 Cooking Pleasures magazine is the magazine produced by the Cooking Club of America. I very happily joined Cooking Club of America, and began receiving this magazine quite a while ago. The Club offers so much to its subscribers, but as time wore on, I could see that the Marketing Department was a tad too aggressive for my taste.  The Cooking Club of America offers their potential members numerous items to entice them to join. Members can take part in member-only contests where kitchen products and gift baskets are some of the prizes. They can be sent food items or kitchen products to review. They can also receive a cheese grater for joining!   There are some nice photographs in this publication. The recipes are not complicated either, although they do require some unusual ingredients and some that are very expensive that many people would find hard to locate. I, personally, had to forego some recipes, and others; I had to order a couple of ingredients online, because of the reasons given.  The cheese grater sent to you is a nice idea, but being it is a rotary grater, you have to squeeze very hard to get the cheese to grate. Also, the grater is made of plastic and eventually snaps in half after using it only a handful of times.  The Club also offers you a Culinary Resource Directory. The information contained in this directory is not difficult to find in a basic Internet search. You can also receive standard sized blank recipe cards. Unfortunately, due to the size of recipe cards, I do not believe anyone can even write the ingredients onto them without running out of space.   Also, part of the member benefits is to sample products for review. Potential members can see photographs of blenders, ice cream makers and much more. While a member there for three years, I did have the opportunity to review quick rise yeast and a chipotle spice. Both were nice products. They were not the glamorous photos of kitchen appliances, but it was something!  Currently, they are offering a VISA credit card with their logo. With this card, not only can you use the card like any other credit card, but also you can receive club discounts. If this is something that appeals to you, see the Club for details.  Approximately 3 months after you renew your own subscription, they start mailing you about how you should renew your membership for the following year now, so that you can help them keep club costs down. After just paying for the current year, I was not interested in paying for another year already. An idea may be to NOT contact members so soon after they just paid their subscriptions. That may save the club some money.  I have Caller ID, and I utilize it all the time, screening my calls to specifically avoid telemarketing calls. Imagine my surprise when I pick up a call and it was a representative for Cooking Club of America. I was, actually, pleasantly surprised, thinking I was about to embark on another benefit of being a member. I was most disappointed to hear the mono-toned voice on the other end of the line, reading the script, suggesting I become a Lifetime Member now. When I tell them I am not interested, they have a "new" deal for me. When I still tell them I am not interested, they have yet another deal. The calls continued after this conversation for another couple of months.   At this point, my subscription has expired. I was relieved as the telemarketing phone call really turned me off. You should have been there to see me receive my credit card statement. Cooking Club of America automatically charged my credit card with my next subscription without my permission. It was three months after my original subscription expired! As you can imagine, this was extremely upsetting.  Upon doing my research for this article, I have come to find that others have had similar experiences with this magazine. It's a shame too, as this magazine has plenty of potential. Unfortunately, their marketing department could utilize different tactics in maintaining their current membership.  Despite this magazine being very affordable, I recommend that you save your money on this one and try Fine Cooking, Cuisine at Home or Cook's Illustrated. Not only do these magazines provide better recipes, more professional tips, they also do not call you daily to get your money 
 this book is nice and it helps me a lot to my economics course 
 I was really looking forward to this book--I've read RMB since Rubyfruit Jungle and I love mysteries--but my anticipation came to a screeching halt on page 4, where Ms. Brown produced this piece of pandering: "The whole point of the ban [on English foxhunting] was to punish those suspected of wealth or title from (sic) enjoying themselves... It was perfectly fine with [those who passed the ban] if the farmers shot the beautiful creatures... Better yet, Americans did not hunt to kill the fox."  No.  It isn't all about the seedy underclasses hating the wealthy (though given the centuries of class privilege in England, it might be understandable if that were the case).  It's not to punish those with wealth or title for enjoying themselves... though I'm sure those with wealth and titles were equally annoyed when droit du seigneur was abolished.  The whole point of that ban was to put an end to the bloody and horrible way in which English hunts conclude--the painful, terrifying death of the fox.  You see, I'm one of those ignorant Yankees who signed one of the many petitions to Parliament to try to bring an end to the bloody business of British-style foxhunting.   I don't recall the English foxhunters ever offering to compromise--to merely hunt the fox, and not allow the dogs to tear it to pieces when it's cornered. It's one thing to shoot an animal that's endangering one's poultry--at least it's quick and relatively merciful.  A British fox-hunt is anything but.  Ms. Brown tosses off the very important difference between US and English hunts as though the death of the fox, and the manner of its death, does not matter.  It matters to me--as I am sure it matters to the fox.  The English hunt begins early, with gamekeepers going around to where the foxes live and stopping their dens--blocking their means of escape.  Not very "sporting!" - but if the fox were allowed to escape, the ladies and gentlemen of the hunt would be denied the pleasure of the kill, and that would be such a disappointment!  Let's look at it from the fox's point of view, as Ms Brown does in her books.  What would happen to her beloved foxes--what if Target or Comet were unfortunate enough to live in Merrie England?  What about sweet, intelligent little Inky?  How would the story go...  "Panting, exhausted, Inky dashed through the creek, backtracked to muddle her trail.  She ran along a fallen log, cut through a thicket, and dove for her escape hole.  It was blocked by a stone, too big to move, too deeply wedged to move around.   She gasped, whirled--but it was too late. The hounds closed in, snarling.  Inky screamed in agony as her hind leg was torn off, but her adrenaline-charged heart was pumping so fast that she bled to death in seconds.    The whipper-in beat off the dogs and pulled out the bleeding stump of what had been her beautiful, luxuriant tail.  He took the still-warm trophy of their victory over to the youngest member of the hunt, an eight-year-old old boy, and smeared Inky's blood across the child's face.  The boy fought back nausea.  This was the glory of the hunt--his father, his mother expected him to be a man!  So he did his best, and smiled, and wished he were a million miles away."  I used to buy Rita Mae Brown's books in hardcover.  When her misplaced modifiers and brand placement got too irritating--her last Sneaky Pie book read like an ifomercial for the Virginia wine industry--I started reading the hardcover at the library and buying the paperback.     At this point... I don't even know if I'm going to finish this book.   The disconnect of making her foxes such interesting, lovable people (her animals have always been more interesting than her humans) while kissing up to the savage brutality of English foxhunting is just more hypocrisy than I want to deal with in recreational reading.  I don't care if Ms Brown or anyone else wants to chase foxes till they're blue in the face; I'm sure it's great exercise.  But I draw the line at being told what to believe when it comes to humane treatment of animals.  It's sheer nonsense to pretend there's no difference between the US and UK style of fox-hunting or wax indignant over how those of us who think British foxhunting is barbaric are trying to punish the poor hunters. I'm sure Ms. Brown's fox-hunting friends were hugging themselves with glee over her polemic on page 4, but it's just lost her a reader. 
 I do not know whether this was Suttons first book, but it reads like it is. The information would be far more effective arranged quite differently. Even the publisher did not correct either the authors style or his arrangement of the material.  Over all, I was disappointed. The style is sloppy, redundant at times and overly general when it needs to be specific. Linkages are may times vague and not born out by actual material, causation is then implied. A lot of the book is more "guilt by association" then guilt by actual evidence. This book could have been researched and written to be much more precise, clear and organized.   Many other books do a better job bringing out the hidden side of history. Unfortunately Sutton is not one of those books. For the price asked for it, I could not recommend him as a valuable source.   If a paper back version selling for $6.95 ever comes out, then and only then could I recommend spending any money on it 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 The Summary (short version)  The characters...  Go to restaurants and drink.  Go to bars and drink.  Go home and drink.  Go to bullfights and drink.  Insult each other and drink.  P!ss and drink.  Go to sleep, wake up and drink.  Take baths and drink.  Have sex and drink.  I became an alcoholic just by reading The Sun Also Rises.  Summary (the long version) Several expatriates lick their emotional wounds and cavort around spending money left by their rich parents. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is a reporter left impotent by a war wound. He and Uncle Toby from Tristram Shandy could have had a ball together (if you've read Tristram Shandy by Laurence Sterne, you'll get the joke). He's in love with the beautiful Brett Ashley, but his impotence makes it impossible for their relationship to have much substance. She falls in and out of love with other men while he stands around watching and feeling jealous. A little bullfighting and violence and drinking later, they're right back where they started: in limbo.  I've never cared for Ernest Hemingway's writing style. It's like he made sure you knew you were reading a story from a REAL man: very macho in tone and style.  And this coupled with the boringness of the story makes The Sun Also Rises a dreadful read 
 When I received this book I was really eager to read it. The whole storyline appealed to me and I was convinced, based on the first few chapters, that I would enjoy it.  I'm not sure when I changed my mind.  Maybe it was after reading countless details about historical and political China when I just wanted to know more about the main characters.  Sometimes I felt as if the author couldn't decide if she wanted to write a history book or a love story.  While her descriptions of the surrounding enviroments within the book were very colorful and evocative, the presentation of historical events taking place was a bit on the boring side.  I found myself fighting the urge to just skip over those parts.  Also, the ending (which I won't give away) sort of left me feeling cheated. I suppose I could've overlooked all of those things except for one thing.  The fact is, the main character just isn't very interesting or likeable.  To me, that's a deal-breaker 
 This guy isnt even funny, you guys must be retrted four year olds with adhd. My dogs crap is funnier than this 
 Got this camera for my wife - a digital novice - during Christmas 2005. Camera is easy to use and takes good pictures. Easily interfaces with PC through USB. However, I also (as did another reviewer) started having problems after about 11 months. Camera would not take pictures as the CCD went bad. Luckily I had an extended service contract and it was repaired. Unfortunately, it just quit working again (April 2007) and the service contract company says they "...won't bother fixing it again..." and is refunding my purchase price. Gracious but a hassle doing without a camera for a second time. Good camera but if you buy one make sure you get the service contract 
 I am being generous in giving this film two stars. I saw a trailer for it, and while it looked intriguing, looks can be deceiving, much like the bulk of this would-be psychological potboiler. I think the photography work and acting deserve a minimum of two stars as both were excellent; the general storyline, however, was drivel.   Many reviewers have noted how the film fundamentally makes no sense, and there are parts where I agree wholeheartedly. I don't mind thought-provoking films that leave you wondering what actually happened, but this was mostly in the shallow end from the standpoint of plot construction. It is inconceivable to me how the two female leads (Charlotte Rampling, and Ludivine Sagnier) could tolerate one another; further, it is incomprehensible why Rampling didn't merely leave France when Sagnier started making her life miserable. To believe that Rampling would actually help Sagnier conceal murder is impossible. Yes, I know that the entire character of the daughter is ambiguous by the end, but inasmuch as the character was constructed in Rampling's mind to be a murderess negates charges of cinematic intellectual superiority and holds Rampling's judgment suspect.  The entire movie is filled with characters that are excruciating to watch, and the only real reason for a two star rating is that the actors do an outstanding job in their roles. I considered briefly watching the film a second time to make sure I understood all the nuances, but I just hated it too much the first time to give it a second chance. This is one film that looks positively great as a two minute theatrical trailer, but looks positively awful in the light of day as a hulking 103 minute feature.   I am very open-minded to unusual, imported, and avant-garde films, but while this movie had touches of all three, I was merely relieved when it was over. 
 The history of the making of the Nancy Drew books is fascinating, and I did enjoy reading that part of this book. However, the author simply could not keep her point of view (that the Nancy Drew authors and creators were modern feminists, showing the great big male world what women could do back then) when the facts simply did not support this point of view. The author even says that the writers SAY they didn't think they were being pioneering or feminists, yet, the author tells, us, even though they say there weren't, they are, and Rehak insists on it. I can't understand how an editor could have allowed so much bias to enter into this book unless the editor, too, shared this slanted point of view.  So, read this book for the history, that part is fascinating. But take all the feminism with a grain of salt. Mildred Wirt Benson is a fasincinating lady, but her intention with Nancy Drew was simply to write a great story and earn a living. She was not trying to impress any men or show the male world that women rule, as the author seems to imply 
 This book was very disappointing.  Aside from the fact that the elements would be very expensive to produce, the designs lacked any strength.  Each project seemed to be more about the designer's ego than about the client.  Additionally, the book's  "icon" layout was cumbersome and meant having to refer to the legend much too often. Granted, some books are more useful than others, but I have never purchased a book that hasn't given me some bit of inspiration, no matter how small... until now.   I found the book and its designs to be much too self-indulgent to be useful.  This is the first book I have ever returned 
 Disappointing, the drive is very noisy, when you reboot the drive runs with the fan on high then shuts down. I would not recommend this drive to anyone 
 I find this video tape of Eminem very boring, I thought it will had more to it, well for the price it was not much because you could had see the music video he did on mtv or vh1.  It mostly that, you see music video on this tape, well if you are a fan and didn't saw some of is previous music video go buy it but if you want to know more about Eminem well that tape is not for you.  I thought it was more a documentary with music video, I thought Eminem will talked about his music video, his music, his life but no you just see his old and more recent music video and that's it.  I think this video tape is not worth the price I pay 
 I love a good pulp-action book, but this book is just insulting. I will give him credit for his aviation knowledge, it seems pretty complete.  However he clearly knows little about real life in the military.  I'm guessing he was in a few years at best.  His mistakes are about the only thing fun about this book.  What this really comes down to though is the guy can't write, and the book is boring.  Don't waste your money 
 I used Version 8 and 9 and NEVER experienced a problem.  Version 10.latest version is terrible.  Crash and burn.  Don't take their advice and re-install your operating system.  Its THEIR software and not the OS.  Amazon and Pinnacle (Avid) continue to sell this product even though its terrible.  I read it was re-written for version 10 and they CAN'T get it right.  Nonetheless, they still charge full price and for support calls. The upgrade should have been free.  There are several good products now so Pinnacle isn't your only choice.  I changed to Sony Vegas and am very happy but it does a have a learning curve.  For super simple try Ulead or one of the others. 
 Like many of the other reviewers, I found this book frought with recipe mistakes (or are they just sloppily written?).  However, many of the recipes, with adaptation, become quite nice.... the problem being that you must have enough cooking knowledge to know how to adapt recipes.  What's great about this book, though, is the plethora of information about food itself, mini-articles about things like mushrooms, green tea and how to grow your own herbs make for some great and informative reading.    Interesting and a great idea, but very poorly executed.  A good and thorough revision would make this book wonderful, but this edition is just not that great 
 Women-in-prison films are supposed to be erotic!  That means they're supposed to have AT LEAST ONE of the three following things (and preferably MORE than one):  1)  An evil lesbian warden who enjoys the bodies of her pretty prisoner-playthings, turning at least one of them into her beautiful nude sex slave.  2)  Evil lesbian guards who occasionally strip the girls naked before whipping/spanking them, and later take them into their own quarters for their private pleasures, especially late at night.  3)  Tough, lesbian inmates, who prey on the younger, most beautiful newcomers, often in the shower, but also in their beds at night.  Well, this particular video HAS NONE OF THESE THINGS!  There are NO LESBIANS in this prison!  There are only gay male guards and a boring old man as the warden.  The women are certainly pretty enough and their outfits revealing enough, but as a women-in-prison flick THIS ONE SUCKS!!!  IT'S NOT EROTIC!!!  NOT RECOMMENDED!!! 
 This book is a bit too professional for anyone who is just starting an astrophysics course.......the provided questions really screw up ur brain.....but if ur sure u have a good solid pure math and advanced physics background  then go ahead and buy it otherwise check out other books.... 
 As a political junkie, I loved reading "Election 2004", for the behind-the-scenes peek at the candidates' campaigns (well, mostly Kerry's). However, if you are to enjoy the book, you must realize that:  a) Newsweek is very pro-Kerry. b) the Bush campaign (wisely) kept them at arms-length.  So we get fawning adulation over Kerry's daughters, while Bush's twins are treated as snide pranksters. Laura Bush is "simple", while Teresa Heinz Kerry "takes charge". The Swift Boat Vets are "grudge-bearing" while 527s like Moveon.org are "groundbreaking". Kerry's team used "sound strategy" while Karl Rove and Karen Hughes cooked up "dirty tricks". You get the picture.  If you can stomach the liberal spin, it's still a good read and does provide a few tantalizing tidbits (especailly about Dean and how he was perceived by both the Democrats [crazy, self-destructive] and Republicans [manna from Heaven]).  The left-wing slant is made more bearable by the fact that Bush won 
 Suzanne Somers' diet is a good idea and it works. However, based on her earlier successes, Ms. Somers' has started marketing a series of products to help follow her diet. This book is filled with recipes that all require her new products. Buy her old book where she still focused on using what is in your kitchen. These recipes are merely marketing for her products 
 I bought this coffee maker to try and get above the level of cheap coffeemakers.  I did not succeed.  I paid $50 and could have bought a $20 Mr. Coffee and saved myself a lot of my money.  This is not a top of the line coffee maker with bottomline features.... it is a bottomline coffee maker with bottomline features.  It has no clock, no timer, no automatic turnoff (It will cook the pot dry if you forget to turn it off.  It is hard to fill to the correct level without having water run out the hole in the reservoir at the back.  It is hard to pour a cup of coffee without cascades of dribbles.    You are supposed to be able to take a cup out as it is brewing.  In a word, "Don't".  It just keeps drooling coffee all over the heating element.  And it takes forever to brew a pot of coffee.  I am not an engineer, just a harried housewife that is trying to get everything together in the morning and get everyone where they need to go.  THIS coffeemaker should have never made it to the marketplace.    If you want a basic coffeemaker, get a Mr. Coffee for $20, this is not what you are looking for.   There is nothing "Deluxe" about this coffee maker except the profit they are making off of consumers like me.    
     To start off. As a response to other reviewers referring to Marx's work, it is neither "simple minded" nor "myopic" any more than modern economic theory espoused by the Austrian and Chicago schools, even though Marx's historical insights may be naive at times. If you read anything past "The Communist Manifesto" (which was a political propaganda pamphlet and should be seen as such) this would become more obvious.       Turning to MacKinnon. She is a perfect example of how Marxism (I'm not talking about Marx here) got a bad name. From reading many of her law review articles I noticed an underlying tone of anger and hatred toward males (note how similar her arguments are to those of racists and mysogynistic men). This combined with her legislative attempts to severely limit 1st amendment rights through a pornography ban in a moral crusade to "save women from themselves" makes one think that perhaps  MacKinnon should have been born a 19th century man, where many of her arguments would hold more weight. Although she may claim to be "Marxist" or "Freudian" or whatever convienient label she identifies herself with to prop up her bankrupt theories , she is one of the most conservative and unenlightened thinkers in feminism today. Read forget about MacKinnon and read Simone De Beauvoi 
 I can't stand Adam Sandler's movies but his albums have always been consistently funny.  This is the most inconsistently funny album he's ever produced.  A few of the laugh out loud skits include "Gay Robot", "Sid and Alex" and "Calling Home"; the charcters in the latter skit seem to be all played by Sandler and his voices and lines are gut-bustingly funny.  And "Gay Robot" is just plain hilarious.  Of course, this has its fair share of singing from Sandler and "Secret" is, by far, the funniest.  Unfortunately, most of the rest of these skits are so tired and boring that you have to wonder if Sandler hasn't hit a wall as far as his album creativity goes.  "Wolfman" is SO painfully unfunny that you just end up squirming uncomfortably waiting for something remotely amusing to materialize.  And the Pibb skits, his latest recurring character, are just dumb and flat.  Some skits even reach the realm of irritating such as "Creepin' On The Mayor" which involves a character hiding in a garbage can from people who want to beat him up.  That's it.  Wow, that's funny.   You're better off focusing on just five or six tracks and ditching the rest (Sid and Alex, Gay Robot, Secret, Boss and the Secretary, Mule Session, Newlyweds-Sleepyheads, and Calling Home should do it for you).  Oh, and a quick response to all of the people who are obsessed with this album being "dirty".  Have you people been asleep for the past 13 years??  That's what makes a Sandler album is his filthy and lewd talk!  Sandler's funniest bits are the dirty ones and it's always been that way 
 As somebody who essentially can 'pick up chicks' I found this book to be a moderately funny read for when you come back from the bar feeling drunk, but it is nowhere near being a serious  guide for actually attracting/picking up/seducing women. If you really are looking to improve with women try books by Ross Jeffries, Neil Strauss or Steve Horsfal 
 i'm as big a fan of chris' as the next guy, but come on, he obviously didn't listen to this dvd before it was released, as even i'm too embarassed to play this for my friends!    i've been waiting forever for a concert of his to play on my home theater system and show him off to my friends.  unfortunately, i'm still waiting.. 
 Not sure about these other reviews but all I can say is make sure to buy yourself a package of Tylenol's with this book, because after reading a few pages your head will be ready to explode.  I am trying to read this book with other 25 people and not one person has said that this book is good.  Make sure that you have alot of spare time if you are going to read this crap, because you will be taking more naps while trying to get through this book, then all the naps you have taken throughout your whole lifetime.  Geoff Huston would make a great lawyer but not a book writer 
 This CD is totally boring, even when "Penny Lane" comes along to "pick things up", 'cause by the time "Penny Lane" comes along, I'm already so down and out b/c of how boring the previous tracks are, "Penny Lane" just isn't much; I like music from all decades and the '60's is no exception.  But what the heck is so great about this CD?  Nothing 
  "Original Motion Picture Soundtrack" as it says on both the front and back sides of the CD?  Give me a break!  As another reviewer wrote on Jan 10, it is disappointing not to get a movie soundtrack when you pay for a movie soundtrack.  I bought the CD to listen to Olivia Olson's (Joanna Anderson's) "All I want for Christmas is You."  Of course, the track is not the same one as I heard when I saw the movie.  In the movie she sings her intro without background music.  On the audio CD, there is unwanted background music clutter from the start and, to my ear, it only gets worse as the piece progresses.  When will the recording industry set standards voluntarily, clearly spelling out on labels and advertising any soundtrack substitutions?  Or, do they prefer to wait for more government regulation?  J Records, a unit of BMG, shouldn't expect any more business from me anytime soon 
 "No one buys or sells without the MONEY of the beast on/in mind or hand" -- Apocalypse. The correct, in context translation of the classical Greek word mistranslated as "mark" is karagma, which means MONEY.  You won't discover the truth about this in Strong's concordance because Strong's Greek-English Lexicon is an abridged version of Liddel-Scott's Greek-English Lexicon.  Same with the word Mammon, which also means money in the Aramaic language, which Jesus spoke. They did not even bother to translate the word because the Pharisees love money. See the whole context of: "You can't serve God & MONEY, you'll either love the one and hate the other . . . but the Pharisees, who loved money heard all this and scoffed.  The so-called christians today do not follow the Logos-Logic of God (John 1:1) but the trite, anti-Christ/anti-Logos-Logic of "Saint" Paul, who was BLINDED by the light.  Confessing with your mouth that Jesus rose from the dead will NOT save you. Only logos-logic will.  The Truth will rise again. Nearly every great philosopher, leader, or revolutionary has realized that the mark of the beast is MONEY, i.e., that MONEY is an unnecessary-evil stumblingblock for the blind.

 I travel 2-3 weeks a month for work and I needed a hairdryer that was better than the 1000 watt hotel dryers, so after some research I decided to purchase the travel-size T3.   During the first time I used it, it started smoking and the coils in the back flared up and caught on fire. (There were actual flames -- although they quickly burned out)  I took the dryer back to Sephora and I was quickly given a replacement.  While I had dryer #2, I noticed that it took 15-20 minutes to dry my hair, when it usually takes 20-30. However, I have the full size T3 at home and it takes about 10 minutes when I use that one.  I was expecting this to offer the same power as the other T3.  The bottom line is that I didn't notice a big difference between the travel T3 and the hotel hairdryers that are built into the bathrooms.   After 6 months, the handle broke on the 2nd hairdryer making it rather challenging to use.   If you want a great hairdryer, buy a full size T3, Elchim or Chi Pro -- if you need something to travel with, you're better off with finding space for the full size model. 
 This magazine should be free, since there are so many advertisements.  Also, it is strictly modern decorating, unlike the editor's claims.  If you like extreme, modern style, try it out; otherwise invest in something else 
 Thank you, Ladies, for writing this book. You are exactly why I will never marry an American woman and why I have advised my nephews and younger brother the same.  I was exhausted halfway through the thing. While I had dealt with my divorce, this book has kindled in me something I would never have expected concerning my divorce from the woman whose very breath I loved. That something is nothing less than ecstatic joy at being free from being tied to an American woman.  Hard, driven, cold, lacking natural affection for their own children, often focused on proving they are as sexually active as a man would like to be, LOL, as if that is a good thing these women portray the American woman as totally devoid of affection or morals.  Don't worry ladies about committment, no one would want you for more than an evening's distraction anyway. 
 This book was terrible, and I would not recommend it for anyone, especially young teens. Although I do understand the author's intentions, the grammar and punctuation were incorrect. Issues such as an eating disorder and incest were present and were never really dealt with or handled properly. Overall, the story was very unrealistic. I had to make myself finish reading it, despite wanting to quit many times. It was not exciting and didn't keep my interest. Not recommended at all 
 I remember reading this book when I was a teen, at a time when the church I was attending was very much into end-time prophecies. Embarrassing as it is to admit it, I fell for it hook, line, and sinker. (*blush*) Yet, 1988 came and went, nothing horrible happened, and I forgot about this steaming pile of dog manure. It didn't matter, though, because there were, and still are, plenty of other "prophetic" books to fill the gap and keep Christians pants-wetting scared. I am no longer a Christian, and in retrospect, I wonder why we were all so scared by Hal Lindsey's nonsense. After all, the end times meant that Sweet Jesus was coming and we'd all be raptured away into the clouds to avoid all the tribulation and terror! I think there was the secret fear that we wouldn't be good enough and our allegedly loving savior would leave us behind on a whim.   At any rate, I wouldn't recommend Hal's book for any purpose other than fireplace kindling, or maybe as a good laugh at the gullibility of desperate and easily frightened people. He is no different than any other self-proclaimed prophet of God, picking whatever scriptures he can to back up his crazy ideas and attempting to use math to count the number of days, weeks, and generations since this or that event. If you must buy it, look for it at thrift stores, where you can pick it up for 50 cents; save your ten bucks for something more worthwhile, like a couple of Spider-Man comics or something 
 This is an autobiography of the author's spiritual journey to enlightenment - in the end it is not clear to me whether he ever became fully enlightened. He has certainly recounted numerous experiences that naturally lead to enlightenment. I found this book interesting in parts, but not consistently so. I did not like the writing style which seemed disjointed, and so the story did not flow for me. The book is OK, but now that I have read it, I feel my time would have been more productively employed reading something else 
 I should have read the other review more closely. This is a good blanket for HOT summer nights! I believe it is too light for cold winter nights. I expected more for over $50. If I didn't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw! The color and texture are nice 
 In this book, the lives of four people intersect and are woven together.  The initial descriptions of the four people--two recently released convicts, a woman whose husband has committed suicide, and a police officer--are interesting and promise an intriguing story.  Unfortunately, the book goes downhill from there.  The characters are manipulated in an artificial manner, and the interactions are forced and wooden.  I agree that the writing is surprisingly amateurish at times and a good editor would have caught the awkward phrasing and helped improve it.  This is not Danielle Steele's best work 
 I agree with the other reviews this is a horrible piece of software. I am a software developer and have written some serious applications in my career, and this one ranks at the bottom of the barrel.  I have a stock Dell XP machine, and after a 15-minute install, Audition 2.0 crashes every time on startup. I never even got it to run. Tried calling Adobe support -- useless...waited 35 minutes on hold then hung up. Search of Google groups for answers revealed nothing, as did their support site.  I *loved* Cool Edit 2000, and even Audition 1.5 to some degree. This new version is what happens when too many engineers get put on a project. It's a remnant of a once great application. Avoid it like the plague 
 It was very disappointing to see major actors, cinematographers, and editors doing a good job with decidedly sub-rate material. The film looks much, much better than its story. One begins to have doubts when this family of "geniuses" reveal little intellectual heft in conversation and interaction. The Paltrow character is a virtual cipher whose only talent seems to be finding stashes for her cigarettes, despite her promotion as a "prodigy". The purported love triangle has no apparent basis, in other words, the audience is told to accept the premise without evidence. The problem is that this film was written by people who are not professional, creative writers. Characters must be shown to be "interesting", "conflicted", "in-love", "suicidal", etc. by their words and actions, not simply because we are told they are. This can only be accomplished by subtle and clever writing, which is wholly absent here 
 I was appalled by the poor editing of this book. The author is from the neighborhood where the story is set..rural North Carolina.  The basic plot is fine, being about a black man in 1947 being accused of attempted rape by a white lady because he didn't get off the sidewalk when she passed by.  This is supposed to be based on a true event where said black man is arrested, hauled out of jail by the Klan to be lynched, but escapes to the swamps and then to the North.     However the 12-year-old main character interejects her own stream of consciousness into the first person present tense story.  These are the problems I had:  She says when her mother gets mad at her, Mother hits her with a plastic spoon.   She says that if she isn't good, she doesn't get to go to grandmother's house to watch RV.  She says Grandmother gets a phone and it's YELLOW, and that the phone number is 919-555-1919.   I remember the 50's pretty well and this story takes place before that.  No one had a TV in 1947, much less a poor black family who had electricity but still had an outhouse in the back.  No one had plastic spoons...they would have been wooden or maybe metal.  Phones didn't come in color until the end of the 50's and then they cost more each month.  And it was the 60's when prefixes came into play.  Before that, it would have been KE 8-1919 or TR 7-5616.   So, the author is interjecting her own memories into this story, and the editor was too young to know the difference.  This is too bad, because, while the children reading this may not notice any one of these anachronisms, having done the research on the time and place would have lent a lot of authenticity.   
 This California case of a spurned lover who conspired with a real loser to eliminate her lover's spouse, and in a twist the lover himself, was a fair read at best. While the author did his best to describe the police investigation into the murders it seemed long in details and short on excitement. (even with the twist) Not recommended. 
 ... but if you loved the movie What the Bleep Do We Know, then you will be doubtless swept away by the warm and fuzzy feeling of this trite plot and rather cursory and one-dimensional examination of Western philosophy, which completely dismisses or ignores Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Husserl, Schopenhauer, Habermas, Foucault, Heidegger, and others (and totally misses the mark in its analysis of Sartre's humanism). 
 This book struck me as a boring little nugget stuffed in a pretentious and dandied up little wrapper.  We get to watch Arthur dress up in a little skirt and prance around the East Villiage; seemingly to show off his knowledge of the local geography.  You begin to wonder how his unemployed protagonist can afford all of this coffee and clubbing and then you begin to relize that it's all just an device for Arthur to show just how well travelled in New York he is and how many local landmarks he can rattle off.  His portrayal of a woman feels like a stuffed bra and a strip of duct tape. There are places where I felt genuinely embarrassed for him, and felt like he was influencing his character's behavior in order to keep them out of uncomfortable situations and to keep his panties from being too closely scrutinized. My biggest gripe with this book is that it lacks the energy and dimension of many of Nersesian's other books and feels like a trip to a quick advance from MTV Books. Waste your time in a less painful way. 
 There's some useful information but it's extremely difficult to find through all the pointless little quizzes and stories about how awesome the author is at reading people 
 This book is so old it should not be sold anymore.  The so called "updates" are simply token and the whole book is too old to be of help. Also, the people are so spartan they really don,t relate to the modern cruiser..ie.. they spend time on the merits of kerosene lights.  When they finally retire to land I sure they will end up in a trailer park 
 Why do I feel like the serpent in the Garden of Eden?... Sorry, I really liked "Deep Waters", but I probably won't buy another JAK unless I am stuck at an airport and I have read every other available Romance, Mystery or Thriller on the newsstand.  I think I have made myself clear.  It is time for me to find some new talented authors.  Although I know I have some previously read titles of hers to review.  Hopefully, they are better than this 
 My 6 year old son wanted this SO badly from Santa.  Well, he got it and it is sitting in his bedroom and has been there since the 28th of Dec.  What was a fun attention grabber initially became a boring, furry annoyance rather quickly. It is cute but there are several things that I (and my son) found wrong with the product. When he is supposed to be sleeping his eyes don't close all the way...kind of creepy especially for something that looks so real! Then his arms that move up and down and are supposed to close in an attempt to give you a hug make a HORRIBLE grinding noise!  My son was shocked by the grinding and got upset that his monkey was broken. I explained it away by saying that he probably just needed a backrub.  What else are you going to tell a child on Christmas morning when his first choice present turns out to be a bummer?! Cute toy in theory, not so much in person though. I would not recommend this toy 
 This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY??? 
 I normally buy Special K cereal.  I found these boxes to be stale 
 I have had this camera for about a year and a half.  I got so fed up with it that I just bought a new one.  I admit, this camera takes decent pictures in good lighting when the zoom isn't used.  However, this camera takes horrible pictures if the zoom is used.  I would only recomomend this camera to someone who just wants to take pictures of of thier surroundings or to a younger person who is getting their first digital camera 
 Kipnis uses her mindlessly wielded implicit racism to make jokes about rape that reinforce the myth that her audience (explicitly white upper middle class women whose money she wants) are raped by strangers (when even ABC news admits that the vast majority of rape victims are raped by people in their own socioeconomic group...who they already know).  She's not accountable to her audience, she's merely profittng from the hyper-spending tendencies that she diagnosis them with.  When I had the disheartening opportunity to discuss the book with her she used every tactic of male chauvinism to dismiss my critique of her book's racism...even to the extent of insisting that since her editor was black she couldn't be racist.   Don't waste your time 
 If you already have the yellow book "Questions and Answers to help you past the Real Estate Appraisal Exams", don't waste your money purchasing the new book that was put out in 2000. It's the same book - just copy written in October of 2000. I made the mistake of thinking that there would be new questions since 1994, or the questions would at least be asked in a different format, but they are not. Word for word they are the same. So save your money if you already have the yellow book and just study it a little bit harder 
 I AM A Master and theres a million potential masters each day. Theres only one TRUTH, yet many books, many opportunities to look outside one self for something you already have within the center of your very being.Use your mind heart and body. You either use this one truth to serve this one higher self but some will use this knowledge to manipulate others in serving thier own personal agenda. NO FEAR..for what you think of as God IS already everywhere and its beautiful source and articulation has to be realized within your own story. Every word idea and thought has already been done, accomplished waiting for you to ask and you shall recieve. Christ means no limitation, infinite supply, abundance of love..heaven is here and now..how long will it take?...how many leaders do you call?...the infinite mind knows no size..you are one... 
 This book lacks any information about education. Such an essential subject - affecting children and adults alike - should certainly be included.  Nor does it include information about art (visual/performing) or literature pertinent to the people at the time.   It also has no index, so that searching for anything is ridiculously slow.  Visuals are lacking - textual descriptions of hair or various equipment are poor substitutes for an image.  Essentially it is a poorly organized dictionary, and stating that it is "a guide for writers, students and historians" is an overstatement to say the least!  
 This book is terrible.  It is very hard to understand.  Not recommended 
 I purchased this book based on the comments and reviews of other readers.  So, I made the mistake of  thinking that this was a book on advanced Chinese astrology. This is elementary Chinese astrology.  Which is  equivalent to looking up your sun sign in your local newspaper. If you're  serious about learning Chinese astrology, then try and find a book on Zi  Ping Four Pillars of Destiny 
 My mother got me this book as a gift...and it is a truly interesting idea for a book. This book lacks the charm of the "soup" books...most  of the stories are drawn out from the one sentence in which they could be  summarized. It seems as though Ford, in trying to solicit stories, accepted  the first 101 and did not edit or improve any submissions at all. Some of  the stories, granted, are interesting, engaging, and even a bit spooky.  Unfortunately, the majority seem contrived and more the fare of late-night  campfire chats or urban legends than genuinely inspiring stories of the  "other side". In future editions of this book (which I am sure  there will be), Ford could, should, and for her own integrity as a writer,  must be more selective in choosing her stories. And.. just *perhaps* she  could make the parody title a tiny, tiny bit less obvious 
 This book focuses on Amanda Starkey, a young nurse who has suffered a breakdown and was sent home by her boss so she could get her act together. Amanda returns to her family home in Wisconsin to live with her sister, Mattie, and Mattie's daughter, Ruth. Mattie's husband, Carl, is off fighting in France during WWI.  The sisters are very close, and so Mattie is of course thrilled to have her sister back in her life on a daily basis again. They begin to embark on a new aspect of their life together, while Mattie anxiously waits for her husband's return from the war.  Then, one winter night, tragedy strikes, and Mattie ends up drowning in the nearby lake. Her young daughter, Ruth, almost ends up drowning as well, but is rescued in the nick of time.   Not long after Mattie's death, Carl returns from the war, wounded. He is eager to see his wife, not realizing that she has died.   Amanda, who has never liked Carl, hopes that he will decide to leave again almost as soon as he'd returned home. She figures him for the sort to not want to raise a child alone, and each day waits for him to leave, thereby making her Ruth's sole caretaker. Yet much to her annoyance, he manages to get his bearings again and remains a fixture in both hers and Ruth's life.  At the same time, Amanda struggles with inner demons, both because of what happened to her sister, and because of what happened in her life prior to returning home, which you eventually learn about. She is then sent to a sanatorium and Carl is left to care for his daughter on his own. However, he founders, and ends up relying on a second cousin (Hilda) for her grudging help.   This new upheaval causes Ruth to regress a great deal, and she stops talking and acts out by breaking things in the house and being impossible to toilet train and deal with overall. In a funny turn of events, Ruth manages to embarrass Hilda enough so that she leaves. Carl, in an act of desperation, takes Ruth with him on one of his many visits to see Amanda, in the hope that it will spark a desire in her to get well once and for all. It works, and a year after having been committed, Amanda returns home.  The rest of the story vacillates between what really happened the night Mattie drowned, and what is happening in Amanda and Ruth's life afterwards. In the first part of the book, Ruth ages from about 3-5. When the second part begins, she is already 11. I felt that was somewhat abrupt, and it took me a few pages to realize how much time had passed, as there wasn't anything to indicate that this had happened.   The book continued to bounce around a lot from this point on, between reminiscences of the past and what was actually happening to the characters months or years down the line. It got a little annoying at times to have to figure out where exactly the next installation was starting out. Also, the book jacket said the story was told from several of the main character's points of view, but the only ones you really hear from are Ruth and Amanda.   I was pretty disappointed by the end of the story. The book starts out intriguing and makes you wonder if Amanda literally went off the deep end after all and killed her sister, or if it was in fact an accidental drowning. But by about halfway through, the facts become clear and are easy to interpret. Still, I hoped maybe I was wrong and the ending would surprise me after all. It didn't.  Carl also disappears about halfway through the book. It's due to a job he takes, but it felt like he was written out of the story because the author ran out of use for him, or wasn't sure what to do with him after a certain point. She spent a lot of time focusing on Carl's desire to learn about the truth of his wife's death.   As it was, he only found out part of the truth, and that was according to what Amanda got him to believe. Nevertheless, Carl accepted it at face value and after that he accepted his wife's fate. He was then written out of the story. I didn't really like that aspect of things and didn't think it meshed with everything else that was happening. Even though he wasn't a strong character in general, he's one of the characters I actually liked. Amanda wasn't that likeable at all, and was a pretty cold person who was obsessed with Ruth and still obsessed with the past. Ruth was somewhat pliable and easily molded to her aunt's bidding, even though she made some feeble attempts to be her own person.  I don't know if I'd read this author again. But I managed to find this book for $1.. and would say it was worth it and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, either on here or in a bookstore 
 Once again, Universal gives a good Tv show, a terrible release on DVD.  As with their other TV shows and now some of their movies, the picture and sound have improved but there are no bonus features.  In some cases, the shows were cut and paste edited, some of the music was changed, and the DVD's still freeze frame in the middle of the show and the DVD player unfreezes the frame by going back to the show's opening titles. What Gives?!   I have seen bare bones releases and second rate DVD's releases from other companies (most notely with Disney and Warners), but Universal also is rapidly joining the list of companies that corner the market with bad and defective DVD standards.  All I can do is stop watching Tv shows or movies made by Universal, because now it is more then likely that they will give them bad DVD releases that are not worth my time or money 
 I can't believe folks would buy this garbage. The title of this book and much of its content were ripped off (yes, plagarized) from George Carlin's bit "Religion is a Mental Illness". But that is not unusal as Mr. Weiner has ripped off other people's work throughout his career. I hope see this guy for the fraud he is 
 I read this book wanting to comprehend how anti-Semitism first originated, flourished, and then culminated in the Holocaust with Christianity as part and parcel of the whole process. Instead, I got countless examples of this ancient hatred and how it manifested itself in the past and present time. I guess this approach was fine for someone who needed to be convinced of the existence of anti-Semitism. But, this approach didn't really help me to better understand the cause and reason behind the subject matter 
 Another reviewer mentioned the blurb on the back of this book, and that it didn't accurately reflect the real story.  I thought this book was going to be some kind of "monster in the closet" thriller.  Instead it turned out to be an testosterone-driven, urban-cave-exploring, Rambo-lovin', bore. So, I'm still trying to figure out why they threw in the five-legged cat?!?! 
 Not sure about this one. Really enjoyed the Woman in White. I found this one a little tedious and slow quite despite the  very high esteem in which it is held by Wilkie fans.   
 My overall impression is that this book is really three treatments for three different books, or perhaps three short stories extended and patched together. While these three plots might have meshed together nicely in some other writer's hands, they did not in this case. Instead we get a grinding of gears and, ultimately, a transmission failure no specialist could fix.  Rarely will I abandon a book 75 pages before it is finished, but this one I did. I didn't even sneak a peek to see how it ended 
 This book is mostly built around the idea "I wish it were true = it *is* true".  While this book has innate appeal to those looking for meaning in their lives, if you're looking for a firm foundation for understanding coincidences in your life (i.e. intellectual integrity), you'd be better off buying an introduction to probability 
 First of all, I can't believe Trace got better reviews than Predator.  Predator was 1000 times better, but that's still not saying much.  Trace was just awful.  The worst in the series.  I can say with the certainty of the Great Scarpetta, that Patricia Cornwell did not write this book. One of her ghostwriters, who probably hates Scarpetta, wrote it.    This book is incomprehensible.  The story lines are disjointed, disconnected--just plain bad.  There is no follow through; the reader doesn't get the satisfaction of having everything tied together at the end.  What happened to Pogue?  Dr. Paulsson?  Mrs. Paulsson?  Dr. Marcus?  And what about Fielding? All of a sudden Fielding has a horrible skin condition and he's no longer in great shape and good looking.  Is this all because the Great Scarpetta was fired and moved away and the stress of life without her has ruined his physical appearance?  That's pretty riduculous. And the motivation of the killer is so weak and SOOOOO absurdly stupid, that I can't believe that Patricia Cornwell approved this awful imitation.   I'm so SICK to death of Lucy and her bad relationships, and I just can't stand Rudy. Also, in this book Lucy's father is now Cuban, instead of Brazilian, like he has been in the 12 previous books.  This ghostwriter has obviously never read any of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels.  Cuba and Brazil are two totally different countries and cultures!  To me, this is a huge oversight.  A good author takes note of every detail of the characters s/he creates, and I'm pretty sure that Cornwell isn't careless.  I digress...And then there's Benton and Kay, back together and back into the swing of their passionless, unfulfilling relationship.  Do they even like each other?  There's such tension and animosity between them.  Especially since Benton was never really dead; he was just undercover.  That whole story line was never explored in this horrible book. Even more evidence of poor ghostwriting--that was the greatest oversight. There's no hashing out of feelings and talking things through. All we're left with is Benton's five sentence explanation in Blow Fly. And Marino...I was horrified and acutally felt embarrassed when I read the part of Scarpetta taking pictures of Marino's injuries.  I don't want to give it away, if you haven't read the book.  That part is humiliating.  If you are a Scarpetta fan, you'll read this book despite the bad reviews.  In fact, you have to read it because you have see for yourself how truly terrible it is.  Just don't buy it.  Borrow it from the library 
 The ONLY reason I bought this was because I thought it was the Disney version.  They make it look like the Disney version, which you can't find anywhere.  The production is primitive, the dialogue is horrible and violent, talking about killing all the time.  It has NO redeeming qualities.  It is nothing you want your kids to see, and I could not even sell it used in good conscience.  My copy ended up in the trash, where it belonged 
 It seems to me that this author is trying to tell us he is tired of Lucas Davenport.  I feel that he wants to transplant the best of Davenport to a new hero.If so, he failed.  If that is the case, he failed. There are long stretches of boring reading and suddenly a spark of the old haro comes through to us.  Worth to read if you cannot fall asleep; after some half a dozen pages, you can. How sad.. 
 The Avatar Series sucks compared to Waterdeep- Trantras Series.  Who knows what is happening in the plot or who are the Shadowmasters?  Silly plot and fight scences. Read Greenwood's Shadowdale for a decent story 
 It was terrible! Lili played a good part of course. But the rest was just plain stupid 
 Finally a book with the courage to stand up and tell people with their heads stuck in the 1950 that theyre abslutely right about everything! Glory to the author who finally proves that women in fact should not be paid equal to men who do the same work, and in truth should not be working at all, because totally a whole bunch of science shows how women with professional ambitions and successes in the private sector are just plain stupid and doting housewives whose lives consist entirely of ovens and vacuums are totally where its at! After all it is a true fact that most women who are in a relationship with a domineering husband with religious convictions and a family who puts pressure on them to behave like their idealized mental image of women and who have learned a long time ago that its just better for them not to resist any longer and to do what theyre told report in surveys run by organizations with a political, to say nothing of sociological axe to grind are PERFECTLY HAPPY with their lives, so that proves everything! And furthermore this book was written by a woman! And even though that means she is violating the basic premise of the book by having professional ambitions of her own as far as being a writer (lets not forget, every day spent writing this book is a day you could've spent cranking out more babies like youre supposed to, woman) its still 100% true! No wait, its 200% true because it contradicts itself! Hooray for the 1950s regressive conservitive oppresively religious and slightly sexist mindset! No, actually I dont know what sarcasm is. Why 
 I'm a huge fan of the DS9 relaunch, and I was eagerly anticipating this book as a continuation of the exciting storyline the various authors had established. However, after the great descriptions and plots of the previous books, especially the "Mission: Gamma" and "Worlds of DS9" series, I was very much disappointed by "Warpath". Like "Unity", the book does advance the plot, and provide some excellent action scenes, but not much else - it definitely does not share the depth and stand-alone nature of the other books. Furthermore, the author liberally reuses a number of plot ideas from previous Star Trek novels, such as the melodrama between Vaughn and Prynn, Ro and Quark. I also intensely disliked the ending, came totally out of nowhere, and didn't expand the DS9 universe at all, something the previous books were excellent at accomplishing. I hope the next installment follows the path established by the previous novels, instead of this new trend. 
 Lots of stilted pseudo-intellectual dialogue.  A pseudo existentialist hero. A painfully ideological lecture against the death penalty.  Stilted performances by brilliant actors.  A receipe for disaster.  Why this film was a hit, I have no idea 
 I'm a fan of Brian O'Malley's Scott Pilgrim so I thought I would try to read this, his earlier foray into the graphic novel. I was very disappointed. The book  is rambling and attempts too hard to be 'deep' and 'dark.' In particular, the characterisation of the teenage female is slightly disturbing and poorly written. The main character, Raleigh, is a young woman in trouble and her imagination and thoughts are so unlike a teenage females that I get the feeling the author may be mystified by women in general and thinks they truly think like this! Absurd. Yes, being a young teenage girl is rough but the author tackles the subject with obvious lack of expertise. The language is harsh with the use of the 'f' word in abundance, trying to make the story more authentic with little success.  The only thing to recommend it is the cuteness of O'Malley's artwork which is a stark contrast to the sad story that unwinds and ends rather abruptly. I do NOT recommend this to any younger females because you'll just leave the book feeling much more depressed. O'Malley has progressed quite a bit however and his later works are much better 
 Not at all what I thought it was going to be.  Way too intoductory and  simplistic for a manager who is actually managing anything or anybody.  Not  something I would want anyone to see on my office bookshelf 
 I thought the book was "oversold" in a way.  From reading the jacket it looked like the "answer" to the Berenger Sauniere mystery, to what on earth it was that turned this impoverished rural cure  into a wealthy identity.  Now, yes, I know we have the sacred geometry, but  it's unfinished?  Where's the follow-up on the trough near the grove of  trees?  Where's the follow-up on just what may have actually happened at  the focal point of that pentagram?  We don't see it.  While the anecdotes  are interesting, and tragi-comic in some cases, they almost appear out of  place?  In some parts I felt like I was reading "The Making of Holy  Blood, Holy Grail"" (which I loved by the way) 
 On pages 105 and 106 of the paperback edition of "Cross World," some veteran puzzlers sit around with the author of the book and attempt to develop an anagram from the letters of his name.  For instance, one of the puzzlers, Peter Gordon, uses the nom de plume "Ogden Porter" when it suits his fancy.  The author suggests that finding a suitable anagram for "Marc Romano" was a tall order, but I think the group was just being kind.  "Marc A. Moron" is the obvious solution.  Or, if you allow "carma" as a variant of "karma," as Will Shortz would no doubt allow, then "Moron Carma" works out very well, too.  "Cross World" is at best an essay or a magazine article in THE ATLANTIC or THE NEW YORKER, where people poke sticks at the real world and grimace horribly.  The book's subject matter hardly justifies its length, and a kind editor might have trimmed a great deal of the empty philosophy and the over-the-top repetition.  Of course, such an editor would have been obliged to deal with the author's ego.  And wrestling that overweight gorilla to the ground may have been a feat no editor cared to attempt.  The ego is huge indeed.  Prepare to be regaled with how fast the author can solve puzzles, how easier crosswords are beneath his contempt, how too clever by half he is, etc., etc., etc.  If a person is coming to crossword puzzles for the first time, this book might serve as an inspiration to choose another hobby.  Can all puzzle solvers be such boors/bores?  The meat of the essay, er, book, is the annual crossword puzzle contest in Stamford, Connecticut.  Understanding what goes on there may actually hold some interest for the outsider.  Unfortunately, this learning experience is tainted with the interjection of the author's personal experiences.  He is so obnoxiously competitive that it's difficult to recall that crossword puzzles were devised as a means of intellectual entertainment.  Who cares who's best?  Did you have fun?  At the end of "Cross World" are the puzzles from the 2004 Stamford competition.  The reader can try to solve them in the prescribed time limit, then spend another five to ten minutes leafing back through the book to find the page on which the author describes how the scoring works.  Of course, in his endless quest to display his brilliance and to extend his magazine article to more than 200 pages, he gives away many of the answers, which somehow detracts from the challenge of solving the puzzles.  To handicap myself, I did the puzzles in bed in three separate sittings (or lyings), making sure that I had consumed a bottle of wine prior to each session.  My score exceeded the author's by a healthy margin; I even added some time to account for the answers I already knew from the text and could fill in without much thought.  As a result, I have concluded the following: Every year, alocal business magazine prints a survey profiling the 100 best companies to work for in the state.  When the company I work for first took notice of the survey, I was designated to find out why we were not included.  The magazine's editor informed me that our company had not applied.  "So," I said, "the survey really showcases only the 100 best companies to work for in the state among those who applied."  That's pretty much the case with the crossword contest, I imagine.  There are, no doubt, many people who, choosing not to travel to Stamford and mingling with folks wearing crossword-puzzle-themed clothing, could nevertheless tear the cover off the ball if presented with the same crossword puzzles.  However, buying a ticket to Stamford (i.e., "applying") automatically assures you that you will be among the "best."   
 Like any great artist, Ayn Rand has her share of people who are trying to leech off of her success.  This book is a shining example of someone trying to cash in on her famous name.  If you want to know more about Ayn Rand you  can read her novels, not someone's book whose only claim to fame is that  they have the two words Ayn Rand in its title.  This is not Ayn Rand 
 This is the first book I can remember reading by this author so perhaps he's a better author than this book leads me to believe. I became interested right from the beginning and found him to be a good storyteller but mid-way through the book, I became disapointed with the repetition.  Too much talk about women in their scanties.  The ending left very much to be desired.  In short, came out of the gates well but had no stamina 
 I confess I love watching BBC productions, in fact I'm a huge fan, but BBC's 1985 version of Pride and Prejudice is quite honestly the worst BBC production I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of them.  What seems to be wrong you ask??   Well simply put it really isn't consistant with the book and the characters and settings seem off.  But yes it is still in England and yes there are the same main characters BUUUTT that's pretty much all I can tell from watching it.  THe MAIN Characters:  Well let's see, the main hero and THE greatest man in classical literature, Mr. Darcy ........ Mr. Darcy well he's handsome alright but nothing like a Mr. Darcy should be.  This Mr. Darcy is unemotional and just seems like a stuck up jerk, he doesn't seem shy or bored with society but simply dull and well, I absolutely hate him as a person.   **Sulking is not acting, I sulk everyday and I've never won an Oscar.**  Elizabeth was alright, I thought she was cute and clever, but not exactly what you would want as an Elizabeth.  I did like her though.  I do have one question... WHO wrote this sad sad script???? and why was Elizabeth, after Darcy proposed, smiling and quirky??? this jerk just asked her to marry her against his better thoughts and wishes and COMPLETELY dissed her family and called them idiots... yep i would really act like that in that situation... she obviously needs a life coach  another thing, after Darcy gives Elizabeth the letter explaining everything the camera is watching Darcy walk away... this actor... (sorry to say) can't walk.. it's like watching a scowling, stomping duck waddle away. (huh?)  in conclusion (if you couldn't tell):    I was very disappointed... the production seemed cheap and the acting very very poor.  You may think from the other reviews that it is worth watching but honestly it is not!    I know that BBC made better movies in the 80's than this.  I just know that they did.  I wish I never bought it and I wish I never saw it, I wish I could throw it away, but that would be a waste of my hard earned money.  GOOD GOD, it's that aweful.   Thank you for listening,  Just so you know I'm obsessed with Pride and Prejudice so I do know a little something.    ********************************* PS By FL's LOVELY Daughter... but, yep, FL does agree with me 
 The specific examples used are to illustrate what the author wants us to believe.  I would have prefered a much rounder picture of the border.  ... offers no alternatives to the reader but to take Mexico's problems off their hands and solve them with our generosity 
 I've read a lot of Stephen King's work, and loved most of it, but 'Firestarter' was a big letdown!  It's not quite in the 'abomination' category of 'From a Buick 8', but at least King could blame that one on his car accident. This one is probably only about as good as 'The Tommyknockers.' The premise is great, but once it gets away from 'Andy and Charlie on the run', and becomes 'The Life Story of Tom Rainbird', it goes downhill very quickly! Not to knock King too much, but as this books goes along, it seems obvious that SK was losing interest, either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason, and wanted to 'explore' the supporting characters more; or simply because this book came out fairly early in King's career, when he was known to partake of certain 'substances' which he later swore off! Worth reading only if you really want to read every SK novel. Otherwise, just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one(with the exception of the two mentioned above) surpasses 'Firestarter' 
 I bought this book because I was interested in using the Psalms with my work but I have to say I was a bit dissapointed. I did like the uses given and the suggestins of candle colors to burn with the Psalms but I did not like that the King James Bible was used for this book. The King James Bible is probably the worst translation out there. I decided to use the working related to each psalm in this book in conjunction with the Catholic Living Bible. The Catholic bible is far superior and much more powerfull for use as a conjure book. 
 For those of you who think this book is depressing, try Susan Allen Toth's travel books about England.  They are charming 
 It's a comic book.   This book was very disappointing.  I had watched the movie and thought that I could get more insight by reading the book...I think that I was done in 10 minutes reading...  Terrible to even market this as a book 
 This is probably the worst war related movie I've ever seen. I am particularly incensed by several actors who are featured as being in the film are present for as little as a single minute or two. Time spent watching this film is time you'll never get back and have nothing to show for it 
 This is the most boring, unmotivating, uninteresting workout I have ever owned, yoga or other.  I am exceptionally disappointed, as it was voted best workout DVD of 2005 by Self magazine. I have only been practicing for a few weeks, having fallen in love with Fit Tv's Namaste workouts, I expected the same great music, flowing rhythm, and steady pace.  Instead, this is an incredibly slow-moving, dull workout that doesn't even challenge me, a true beginner.  I adore yoga, and wanted a longer, challenging workout--this is not it.  I'm back to my FREE FitTv Namaste workouts, until I can find somethng better 
 I've read 300 of the 362 pages and I can't be bothered to finish.  Not particularly well written.  The secondary characters are un-developed and annoying... in fact, the same can be said for the main characters.    I don't care what happens to them.  I don't care about finding out what the "mystery" is.  I can't figure out how they could possibly have fallen in love.  The author just springs it on you.  It's a bit insulting to the reader, in fact.    The heroine is passive and whiny... "[spies (or whatever) are following me and I'm going to do nothing about it except wait for them to spring on me at every tourist site and "ruin" the tourist experience for me.]"  This is my first book by this author, and unless I forget her name (it's a very bland, forgettable name) and accidentally buy something by her again, it is the last.  I'm really glad I only paid a buck for it 
 Like many people, I was drawn to Light in the Piazza by its amazing reviews.  It was only after I had purchased tickets that I saw the performance on the Tonys.  It didn't bode well.  As a whole the c.d, much like the production, is over-dramatic, overly sensational.  The music has been called "lush," however I think it leans more to "trying too hard."  It is all far too overdone.  The music also lacks any sort of conflict or passion.  All in all, a great disappointment 
 Honestly, nothing about this show grabs me. I'm surprised this show gets such high Nielsen ratings every week. The writers tend to come up with similar stories all the time. But the biggest flaw is the acting. It is really laughable. Me and my friends watch this sometimes to laugh at how ridiculous everyone seems to be. Horatio Caine talks in a slow drawl all the time, saying the stupidest and most obvious things. Calleigh is always smiling at everyone and everything up to the point it gets irritating. None of the C.S.I team displays any emotion whatsoever, oh...except Horatio when he over does it.   The stories are also terribly boring and utterly predictable. If there's a V.I.P suspect with a "history" with Horatio, yup...you guessed it, he's involved (either directly or indirectly). And also, if the suspect appears in about 10 minutes into the show...yea, it's not him. And Calleigh gets "evidence" such as DNA from saliva etc almost every episode using her sexuality. I mean, once or twice is alright...but I've seen about 8-10 episodes and she does it all the time. Every criminal here is an idiot, they are sure to leave all kinds of huge "clues" leading to them or their alliances. And every crime gets solved all the time. Oh, and is it just me or does the C.S.I team seem to know everything under the sun at their fingertips, no need for books or researching, they already have it that big brain of theirs. Think that's unlikely? Exactly my point.  In short, I wouldn't move appointments or hurry home to watch this show. In fact, even if someone gives me this DVD set as a gift, I would probably keep it aside or maybe present it to someoene else. Watch this show if you're REALLY bored, with nothing else to do and no better use of your time. If you want real Crime Scene Investigation, watch the original C.S.I, Las Vegas. That's the best C.S.I....period 
 I've been a fan of Bright Eyes (Connor Oberst) since the first time I heard the song Motion Sickness on the radio. Since then, with albums like Fevers and Lifted and even I'm wide awake (although to a lesser extent), I've been awe inspired by Oberst's amazing talent. With all that said, I have to be objective when I say that this newest album is really more or less dressed up garbage. It seems like he's lost that spark of angst and emotion that made his previous songs so special. Has success gotten to Oberst? Has the trauma of being smiled upon by so many soulless hollywood types ruined his once unrivaled talent? I don't know, but my advice would be either download this album for free, or ignore it altogether. If you absolutly must spend your hard earned moula on something Bright Eyes, I suggest the recently released rareties collection, Noise Floor, instead. Noise Floor will remind old fans of what made Bright Eyes so special, or introduce newcomers to something they've been missing 
 I was misled by the picture of 13 bars (a complete set).  I got 5 bars which does me no good.  I want to change them all.  I am sending back and getting a complete set, for $50.  
 This is a barely passable pulp fiction "mystery" novel from Jonathan Kellerman revolving around a sex murder and some questionable rich kids.   In essence, this book is pretty much completely predictable, and burdened by lengthy explanations that, by the time you get to them, you've either guessed or stopped caring about.  The book starts off with premise - a young woman is brutally murdered and sexually molested, with no apparent leads, a cold case 20 years old - but it quickly degenerates, and the true perpetrators are apparent from early on.    Even as a light holiday, poolside, read - this book is lacking.  There are way too many lucky breaks and coincidences (the main character just happens to be old friends with a key witness' shrink) for this book to even approach plausible.  The characters are one dimensional and boring.  Even Milo, the gay cop, is just... boring.  Cliched.  A shabby excuse for a fleshed out character.    Give this book a pass - seriously.  I'm sure there are much better books to spend your $6 - $8 on. 
 The good first. There is a lot of good. I enjoyed and agree with every chapter except the chapter about men keeping a visual rolodex of sexual images for their perusal.   My husband and I have a great marriage. He knows I have the utmost respect for him and he has great love for me. He is certainly not ever wanting more sex, just complaining about how he feel like a piece of meat sometimes. (In jest I'm sure.)I say that to show, that not coming from a prude, the author puts for the idea that men just lust and fantasize about women nonstop and it's normal. I am quite sure she used the word normal at least twice. It was dealt with like, it's a fact so get used to it.  Your man might chase women around home depot to get a better look, or go out to dinner with you and remain preoccupied with the hostess all night. The men give accounts of this, like, oh well, doesn't mean I don't love my wife.  In my opinion, just b/c they aren't willing to risk actually acting on those thoughts, doesn't mean it's ok.   I found the book to be very very discouraging. That a bunch of married Christian men would unapologetically (key word here)see a woman in a fitted worksuit no less (we're not talking lingerie here) and think about what she's like in bed or what her nipples look like. There's no mention that maybe this is lust or committing adultery in your heart. Or maybe they should not do this. It really threw me for a loop! I guess I didn't realize just how insecure or sex crazed men are. Not that I think they don't want a lot of it. But I found it discouraging for Christian wives to think that their husbands can't go to work without picturing everyone naked.  I found it disturbing that the book is purporting this is giving the idea to men a lisence to do this since it's "normal" and women just need to get used to the idea 
 Having read a few books by Mr. Benedict, I am beginning to question his motives. Is he writing for shock value, or is there a darker agenda hidden here? Questionable statistics, and even more questionable conclusions. Singling out a group of men, using anecdotal evidence, and drawing broad conclusions about the group as a whole is somewhat frightening in my opinion. A shameless attack on NFL players that simply promotes prejudice without any enlightening social content in evidence. Pathetic 
 I bought this in November and used it a couple times. It worked on one disk and not the other. I went to use it again and it stopped working. I then called Maxell and it only has a 90 warranty. So I am feeling ripped off and angry. Oh well, that'll teach me to buy Maxell anything 
 Samples taken from WTC steel now confirm (soon to be released by Professor Steven Jones of BYU and five other universities) Thermate was used in the WTC Towers to take them down. This meshes with the global collapse times of both Towers (and 7 WTC) and the eyewitness reports that day from firefighters, police, tenants and workers who said bombs were in the Towers. Not only do we have dispicable people in government who, of course, knew this all along, but the U.S. media knew it too. Soon both will be out of employment 
 This sleeping bag is NOT worth the money. The tent part is very flimse and tears up easily. The sleeping bag itself was nearly destroyed after I washed it 
 Wow.  This movie's bad.  But it's good for a laugh if you're in the mood for some brainless fun.  Patrick Bergen gives one of the great over-the-top performances of all time as the psycho husband.  Among the many major plot holes:  Hubby smacks Julia because he thought she was checking out their new neighbor on his boat.  Then a few days later he's arranging for them both to go sailing with the same guy, on his boat!  (Wouldn't the psychotically jealous husband try to keep his wife away from the man he thinks she's lusting after?)  Also, the fact that she would fake her drowning in the OCEAN - but flush her wedding ring (halfway) down the TOILET - is not the smartest move to say the least.  Might wanna just ditch that ring in the ocean while you're faking your own death next time, Julia!  Gotta admit though, I loved that the psycho hubby would sneak into Julia's house and actually take time to rearrange the cans in the cupboard before he hides.  What a neat freak.  The final plot hole involves her new boyfriend in Iowa, who would likely be more interested in Patrick Bergen than Julia, if you know what I'm saying 
 great book, too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds.  i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie, almost didn't finish reading it.  they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film.  on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira's voice was right on, and while the movie character of Brom was fully wasted, jeremy irons did a fine job.  i look forward to starting the next book, but will skip the next movie.  
 This is not what I expected or wanted.  The book is written for business senarios with very few suggestions of a personal nature.  The description of the book does not indicate that it is mainly for business use 
 Some journalists write excellent history.  Others produce mediocre but acceptable historical books.  But some are simply awful, like Thomas Laird, who tried hard to write something profound but failed.  Having seen the substantive criticism from experts, one could hardly believe the bad reviews were true, but they didn't reveal just how badly this is done.  Besides the multitude of factual errors, it's stylistically annoying--as if Laird were trying to write a screenplay for Oliver Stone, another propagandist with an agenda who cares little for facts if they get in the way of the story he wants to tell.  
 This device was pretty good, the kids loved sleeping with it running.  Then I purchased a Gauss meter and discovered a whopping 400.0mG of EMF radiating from it.  Considering that most countries recommend nothing higher than 1.0mG, and anything over 10.0mG is considered an extreme cancer risk this is completely unacceptable.  The EMF declined rapidly as the range from the device increases, effectively dropping to 0 at 6 feet.  However people that put this on their nightstand should immediately rectify that situation! The fact of the matter is, all electrical devices should always be a minimum of 5 feet away from the body in bedrooms.  Even so, I question the engineering of this device if it emits such a drastic level of EMF.  
 If this was dubbed well, I would rate this a 5, I love series 2 of Sonic X, but NOT THIS VERSION.  I'm sorry but this was the worst dubbed 26 episodes of Sonic X ever.  They delete Cosmo and Molly's death, and change Tails' feelings completely showing NO love or romance. Cream, Vector and Sonic's horrid voices or the screechy Rebecca Honig, the painfully annoying and Barney Gumble sounding Carter Cathcart, and the bland, emotionless, and dweeby Jason Anthony Griffith (Though on voice matters, if there was ANY voice that made me stop watching this show ever again in English, it's Rebecca Honig as Cream, gave me a headache listening to it, that is NOT how a kid sounds).  That horrid replacement music.  The original made me cry, but after episode 74, I stopped and just read the edits and such, and what I read about episodes 77 and 78 appalled me, no true anime fan should buy this DVD set, it's an insult to anime, it's an insult to emotions, and it's an insult to Sonic.  download the episodes in Japanese or French if you can find them, it's better then this.  Trust me, I watched the English episodes as well as the Japanese episodes.  Naruto was a good edited dub, this is not.  Some of the edits involve editing out Molly's death, Changing Cosmo's death completely to something else that makes it look like a bad fanfic (and if my friend Jason is reading this, I said BAD Fanfic, NOT JUST fanfic), they also cut out the part where Knuckles was trying to save Zelkova which I felt was an inportant character part  for Knuckles and even the bad guy before he died.  They also changed Tails feelings towards Cosmo to just friendship rather then love, why?  it was some junk on seeds and such, it made no sence and made it sound nasty.  the ONLY episodes I think were dubbed decently were episodes 73 and 74 but they were still badly voiced and the music was still annoying.  And even so, some translations was pathetic, like when Tails attacked Shadow to protect Cosmo, when Shadow struck Tails, instead of Cosmo yelling to Tails by name in fear for his safety, she just said quietly "he's hurt" talk about stating the obvious.......  Why does Cosmo's actress have to sound old and emotionless?  in Japanese Cosmo is an 8 year old girl full of emotion, did 4Kids not know that?    Being the Sonic fan and Anime purist I am, I am making a fandub of this show to see if I can make a better, uncut and more in character English version.  I can say this, THIS IS the final release of Sonic X, TMS and 4Kids confermed it to me resently in a email from each.  So maybe with this gone for a bit, things can get back on track for Sonic, and when another company hopefully licences Sonic X, they can make a better english versions with the original music, original story and better voices, especially Sonic's (it doesn't actually have to be Ryan Drummond or Jaleel White, just someone who can fit Sonic's character like those two were able).  So for now I do say SO LONG SONIC 
 I was enjoying this book for the first sixty-seventy pages until I read Mr. Lengel's description of Ft. Ticonderoga. He places the Fort on the Hudson River. (????) Ft. Ticonderoga, so important a location in the French/Indian and Revolutionary wars is, in fact, on Lake Champlain. Mr. Lengel also incorrectly writes that Henry Knox, after retrieving the cannons from Ft. Ticonderoga takes them down the Hudson. This too is incorrect. Knox and his men took the cannons across land to Lake George (which was frozen in winter), down to Lake George village and south to Albany before turning east to Boston. I'm totally shocked that no review of this book mentions these inaccurate statements. Anyway, after about 100 pages I took the book back to the library. I couldn't depend on the rest of his facts-so what's the point of reading it? 
 It looks attractive, but I was markedly disappointed with the lack of sharpness in all the knives.  I find myself reaching for an old set of knives to cut up vegetables.  If the fruit or veggies are nearing ripeness, the kitchenaid knives will not cut through them at all 
 Slow,dull and done on the "cheap"....stick with "Zulu" and read your history book's ....far more entertaining 
 I love Jez Alborough and this book is great to look at and read and rhyme with -- until you get to the end!  Shame on you duck.  I read this to a group of children at a day care center yesterday and they were shocked at Duck's treatment of his helpful friends.  
 If you are interested in Kabbala, it is best approached within the framework of a lifestyle observant of Jewish Law.  As one reads Gershon Scholem's books the thoughtful reader will quickly realize that he does not believe what he is writing. His point of view is intellectual only and he did not in his lifetime practice.   Anyone can take some of the principles of Kabbala and use them to get some pretty cool results. The unfortunate thing is that the earlier comment that you can get the same feelings from reading a dungeons and dragons book was absolutely true. The author of the Zoar, and the real kabalistic texts assume that the only people reading them would be Torah Observant Jews.   For the Kabbala to be explored, even slightly, requires the same strict adherence to Torah that the early masters had. Anything less is folly. Yes you can have nice feelings that are real, but you can get those practicing tai chi, you can meditate deeply, but anyone can do that counting sheep.  These people who say that this books and all others by Gershon Scholem are a waste of time are correct, but don't allow that to convince you that Kabbala is not of value. He did not know that he approached it in the wrong way, but you don't have to.   If you are interested in learning Kabbala do not purchase this book. 
 I thought I'd try this book because I enjoyed both of the films about Ripley. But take away the acting of Matt Damon and John Malkovich and Ripley loses his depth as a fascinatingly ambiguous amoralist, and turns into just a bore in a dressing gown who happens to kill a lot of people. Furthermore, Highsmith seems to have only one literary trick up her sleeve: describe a bunch of horrific acts in deadpan, Hemingwayesque prose so that your reader can shiver and marvel at the incongruity of it all. Well, ho hum 
 I was urged to finish the book in hopes that the simplistic plot took a sordid twist to shock me at the end. The book lacked thoughtful character development. The protagonist, a seemingly complex character seemed to get by on bartending, and denying himself from the world. Early in the book, Koontz alludes to something in the protagonists past. I waited until page 350 to find out, and was somewhat disappointed that the incident didn't directly provoke the protagonist's current situation...it simply made him an interesting target. Furthermore, along the killing spree clean-up, the protagonist seemed all to comfortable with protecting his innocence, to the point where I was hoping some surprise that he had colluded in the sordid details. Also, early on, the book reveals who the killer is, in such a way that I was sure that Koontz was trying to over-simplify the plot to lead the reader in the wrong direction.  I really wanted to the plot to come full circle. Furthermore, the plot lacked serious suspense when the protagonist encountered the villian. It reminded me of Hannible. The allusions to art, performances, etc. Not really original. The last thing that was overrated were the allusions to Dickenson and Elliot. It was as if a novice writer was trying to display their familiarity with the classics. The references did not really fit into the plot. Perhaps I missed the boat, but I was not at all impressed with my first Koontz read.    
 If you want to believe, don't bother reading this.  After much anticipation, I just finished viewing Temple of Doom and found it a dissapointment. Indy's 2-dimensional companions "Willie" and "Shorty" seemed to toggle between desparate comic diversion and self-serving audience identification. The main villian spouted exotic gibberish to some styrofoam god gave the term "heart wrenching" a new definition. The insects were slimy also. I'm sorry- it may be my 12" TV or maybe I am in a cranky mood, but I found this movie to be a skeleton from the 80s best locked away 
 I was hoping for more in-depth information about Hibernate 3.  The book flows ok and is easy to read, but just doesn't have the details that you can find with the general documentation.   I should have previewed the book at a local store before buying it.  Hibernate in Action is supposed to be the best Hibernate book, but didn't buy it because it is almost 2 years old now.  Looking back, probably should have bought that to get a good foundation, then used the online docs to find the differences with ver 3 
 John Harris is not shy about his feelings for DSotM.  The back cover of this book states "Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' (1973) is one of the most beloved albums of all time.  A sonically stunning exploration into dark themes...  Besides being perhaps the most fully realized and elegant concept album ever recorded, 'The Dark Side of the Moon' [sic] was also one of the most technologically advanced LPs of its day."    Yeah, right.  Questionable hyperbole aside, Harris starts the book with the by-now familiar story of The Pink Floyd Sound, Syd Barrett, early psychedelia, quick success, Syd's decline and the band's decision to carry on without him.  It's an interesting story, and many books and articles have mined it for dramatic appeal.  For me, what happened next is the most interesting part -- the band throws out the pop song format and begins turning music inside out, experimenting with long drones, alternate playing techniques, and new music structures never before seen on this planet.  Their incredible inventiveness creates a whole new style of music, with a ripple effect on everything that follows.  Unfortunately, Harris is less enamored of "Saucerful," "More," "Ummagumma," "Atom Heart," "Meddle" and "Obscured" than I am, dismissing them rather cavalierly as "poorly realized, loose-ended stuff" that "sought, in their own ill-advised way, to test both their audience's expectations and the limits of musical orthodoxy."  Apparently musical orthodoxy is very important to author Harris, because he gets all gushy when he gets to Chapter 3 and starts relating stories of the creation of DSotM.  For those of us who LOVED the unorthodoxy and limits-testing, DSotM was a huge disappointment from day one, the episode where Pink Floyd "jumped the shark" (to use a TV metaphor), sold out and started playing to the lowest common denominator.  It was also the undeniable beginning of the end, where PF got so famous that they became prisoners of their own success.  Instead of musicians, they became commodities.  They all went off and bought mansions and were miserable.  To Harris this is all fine.  DSotM is his favorite album in the whole world and he gathers all available material about the creation of this album.  It's a fine story as far as it goes; and Harris does a credible job of telling it; and Floyd fans will enjoy the retelling.  I just wish John Harris knew the Pink Floyd I knew and loved. 
 I read a lot of books and have been doing a number of reviews and this is one of the only books that I couldn't finish. After beginning to read this book I found that it just bounced all over the place. The book was not focused on anything or anyone in particular especially Andrew Jackson. If the book did focus on one thing in particular then it was details of the types of personalities some of the men around Jackson had, which I am not sure how one could be so familar with that not knowing any of the people personally. Sure you can learn something about personalities from letters but the detail about personality types was too much. Spending too much time on small detail does not make for great reading nor does it help one to see the big picture behind the story. So if what you like in a book is learning about personality types you will love this book.   The book also seemed to be written by a some what biased point of view by the author. The title should have been something like Politics in the early 1800's. This book will NOT keep your attention from one page to another. If you want to know more about Andrew Jackson spend your money on something else! 
 Our baby boy loves jumping and swinging but this product is not well designed (and I'm an industrial designer Dad, so I should know!). It can hit the door frame easily, the seat is way too deep even though our baby is above average height. He's banged his mouth a few times into the hard plastic portion when he swings in or jumps in it. He has fun in it at first, but it always seem a disappointment in the end. Save your time and money and get the Baby Einstein Excersaucer. THAT is agreat toy and better for development skills 
 This book is an overview. It does not cover the details that are required for CISSP. I found more helpful resources (PDF, PPT, doc)) on the internet free of cost.  Save some money and buy Shon Harris's or Wiley's Exam Prep Guide instead. That is what I  did. 
 In all honesty, this book was severely lacking in just about every area. It wasn't horrible. I didn't mind reading it, but there were just so many problems with the story as a whole, so many poorly developed aspects that kept it from being a truly good read. The story was very two-dimensional, lacking development and depth. It was just very superficial.  The characters have very little depth or exploration. The authors give you some basic history, but fail to really explore them. They mention things but then never really tell you about them. An example is Maggie's pregnancy. You know that the antagonist got her pregnant at a young age, and you're told that there was some sort of cover-up to get her out of town so no one would know. But they never give you any details. You have no idea exactly how old she was, and you're not told anything at all about this cover-up. Where did she go? What did she do? How did she handle it all? Why did she make up a husband? It would have been nice to have these details and it would have given another dimension to Maggie's character.  Zack's was in a similar state. You know his FBI step-father was killed by the antagonist but you learn little else, other than that Zack was greatly affected by the slaying. I wanted to know how old Zack was when his mother married his step-father, what their relationship was like, how he dealt with the man's death, etc. Again, knowing all this would have made the character more full-bodied. The authors just failed to give these characters any depth at all.  The romance between them was poorly developed as well. It seemed extremely forced, with very little emotion involved. It was like, hey, let's kiss; hey, let's have sex; hey, I think I might have feelings for you. I wasn't feeling the chemistry between them at all. I had a really hard time believing that these two characters were in love.  There were also some minor areas where issues bothered me. One was that Zack, as an FBI Agent, was allowed to participate in the case at all. He was personally connected (his father being killed by the antagonist 14 years earlier). I had a hard time buying that that would be allowed. Also, Destiny, who had roles in the other books, is done a serious injustice in this book. She's paired off and engaged with hardly a whisper. A little more on that would have been nice.  As for the good points...well, I enjoyed the cameos of Max and Jamie. Fleas the hound dog and Butterbean the goat were great. And the actual plot wasn't too bad. But none of that could overcome the holes in the book. I was rather disappointed overall once I finished.  Rating: 2 / 5 
 I am only giving this product such a low rating because of the shipping.  The product costs $29.95, and shipping is $22.49 ... Doubling the cost!  This is the product we used to flavor the popcorn in the movie theater I worked in during high school.  I adore it

 I had to read this book for my highschool literature class. Now I enjoy reading a good book now and then but the only reason that this is a bestseller is that all highschools across america must buy the book for summer reading every year. This book put me to sleep. The only reason this book gets two stars is because of the Trojan War chapter which I wished was longer. It was rich in detail and made you want to keep reading, unlike the rest of the book. I only recommend this book if you have to for a school class but other than that don't waste your time 
 Perhaps in the first time in the publishing industry, a former president had to refund a portion of the advance for his memoirs due to its falling short of expectations of the publisher. That is all that needs to be said about A Time To Heal.  Gerald R. Ford stumbled into the presidency in the same way comic Chevy Chase panned him in skits on SNL. Embattled Pres. Richard Nixon needed a mark to make sure he could shuffle out of the Oval Office without the threat of being prosecuted for crimes & misdemeanors, and Ford was the man.  The book is short on detailed facts concerning the issue of the pardon and staggers through the key points of the times - the fall of Saigon and the 1976 Republican primary that basically undid his presidency - like a running back on a soggy field and wearing the wrong cleats for proper traction.  Ford should have had the courage to take a pen in hand and truly write a major piece on the tumolt that defined his brief presidency. The book publisher certainly expected more. But I guess that sketches short on facts are what should have been expected from an individual who truly defined the term, "Beltway Insider."    
 There is a preview in Box set #2 , in which he makes a commercial like that of BrokeBack Mountain in which he says the final 42 episodes on DVD in Set 3..  Shame on you Mr. Judge.. only 120 episodes out of about 200+ are getting the DVD digital cut?  in the words of your own created characters..you suck!! Rent it when it comes out 8/1/2006 and reminisce what a great show it was despite Fart-knocker Mike Judge limiting his release of titles..  Mike Judge the ultimate tool..  huh huh, he said tool 
 I haven't been really able to use any of the things in this book for my personal trading.  However, there is one thing that I find helpful, that is the table on page 30 & 31 which gives you a run down of the popular  indicators and their deficiencies 
 buy it so you can set it on fire. it'll be one of the most ENJOYABLE experiences you'll ever have. trust me on this one. it's like the biggest smallest victory one could ever achieve 
 A weak freshman effort from the earliest Jefferson Starship iteration, DRAGON FLY suffers, as many J. Airplane/"Solo"/J. Starship/Starship albums do, from overproduction.   This band, in whatever form its taken, has always loved its multipart harmonies and heavy instrumentation. When the formula works it works very well, but when it doesn't, the music tends to have the dissonant sound of rush hour gridlock in Manhattan. And although the Jefferson Airplane "broke up" in 1972, the early Seventies saw a slew of various solo projects by various band members come to fruition, the overall quality of which were uneven. To be fair, it's difficult to write good material consistently, and the more prolific the writing, the more throwaways are created. It's clear that Kantner, Slick, Balin, et. al. all needed individually to take some real time off to find new directions for themselves. The early Seventies albums all seem to be retreads of each other.   So it is with DRAGON FLY. Most of this album consists of eminently forgettable songs with weak lyrics. The band's densely insistent musical aggressiveness does not lift any song on this album up to the status of a true "hit." The best song on the disc is far and away "Ride The Tiger," a piece which would otherwise qualify as a secondary choice on any Greatest Hits compilation.  The only other pieces of note are Grace Slick's "Hyperdrive," overly long and prolix but potentially a good "live" suite; and "Caroline," 'guest star' Marty Balin's lengthy ode to lost love, which anticipates "Miracles" on RED OCTOPUS.   Overall, DRAGON FLY is an unimpressive entry from a "new" band of the 1970s that had played themselves out being an "old" band from the 1960s.                
 Andrew Weill is perhaps the most well-known of these type of practioners.  Unfortunately, some of what he has to say has been clinical disproven. For example, in study after study, large amnounts of Vitamin C given orally do absolutely nothing more than a   placebo for cancer patient.  Yet he still preaches this.  Given intravenously, actually, there is some evidence that it may work for some people..but it does not work by stimulating your immune system..it works in a different way.  The book How To treat and Prevent Cancer with Natural Medicine is far superios in my opinion, even though it was written by four naturopaths in 2002.  Even then they admitted that clinical studies were showing that there was no advantage of taking Vitamin C orally over a placebo,  and the authors freely admitted it. But much of what the discussed in that book..Eight Magic supplements to take when you have cancer..has actually been proven. I am a cancer patient with myeloma.  Maitake D fraction, curcumin (it must be taken w/bioperine an hour before meals), selenium, and some other things they mention have all been proven in clinical studies or are being worked on.  They do not promise that they have a cure of anything..they only say it may help in the context of complimentary medicine. They do not claim an organic diet will cure cancer or that medical science would hide it if they have a cure.  The book by Quiallan I think claims that an organic diet will cure you, and there is post after post that this has actually worked.  Maybe it has..but as a myeloma patient..my immune system is overstimulated, so I cannot take most immune system supplements..and some like Vitamin C are actually antagonistic In Vitro to myeloma treatments..this usually translates to the same thing in the body..unlike positive in studies that often do not pan out.  Anyway, I am not saying Dr. Weill is all wrong, but do not pretend he has a cure.  I have known secondhand two people who have been cured by long fasts of only carrot juice, another two by healers (I  am not religious), and one who claims that barley juice and lowering his PH totally got rid of his cancer.  I believe these people all may have gotten rid of their LOCALIZED tumors this way. For blood cancers, such as leukemia and myeloma (a cancer of blood produced in the marrow), we do not exactly have localized tumors.  But with the addition of supplements mentioned in Dr. Murray et al's book, my response to medications has been phenomenal and I have went into remission. Unfortunately, at this time, myeloma always comes back from remission. There is new understanding why this may be so..that just came out December 2005.  There is even a drug available..but it will not be available to myeloma patients for a long while 
 I bought this book based on the reviews on this website having never seen it first hand.  While I think it is a cute story, my 18 month old book lover didn't take to it.  It's the last of his picks during reading hour 
 "24 Days" is both a story about what went on at Enron and how the Wall Street Journal reporters followed and wrote the story. The book is interesting at first, but after awhile the detail becomes overwhelming and pointless.   In addition, the book did not provide a clear understanding about CFO Fastow's side deals. To be fair, however, the deals were so complex that even with printed documentation in hand it was not possible to decipher what was going on, and other books on the topic have not clarified the matter either. What is clear, however, is that the side deals were kept under the radar as much as possible, and even deliberately hidden in some instances.   Another clear conclusion is that neither CEO Lay, former CEO Skilling, Enron's Board, nor numerous highly-paid stock analysts knew the full details or even tried. No evidence of their interest in any details was revealed. Incredible incompetence - at bes 
 If "false memories" of childhood sexual abuse are truly false, then why aren't people having false memories en masse about other traumatic events in their lives, such as being beaten up, or having car accidents? This book obviously serves to perpetuate the taboo our culture has around the subject of childhood sexual abuse. This book is nothing but a business card Loftis uses to hand out to defense attorneys with budgets large enough to pay for her testimony.   If you want to know how trauma affects memory, try reading Traumatic Experience and the Brain by Dave Zeigler, Ph.D. 
 These two movies are a montage of slow-motion, fast-motion, and time-lapse filming set to music.  One shows the how man works and the other how man uses the planet.  I wanted to like these but I found the constant image changing and music aggravating.  They are very interesting and have good messages but I can't stand the constant sensory bombardment.  
 The name on this item should be "pillow". It is much too small for a cushion. They need to change the discription to pillow or cushion for your head. I wish I had spent more time reading the whole page on this item before I ordered it. Lesson learned 
 If the publisher offered an edited edition of this book minus the vitriol I'd give it four stars. But when the author chastises people and groups that he despises, who used the very same tactics to make the changes they wanted with the techniques he's advising the reader to do and not acknowledging them although he may disagree with them, it taints what wisdom there is with a stain of hypocrisy.   Better luck next time Mr. Ringer when you can control your anger and be a bit more objective. I'm certain to be one of the "stupid" people after this review 
 The Ying Yang Twins definitely aren't one of my favorite rap groups. Sure, they can make a few stupid songs like "Say I Yi Yi" that get radio and videoplay for awhile, but as far as a really good album, no they can't do that. I'm giving this album 2 stars because it has "Say I Yi Yi" and "By Myself" which are hits that were enjoyable for a few minutes. This album might really be worth a dollar, but thats being generous. If you enjoy listening to a group of people who want to make noise instead of music, then this is for you. If you want good rap music, then go pick up Tupac's greatest hits. 
 If you pick this up, don't expect any in-depth or informative analysis of Alexander's life, conquests, tactics, motives or personality; expect a Junior High School reading-level synopsis of the route traveled by Alexander's army with brief, sporadic, uncohesive glimpses of major events along the way. The pictures add a bit of life to dehydratated and uninspired prose 
 The beginning of this book was well written and made me think I was going to follow two young girls through their experience growing up in an Italian family.  Pretty soon, I realized I was wrong.  The girls are highly disrespectful of their mother, who seems to have no redeeming qualities.  They have nothing good to say about their father and although they take care of both later in their lives (well, they put them in nursing homes), there is no love, tenderness, conflicts about their anger with their parents (and why are they SO mad?!) versus their loyalty to them!  The sister is a basket case whom the younger sister can never get past admiring.  And one of the most irritating parts of this book is the time factor.  While the girls seem to be growing up, the sister has 2 kids, has an affair, and ultimately both parents die, but the sister's kids NEVER GET OLDER!  They are always little so it makes you wonder how insightful the author really is if she can't even keep up with the time.  In the end, I felt sorry for the parents for having two children who were so self-absorbed and selfish that, even as youngsters, they never even tried to relate to their elders-- also something that seemed unrealistic 
 I personally started liking Tim Robbins from Shawshank Redemption & Sean Penn from Dead Man Walking and I believe these were the movies these guys should have recieved oscar for their outstanding roles.  Keeping than in mind and seeing lot of recommendations I saw Mystic River which the review said was the best as far as Clint Eastwood was concerned Again he had adapted another movie, Bridges of Madison County, which in my personal opinion was much better adaptation of a novel.  The story line eventhough is good about three friends meeting again by fate and all the script is not that strong. I actually fell asleep in between. Off the cast my personal belief is Kevin Bacon was really good. Sure Tim  Robbins plays a character of sexually abused child with lot of conviction but even that was potrayed better in Shawshank Redemption where he is abused by a few inmates. And the end is kind of loose.  Give it a mis 
 Hi, I have all the 3 famous book of Kevyn Aucoin (Making Faces, Faces Forward and this) and this one is the worst. Why is this the most expensive? I don`t understand 
 This is certainly an impassioned defence of beauty, and a 'feel-good' book, but it is so lacking in substance is barely counts as a contribution to the debate. It's incoherent at many levels, most notably concerning the switch from the accepted idea in part one that beauty is always particular, to the claims in part two that it is a function of certain qualities, especially symmetry. Asthetic symmetry promotes ethical justice? The idea of beauty as enlivening is also too simple. This is not good enough as a theory of the link between aesthetics and ethics. The account of the so called 'political complaints' against beauty is a set of caricatures. There is also a very weak accounts of Matisse, whose Nice paintings are regarded by Scarry as stand ins for real windows and real palm trees; some sense of what modernist art has done to the concept of beauty and why is needed here. There are many better books on the topic. 
 THIS BOOK WAS SO BADLY WRITTEN THAT I DON'T WANT YOU TO WAIST YOUR TIME READING A REVIEW ON IT. RUUUUUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN... GO ON WITHOUT ME! 
 I bought this because I thought it may be an entertaining spoof on Bush's blunders and so forth. Instead, it is more BASED on Bush but not really about him, or about anything. This is not the worst TV show. I say that because a TV show can only be so bad. Once it gets to the lowest level, then it is tied with all the other shows that are at that level. So, this is not the worst show ever. However, it is TIED with the worst shows ever. Another way of putting it is that it is in the same class as the worse shows ever. Meaning, it is absolutely horrible, painful to watch, insanely un-funny, terribly acted and written by total idiots with no talent. All in all, I would describe it as "shockingly bad". Meaning that it is beyond me how any human being could consider it to be entertaining. 
 I read this book for a course in social anthropology and while it is a detailed ethnographic monograph it is difficult to understand the language and it would help to know more about the history of the conflict in  Northern Ireland before reading it 
 Like many of the readers, I agree that Ms. Evanovich seems to have run out of ideas.  The series could be written by a twelve year old.  Just give them a checklist- blow up car, eat donuts, feed Rex a donut/grape/piece of pizza, eat donuts, vascilate between Ranger and Joe, eat six tastykakes.  You get the idea.  Ms. Evanovich did expand the plot a little with this book, though.  She added in Ranger's shower gel to the list.  It was only mentioned every other paragraph.  Might I add that I have never smelled a shower gel that lingers quite like his supposedly does.  Seriously, the books went downhill after the sixth installment.  If Ms. Evanovich cannot expand the plots and allow more character growth rather than rehashing the same events over and over, perhaps she should consider ending the series.  
 This is a nice enough board book, but be advised that it is NOT the full version of Dr. Seuss' book!  They've left out several (charming!) pages of text and illustrations for the Board Book...  What a disappointment to loyal fans, and how unfair to the newest generation of fans-to-be 
 I realize that the Stephanie Plum series is primarily written for women and I can appreciate that. Even though I am a guy I had really enjoyed the books until this one. First of all, I grew very tired of all the misadventures. I know that is the charm of her character but I think she averaged 3 strange encounters a day. It just wasn't very realistic. Also, the ending was terrible. If Ranger was going to take care of her business anyway, why did he let her waste all that time? Lastly, is there going to be a point when Stephanie actually becomes semi-independent and competent. I am starting to lose the love for Ms. Plum 
 I beg to differ with other reviewers of this book. Although the book may have been regarded as a classic in its time, it cannot be recommended as a source for either self-study or as a reference book on set theory by present-day standards for mathematical writing. Its style varies from too concise to too verbose in an erratic manner. It attempts to combine rigor and lack of rigor, and does so inconsistently. There are no references to other works. Finally, I was particularly turned off by the last sentence of the Preface, the pompous and patronizing "read it, absorb it, and forget it." Those who are interested in elementary set theory are advised to consult the books by Robert Stoll and Patrick Suppes. Besides being much better written and more comprehensive, they are also cheaper. 
 In his recently published history, The Whiskey Rebellion, William Hogeland attempts create a revisionist history of the late eighteenth century Whiskey Rebellion in Western Pennsylvania. What Hogeland accomplishes is less history and more diatribe in the vein of Howard Zinn. He has an axe to grind, and by the end Alexander Hamilton is the devil incarnate, and those who openly contemplated secession and committed acts of violence against property and people were just trying to bring the American Revolution to its necessary conclusion.  The accusation that Hogeland comes back to again and again is that Hamilton incited the rebellion. The argument is that because Hamilton's patently unfair whiskey tax was the impetus behind the frontiersmen's resistance, and his unreasonableness in enforcing the tax and issuing writs for the arrest of those who refused to pay the tax caused the rebellion.  The problem with Hogeland's argument is his scholarship, or lack there of. He almost never offers a direct quote, especially when accusing Hamilton of malfeasance. Instead, Hogeland offers his summary of primary documents with nary a footnote. The reader is expected to accept on faith the author's interpretation at face value with no way to check the facts except a ridiculously useless bibliographic essay at the end. Not all of this is Hogeland's fault. The new trend in historical works intended for the popular market eschews scholarly footnoting, opting instead for endnotes that provide little more than an opportunity to name drop. Even Doris Kearns Goodwin, a legitimate scholar, is guilty of the succumbing to this new endnote craze.  Ultimately, this is the main problem with William Hogeland: he is not a scholar. He is a magazine writer with an agenda, and no scholarly background to legitimize his preposterous conclusions. To read some radical agenda into the actions of the Pennsylvania farmers is the very worst revisionist history, because there is no basis in reality. 
 This is just like the English version but in Spanish. The content does not reflect the culture or morals of the general Latino people. Nearly all models (especially on the cover) are white and/or American and are very thin and tall. They try to use photos of American celebrities when they have brown hair, for example Christina Aguilera, Mandy Moore, Angelina Jolie or just natural brunettes like Catherine Zeta-Jones. Maybe Cosmo thinks we're too ignorant and can be easily fooled by the dark hair dye job or the computer generated tans. There are tons of beautiful and succesful Latinas that could easily be placed on the covers but I think they'd rather just use the same photos that they already took for their English-version magazines. The ads are also for high-end American and European products. I've bought this magazine in Mexico and while it still has the same problems at least they feature real Mexicans and Mexican products in some of the ads.   If you want a magazine that more reflects Latino culture, although it's mostly in English, get Latina Magazine. They use lots of Latina models and it's more relevant to Latin-American women and people interested in Latino culture 
 I am terribly sorry to have to write this, but the author of the book is obviously not orthodox. Most of the recipes use matzoh meal and one even had FLOUR!!  Orthodox jews don't use matzoh meal, or any vegetables that cannot be peeled. We don't use spinach, strawberries,etc.,  or matzoh for cooking or baking.  We use potato  starch for baking. It can't be used in the same quantity of flour because it's much thicker.  There wasn't one single recipe using potato starch! For me, this cookbook is useless 
 I bought this book because I went to a conference in which Burroughs gave a pretty decent speech.  I read two of his books (Magical Thinking and Sellevision) and the humor must have gone over my head.  I don't really care what grown ups do in their spare time, as long as it doesn't frighten the horses, but this one seems cliche-ridden and the jokes fall flat.  I know the literary marketplace has niches, but Sellevision's only redeeming virtue was that it was a quick read.  He missed some of his best opportunities at humor, and the "poetic justice" fizzled out when the exploititative director of programming John Smythe winds up happily divorced with his jailbait girlfriend at a cheap motel.  Max, the gay protagonist goes from flop (no pun) to failure to porn star (I wondered how long it would take for him to get there, since the plot development almost telegraphed it). Thin on plot, two-dimensional characters with cardboard brains.  How long did it take the author to dusctate this one? Mybe John Watters could do something with it, but he would have to bring it to life with a decent writer.     
 My 5 year old loved the thing for the first 30 minutes until the ruber track in the wheels broke in too.  Nothing on the box to try and get parts and a bit expensive just to write off.  The excavator is so realistic in looks and operation but just doesn't look like it is made to hold up under even mild indoor conditions.  ??? what is the intent if it won't hold up on carpet??? 
 Mordden's other musical history books are so informative and entertaining. This one is angry, bitter, cranky, condescending, and not terribly well written. The book's organization is messy at best, his right-wing politics needlessly intrusive, and his opinion of current musical theatre offensive and closed-minded. In fact, the musial theatre is healthier, more exciting, more inventive than at almost any other time in history. At what other time did we have brilliant experiments like Urinetown, Bat Boy, Songs for a New World, The Last Five Years, Avenue Q, A New Brain, Euphoria, Dream True, A Light in the Piazza, etc.? Mordden is just a fuddy-duddy who can't see what a glorious time this is for the art form 
 Pro:  No trans fat.  Con:  No flavor.  Basically tastes like cardboard.  My children won't eat it 
 Dr. Archer is well-schooled. He has a law degree, and extensive training as a linguist. Many of the points he makes in this volume would have been more influential if he had only chosen to annotate the text. He presents  numerous ideas about so-called bible difficulties that are not mentioned in  commentaries by other authors. Due to the complete absence of footnotes or  other annotation, it is nearly impossible to determine what ideas were the  product of research and which are opinion. A work of this type should  provide the reader with the opportunity to pursue the sources of origen in  order to evaluate the author's points against the points of others in the  same field 
 Absolute rubbish. Who publishes a cookbook without pictures. Ok. There are about a dozen pictures, but even so. 400 recipes and no pictures beside them. You eat with your eyes first. What a waste of 45 dollars. The author is a thief 
 Sorry I couldn't come up with a better punchline, but this movie doesn't deserve any original thought or ideas.  Maybe its because there aren't any original ideas in this movie event.  National Lampoon used to mean funny, now its french for crapola.  Avoid this one at all costs!!!  Watch Caddyshack II, Airplane II, yes even Xanadu three times each before you pick this booger one 
 DONT BUY  CDNOW   I GOT BILLED 2 TIMES AND THEY DONT LIKE TO SHOW THERE # SO HERE YOU GO 1-866-771-546 
 Initially this unit seemed to work pretty well. I wasn't thrilled about  the copyright protection issues or the extremely slow time to load, but I decided to try to work with it. In six months, this player often arbitrarily decides not to record sometimes, and it often stops recording regular TV programming (my wife's favorite soap) due to "copyright issues" - completely ridiculous! Now this unit will not output any audio signals at all. Stay away from this piece of garbage. I used to respect Sony quality - I will never buy from them again 
 I can not describe how painful this book was.  The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl.  This book stands out in my memory not just for instilling a loathing of the written word that nearly took my away from literature for the rest of my life, but for the great amount of negative space it left in my brain when I try to recall some of the "excitement" of the drudgery of Silas's everyday life.  Truly a GREAT classic to unload on junior high children 
 I am a British citizen. I have just read this book and it left me stunned. I can only conclude that the author is barking mad and the positive reviews of this book are written by people who were educated in DisneyLand.  If this book made you "feel good" for being a patriotic, right-wing, conservative American then all I can say is: Use the internet to LEARN stuff instead of looking at porn sites. 
 Suitable for making your car windows rattle.  Will flash you back to the mid 90's with funky bass breaks.  A few heart pounders that are fun if you are flying.    Not as heavy as DJ Irene or Bad Boy Bill, not even close to the mastery of Aprhodite. DJ Icey has done better with essential mixes although I'd skip his Disco Rodeo the release party was a BOMB!  
 This griddle performed very poorly and I will not be keeping it.  It cooked very unevenly (the left side of a 4-inch pancake was almost burned, while the right side was practically raw) and the pancakes stuck, even though it is supposed to be preseasoned (it's cast iron) and I heated it first before applying a light coat of vegetable oil.  It also did not sit securely on my gas stove, due to the 'grill' ridges on the other side -- it rocks back and forth slightly--even thought the box says it is suitable for all cooking surfaces except glass.    Because I use my griddle almost every weekend, I am considering the Broil King Ultra Large electric giddle, which got Cook's Illustrated top recommendation in its 2003 tests.    
 THESE SOCKS WERE ORDERED FOR CHRISTMAS ON DEC 9.  THEY WERE INSTOCK AND WERE PROMISED BEFORE CHRISTMAS.  THEY ARRIVED ON JAN 10, AND WERE NOT THE COLOR I ORDERED (MINE WERE RED AND PINK STRIPED LIKE THE PICTURE, THE ONES THEY SENT WERE SOLID RED).

 As a big fan of the Postal Service (their "Give Up" easily makes the cut on my top 10 albums), I had high expectations for this Dntel record, as Jimmy Tamberello is one half of the Postal Service. BIG mistake. Listen to the samples: if you like what you hear, then buy it; if you don't like what you hear, don't make my mistake of thinking that the songs get better beyond the 30 seconds given. Worthwhile songs on this CD: 1)"(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan" (The Postal Service remix is available on iTunes, and is a better version than what's on the CD), sung by Ben Gibbard of Death Cab and Postal Service. 2)"Last Songs" is if anything, relaxing. I recommend getting these two songs on iTunes and leaving it at that, save some money.  The CD's too expensive for two decent songs.  Jimmy Tamberello has another digital project that he works called Figurine and (more recently) James Figurine, it's essentially a catchier, poppier version of Dntel, more in line with Postal Service 
 I came across this book when advising a friend's college-age child who was researching careers and was using this book.  On the plus side, the book does contain info on basic job search skills.  I would say that most (if not all of it) is now widely available via the internet.  Very troubling was the inaccurate guidance regarding specific careers - some of it was just outdated, but some of it was inaccurate to the point of being "dangerous" for a reader with little knowledge or experience, and who would choose to spend time/effort pursuing a career based on the info in this book.  I would have to recommend against using this book as a key source for making a career choice 
 Hardest to understand book on stocks to date for me. Where is my asprin :0 
 For those who grew up watching Gene Kelly's "Singin' in the Rain" and "On the Town," the MGM mishmash of "Anchors Aweigh" (1945) will prove a disappointment. Nevertheless, there are some magical moments. The film's highlight is Gene's breakthrough dance with Jerry the Mouse -- a stunning fusion of animation and live-action. Along the way, Frank Sinatra sings a few memorable numbers amid the Technicolor splendor. However, you must keep your finger on the fast-forward button to encounter these gems. Running 140 minutes, it's obvious that the editor fell asleep at the Moviola. Though directed by the usually reliable George Sidney, one wishes Kelly had more creative control over this unwieldy project. "Anchors Aweigh" should be viewed as a warm-up to the far-superior "On the Town." 
  Author Joshua Harris, who have scored (no pun intended, mind you) a great hit with his first book on the subject of dating called I KISSED DATING GOODBYE, spawned a sequel documenting his courtshipping days with his now found wife called BOY MEETS GIRL. This time Harris had come up with a third installment on the subject of Lust, particularly on the aspect of human sexuality.  Eventually the book just went on as being more of a stuff to only propagate organized churches' ideals rather than to convey to its readers what its premise supposedly have guaranteed: a book to help Christians overcome their problems with sexual temptations - presenting a certain idea of dependence to the common church communities' norms (chapters 8: "Lone Rangers are Dead Rangers") although it did affirmed that the key to total deliverance from sinful problems IS a sturdy connection with God (chapter 3: "You Can't Save Yourself"), which at the same time apparently only show the inconsistencies of what are the currently and commonly accepted prevailing concepts amidst the church circles of our day; along with their popular explanation regarding God's salvation - that runs like a confusing pretzel logic, which only go around in tangled circles, proclaiming that being Salvation is only attainable by Grace, one has no real need to obey God, and yet they would strain a gnat to follow into their church's system, or otherwise condemnation is not too far around to be driveled out into the particular if one wouldn't submit into the dictates of their church's ideals.  Thus, unfortunately this book never delivered; and in the long run, Harris stated it so in the book that he has no solution and there is no secret method at all in overcoming the lust problem.  Harris' book NOT EVEN A HINT live up to its title under the constriction of being a completely impotent material to help anyone who has a great problem with sexual temptations.  And not as to dismiss or belittle every person's own strengths and capacities regarding an individual's own area of weaknesses - I find it crazy on the author's part to have strong sexual problems when it comes to seeing a copy of lingerie catalogues. I mean being that he is a Christian, and married to his wife, which would mean that he loves his wife synonymous to his devotion and commitment with his wife in that respect, presumably - and in being thus out of his respect for his wife - sure enough although its automatic within a male's psyche to have that sexual suggestion in the mind whenever the sight of an `insufficiently' clad woman comes along - he would've not have a problem at all with that and be tempted to indulge in it; or otherwise there is something wrong with his own perspective as a Christian, and for that matter: about his love for his wife and how she really meant to him. 'Cause if one is really in love and needless to say devoted out of that condition to his wife - he wouldn't have the knack to look lustfully at nor desire any other women at all but his very own wife (believe you that!).  Thus at this point, it only gives the idea that Harris should've taken more time in analyzing his own personal condition, and learn more about the topic at hand before coming out with this book on the subject.  The aspect of a person's sexuality is the most private and personal thing that each person possessed. As occultist and book writer Donald Michael Kraig wrote on his book MODERN MAGICK, "Therefore, sex is totally involved in our psyches. Control a person's sex life and ... you control the person." Kraig cites that the matter regarding sexuality is the very aspect wherein those who'd like to manipulate and control its subjects within a group, sect or cult is the very effective means to do so and is indeed used for "brainwashing" methods. It's crazy that in most church communities these days, they even control matters of courtship within their members.  Not for the purpose of trying to peeve away many "christians" that perhaps this little review have done enough already for those who are so Up with Joshua Harris (as he's someone who's in the camp of their church's idealisms) - I think so-called Church of Satan founder Anton LaVae presented a more better idea regarding the method to solve the problem of sexual urges (although I bet that his motives could be moot as far as his sincerity goes, under the context that he's on for the faade of trying to assert an appearance of some idyllic pretense against the Christians, and that it's not for the sake of plain earnestness in itself) - that one could have the means for sexual release or relief, through indulging in sexual fantasies without committing to involve anyone upon it. Such as in example - one would masturbate without fantasizing to involve any real person within those fantasies, but are such that are consisting only of self-created images (kinda like in the movie COOL WORLD) or of a fictionary person visualized for those sex-fantasies. Therefore under that context, not only would the individual be free from the act of fornication but is also not guilty of committing any mental adultery towards another person .  Deliverance from sexual struggles involves one's own personal acceptance, understanding and knowledge about his or her own sexuality.   There are other books and resource materials that are much more helpful than this one by Joshua Harris that are available out there. Hence regarding the topic, NOT EVEN A HINT scores not an inch of any helpful doze for its readers.   Rather, Smooch unnecessary church demands goodbye. 
 It is quite complete. The main issues are all there. And it isn't too difficult to follow. But the structure does wobble a bit. It also fails to galvanize the reader. It is a bit of a sleeper since it just presents one technique after the other. No sparkle, inflection nor much motivation. Right now I'm halfway through (chapter 6) and I will finish it, cause the subject matter is all there. But I wish I had another book to choose from 
 Like so many others, the Fed chairman is a mediocrity who rose to prominence by serving as a flunkey to David Rockefeller through exclusive membership in the J.P. Morgan-Chase billionaire's semi-secret Trilateral Commission.  Greenspan has long deserved to be exposed not for his own evil but for the greater evil that he is covering up.  Unfortunately, Batra's book is so poorly done, that one almost suspects that he was paid by Rockefeller to write it.  The author begins by assuming what he is trying to prove thereby destroying any possibility of being taken seriously as an economist because of his unscientific bias.  In fact, the only thing that can be said in his favor is that he is honest enough not to make any pretense of objectivity.  He tells you right off that this is going to be a hatchet job and immediately gets down to looking for facts to support his allegations.  Instead of talking about Greenspan's relationship to Rockefeller, Batra diverts attention to any problem that exists in the economy and blames it on Greenspan.  This is like a medical book discussing cancer in terms of its symptoms rather than its causes 
 "What a lift?" Not exactly!  I can get away with wearing this without a bra only  when I am looking for the "tied down" look, but maybe that's because I normally wear a D cup.  But I wasn't really looking for a bra substitute.  I bought this looking for (and expecting) a control garment to handle the bumps and rolls that ruin the look when I wear a fine gauge swaeter or twinset.  Not too much to ask, and it would have done the job -- except it rides up something fierce.   I immediately thought this was because the garment ran small, so I bought one a size larger --no luck.  The only way to stop this annoying feature of the undergarment is to tuck it into the waist of a snug fitting skirt or pair of pants, and then not to sit down.  Not so much fun.  Oh well, back to the drawing board 
 I was disappointed with this book.  There were a few worthwile tips (such as going to bed early to take advantage of the more productive morning hours) but mostly the author solved her problems by throwing money at them.  If I could pick anywhere in the country I wanted to live, buy $700 coats and hire people to run all my errands, hey, I'd be organized too!  As for "simplicity"....there is nothing here that anyone with even a passing familiarity with the simplicity movement would recognize 
 How could a great director like Tim Burton take a concept that is slam dunk good and change it so much as to kill it this bad. While it does have some good points most of this mess is just wrong. Allowing the humans to talk makes the hunting of them more cruel than in the first films when men were seen as cattle and pest. Talking humans did in the series and this movie as well. The apes come across as just cruel hunting and killing speaking animals and this sinks this turkey fast. A real let down and waste of tim 
 The most disappointing part of this book is its blatant political slant.  The book is NOT about a theory of leadership, but about an ideological judgement of the performance of leaders.  Heifetz starts by insisting that leadership is necessarily tied to values because if you disagree....then the rest of his book is meaningless.  Heifetz believes that to be a good leader you have to adopt positions that he advocates and if you don't, then you aren't a good leader.  So, in Heifetz's world, Reagan wasn't a good leader, but LBJ was.    Do yourself a favor and keep surfing... 
 Even though I never listened to Ray J's music I always thought he could sing.  When I heard "One Wish" on the radio I liked the song a lot because of the beat and overall sound to it.  When I found out it was Ray J, I was shocked because the vocals sounded kind of horrible.  Very recently he was on that show, "Showtime at the Apollo" and let me tell you it was embarassing.  This boy couldn't sing a lick.  It looked like he was in pain and his voice kept going out.  He was frontin like he was really doing something but you can tell he strains a lot when he sings and I bet the audience noticed it to.  This has got to be one the worst singers in music history.  He makes mediocre singers like Mario and Usher sound good.  I really don't know why he got a record deal with any company because his vocals are bad.  I guess because he's related to Brandy, who can actually sing.  When you have that instant name recognition it usually gets you in the door rather you have talent or not.  Even though I don't own this CD I just had to write a review because his singing is so bad it's hilarious.  His songs sound nice, but it would be a plus if he can actually sing.  So why would anybody waste money on this.  I don't care if the music is nice.  When a bad voice accompanies it, it can be quite annoying and unbearable.   
 My daughter was so excited to use this toy with her friend on the first warm day of spring, but was sorely disappointed.  It took nearly three hours to fill each individual chamber with air, and by the time I was done, her friend had to go home.  If you leave it outside, it gets very grungy and it is a pain to clean all of the grass and dirt and bug carcasses out of the crevices.  And since you can't fit in through a regular door without deflating it a bit, ours wound up mostly outdoors.  Some chambers leaked and went flat.  It was somewhat fun, although I was worried that the kids would roll over too hard and break an arm.  It's hard for the younger kids to push around.  My older daughter did have fun in it during a raging hurricane, sitting inside with a hose running.  Too labor intensive.  Looked like a good idea, but in reality was a pain in the neck 
 Years of trusting Chicago Cutlery went down the drain with this purchase. How the company could risk its reputation for quality by putting out such a poor product is beyond me.   The wood knife holder is fine.  The handles are smooth and well finished. The knife blades are a complete and total disaster.  The so-called "STAINLESS" steel is really a poor quality carbon steel.  I have the distinct feeling that my set was unfinished, as the serrated edges were so rough that slicing meats or even a tomato ended up with a tearing of the food.  I finally used a sharpener to take the unfinished edges down a little.  That worked, but seems dumb that they came out of the factory unfinished. The blades are very heavy whch may seem like a feature, but because the serrations are only on one side, when you try to cut, the angle of the blade edge causes the blade to turn , and prevents even cuts. The worst part, is the rust.  I note that after I bought the item, the term "hand wash" was added to the descriptive copy.  Even hand washing and drying did not prevent rust, and then of course, if the rust is allowed to remain for any time... pitting takes place. My wife bought the set at Christmas from Kmart... supposedly a $59.95 value for $29.95.  Hey... I was happy... a set of Chicago, at a great price.  Not to be... I have thrown away the original box, but don't recall anything on the box or the descriptive card that was included that said the set was imported from China.  Usually, when this is the case, the words "made in China" are imbedded in the blade.  Not so.  The blade has only the embossed "Chicago" brand. I used to work near the Chicago headquarters, and knew some of the workers, who had pride in their product. That was then, this is now...   They say you get what you pay for.  In this case, I must tell you that I bought a similar set for our cabin, with a few less steak knives, but the same basic carving knives... no wood knife holder but a nice wood cutting board.  The set doesn't rust, cuts better, and the best part is that it had a day in, day out price of a flat $8.00.  The stamped brand was "Gourmet Traditions", and the "made in China" stamp WAS on the blade.  We gave our "Classic" set away to Goodwill, with a warning that it wasn't worth more than $5-8.00  "Chicago Cutlery" made an enemy of me...  You can only trade on a magnificent reputation 'til your old customers catch on. 
 I agreed with previous low rating reviewers, while this book is good motivation read it lacks detail on how to find and evaluate good business opportunities. I find it amusing how the Author denounced investment in equities and yet happy to put money in Options. Further, throughout the book (every couple of pages) the author shameless promotes his other books which I found very annoying. The repetitiveness of certain topics (i.e. how trillion was lost during 2000-03) forces me to skip pages of the book 
 Wow! What a treasure trove of ideas and patterns!  You will love this book 
 Reading the reviews of this cd really makes me sad.  People actually listen and defend this trash.  Some of these reviews are unbelievable.  But i guess I'm just a liberal america hating commie.    ...A great American entertainer was silenced by foreigners whose religion attacked this country... [their religion attacked us??, different skin/language doesn't make you a foreigner, racist/xenophobe!]  ...If you feel so compelled to blast music with a social and political agenda, then why don't you do so with music that has lyrics that has been proven to cause youths to commit homicide...... [which music is that again??, if you're worried about homicide maybe you oughta look towards Iraq, nevermind they're just foreigners who cares]  ...by the way, i love the United State 
 I bought this game because it sounded like a lot of fun.  I tried installing it on my Dell laptop and no dice.  It would not run.  I tried installing it on my Dell desktop computer and again, it would not run.  When I went to the knowledge base, technical support lists that if you have an integrated video card, the game will not work on your system.  In short, if you have an "over the counter" system, you cannot run this game on your computer.  I find this ridiculous and disappointing.  I would not suggest buying this game until you go to their technical support page and go over all of the requirements for game play.  Especially since these little facts are not listed on the box 
 not to bash the doc's...but this is the worst ive heard. I bought "Pocket Full of Kryptonite" on a whim, absolutely loved it, and bought this album just 20 minutes ago. simply awful...redundant, whiny, the vocals barely held a note. the only bearable song is sister sysiphus. If you like their sound, get pocket full of kryptonite 
 if your a real skateboarder, you'll hate this film. if you don't skateboard you'll probably hate skateboarders after this film.  truly terrible 'jump-on-the-band-wagon-cos-skatins-cool-for-a-while' tripe.  'Gleaming the Cube' if funnier and its not even trying to be. check that out instead 
 I recently saw Danielle Steel interviewed and was impressed that she had raised 9 children, lost a son to suicide, and did so much humanitarian work.  I'm not a fan of this type of novel but thought I would give it a try since I was so impressed with her in the interview.  There were two things that drove me nuts about this book, the most annoying of which was her repetition of words and phrases, often right on the same page.  "He was going to ask Carole" and then in the next paragraph, "He had decided to ask Carole."  The second most annoying thing was all the cliches.  It isn't often that I roll my eyes while reading a book.  I also think she spends way too much time with her superficial descriptions of places and people and not enough time having them do things.  I like the way other authors develop their characters by showing us how they behave, react and what they say in different situations.  I think having a character kick a dog (3 words) tells you a whole lot more about them than 50 pages of superficial drivel, which this book is full of.  I think Danielle Steel is a remarkable woman, but as an author, at least of this particular book, I don't see the magic or talent I expected from a person who has been called, "the world's most popular author."  447 pages.  Two days.  That's time I could have used elsewhere, feeding the hungry or ministering to the poor or sick.  OK, probably just reading another book 
 I am a big fan of John Bingham, and credit his book "The Courage to Start" as a major inspiration to me to begin running and making it a part of my life.  Even better (if you choose only one of his books) is "No Need for Speed" which covers many of the themes but is a more complete beginner's guide to running. John is a fine writer and motivator especially for those of us who are "at the back of the pack".  That said, I found his training log disappointing. Essentially you have a some running tips from John and Jenny (which are very good, but all are found in his books) and the same single page (the weekly log) copied 52 times and spiral bound.  If this is what you are looking for, it's fine.  I prefer tracking my running and races on an Xcel spreadsheet. Even a regular notebook would do about the same.  The bottom line for me is that if you don't own both of his books, either would be a better purchase. 
 I just did not like this book at all.  Children should not be having parliments.  What foolishness this all was.  All it does is prove the point that children cannot and should not rule.  They are imature!  The ending was bad too.  I hate books with bad endings.  Don't waste your money like I did. 
 If you've read Nicci French, you will recognize the opening hook of this book, only Nicci French did it much better (and with a watermelon!).  Almost everything after that hook (young woman performs heroic deed, is captured in paper, attracts attention of at least one potentially dangerous man) is pretty predictable and disappointing.  I'm not really a thriller snob.  I don't mind a little romance thrown in with my suspense (there's a reason I mentioned Nicci French - I like her!) and I don't need a thriller writer to be Hemingway.  But "Beautiful Lies" just really doesn't work even as an escapist book.  The other reviewer is absolutely right that this book reads sometimes like a Harlequin romance novel. (From about twenty years ago.) Other times, the tone makes attempts at doom and foreboding.  Everything is communicated by an overly familiar, "aren't I cool?" narrator who is not in fact too cool -- her commentary reads kind of like your aunt's idea of "what one of those Sex and the City girls might say."  At no point does she convince me that she actually IS cool.  In fact, despite the overfamiliarity, at no point in this book did I believe it was a real person narrating this story, even though that's obviously the tone the author was going for.  On top of that, the plotting was not surprising or new in any way, and every "twist" in this book was telegraphed from a mile away.    I know I sound harsh, but I'm just disappointed, because I really wanted to like this book.  The writer obviously has talent, and this was a good idea that could have been better developed.  Plus, there are occasional glimpses of interesting, thoughtful writing.  But they're way too few and far between to make the other 90 percent of this book worth reading.   I finished this book with the impression that Unger strayed from the book she wanted to write and ended up trying to write a Nicci French book instead.  I wish this author would write the book I saw occasional glimpses of here, when the narrator knocked off the cutesyness and the book got a little darker and more interesting.  I have a feeling that if she wrote that book, it would be good.  Till then, though, I have to give this book a very disappointed two stars (with an extra star for potential). 
 While I tend to always take the horror movie genre with a grain of salt, this movie kind of irked me. I mean I read how the director/writer of this film is an editor at Cinescape, so I had hoped that the movie would not fall into some of the pitfalls that   most of the recent horror films have fallen into. This is not true, there are pitfalls a plenty in this. There was SO much potential at least I thought, but the movie falls flat rather quick. The pace of the film is very off setting and to be honest I was watching it on Scifi (my local video store doesn't have it), but yet I was kind of losing track of who is who and what they were doing in the haunted aslyum in the first place (example Meg and her brother. I also think the  BIGGEST AAGGGHH moment was when the  friend and the blonde hero girl (see can't remember names cause it was truly eh characters and characterization) were sitting on the lobby and talking, and the girl sees a shadow while the guy is looking at her, and she asks: "Did you see that?". NO HE WAS LOOKING AT YOU! I just honestly thought it could of had been better, although the maggot clown scene was pretty good, it just needed a better film around it 
 I love Catherine Coulter books but this one was disappointing at best. The formula for the book which involves female slavery has been used over and over in historical romances but this plot fails where many others succeed. Mainly because Magnus is such a [jerk] throughout the whole story, he never stops being cruel long enough to make this a good romance novel. If you want a good Coulter book read her bride triology but skip this book 
 Rarely is pretentious drivel so profoundly trite.  Perfectly exemplifies the great post-modern con.  A chaotic assemblage of random terms to which meaning is later ascribed, so much like a certain nostradomus.  There are two principle types of literay work:  1. That which is to be read. and of course  2. That which is to be carted about, the title clearly visible, with a look of supreme smugness upon the owner's face.  Gravity's Rainbow is quite obviously a work of the latter category.  You see, I've come to the think of myself as something of an amateur post-modern poet; here is an example of my work:  Ball, Kite, wolf, sky, space, heart, moon, expand, window, flowing, profound, pompous, gravity's rainbow.  You see i'm quite the literary genius, somebody give me an award!!!  What you fools fail to realize is that the post-modern style is simply a tool enabling those of simple mind to veil their lack of true artistry behind absurdity 
 I was so annoyed by this book, I wanted to send it back.   First, it contains maybe 20 pages of real info, padded out to 450 pages. They do this by putting each day on a separate page, with a two- or three-paragraph "prediction" for each day. They try to fill the rest of each page with typographical devices, an affirmation, etc.   Second, the info that's there is mostly happy talk, platitudes, and exclamation points. They have a "prediction" for every day, even though some days just aren't all that astrologically significant.    I also ordered Levine and Jawer's book, and it's fine. They break it down by sign and give no-nonsense predictions for each month's key days on a two-page spread. They also give an overview of each year and month, by sign 
 I must say you are getting a very good price and these are very comfortable. You also do not notice anything "irregular".  However, I ordered these to use as boxers -- that is to wear them around the house. Not a good plan. These are very thin, plus the fly is very narrow. All in all, not very useful for my intended purpose 
 If you are a flowershop owner and want fresh ideas for your customers this is not the book you are looking for. There are not many greenhouse flowers you commonly find in flowershops. Most are simple, garden flowers 
 This 7th Edition was published in 1999, but a good bit of the material seems to date from an earlier era.  Remarks about 35mm photography, for example, refer to a level of technology that prevailed much longer ago.   The photographs (none in color) are very, very dated in style (were they made in East Germany?), and in fact many of them are held over from the 1st edition (1967).   Worse, the pictures are disturbingly bizarre and creepy.   I ripped page 78 out of the book to avoid having to see it again.  This may the most comprehensive work available on the subject, but let's hope the 8th edition is a thorough revision - and please include a few marvelous color landscapes and fine B&W portraits that are the reasons we love the LF format.... and lose those awful distorted photographs of 1950s mannequins.  Luckily, though, a lot of things about view cameras are the same as they have always been, so the basic content of this book remains altogether usable.  
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but I felt like it put too much pressure on me to pack on the pounds.  I didn't realise so much of the book was focused on diet.  It says you should plan on gaining a pound a week, and the more you gain the healthier your babies will be.  Well the first 13 weeks I managed to gain NOTHING, and I felt horrible about it, but food made me so sick the last thing I could do was eat MORE food to try to gain weight.  The book said that according to my starting weight I should try to gain 50 - 60 pounds during my pregnancy!  I decided to stop reading the book, and so far, just going by what my gut says about what to eat and when, I've managed to put on 20 pounds.  My twins are measuring perfectly and are very healthy.  This book isn't horrible, but I would check it out of a library or borrow it or buy it used, don't spend the $ on a new one... and be prepared to put it down if it doesn't sound right to you 
 I wish some other reviewer or the synopsis had warned me of the narrow and excluding point of view of most of this book. It is no excuse saying the reader is supposed to assume this point of view since this is a book of apologetics, I happen to enjoy C.S.Lewis very much without having to agree with every word of the Bible or all the tenets of a specific branch of a Christian church.  In my opinion this book teaches christians to look down on all other faiths in spite of professing to respect them. 
 The DVD is really a deception. All the experts invited are the ones that support Gnostic theory. I was hoping that I can see a balanced view related to this subject. Instead, I only see the point of view of the pro Dan Brown's experts. I think we should invite the famous evangelists, theologists, and scholars from the protestant, cathodic and liberal to discuss the issue. The DVD does not even discuss why the Gnostic theory was rejected in the first century. 
 This is an interesting book, no doubt about it. But the authors make mistakes common to Southern apologists.   The first is that the Civil War was not fought over slavery. Certainly the Civil War was not fought over the morality of slavery, with the North fighting for right and the South fighting to defend evil. But yes, the Civil War absolutely was fought over the Economics of Slavery. All wars are economic.  Here is a part of Georgia's Declaration of Secession:       For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slaveholding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property, and by the use of their power in the Federal Government have striven to deprive us of an equal enjoyment of the common Territories of the Republic. This hostile policy of our confederates has been pursued with every circumstance of aggravation which could arouse the passions and excite the hatred of our people, and has placed the two sections of the Union for many years past in the condition of virtual civil war.  This is from South Carolina's declaration of secession:  The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution. The States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa, have enacted laws which either nullify the Acts of Congress or render useless any attempt to execute them. In many of these States the fugitive is discharged from service or labor claimed, and in none of them has the State Government complied with the stipulation made in the Constitution. The State of New Jersey, at an early day, passed a law in conformity with her constitutional obligation; but the current of anti-slavery feeling has led her more recently to enact laws which render inoperative the remedies provided by her own law and by the laws of Congress. In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals; and the States of Ohio and Iowa have refused to surrender to justice fugitives charged with murder, and with inciting servile insurrection in the State of Virginia. Thus the constituted compact has been deliberately broken and disregarded by the non-slaveholding States, and the consequence follows that South Carolina is released from her obligation.  This from Texas':  Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them? The controlling majority of the Federal Government, under various pretences and disguises, has so administered the same as to exclude the citizens of the Southern States, unless under odious and unconstitutional restrictions, from all the immense territory owned in common by all the States on the Pacific Ocean, for the avowed purpose of acquiring sufficient power in the common government to use it as a means of destroying the institutions of Texas and her sister slaveholding States.        As for whether the majority of soldiers fighting were fighting for or against slavery, the question is frankly, ridiculous. Ask any veteran of Vietnam or Korea what they fought for. They fought because their country told them to fight. Not because they'd done a personal analysis of the communist threat. But for the COUNTRY, yes communism certainly was at the heart of those wars. 
 I bought this book nearly as soon as it came out, and I absolutely loved it.  The cartoons and the layout of the book are superb. I did not really use the CD's, however, because I was in transition between computers.  It was still nice knowing that there were 60,000 more cartoons waiting for me if ever I wanted to read them, and with the stellar quality of the book, I assumed the same for the CD's.    I was wrong.  The cartoons on the CD's are very low resoluton- this means that the pictures are not clear; they look a little blocky and pixelated.  Also, the large, multi-panel cartoons have been compressed even more so as to fit on to one page.  I was severely disappointed. The captions, however, are very nice.  Too bad it's often difficult to see what they're referring to. I don't really have the complete cartoons of the New Yorker: I've got about half, with the other half illegibly thrown into the mix.    Why then two stars?  It's simple: The book itself is very nice.  With the price lower now, It is a very reasonable price for the Best Cartoons of the New Yorker, which is what this book is without the CD's.  The book is wonderful, just don't be confused into thinking that you will be able to read every cartoon as the book claims 
 That so many people gave this book five stars really concerns me. Luckily, I bought this book used, otherwise I might be kicking myself for paying full price. Between her utterly uninspired "devotional dances" to things such as sex, wisdom, and the "Sticky One" (a term she made up for the astral body), and her constant blabber about masturbation and rubbing your juices all over everything to "anoint" it, I was unimpressed, to say the least. However, driving on a trip a friend and I got a lot of laughs out of flipping through this book. It's very, very amusing if you don't take it seriously. The thing that makes me sad is that she's just using her sexuality to sell a feel good waste of paper with absolutely no depth. There's nothing evolutionary about it, unless you consider being a wanton, idiotic freak "evolutionary". If this is what humanity is evolving into, I am frightend 
 Was excited to have gotten it but have spent a great deal of time fussing with it. Several issues with this pen: 1) Way to many errors, spend a great deal of time correcting errors, 2)Sometimes doesn't want to communicate with my computer(s), spend way too much time getting it to be recognized, 3)On numerous occasions have lost files I've scanned while communicating with my computer, transferring, and have never been able to retrieve them afterwards. This is especially frustrating after reading, and scanning portions of chapters, instead of using highlight pen or jotting notes, 4) Seems software is still living in the old 16-bit world of dos so naming files is limited to 8 characters. When I read chapters for research, I like to be able to name files something other chap1int,and 5) Tech support seems to be a joke, when I've emailed them on several occasions about problems there response has been: never heard of that problem before, reinstall software.  If I had to do over again I think I would have either looked for alternative pen scanner or stuck with the old fashion way 
 Haven't been able to really get into it because the print is so tiny and compacted. The writing is difficult to read. It seems to be biased favoring the English side. 
 The professional design, abundant references, and sober-sounding style of writing in 9/11 Revealed creates the illusion of serious reporting. Unfortunately, the book is anything but that. Rather, it uses an appearance of journalism in order to insert numerous poison pills -- ludicrous ideas whose purpose is to discredit challenges to the official story.   9/11 Revealed includes, in some form, almost every major hoax that has plagued the 9/11 Truth Movement, even the most ridiculous of these: that pods were mounted under the jets that hit the WTC towers.  The hoaxes presented in here have been so thoroughly debunked over and over that I can't imagine why they are included except to intentionally discredit the movement.  Readers who have not researched the attack will also not be aware of the book's critical omissions, such as its avoidance of the direct evidence of controlled demolition of the Twin Towers and WTC Building 7.  Instead of including the strongest evidence for demolitions, already exposed on many 9/11 websites, we get outrageous excuses serving as cover, such as the idea that demolition charges must have been installed in the WTC towers at some point earlier to "prevent a sideways fall onto neighboring Manhattan."  I guess you should check with your building manager if you are in a highrise -- your building may be rigged to explode!  Sad to see the hoaxes packaged in a slick format and mixed with a lot of what appears to be the real evidence, but that's how these things are done.  Thus, while pretending to reveal the crime, this book, instead, serves to subtly reinforce the official story 
 I know that Taiyo Yuden manufactures quality professional blank media but these are from from it. There is no proof on the CD hub that identifies them as Taiyo Yuden. Already I have had 2 out of 10 CDs that did'nt record any data during a live church service although the Tascam pro unit we use showed that recording was in process. Buyers beware!   
 While this offers a wonderful opportunity to hear Buckminster Fuller speak, the recording as a whole is poor quality.  I cannot think Bucky would have approved marketing it in the form it is in. The only value is in the voice of this great thinker who left his imprint on the world.  Ann 
    I have a better title for this album. It should be called "Art of Death". The songs are moody,dark, and just plain boreing. Having said that, I will also say that Sandra has recorded some excellent pop masterpieces throughout the years. All of her  previous albums  contained very melodic,entertaining songs in a kind of europop format. This is her first new album in a while and while she still sounds great vocally, the songs are not very good. 
 It is a fact that the human race originated in Africa. It is also a fact that civilization originated in the Middle East. So what 
 the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book.  the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were.  this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it 
 My reaction to this scrapbook, which I purchased due to an extremely clever Web site promoted on Publishers' Weekly?  It is scandalous that a well-known agent succeeded in marketing a series of images which is little more than an art project and that a major publisher agreed to invest on production costs.  The "story" is a 20-minute read at best.   I imagine someone will soon be turning it into a successful tele-film.  If you like literature, don't waste your time on this so-called journal, a total rip-off which left me wanting my money back 
 I had reservations about it when my small group decided to give this book a whirl, and although I was game and tried to like it, I just couldn't.    Liz's overfamiliar style, her judgemental tone, and pandering to churchy already-good-girls reads like a book that reinforces smugness among the churched.  I especially did not like the way she glossed over the difference in 21st Century standards for women, and instead just judged them against today's free-er women's options and opportunities.  I will say that we had many good conversations because we read the book, but in the end, we were all severely disappointed in the book itself.   Examples of what I mean:  some of the "bad girl" scenarios seemed like she was stretching to fill pages, "bad for a good reason" - what?, or nattering on and on about David's sin with Bathsheba - wait, he's not a girl! 
 I have nothing more to say than I've already said in my headline. Lou Dobbs' book was a big disappointment for me.  
 I bought this set assuming that at the price it would at least contain single-sided discs since it was only half of the season. No such luck, they're dualies. Fox should be ashamed of themselves. Total rip-off 
 THe book tries to say back injuries are stress. I dont think herniated discs or annular tears heal in a couple of weeks. A Social Security Doctor just recommended me to read this. Even though my injures were hernaitons with annual tears. So even though he was aware of my injuries he still must think its stress related . WHAT A JOKE. BOOK STINK 
 Well, I heard the first track on the radio, so, what the heck! Now having listened to it, the stars of track and field, and Judy and her dream of horses, for me, are really the radio-worthy listenable catchy tunes. The stuff in between is, you know, indie-shlock, blah blah twangy nothingness. Though, don't get me wrong, would be very suitable for say, trying to seduce 20 something, depressed, slightly higher than average IQ, lonely, journal keeping, liberal arts degree program dropouts. (note: For Engineering degree dropouts, DEVO Hardcore Vol.2 suits this purpose) Oh, and hey, what's the deal with the singer? He sounds like a disaffected English guy with a cleft palate and a hare lip, who has a predeliction for baby talk. Don't get me wrong though, it really works on those two songs 
 The Hannah Swensen books started off so well, now they are just annoying. Hannah is overbearing, over-critical and plain not likable anymore. This book was sold as a mystery novel when in reality it was a second rate cook book 
 Reading this book is like listening to a speach by Bush.  His position is that "reasonable people" will agree with him, and those who don't either miss the point, are "unpatriotic" to his clearly righteous cause, or are just idiots.  If you are interested in this topic, read the summary of the book and the posted comments.  You'll get a good grounding in both sides of the issue - something that the book itself does not provide. 
 Half of this book is devoted to justifying the decision to have an only child.  If you aren't deeply committed to having had one and that's just how it is, the repetitive superiority argument gets tiresome.  If you do hold deep convictions that this is the right and only decision for you, I doubt that you need this kind of validation... there are bettter arguments than she offers.  Newman spends a lot of time arguing against the myths of how an only child will turn out...selfish, spoiled, dependent, etc.  But the second half of the book, supposedly devoted to the unique issues of parenting an only, droans on about these same issues and paints the picture of the over-zealous pressuring super-mom/dad.  There is very little new or useful information presented, especially if you've ever read, another, better parenting book.  She provides few citations of actual research to back up her assertions and relies simply on naming indiviuals who are onlies or parents of onlies and citing their experiences in support of her "conclusions" it was easy to doubt their authenticity.  By then end of the book she sounded like a park bench parent who assumed her way was the best/only way.  I also found her penchant for bashing the relationships of siblings and parents/children in multi-child families distressing and her arguments quite flawed.  I forced myself to finish this book hoping to come away with some useful information about the truly unique and complex issues that arise with an only child. You need not waste your time doing the same... there is little here other than oversimplified generalitites, unsubstantiated opinions, and streotyping 
 Carly Simon's the only one worth watching on this DVD,but she's only in  the film for 69 seconds,and her only line is "I read that Sh-t you wrote about me."and thats what this movie i 
 As a huge fan of "Chiefs", Stuart Woods first novel, I decided to give Dark Harbor a try.  What I found was a predictable plot, gratuitous sex, and all the marks of a "spit out thinly plotted books" machine.  Stone Barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family's life and left Stone as the executor of his will.  When it is discovered that the cousin worked for the C.I.A., Stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work.  As they investigate and the suspects materialize, the plot grows more and more predictable.  Run from this one 
 This is one of those books that's so bad you can use it to judge critics -- because if *anybody* says it's well written, or well plotted, or has good characterizations, THEY'RE NUTS.  The fact is, there's NO characterization, the sentence constructions are painful, and at least one major plot point is impossible.  (If you're paying even a minimum of attention, you'll put the book down and go, "HUH?")  This book is good for exactly one thing:  it shows you don't have to spend a lot of time writing a book -- or even be a competent writer -- to have a best seller.  I don't mind mindless escapism -- heck, I'll give Janet Evanovitch two thumbs WAY up -- but when it's a trash heap like this it gives reading a bad name 
 We only bought this CD for this very special song.  No Christmas is complete without this song 
 This book, like the Atkins approach in general, has part of the picture, but is certainly incomplete.  Moderation, not virtual elimination, of carbohydrates, when paired with lean protein, plenty of omega 3 (fish and flax oils), and monounsaturated oils (like olive oil), has been shown to be the healthiest diet (a Mediterranian type diet). The Atkins approach does not advocate moderation, instead prefering to vilify an entire necessary macronutrient - carbohydrates!  Certainly the old fashioned 1980's style high carb low fat diets were a disaster, and brought out diabetes in susceptible people - but the answer is balance - good quality, naturally high fiber carbs, paired with protein and healthy fat - not virtual elimination of carbs.  Inadequate carbohydrate intake can lead to fatigue and reluctance to exercise.  Dr. Vernon herself continues to struggle with her weight, despite following the Atkins approach. Most Americans will initially lose weight when starting on Atkins because most eat FAR too many carbs.  But they also eat too much saturated fat (animal and dairy fat, for the most part), which has been show to worsen insulin problems and diabetes, and aggravate cholesterol and artery inflammation, worsening risk of heart disease and stroke.  Atkins addresses one of the these culprits (excess sugar), but not the other (excess saturated fat).  Americans need to cut down on these, and then add more good fats (fish, nuts, olive oil, avacado), lean protein (to cut down on saturated fat), and not be afraid of healthy carbs in the form of whole fruits (not juice), vegetables, and whole grains (not white bread or sugary low fiber cereal).  That, plus watching the calories, and daily exercise (at least 30 " of moderate cardio, five days a week), and diabetes will DRAMATICALLY improve.  Try it and see! Health is not just about weight - its about healthy body fat and muscle ratios, and what is going on inside your body - in your arteries, your brain, etc.  The studies all support healthy balance.   
 This book was chosen by my office reading group.  It was generally felt to be a disappointment.  I for one really liked the writing style and prose but wondered why simpler words were not chosen.  Some felt, too, they required a dictionary by their side.  It was definitely a book one could easily put down.  There wasn't much in the way of character development and the story lacked intrigue.  The ending, too, was a disappointment 
 Nobokov's The Gift is an interesting work. I am unsure whether it is due to the haste with which I read it, or the nature of the book itself, but I found that while some sections were enticing, not only in style, but also in content, entire sections seemed unrelated and uninteresting. I frequently found myself engaged in the action, but often found myself unable to recall what I had just been reading for the previous 40 pages. While I enjoyed many sections, this ebb and flow made it difficult for me to concentrate on the full picture and I sometimes found myself frustrated with reading.  Nabokov's prose however was always beautiful, regardless of my feelings toward the plot elements. Even in those sections entirely devoid of other interest, I always found the prose captivating. Thus there are innumerable quotable passages, each of which glides smoothly across the tongue or through the ear. It is this ability with prose which made the seemingly mundane life of a butterfly collector come alive with the adventurous nature of many heroic explorers. The times where Fyodor recalls his father and his expeditions are undoubtedly my favorite part of the novel, they felt most personal and realistic, while other portions felt dry and rather uninteresting.   I found the first fifty pages especially dry, they read more like a book report or litererary analysis than a novel, continually interspersed with excerpts from his poetry which were then discussed for their merit in capturing or not capturing the desired sentiment. The following story of the boy who died, and the mother eager to speak with Fyodor about it, added interest and a more human aspect. While he seemed cold and removed, it is very easy to associate with his character, while it always feels fulfilling to help another person through difficult times, it often becomes burdensome and even boring when a tape recorder could easily have taken his place.  It is quite possible that a second reading would be beneficial, that it would make many of the connections that I have missed, but for now, I am more inclined to read other works of a less tedious nature.  For me, The Gift is an exercise in How prose means rather than What it means 
 Being a huge fan of Sandra Bullock, I bought this movie thinking it would be fun and cute like her other work. Nope, this movie is garbage. First thing I noticed was that the sound quality is extremely poor which goes along hand in hand with the poor camera angles and shoots. The acting is very bad and the story line is simply ridiculous. Over all, it's not a movie worth buying. 
 This book is remarkable in one way--it accurately represents the fantasies of many a teenage girl.  Yes, Jim really sang to YOU, even encoding special messages in his songs. ("If I WERE to say to you..." in the Ed Sullivan Show is actually a response to Ashcroft's grammar critique, who knew?) Yes, this 20-something man was entralled both intellectually and physically by a nerdy (by her own account) teenager and what he really wanted to do was trade not particularly high brow literary analogies for hours on end.  Yes, you were the only one who truly grasped the meaning of the Doors.  And this goes on for hundreds of pages.  Towards the end, I began to worry seriously about Ashcroft's mental state.   This book adequately represents the fantasy life of the pubescent, but, alas, is no more true than my high school fantasies.  And not only does it have teenager appropriate content, it also has a writing style that could have been lifted verbatim from my overwrought high school diaries.  
 This book is rediculously boring. How a person can actually put their name on a piece of writing that so bad leaves me dumb founded. If anyone can find me anything similar to Cliff's Notes for this book, I'd love you forever, because in 1 month I've read 100 pages, and I'm 1 of those that actually enjoys reading. It had facts, but that's about it. Wow a summer well wasted.. 
 I am bought into the philosophy that the ability to effectively measure operational performance is key to achieving excellence. Unfortunately, this book provides little useful information. This is one of those 'advocacy  supersedes real content' books 
 A good looking, substantial item butI had to return two of these units due to uneven heating. The only KitchenAid product that I've ever had that was sub-par. For this kind of money, they should be first rate and they're not. The company was good about the returns, however 
 I agree, these were not used in the first two seasons for a good reason, they are not that good.  OK, there is maybe one or two slightly funny sketches but it is not worth buying.  I love Charlie Murphy and the Ashy guy and I think they could have done more with these guys to make it funny.  Dave, come back to TV 
 This book was extremely dry. The subjects brought up in the book had no real applications and was only pleasing to those whose fun time is filled with boundry layer equations and diffusion of dilute gases in my butt 
 The funny thing with Camouflage is that, apart from a song or two, they either have great albums or awful albums.   Skip this one and get the compilation 'We Stroke the Flames', their newest 'Relocated', and the excellent 'Bodega Bohemia'.  Thief is a great song though, download it and forget the rest of this boring album 
 Do not purchase this product if you plan to use your play yard with the bassinet. The tent snaps on in the same spot and you can not use both 
 I bought this book looking for some helpful advice for when our first son arrived.  I did not find it with this book.  This book is just a couple's stories about life with their first.  Somewhat interesting but not at all what I was looking for 
 Though the DVD has some really nice extras (interviews, etc.), the restoration leaves a lot to be desired.  Much clarity is lost from the original.  Almost blurry, like multiple images that don't properly align (the actors all have "zombie eyes").  Not really watchable.  Now shopping for the unrestored version 
 Land of Little Interest would be a better title; it looks like even old Cactus Ed didn't read beyond the first chapter.  All the references he makes in his introduction are from the beginning of the book, and he seems to ignore the rest of the book, as I wish I had.  Boring, unless you want to know about what grows next to irrigating ditches.  And I still don't know what the hell a "campoodie" is (a term used over and over), but, who cares 
 Ughh! I was so frustrated with the main character of March in this book that it made it hard to enjoy anything else about it. She was whiny and selfish and abandons all those who truly care about her. It was impossible to have any patience or sympathy for such weak character. You wanted to tell her to grow up and start putting her daughter's needs before her own. Instead, she puts her daughter's life at risk by moving her in with a sociopath. The daughter, Gwen, was very interesting and you felt so sorry for her for having such a terrible mother. I also enjoyed her "love interest", her cousin that lives with Hollis, as well as her relationship with the horse. For me, these were the only redeemable parts of the book 
      Paul Johnson generally gets short shrift and quick dismissal as that most dreaded of ink-stained commentators - the "popular historian." Suffering from two fatal defects - he suffers from having his books actually purchased and read in significant quantity, and unencumbered by footnotes or academic cant - Johnson is, three dozen books or so later, nonplussed, and certainly undeterred. Instead, Johnson soldiers on in his crusade of churning out crisp, readable and even trenchant history. Generally he hits the mark more often than he misses. A HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY, unfortunately, is largely one of the occasional misses, a misfired product of his youth written (1976) in what must be considered one of the most demoralized and cynical decades in Christianity's history. The resulting book is one very much of its day.   How cynical is A HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY? Johnson, in his preface, has the avowed goal of a history of Christianity with "the requisite degree of historical detachment." At no point does Johnson spell out what this degree is or if it is even measurable. Nonetheless, he certainly believed it to be attainable. Johnson, an avowed Catholic, achieves it by a searching and relentless hermeneutic of suspicion towards nearly all comers, but most especially his own church. "Nearly all" - but there are exceptions, for Johnson's narrative leaves no doubt who its heroes are and who resides in the rogue's gallery. And it is in both classifications that the reader gathers a clear sense of Johnson's brand of Christianity - and an uneven (at best) historical detachment. That brand is, inescapably, Erasmian.  In this regard it is worth noting that while Erasmus does not make his appearance until the opening of Chapter 5 ("The Third Force," devoted to the Renaissance and the Reformation), he provides not only only the glue for the entire chapter but the entire work. Johnson's sympathies are not only evident in the disproportionate treatment given to the Dutch humanist - over a dozen continuous pages, to contrast with, say, the two given to Calvin, the few sentences given to Athanasius, Anselm, Aquinas or Zwingli, and the lack of any mention at all of Kierkegaard, Unamuno, or Bunyan - but in the effusive manner in which Erasmian themes come to dominate analyses of crucial episodes throughout Christian history. An Erasmian theology "reduced to the bare minimum" finds little to praise in "the constant and depressing inflation in the vocabulary of invective" (p. 51) of the Church Fathers; the "parasitical" unproductivity of monasticism; the scholasticism, high, midddle or low of the High Middle Ages; the "confident dogmatism" of Calvin and Luther and their successors; but plenty for Pelagius in his doomed battle with Augustine - apparently the chief of Johnson's villains - and John Locke's religious minimalism. Locke and Erasmus, Johnson says, get to "the heart of the problem. What matters is not so much what a man believes as what he does. Christianity is about morals, not dogma" (p.338). From this premise most of Johnson work flows, and only in passing does Johnson hint at the possible vulnerabilities of this approach - Christianity at risk, he faintly concedes, to easily lose its Christian character completely "and topple over into mere deism" (p. 340). Passe Leo Strauss (or at least his popular caricature), Johnson's ideal Christianity is one that makes for well-behaved and productive citizens. "It helps to cage the beast," Johnson avers (p. 517). Which is to say, very Lockean of him.  Such a narrative requires a certain selectivity in treatment, but Johnson's story leaves surprisingly large swaths of Christianity untouched or barely grazed. The virtually nonexistent attention given to Christian history in the developing world is bad enough if tolerable given its marginality to the core of the faith's identity during much of its development. Less escusable is the scanty treatment given to the critical role of the Eastern Churches, which more or less disappear from view even well before the Great Schism. Likewise striking are the large gaps in Protestant history, especially of evangelical movements in the U.S. Johnson's is less a History of Christianity than A History of West European Christianity.   Nevertheless, there are glimmers of the old Johnson fire which no doubt form much of the attraction the book has had over the last three decades. Crackling, even astute observations pepper the work. Not the least of which is the concluding paragraph, which for all its Erasmian language is inescapably skeptical of the alternative: "Certainly, mankind without Christianity conjures up a dismal prospect. The record of mankind *with* Christianity is daunting enough...In the last generation, with public Christianity in headlong retreat, we have caught our first, distant view of a de-Christianized world, and it is not encouraging." While it is likely that A HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY would be a different work if Johnson wrote it today, three decades of de-Christianization in Western Europe have lent an undeniable force to Johnson's observation 
 First off, I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Secondly, I have not actually read the book.  However, I have studied many religions including other Christian religions, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism.  Also I have read the excerpts from this book provided on the main website.  That gave me enough information to know that most of the information is false or has been twisted to provide a pejorative view point on the church.  As far as I can tell the book doesn't mention the fact that the children are being taught strong moral values like honesty and chastity.  These are attributes that seem to be lost in most of the world today.  Now this does not mean that members of the church are perfect and that they don't make mistakes but at least they are trying.  Moreover, there is no sign, in the excerpts, that all of the humanitarian work that the members of the church and the church itself does every year is ever mentioned.  Well of course not we wouldn't dare paint a real picture of the church if it makes it look better than what he may believe it is.    Here is a quote from the excerpts "Over sixty thousand fully-trained, adequately financed and prepared Mormon missionaries are serving in all parts of the United States and in over 124 countries around the world."  I was one of these supposedly "fully-trained" and "adequately financed" and "prepared" missionaries.  I don't know what the author considers "fully-trained" and "prepared" but I know that I would not have considered myself fully-trained.  I served as a missionary in Mexico.  I arrived there after 8 weeks of language and teaching training.  Being a linguist I also know that 8 weeks is hardly enough time to learn a foreign language let alone teaching skills.  And the reason that the missionaries are "adequately financed" is because many of them save up money for years or their parents provide the money for the missionary.  In cases where the family is not able to provide the money for the missionary to serve then members of the local congregation also can choose to help.  So what this really comes down to is if you want to know about any religious group or any other organization why do you go to someone who is obviously biased against it.  For example, when I wanted to know about Catholicism I went to my Catholic friends.  Same thing with Lutherans, Jehovah's Witnesses, Muslims and Jews.  If you want to know the truth about something go to those people that actually know.    If you want to know about Mormonism talk to a Mormon.  You shouldn't feel any pressure to become a member of the church yourself.  But you can learn and decide for yourself if the church is a good thing or a bad thing.  As a final note I know that many people who are not members of the LDS church are happy when their children make friends with kids who are members of the LDS church.  Because more often than not those children have higher moral values than many other kids in this day and time 
 I am having a hard time understanding why people have raved about this book.  I guess everyone is entitled to have loyal fans, but I just don't see what was great, or even good, about this story.  Two teenagers enter a school and end up killing seven people.  They are caught, they confess, and the Grandmother of one of the killers hires Spenser to prove the boy's innocense.  We are given the impression a great mystery, with possible red herrings, is about to entertain us.  Alas, it is not to be.  The kids did it, plain and simple.  Why they did it is so stupid.  The story reads as though a sixth grader has written it.  The plot is lame, and even as lame as it is, it isn't executed well at all.  The characters are boring and 2 dimensional.  The banter which takes place between the main character and others, while it seems to be trying to be witty, is just dumb and unbelievable.  I just can't say enough about how stupid this story is.  There are too many wonderful mystery authors out there writing gripping, intense works of fiction to waste your time on this one.  This is the first novel I have read by this author and will most definitely be my last 
 I continually hear nothing but how great and gifted a musician John was but when I finally hear his music, I wonder what all the talk is about.  Nothing but cacophony here. If you like the sound of several musicians each listening only to his own instrument, then you will like this. Otherwise, you will probably consider this to be pure tripe. I'll stick to more conventional music 
 In all, I think this story could have been written in about ten pages in The New Yorker, or some publication like that. Mr. Sierra simply took too long to get to his point and rambled about topics not relevant to the crux of his book. Because it was originally published in Spanish, part of me wonders how much was lost in the translation. Then again, that would only account for a better read, not a better plot 
 After watching the movie and reading the reviews, I felt compelled to say something. The plot synopsis gives an adequate idea of what the movie is about, but not how it is told-which is dull 
 Covers of old songs that is now way over done. And these are average at best versions. (I really dislike his California Bloodlines 
 Rhino, in the liner notes for this CD, refers to the Gay Purr-ee soundtrack as having been restored from the original Warner master tapes.  What exactly has been restored is open to debate, as the entire album is marred with audible tape hiss and occasional dropouts. If any restoration of these elements took place, it isn't audible in the finished product.   It's still a "must have" for anyone who loves Judy Garland...but with the tiniest bit of effort, this long overdue CD could have been worlds better. As things stand, it's mediocre at best 
 This book was not at all what I expected from Brands, who was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his biography of Benjamin Franklin, First American.  In trying to make an academic biography accessible to the reading public, Brands' writing suffers greatly and becomes far too colloquial.  At one point, when discussing Indian-White relations, he goes so far as to call the whites "Palefaces."  It was a chore to get through, and while it heightened my knowledge of Jackson, nothing was particularly memorable except what I already knew or, perhaps, the actions I disagreed with (his invasion of Florida or his use of martial law after the Battle of New Orleans).  Particularly when discussing Jackson's historically far reaching actions, such as kicking the Cherokees out of Georgia, or his battle with Biddle and eventual destruction of the Bank of the United States, Brands does a deplorable job of explaining what happened.  Elements of background, and why Jackson did whatever it was he did exactly, as the reader will be confused on that point, are conspicuously missing.  I have read similarly poor reviews of another biography by Brands, TR: The Last Romantic, and if First American is at all similar in style, I know why he didn't win that Pulitzer 
 If you MUST read this book, get it at the library. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this boring "To Be Continued" rag. I cared absolutely nothing about the characters. The attacks on the USA, while interesting and plausible were never resolved. When the ending mercifully came you could not imagine the look on my face.. Absolutely dumbfounded that Weber would end it that way.. At least now I know never to take a flyer on him again.. 
 Summary:  Do not read businessThink, unless you want to learn how to write hundreds of pages of common knowledge and hype it as revolutionary thinking. The book does contain useful thoughts but they are definitely not new and are wrapped in disgusting self-propaganda for the businessThink "methodology". The authors do not demonstrate any significant knowledge of business best practices or the relevant literature, consequently the examples used to underline the points are far from enlightening.   Details: Normally I stop reading such books before the end of the introduction, but being on holiday and the weather being rainy, I got as far as the beginning of Chapter 5. Then I decided that businessThink was not even worth the $6 bargain price I paid for it.   I do not expect every business book to contain breakthrough ideas (for instance, I enjoyed reading "Thinking Inside the Box" even if it claimed to contain only the old, commonsense rules of business). However, what Marcum and Smith did in this book; pasting together trite from business literature, calling it "revolutionary" on every second page of the book, lacing it with irrelevant or imprecise examples, and using a conceited and patronizing style in the meantime is way too much for me.   Being mostly a compilation of common business knowledge, businessThink does give you some good general advice, but much better business books exist, with more relevant and practical examples and written by more modest authors.   Let me share with you what I have read in the first four chapters and then you can decide whether you are interested in the rest. (My comments are in parentheses.)  Foreword by Stephen R. Covey: Powerful breakthroughs need a paradigm change, not just a change in attitudes. He believes that businessThink "presents a provocative, principle-centered paradigm shift for rethinking the way we do business". This book is "every person's MBA for the real world". And this goes on for 8 pages... (By the way, if I hear or read "paradigm change" or "paradigm shift" I get immediately suspicious. This is one of the favorite phrases of empty-headed corporate parrots.)  Introduction: Despite of an "innovation explosion" and a confidence among entrepreneurs, most businesses fail. This is because most businesspeople just "do" business and not think about it. (This is the first of many not-so-solid conclusions of the authors. A business can fail for many reasons, inadequate thinking being just one important aspect.)  But do not worry, all you feeble-minded, unable-to-think-coherently businesspeople around the globe, because here we are to help you out with our eight rules that "will be the seeds of a much-needed revolution in business". We offer a complete, fail-proof solution to the "dysfunction of the real business world". Live by these rules and "you will develop a business instinct or seventh sense". If you learn how to think correctly - that is, if you adopt businessThink - then it will be better for both you and for your company. Since you may find this idea difficult to comprehend, let us elaborate the upsides of thinking versus not thinking. (And they actually list the advantages of using your brain at work! This is probably necessary because the moronic reader has not learnt businessThink yet. By the end of the book, he might be able to assemble such a list himself, but for the time being he surely needs instruction by the bright authors on this point.)  Chapter 1: Today thinking is the most important activity of businesses. But most decisions fail, while decision confidence is high. (The authors cite research results, some of them without proper reference.)  Let us see an example of a company making bad decisions - Webvan. (A verbatim quote from Fortune magazine follows, with what I believe to be a rather shallow analysis of Webvan's failure. Surfing on the Net, I found a better article on the topic in 5 minutes. If Marcum and Smith could not come up with an original example, at least they should have chosen their quote wisely.) In today's business white-collar productivity is all-important. Thinking is everybody's job. (I believe, I've also heard this before...) Currently in most businesses "there is no common approach or common criteria for making decisions". But here are the Eight Rules of businessThink listed and shortly explained. Neither EQ, nor IQ is enough for proper application of businessThink, you need a fusion of the two.   Chapters 2 and 3: The first rule is "Check Your Ego at the Door". That is, listen to others, do not be overconfident, show humility etc. (Of course, this rule is only applicable in business decisions but you can forget about it when you write business books - at least that's what Marcum and Smith seem to think...) Some of the revolutionary ideas regarding the first rule include:  - Don't think black and white, but consider other options. - Beware the absolutes like all, never etc. For your convenience, these rules are also demonstrated in business scenarios, comparing the "old school" thinking with businessThink.  (Many of these thoughts are meaningful. The only problem is that the "old school" does not exist. At least I have never read any business book or methodology that would recommend that on a company meeting you should say things like "The idiots. I totally agree with you..." instead of "What kind of information could we get together...?". Of course in practice you will meet stupid reactions, but this is not because of some pervasive "old school". Smart people have avoided thinking black and white for centuries, while dumb people will continue to react stupidly. So it is a ridiculous claim of the authors that businessThink provides the reader with a completely new approach.)  Chapter 4: The second rule is "Create curiosity". Ask questions, refresh your beliefs and forget about hierarchy and titles. (This is of course not bad advice, but the examples cited range from the inaccurate - Grace Murray Hopper inventing the COBOL language - to the unproven in practice - the company IDEO reinventing the shopping cart in a TV show -, indicating a lack of serious knowledge or adequate research by Marcum and Smith on this topic. This shallowness of the authors is also evident from other parts of the book, e.g. in the beginning of Chapter 5 they cite a research result but instead of referencing the original publication they refer to another book. I would expect that if you make an experiment a starting point of a chapter in your book, you would actually read the original report in full, not just some interpretation of it.)  Enough said... If you are really in need all these ideas then I doubt that you will profit from any book, including this one. I give two stars for the glitters of humor and for the honesty of the authors' own failure stories. 
 I just bought this book and am really disappointed.  I had expected something like the reviewers said, "a bible for motorists", "dining options along America's highways and back roads", "regional maps", etc.  I checked out Wisconsin first, because that's where I live and what I know best.  18 places reviewed and 10 of them are in Milwaukee, with 3 more in the 'burbs.  2 in Green Bay, neither of which I would put in a book on great food - 'tis true, Krolls is good, but it's the East side Krolls (different owners, vastly better food), not the West side one, although of course with the West side, you do get to mention Lambeau Field, Green Bay's Mecca.    Racine, Sheboygan and Manitowoc get the other state listings.  Recap:  18 in Wisconsin, 13 of which are in Milwaukee.  Two of the places virtually every Wisconsinite will cite as great food options are Madison and Door County, neither of which get a mention.  OK, maybe I'm being too hard on the authors.  Maybe I should forget about the ethnic smorgasbord in Madison and all the tasty home made ice creams and other places in Door County and just admit Milwaukee has all the great road food - but see folks, the problem is, I wasn't expecting listings like Watts Tea Room or Karl Ratzsch's ($79 Porterhouse for 2).  Guess my roadfood budget is different than others roadfood budget.  So get over Wisconsin.  How about Illinois?  24 listings, guess where 18 are?  Yup, Chicago.  So if you didn't fill up, or shoot your budget in Milwaukee, just drive south an hour or so, and cruise the highways and backroads of the Windy City.  Hey, get out of the Midwest.  Let's go South.  How about Kentucky?  I'm fairly familiar with that state, mmm, not a lot of good food in Kentucky apparently, only 5 listings.  OK, maybe Kentuckians are just bad cooks.  Again, though, the good cooks are clustered together (is it the same air, I wonder?).  3 of the recommended restaurants are in Louisville, 1 in Henderson, 1 in Owensville.  Knoxville?  Uh-uh.  Lexington?  Nope.  As for those "regional maps", don't leave yours at home when you travel.  The maps are regional all right - 5 or so states in a clump and the restaurant cities listed.  So, at the beginning of the Midwest section, you can see the trip to find all this great road food nicely hugs the Lake Michigan shoreline and goes down in a straight line.    All of the chapters I looked at (maybe 1/3 of the book so far) are like that.  It looks like someone took A Trip, from city to city and stopped and investigated some restaurants in those cities.  If you love to travel from big city to big city, eat your heart out while you're there and have money to burn, this is the book for you.  Wanna buy my copy cheap 
 The Gunslinger is the first book in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. It is the story of Roland Deschain's quest to find the man in black, who will lead him to the Dark Tower  On this journey, Roland travels through gritty rundown lands, often times lost in thought, reflecting on his past and all that he has lost. And thus becomes the pattern of the story. Roland travels and thinks and travels some more.  I did enjoy one childhood story in particular. He challenged his teacher and fought with a raven as his weapon. It proved that he was willing to sacrifice others, even a bird in this case, to further his own cause. This is why when we meet a young boy named, Jake, we know his fate is doomed as well.  Jake's story fascinated me. He was in New York City and the man in black ripped him from his world there and dumped him in the middle of the desert in Roland's world. He is a small glimmer of hope to an otherwise jaded story.  I had a hard time reading this book. At first I thought it was because I don't normally like western flavored stories, but my love for movies like Tombstone and shows like Deadwood have proved that's not always the case. It turns out that I just don't like the hero of the tale.  I think Jake was added to show us a softer, caring side of Roland, but it fell short. He knew he'd betray the boy from the beginning and we knew it too. Only, I wanted it to be something big when it happened. The big scene was a big let down. I remember thinking, "Wow, that's it? Please tell me that's not it."  I know heroes are not all supposed to be charmers, and I'm not one to mind if the hero is crass and ruthless. But no matter what, I found that I just didn't care about Roland or his plight or anything in his world. I couldn't attach myself to them.  What I enjoyed most in this book was reading the introduction King wrote since I always love reading when he writes about creating stories in general.  And well that's that. I have the next 4 or 5 books in this series and I haven't yet decided if I will continue it. How can I read more if I don't like the hero, eh

 While I liked the designs in the book and the vibrant colors of the paints.I was disappionted by the fact that when I tryed to move my design from the window it tore.If the window is to cold your design can tear.If the window is hot your design will fade.Also I think the drying time 24 hours might be to long a wait for some kids.Also you have to have a real steady hand 
 i skimmed through the first one -- dated and in places homophobic, so no idea what this one would be like -- the guy sounds like a curmudgeon, albeit a spiritual one 
 An attempt to add glamour to the job of writing code, by someone who clearly read the more popular works of Roger Zelazny at an impressionable age. The good points are nice, nippy action, an interesting blend of computers and magic, and a brave attempt to create a universe with an actual underlying metaphysic. Bad points are the non-existent characterisation (a simple tendency to crack wise is insufficient), the heavy-handed exposition (we know that Eris has a sense of humour, it is adequately shown, it does not need to be explained again in narrative), clunky dialogue, and the heavy miasma of wish-fulfillment that hangs over the book. Unless you are trapped in an airport with nothing else to do,  read "Nine Princes In Amber" instead 
 The Last Samurai is a re-do of the 1990 borefest Dances With Wolves.  Once again, a formerly evil American U.S. Army officer comes to the aid of an indigenous people who are threatened by evil predatory U.S. imperialism.  At least that is what the filmmakers would like you to believe.    Actually, the Japanese samurai were an oppressor class in their own right.  The samurai preyed on the peasants.  Eventually, as reformers took hold in 19th Century Japan, a new national army based on the peasantry was formed.  When the samurai rose in revolt against the reform government and attempted to restore their traditional privileges. the national army defeated them.    The Last Samurai fails as both movie and history.  Avoid it like the plague.   
 I checked this book out from my local library, expecting another great Baldacci read.  After trying my best to slog through the opening chapters, I finally gave up and called it quits.  There was just nothing to grab and hold my attention and there were too many other good titles sitting on the "To Be Read" pile.    I very rarely give up on a book, but I am thankful I did on this one after reading the reviews.  The political agenda in the book that others have discussed frankly would have just ticked me off.  Why do Hollywood types, and now authors, think that they qualify as experts on international affairs?  While I don't think that everything we as a country have done over the years has been right, I absolutely REJECT that there is justification for anyone to mass-murder innocent people.  I am frankly sick of people portraying terrorists as victims, or worse, heroic freedom fighters against the evil capitalist regimes of the world.  I would challenge anyone who feels that this country is so evil that its citizens deserve to be hunted down and killed to MOVE!  Why would you want to live here if American politics and military actions are so repugnant?  Hopefully, Mr. Baldacci and others like him will relocate to sunny Afghanistan or Iran where they can enjoy the company of like-minded people, help bring about Armageddon, and wait for the return of the Twelfth Imam.  If you want to understand the motivation behind some of the terrorists, Google that one and read up, America 
 We've heard these songs a million times b 4...nice...but forgettable 
 The first part of this 1997 edition covers material that is an "old hat". The rest of the topics are unnecessary, badly explained, too superficial, or unfocused. Don't waste your money, and your time 
 Actually Amazonia reads like an extended episode of Jonny Quest, only not as sophisticated. One of the characters (and I use the term loosely) travels with a pet jaguar. The military contingent are equivilent to Star Trek's "red shirts" -- expendable extras who exist only to get killed. In Amazonia, they are killed by giant mutant creatures. The sections involving an obligatory and chiched romance and the author's occasional lectures on the value of the rain forest (spare us, please) are absolutely must-skip reading.  I know it's supposed to be mindless fun, but this is all a little TOO mindless. I'm a big fan of Preston and Child thrillers and this falls far short. 
 Unlike most of the reviewers here, I come from a different starting place. I knew Margaret Murray. She lived to be a hundred years old and died in 1963. It's a shame that she's known mostly now for her books on witches. She was an Egyptologist and did valuable work back in the late 1890's with Sir Matthew Finders Petrie.  This book is not one of her best. She was cantankerous to say the least. She would agree with me, if she were able. Sorry, Margaret.... 
 "In Good Company" goes on and on at the end a little bit, and the ending especially is not fulfilling character/plot-wise.  If it had ended 15-20 minutes before it actually did, I would give it three stars instead of two.  I admit there were quite a few times when I laughed a bit to myself, but it didn't make me fall off the couch or anything. There were other times when I thought the actions of some characters were weird or forced.  Overall it isn't an entirely bad movie, but, like I said, the ending is unfulfilling.  Overall not strong performances coming from Scarlett Johansson or Topher Grace 
 Shallow, off-the-cuff reviews that relate plot and opinion and do little more.  Gifford says he'd intended them to be "impressionistic" writeups, which is fine for his purposes but not very helpful for most others.  In these entries Gifford offers little research or argument to support his views, instead tossing off praises or dismissals without bothering to justify them. The trouble is that this is a book, not a conversation at a coffeeshop, and so there's little chance of understanding why Gifford thinks the way he does.  The result is a book that's more frustrating than illuminating 
 I thought the book was very well written, but that the Morman angle was over the top. There are stereotypes about Mormans that are not true, we GET IT. I skipped over pages of "discussions" on the Morman faith.  If it was not for that theme, I would have reccommended this book to my friends 
 I purchased my gigabeat in febuary 2007. The night after I got it, it stopped being able to charge, and it wouldnt recognize the battery for some reason, but I turned the battery on and off over and over and then it started back up.Three days after I bought it, all the songs magically got removed, vanished. I was a little nervous but put all my songs back on anyway. It was alright during the month of march, with no problems. Then a about a week ago,when i finished syncing some songs to it and pulled out the usb plug, all the songs vanished again. I was annoyed, and put them back on, which took awhile. Then today, the gigabeat stopped recognizing the battery again. I frantically turned the battery on and off. nothing. When i plugged it into the charger, it turned on but then without me doing any thing it turned off. so basically, it won't work when its not in the charger. I know your thinking "oh that couldnt happen to me" but it will. I garuntee that the gigabeat will dissapoint you. Cnet don't know what they're talking about. DO NOT BUY IT! GET THE 80 GIG IPOD!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!! 
 They have made several changes - some good, most bad -  since I bought my last Sony handicam in 8/2003.  First of all, there is no carrying strap.  This is very inconvenient if you plan to use your hand for anything else except for holding your camera.  I managed to jury rig one but it is a royal pain. The docking station is just one more thing to have to carry and when you want to upload your mini cassettes to your computer, you have to take the camera off the docking station to change cassettes. This messes up my editing program.  Fortunately I still have my old camera.  The ability to take still shots is better - more megapixels - but not good enough to zoom in or enlarge.   While I was told most people prefer to use the LED screen (I don't knoiw why as it eats up more power and you can't see clearly in bright sun) I like to use the viewfinder.  It no longer has a tilt up feature so I end up mashing the battery into my cheek.  This last complaint is about the batteries. Sony LIED about the amount of time that a battery will hold.  The 5 hour battery only charges to 194 minutes on my camera. That's slightly more than 3 hours; It is nowhere near 5 hours.  The 7 hour battery does not get anywhere near 7 hours either. Their packages should be accurate.   All in all, It is not as good as the older product.  There also should be a setting to stop it from running if the rec. button is not being pushed.   THIS WILL BE MY LAST SONY UNLESS THEY MAKE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS 
 I'm an avid reader who takes pleasure in spending (too much) money on books.  Catherine Coulter, being that she's one of my favorite authors, takes up a large amount of space in my book cabinet along with Julie Garwood, Tami Hoag, and Patricia Cornwell.  However, I've noticed Ms. Coulter's losing a bit of her pizzaz when it comes to her more recent works.  Before I read this book, although in honesty, I have yet to finish it, I was elated upon seeing that it would soon be in stores.  I went to her website each and every day for the longest time, in hope that she'd post a preview as she always does.  When I read about Ruth's adventure, I was excited and determined to purchase the book with all haste.  Especially after witnessing the panic she was feeling.  However, once I'd begun reading Point Blank, I realized she'd put everything she had into a powerful beginning and not so much into the rising action.  To say in the least, I'm disappointed.  I'm currently stuck, for lack of a better word, on chapter twenty-one because I've been straying from reading this book.  Instead, I've enveloped myself in the wonderfully written novels Julie Garwood has provided.  I hate admitting the fact that although Coulter started out as my favorite author with novels such as The Maze, The Edge, Riptide, Eleventh Hour, Blindside, and Blowout, Julie Garwood is beginning to pull ahead with her brilliant works.    The dialogue in this book is so forced, along with the jokes and relationships.  I took a bit of a peek ahead and witnessed a kiss between Ruth and Dix that was both expected yet unexpected.  You see, he kissed her in a rather awkward moment.  The dog had just wet himself (and her borrowed leather jacket) when Dix decides this is the time to kiss her.  I'm sorry, but who does that?  There was no indication, from what I saw, at that moment to suggest he even desired kissing her.  Yes, it's bound to happen eventually- the two of them realizing they care about each other.  But at such an awkward time?  With no warning or no hint of what he'd been thinking or seeing?  It was certainly a moment I'd like to forget because it's one of the worst moments she's written thus far between two characters.  Yes, the dialogue is indeed forced, as are the relationships, jokes, and laughter.  I don't understand exactly what happened to my favorite author, but I sense this is perhaps a foreshadowing of the worst.  
 I've been a fan of this series for years, but this one was really disappointing. One almost gets the impression that Braun herself has lost interest in the series...(IF she even writes the books anymore!?) Of course, the books have always been slow, but they did have a certain charm to them, making them the perfect bedtime material...but, boy, did I sleep well,when I was reading THIS one.. 
 I was really surprised to see my Singer cheri having written a book about Hegel. Why Hegel? Why the vulgarisation of philosophy? Who is supposed to read it? I did, 'cause I said to myself that this might be a kind of joke, but unfortunatelly it was not. But I will never understand why do we committ this kind of "litterature". Do not judge Singer using this book. He has much more to say 
 The sub-header to this book could very well be: "All Work & no Play makes Jack a Dull Boy".   Basically, Tom Stanley's scholarly treatise on American wealth comes down to this mind-ripping, continent-blasting conclusion:   Millionaires, you see:   1) Save more than they spend;   2) Don't spend anything.   That's it. Page after page, chart after chart, graph after graph, anecdote piling up on anecdote, all of it boiling down to the same conclusion: don't spend more than you save. Clip coupons. Hang on to your wife `til Death you do Part. Buy a rambler for 80 grand, and cling to it like a rat clutching a Big Mac in a hurricane.   To wit: if you're a good little Bob Cratchit, and burrow down in your suburban Dacha, drive the Civic, eat Top Ramen, and take your vacations at the State Museum of Knitting & the Fine Arts, you'll die loaded!Sound like fun?   Didn't think so. Look: you've got one life, and after death all bets are off. Sure, you could be hauled up by the angels to Paradise, or it could just be one plate of linguini too many, a nasty flatline and one vast inky void of non-consciousness. Either way, you're looking at one single trip on this not-so-flat Earth, so you might as well live large.   It's true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose: eremetic horror-writer, Wall Street tycoon, Railroad baron, small-town librarian, legal eagle defender of the Criminally Insane, whatever. And you can always outspend it. That is the source of endless tragedy and Dickensian woe throughout the ages, without a doubt.  But there pitfalls at the other extreme. Listen: I live next door to one of these McMillionaires. The guy is this enfeebled little wizened gnome of a critter, used to be a bank Vice President and got bought out because he was a dingus. Total skinflint. Miser. Goes on his own hunting trips and brings back venison, deer meat, which he forces his family of---jesus, I think 12---to eat for months. Lives in a shacky little rambler, buys used Crown Vics from the local police department and bargain basement prices.   The guy, no doubt, is high net worth. But he's also a loser.   This is a guy who didn't want to cough up a few hundred bucks to help build a joint fence between our properties---so there's a fence, even a fence that abuts his property---but beyond my house and demesne, he elected not to build a fence. Instead, he got a plastic Jersey Barricade (orange and white) and went with that. Is that any way to live? Is that really what it means to be a `millionaire'?  I think not. Half the glory of the Age of Great American Consumption is buying stuff you don't need, but want. Desire. Demand. What else is work for?  Find a way to creative bliss, work at something you're good at, that you have a real passion for, and the money will follow.   But for the Love of God, it's only Money: spend it! What is money for, if not to indulge yourself?   Sure, get a pace---plan to the end---set a budget. But how many of you want to be that newspaper column on page A3, the 95 year old dowager pauper who begged for alms on the streetcorner, ate catfood out of a tin, and scrounged for quarters by the bus stop, then was found rigid and cold in the urine-stiff sheets of her dirty bed, sprawled atop a fortune estimated at 20 million bucks? Sound like a plan? I think not. Money may not buy happiness, but it sure as hell can get you a Rolls-Royce Phantom.   "Millionaire Next Door" might have it right in its sociology---and for what it is, Stanley's thesis is meticulously researched, mustered like a well-trained army, and capable of marshalling its teeming forest of facts like a well-drilled martinet---but it's off the map when it comes down to the point of the whole thing: if you've got it, flaunt it.   "Millionaire Next Door" isn't a bad book: it's scholarly, and plods along its own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap! Die loaded!), and perhaps some folks will be astounded to discover there are some real richies down the block who in another day would have been called skinflints.   But as a map to your stars, this one is a little cramped, cribbed, dank, and stinks of mothballs. I think I'll take first class---scratch that, how much did you say that Learjet was going for, again?   JS 
 I was looking for the instrumental version of Tim McGraw's song for a project I was working on and purchased the CD just for the song... It wasn't there.  Not very happy 
 this movie was kinda boring. Not enough of Cross' standup. Also when there was footage of his stand up, it wasnt that funny 
 I bought this book with great hopes, the extended family aspects of Buffy being one of my favorite topics. First, and foremost it is outrageously priced at $32.00. $3.20 would have been more appropriate.  I'm just grateful I bought a used half-priced copy.  The text reads more like a doctoral thesis than most of its predecessors and is much the worse for it.  If you can wade through descriptions of Buffy episodes as, "They are visual representations, whose imagery is double-coded with semantic "values" that often conflict, or even negate each other," and other comments like, "I mentioned a Deluzian family-rhizome in the introduction, but that's absurdly abstract," then you'll probably love this book. Anyone else will be much better served  checking out Reading the Slayer or Why Buffy Matters. Nothing really new is said here, but writing it in acadamian just makes it seem new and important.  I give this book 5 yawns and a 10 on the waste of money scale 
 How could the author of so great a book as "The Company" draft such a mediocre cliche-ridden effort as this.  One reason, I submit, is that he couldn't make up his mind if he wanted to write a historical novel or a spy novel.  He had a similar dilemma in "An Agent in Place" where he couldn't decide whether he wanted to write a love story or a spy story.  "The Company" was a whole dimension above most spy novels.  "The Once and Future Spy," sadly, is simply a uninspired work. The plot was highly improbable, the characters lacked credibility, and Littell resorted to too many cheap plot tricks to speed the book along, at the cost of believeability.  Even the whole theme of "whose truth?" also is not all that unique.  Don't want to give the ending away so I won't say any more about that except that, personally, I found the ending to be highly unsatisfying. I still have a few more Littell books to read and I am hoping that I will get from them the deep pleasure I got from "The Company."  Littell's capable of much much better work than reflected in this novel.   
 I liked most of Cook's books. This one I skipped to the last pages having waded through 3/4 of it. I think there MUST be a way of getting a novel along other than the "I am a maverick doctor/lawyer/cop/engineer that will investigate this case to the end even if my bosses tell me it is closed because I am so emotionally involved with every single case that I cannot rest till I see it closed as I think it should". Then this guy JUST happens to be told about rats dying. And he JUST happens to get another case of the same type. And then (and this is simply so incredible that it is funny) he has this girl he is totally hot for in a romantic dinner together and they start talking about anthrax and botulism cases and then they go together to his house to...nononoo sorry, they both go off together (after desert of course) to talk to the husband of one of the victims to tell him to be careful with botulism!!! At night!!! In a loaned car!!! I mean, one cannot trust the agencies with that, no? And who can think about s*x when one is worried about botulism? Of course the husband is the russian bad guy. Add so many cliches about white trash and hip minorities you could sink a battleship, and you have this novel. Forget it. Read "Coma" instead, this book could induce you to a coma 
 This is truly a strange book.  I'm not going to argue about definitions of the Enlightenment.  As long as the term is used to refer to rationalism in one's approach to questions of science and society as well as some sort of political liberalism, I'll accept it.  And Bronner surely treats the Enlightenment in such a manner.  The author starts by explaining that both those on the political right and those on the political left have been attacking Enlightenment values.  He says that "human rights is often used as an ideological excuse for the exercise of arbitrary power."  I agree.    He also points out some traditional conservative arguments against the Enlightenment: its supposed nihilism and its "assault on communal life, religious faith, social privilege, and traditional authority."  As a supporter of the Enlightenment, I'm proud to oppose religious tyranny and social inequity.  And I think this book tends to support such a position.  I think that opposition to rationalism, such as what we might find in the misleading arguments of the Creationists, is a good example of anti-Enlightenment attitudes.  Bronner does not bring this up (although I have no reason to think he would disagree with me on this), but instead delves into opposition to social justice.    There is an interesting question here: what do racism, anti-Semitism, chauvinism, and other forms of illiberal oppression have to do with the Enlightenment?  Bronner identifies all this as part of the Counter-Enlightenment, and I agree.  But I also feel that there is a strong anti-rational attitude of some of the oppressors which one can see clearly in their responses to any challenges of their biases.  Bronner does point out that National Socialism in Germany succeeded in part because of its popularity in universities there.  And that various intellectuals did offer their support to some very oppressive leaders.  I think he then makes the same mistake.  Given the author's concern about anti-Semitism, I'm not surprised that he comes up with this: "a half-wit prime minister of Malaysia, who opposes the introduction of democracy into the non-western world, rants about the power of world Jewry."  But I am surprised at the following: "Outside of the Middle East, where hatred of Jews is fueled by the imperialist policies of the Israeli state, anti-Semitism has become detached from any party or mass movement genuinely competing for political power."    I suggest that he look at the politics in, say, the UN General Assembly.  And more important, why is he appearing to stipulate to a wild accusation against the Jews by calling Arab demands to obliterate human rights for Jews a mere reaction to Israeli policies?   His praise of Noam Chomsky and Ed Said, with no mention of their antirational and arbitrary opposition to Israel, appears to fit right in with this very anti-Enlightenment view.  Bronner encourages us not to discard the contributions of various Enlightenment intellectuals merely on the grounds that they sometimes had some reactionary social views.  But I'm not so sure I want to offer him the same charity.  Given his concern about anti-Semitism, he ought to be very wary of supporting this sort of antirational and antisocial behavior.    I think this is no small error on Bronner's part.  Those who read his more recent book, "Blood in the Sand," may discover why I consider it to be an anti-Enlightenment work.  If the problem were merely a rational belief in excessive rights of the Majority, I would at least understand how this could be reasonably consistent with Enlightenment views in some other areas.  But I think the problem is deeper than that, and that Bronner has no use for rationalism when he discusses Israel.  In any case, I feel that two stars is plenty for what is otherwise a very interesting study. 
 this is a crappy album. so why do they keep on making this if only two people buy these albums in five years, anyone who likes this crap is retarted. dont buy it and buy cds from the actual singers and buy this to use as a coaster, a dog bag, toilet paper, a tissue, a toilet, a target to shoot at because you wont like this beacause the kids are just screaming "YO!" and its a rip off for 10 buck 
 In the preface of his book, Kousoulas states "the traditional approach to writing history and biography is to tell about what happened, rather than to describe what actually did happen, as a novelist might-in effect to tell a story. Moving away from the traditionalist approach in order "to tell a story" has been my guiding principle." This is the main problem with Kousoulas' book.   I suppose the book is accessible to the masses (no footnotes or endnotes), but if you are actually interested in history and don't mind scholarly works, this is probably not the book for you. At times, Kousoulas' writing style had me cringing. By trying to tell Constantine's story as if he were writing a novel, Kousoulas runs into many problems. He tells us what Constantine did, but I felt like he never offered enough explanation as to why. He seems to take many of Constantine's decisions for granted, including his decision to promote Christianity. When I finished the book, I felt that I knew about Kousoulas' character of Constantine, but I wouldn't feel comfortable discussing the actual, historical Constantine with someone who knew something about him.   Kousoulas also deals with the problems in the church that were emerging at this time, but once again, it is a very vapid treatment. He tells about the arguments between the Arians and the Orthodox, but he never goes into what the importance of these arguments was on the larger scale.   Also, I wish he had provided a better conclusion. He goes up to Constantine's death and then ends after providing a brief sketch of what his sons did. It would have been nice if he had provided a final analysis of Constantine and his achievements.  I'm not saying this is a terrible book; I only gave it one star because I wanted to drop its perfect 5 star score. However, I would be careful about drawing conclusions on Constantine and Christianity from this book. It is far from objective and it really only deals with the surface issues. Seeing as how this is one of the only recent pieces of biography on Constantine, it is a shame that Kousoulas did not want to produce a more scholarly work 
 It seems as if authors and publishers have decided to sell something that is marginal at best, just include the words Power,Prestige, wealth all seemingly offering some simple strategy to imporove and empower your life, Power talk fails to live up to its title. It is a ok book on how we talk and what the 2 distinct communication styles are all about. But it doesnt take a 200 page book to tell us that the key is to merge the two? This book is geared towards salespeople and corporate executives, if you work for a firm of 20 or less this probably won't help much. The key to success is adaptation to the enviroment your in rather than discuss key words or stratagies for enhancing vocabulary, structure , etiquitte this book just rehashes the adaptation philosophy. Probably great for some but the majority will just be wasting their time with this title 
 It's NOT a good read about the WM3 case.Many mall-drifters would probably approve of this book.The title is lurid,and adds to the hype surrounding the horrorific crimes.Mostly the underbelly of Hollywood declares the innocence of the WM3.And even when i first heard about the WM3 situation,i thought it was a blatant case of 'Satanic- Panic' and that all three were probably 'innocent'.Well,after reviewing the full story and motives of all parties involved,it's clear that Damian Echols is guilty.My theory-Echols was a Xanax-dope buyer from John Mark Byers.Both knew of each other.The truck-car wash was the dope-cove for buying and dealing.MissKelley and Baldwynn were just hapless followers of Echols,and got sucked down the satanic-toilet vortex with Echols.Echols may have been involved in a 'drug-burn' with Byers.Or Echols performed 'sex-acts' with John Mark Byers.Or simply both .How could JM Byers hold down the three victims and emasculate his own step-son?How could Byers direct and watch the WM3 kill these boys,so cruelly,and remain passive?Did Byers exchange Xanax for services rendered? If solo,did Byers then calmly drive to Echols' family property,and throw the murder-weapon knife ,in the adjoining lake,without being noticed?And why would the evasive Echols draw satanic-pentagrams ,in his holding cell,in full-view of the police-guards?I would read the court transcripts for the most accurate view of Echols' feelings.He was defensive,evasive and protective about his satanic-gothic beliefs.Echols had a novice layman's education about the 'earth-religions',and was heavily influenced by the Hollywood grist-mill.So why doesn't Byers go into detail about Echols,being the main murderer?Would this not expose a drug-dealing link to Echols.Why would Byers want to befriend the three small-town outcasts,like the WM3?If anything good comes from this WM3 case,it is that the practioners of the Occult,must always use their skills for the benefit of all mankind.When an occultist uses the Wicca-craft for evil-doings,it will attack back at them ,three-fold. I think once Byers and Echols expire,then the long-sought truth will finally be elucidated from the murky darkness. Update:Nov.4.06.-I talked with a gal(a Theatre major) who was aquaited with the drug,Xanax.She informed me that large-doses of Xanax will make anyone hallucinate and raise unsettled feelings from within.The user will forget what they had done ,when affects have worn-off.So,i came to the conclusion that ,it's possible that the WM3,just don't remember any of their deeds, because of the large quanties of grounded-up Xanax they had consumed.Just like an Aztec shaman consuming a fermented agave drink to loosen them up before the temple sacrifice.           
  Imagine your proudest moment, your claim to fame, your greatest accomplishment and personal glory rejected and censored almost immediately after achieved.  Author Linda Lawrence Hunt revives the almost forgotten story of an amazing female immigrant living in western America in 1896 in her book, Bold Spirit. Life before the Norwegian immigrant Helga Estby's greatest victory was noteworthy enough as she battled the restrictions on women defined by society in Victorian America and the hardships and expenses of the struggling prairie life.  Enticed by a $10,000 dollar reward, Helga boldly accepted a challenge to walk across America. 	When Hunt, an English professor from Spokane, Washington, stumbled across this vague but intriguing story through a student's essay, she felt she had to honor its significance to a greater potential. She could not pass up an opportunity to explain the gravity of Helga's journey across fourteen states on foot with only $5, few possessions, her daughter as a companion, and determination to battle fears, fatigue, and danger.  Hunt's curiosity about this amazing woman led her to research endlessly through newspapers, periodicals, maps, museums, and witnesses' stories to recount the courageous journey that had been censored for so long.  With no journals, diaries, or personal documentation of the experience and very few corresponding letters with the family, Hunt uses only fact-based and historically accounted information to retrace the journey from a third-person point of view.  However, the facts prove insufficient in portraying Helga's true inner struggle.  	The geographical and historical research of the retold story is evident in every page of Hunt's work.  However, the constant factual repudiation of the cities, locales, mountain ranges, rivers, and coal mines that Helga and her daughter Clara encountered are often distracting from the purpose of the novel.  The abundance of facts, becoming monotonous at times, occasionally seems as though they are meant to divert the attention from the multitudes of unknowns that encompass the Estbys' journey.  Understanding the difficulty in comprehending the route taken by the two Estbys, Hunt assists readers with maps and pictures throughout the book that are very helpful.   Nonetheless, the fact-driven book is so impersonal that it's comparable to a history book. 	The lack of journals, personal entries, and letters to the family make it difficult to fully connect with the protagonist.  Her obvious hardships on the farm and on the road can be assumed, but the reader never really gets a glance at the genuine thoughts or emotions that occupied Helga's heart and mind.  Because any indication of fears or fatigue were recorded through news reports and articles keeping track of the journey, the book only offers insight to the background of the story, not to the emotions and thoughts of Helga.  The amazing story of Helga Estby's journey would be more powerful and effective told through historical fiction allowing Helga to have a sense of personality and capturing her inner conflicts.   	Hunt recognizes and clearly emphasizes the extremity of a Victorian woman's trek across the country.  Lacking personality, her book nonetheless reinforces the respect felt for this courageous person and captures the significance of a woman risking her honor, her health and ultimately her life to save the family farm.  The perfectly chosen title reflects the only way to describe Helga Estby: a bold spirit.  
 Good first attempt at the task. The second generation model, CTZ900 Telezapper II uses the THREE tones necessary to remove your number from all of the current computer lists 
 I had been hearing about Thomas McGuane for what felt like decades.  Finally, a few days ago, I got the chance to read one of his books.  The female characters were compelling, but the male characters were caricatures, which surprised me.  There were only three types: the stoic, laconic "heroic" cowboy; the small-time hood; and the put-upon husband.  The long passages displaying the author's familiarity with cowboy lore were VERY lazy writing-- and dull, dull, dull.  There was some attempt at elegy.. 
 I haven't read any of Shirley's works till this one.  I really enjoy her movies.  I love dogs so I thought I would try to read this book.  I found this book to be very lacking in dog understanding.  So maybe she wasn't professing to really understand dogs and was just using them as a tool to convey some type of message.  But if this was the case I found the tool/message lacking and not worth the money 
 This book would be a good reference for high school aged young women and men who are trying to consider what career to go into.  As for an adult who wants to know other career options available in the beauty or fashion industry, outside of "wig stylist", "manicurist" or "shampoo girl" this book is not for you.    I was expecting more of an inside view of various careers in the beauty and fashion industry.  Careers outside of the norm, like maybe "Jewelry Buyer", "Fashion Consultant" or something.  This book was really of no help to me at all.   
 The title promises much. One had hoped that with so few pages a concise outline would be the product. Alas no. One has 95 pages of vaguery, allusion to supposed meaningful research which is never explained, and trite examinations of the substantial observations that have been borowed from other authors. His reference to the power law does not result in anything applicable to understanding the Web. His reference "tragedy of the commons" a la Peter Senge, suggests he undestands neither the metaphor nor its relationship to the Web or the information that exists there. Unfortunately this takes up one of the five pages of anything containing potential substance. The discussion of nodes begins vaguely and ends with no law. Another page down. The power law suggests an upper level of tolerance, but in its lack of conclusion loses another page. Social dilemma leaves the reader with the abiding question: So? With the final page ostensibly dealing with a critical number of clicks the reader is left to infer that reading this book is too many clicks (pages turned) and with the end we are left with no code, no guidelines, no greater understanding of the growth of the Web, and appreciation that while the reader is left no wiser, at least the book was short. There is great pretension here, but no delivery 
 I purchased this book at the Duke University bookstore, after the recommendation from a professor at another institution.    Petroski's prose is extremely dense and verbose.  His style consists of run-on sentences which require several readings.  Even if it is technically (grammatically) correct, it is extremely difficult to read.  The subject matter is dry to begin with, however, Petroski does nothing to liven it.  I am an engineer also, and am not threatened by the technical information (admittedly lifted from his students' term papers).  I have chemical engineering textbooks that read like a novel.  Hopefully the courses he teaches are clearer than this muddled prose.    Petroski is certainly an engineer.  He has engineered an elegant method of making money from saps like us.  I successfully engineered Petroski's book into a beverage coaster to help drown the sorrows of wasting $14 on this book.  
 I learned to make cheese with this book, so it couldn't be all bad, but I found myself going to the internet to check out proportions that looked wrong, going to another recipe in the book when the one I was using said, "Add salt," but there had been no salt in the ingredients list (I assumed that I could use the amount listed in another 2-gallon recipe), and making Muenster with no starter culture since it was not listed in the ingredients or referred to in the process description.  I got cheese, but it sure wasn't like any other Meunster I ever ate.  Wasn't too good, and an experienced cheese maker told me you have to use a starter culture in Meunster.  The book gave equivalents in some recipes (rennet tablets vs. liquid rennet / powdered starter cultures vs. fresh cultures), in others it gave only one and in some it didn't tell you which it was listing.  If anyone made the Colby first and put in three ounces of powdered starter culture, you would have an expensive cheese to say the least.  Also, I checked with my supplier and found out the 1/2 tsp. mesophilic starter culture the author lists in two-gallon recipes was twice what is necessary, which cranks up the cost a good bit.  But now I know and I'm buying only half as much starter culture.  I am puzzled when I read these good reviews.  Did they just do a batch of chevre or cottage cheese and call it quits?  If you follow these recipes exactly, you will have many failures 
 I like Ogilvy's premise that we should stop striving toward a distant Goal and be more artful about the small details of living. Unfortunately, though, most of the book goes off the deep end into unreadable  philosophical abstractions ("Narcissism Degree Zero,"  "Semiotics and Sublimation"). Most readable are the stories about  real lives -- the author's, Howard Hughes's, Lila's, Spike's. If you're  interested in this topic, your time is better spent reading Julia Cameron's  THE ARTIST'S WAY or Thomas More's THE SOUL OF SEX 
 In the search and title it says Human Physiology: From cell to systems by Sherwood. It is not this is an study guide to accompany the textbook. Also when are reciever in the front page say clearly textbook not included. The name of this is Cram101 Textbook Outlines. I am very dissapointed because now I have to return this wait for my money back in the meanwhile order the texctbook elsewhere 
 While the book contains tried-and-true tactics that will always work, it is outdated and not thorough enough.  No mention, for example, on dropshot, splitshot, or swimbait techniques.  Very brief mention of casting techniques, and nothing about pitching.  All of the B&W photos look like the fishermen were going to a screening of "Saturday Night Fever" once they got off the lake.  The book was "updated" by Mark Hicks, who never hesitates to include photos and stories of himself, a no-no in the unwritten rules of authors.  I should have spent my money on Roland Martin's or Van Dam's books.  
 This book has a nice warm writing style, which means it is an easy read for the most part.  But, that being said, most of it is not really about the writer's search for Nefertiti and is, instead, about her own life and how she became an Egyptologist.  There are some nice pictures and illustrations included, but generally I wouldn't recommend it if you are actually interested in seeing some proof that the mummy discovered is the long lost Queen Nefertiti.  For one thing, the author contradicts herself on more than one occasion when it comes to her supposed "proof," and it is clear she had already made up her mind who the mummy was long before she ever even saw it.  As a fun read about how this woman got into her chosen career it's a good book, but otherwise rather lacking on both science and logic and has an obvious bias and agenda.  The actual chapters about researching the mummy in question takes up very little of the book and you just as easily watch the DVD that the Discovery Channel did with her on the same subject.          
 The book does a good job in illustrating why the little things we do is important in creating return sales but it does not dive into the world of industrial sales.  The customer of this book is most often the retail consumer.  The world of customer loyalty in industrial relationships is motivated by different needs and not addressed by this book 
 I thought this was very cute and my daughter loved playing with it.  Then, when she was in her carseat she threw up, which is very unusual for her. Then I figured out what happened:  Right after, I noticed that she was sticking the keys all the way into her throat.  I'm sure she gagged on it and that is why she threw up.  I now let her play with it a little, but only if I am watching her closely to make sure she doesn't do that.  I wouldn't recommend it. 
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 This blender has been emitting a motor-burning smell since the day I got it. I thought it would go away, but it has only gotten worse. Definitely does not do what it says it does, all speeds perform the same. What a waste of money! 
 This book is not worth the paper it is written on.  It is disgusting in every way.  It is a negative 5 stars.  The frequent use of inappropriate language clearly identifies the author's lacks of vocabulary 
 this has got to be the WORST film I've ever seen. its not sad. Its not funny, jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage. I don't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie, because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him. the actor is the worst of all. i cant tell if he's sad in some seens, or angry or jest retarded. I've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks, I guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present. it probably worked better back in 96'. but this movie is SO SO SO BAD. its embarrassing. do not rent it or buy it or view it on television. NOTE'S: THIS FILM HAD  SOME GREAT TALENT A song from Olivia Newton Jon, and (one of my most personal favorites) Mila AND my favorite comedians Margaret Cho. She's to good but...why this film, she (and Mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this.      
 A very bizarre, artsy Swedish film. It is more visually driven than plot driven. I could not make it past the 30 minute mark. I gather that the point has something to do with things in life being confusing and a sense of dissatisfaction with the way life goes, a lack of connections with things that are important, for example. It could technically be interpreted to mean many things to many different people, which is the one really beautiful thing about this loosely organized film. 
 This was NOT a good book, unless you are of a highly advanced level in model railroading. All the "layouts" were poor paintings, which you couldn't envision easily at all. This was not a good book 
 The VHS took quite a while to arrive. I had ordered 5 other items at the same time and it arrived almost 3 weeks later than all the others, I actually had given up on it's showing up.  The video itself rolls quite a bit at the end of the video when played. However, with the age of the movie, I will grant them some slack.  I was disappointed in service and the product.  I will not buy another movie from this seller 
 I got two pairs of these for my kids and they could hardly walk after wearing these.  Unless the bottom of your feet are tough I would not get these 
 Unfortunately, Blum's work was my first exposure to the Runes. That was several years ago.  Now I have taken up studying Asatru, and am finding that this is the path for me.  It is too bad that many will be exposed to this work, it is full of references to Jesus Christ and Buddha, each of whom have absolutely NOTHING to do with the Odinnic ways or Runecasting. Many would find it offensive to see Teutonic Runes etched onto a crucifix; i feel the same way whenever i see an image of the crucified Christ superimposed on Thor's Hammer. I would give this book Zero stars if allowed. DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE SEEKING AUTHENTICITY! Seek out the many works of Edred Thorsson instead 
 I'm going to catch flak for this, if only because looking at others' reviews I realized that this is the lowest the book has gotten.  This is mainly because the people who read it are a self-selected group, and so they like it, unless they're from Montana, in which case they like it but call it too one-dimensional.  The major problem with this book is that it takes a single theme and doesn't go anywhere with it.  There is no progression or movement in its somewhat flimsy premise. To quote the opinion of a man I respect: "The book is in bits and pieces--some of these bits and pieces are good, others are just...bits and pieces.  It feels all of her friends told her to write this book, she wrote some bits, showed them around, had somebody read and like them, and then a publisher gave her a check and said 'finish the book'."    The insight provided by this book is debatable, given that she approaches the reality of Wyoming with a desire to reshape this in literary form to fit her notions of theme.  There is some good imagery.  There is also some wasted space, some disjointed incompleteness, and a sense that the book, as thin as it is, is itself wasting space by refusing to allow for more complex and varied explorations 
 This product will not program any TV or cable box in the house. I have been using universal remotes for many years, so I know what I'm doing. Beware 
 These recipes are boring hardly professional. The author had a cooking school in her home...c'mon??? That is exactly what the recipes look like.  There are no secrets in cooking, just good techniques and procedures. There are too many organizations out there like the International Association of Cooking Professionals that give awards to their members for marketing purposes...friends supporting friends.  Terrible book...and that is no secret 
 This was Heinlein's 1st novel; it wasn't published during his lifetime.  He wrote it prior to WWII.  It's emphasis is on his depression-era socio-political views, not on science fiction entertainment.  Thus, the plot is thin & the characters, though likable, aren't deeply drawn.  To his credit, he changed many of his views later--as many were rather naive &, perhaps, influenced by his frustration.  Some of his libertarian social innovations, however, were courageous & innovative, but would require considerable cultural development to become politically practical in the US.  But many (IMHO boring) pages are devoted to his economic/financial system, particularly the "card game" attacking free enterprise.  It is very naive--ignores intellectual capital, population expansion, & the money multiplier (the average dollar's spent 6x/year).  His "social credit/dividend" system is utopian to an extreme & p. 243: "We don't need social service workers where poverty is unknown" is absurd--$ won't buy a child's mental/emotional health anymore than happiness.  Heinlein fans (he's my favorite SF novelist) may find it historically/developmentally enlightening, but as fiction, it's his worst novel 
 I purchased this disk along with others to play in my Acura DVD-A system.  I found the overall audio quality to be a bit disappointing...and the mix to be a bit "over the top" with surround effects.  Major vocals coming from rear speakers, etc.   I also found the overall sound to lack the brightness and crispness on this specific disk. In fact, the demo disk for my TL has the Marvin Gaye song "Let's Get It On" and it is remarkably brighter on that disk than on this collection.  If you are looking for DVD-A disks with 5.1 surround...I'd pass on this one and maybe purchase the CD of this album.  
 I can understand how people have different tastes.  I can understand how people with no taste still have preferences. But I honestly cannot understand how ANYONE could like this.   The music is like that of William Shatner, while the spoken word vocals reminded me of the narration that led into commercial breaks on the old Dukes of Hazzard TV show.  This guy is a redneck in full self-parody mode, trying to be a beatnik.  As I listened, my first instinct was to eject it from my car stereo and throw it out the window.  Then I thought about giving it away, but I was afraid of insulting anyone I'd give it too.  Out the window it went.  I honestly believe any positive review must be coming from either Ben under an alias or a record company plant.  It is impossible to like this garbage 
 Norman Friedman deserves credit for the way in which he manages to explain the concepts of 20th century physics so well. Unfortunately, his interpretation of quantum physics is rather conservative. The result is  that he attempts to prop all of reality into a framework that is just too  narrow and limited. It is not the definitive book on the relationship  between modern physics and spirituality, but it's a good start 
 Flynn is half-crazy and I can't for the life of me understand how he was able to type with his arms in a strait-jacket. With a book this awful to his credit, he'd make a great White House reporter 
 Trinity Collection is a Bootleg. Picture is extremly poor. 3 movies for $10. Too bad, I like Trinity, she's cute. Ooops, wrong Trinity.. 
 I enjoyed everything else I have read from Harry Harrison, and am fascinated by alternative history, so I expected to like this book. I didn't.  I think it does credit to the American reviewers who have criticised this book that it went down nearly as badly with them as it did with Brits. They have demonstrated that one comment by a British reviewer - that this book provides an insight into the American mind - is unfair to most Americans.  The starting premise - Britain blundering into war with the North in the American civil war - is horrifying plausible, which is not surprising as this very nearly happened. The first part of the book, up to that stage, is well done.  However, the author then abandons any attempt at either a realistic attempt to work through what might have happened, or to look sympathically at how the situation might have developed from the viewpoint of all sides. Instead, looking for a way to turn both the USA and CSA into heroes, he casts the Brits as utterly incompetent and evil cretins who both sides can unite against.  Although it isn't a positive for me to read a book in which my country is shown in a bad light, this doesn't usually make it impossible for me to enjoy a work of fiction. Heaven only knows Britain has had it's share of reverses and like every other country in the world has been responsible for some stupid or wicked mistakes. However, the increasingly implausible idiocy through which this book has the British blundering into war against both parties in the American civil war is way over the top. The idea that a Commander in Chief of any civilised nation could simultaneously be moronic enough to commit the acts attributed to the Duke of Cambridge in this book, and clever enough to prevent his own government finding out what he had done and sacking him, is  ludicrous beyond belief.  Harry Harrison is almost the last writer on earth I would have expected to prostitute his enormous talents with such chauvinistic rubbish. One-sided nationalism is not usually his style at all, and he has written another book about a set of events which might have changed the course of the US Civil War/War between the States - "Rebel in Time" - which is far  superior to this.  The market for this book is people who like America, hate the   British, and are not too bothered about historical plausibility. So it may sell some copies in the USA, and probably a few in Ireland (though as I'm married to an Irish catholic girl I think I'm qualified to say that not everyone in Ireland falls into these categories.) In the rest of the world most of those who don't like the Brits don't like the USA either, and would be even less sympathetic to the CSA.   For anyone who is looking for a good account of how the American Civil war might have gone wrong, try Harry Turtledove's "The Guns of the South," or "How Few Remain" and the "Great War" and "American Empire" trilogies which follow it. Or indeed Harry Harrison's "Rebel in Time" 
 My sixth grader likes it.  It is extremely ordinary and easy to outgrow 
 Don't buy this book, it's a total waste. I bought this book recently and read it. Writing style is moronic, scene descriptions are haphazard and uncertain, protrayal of characters is blured. Most of all, he seems to have a huge issue against Japanese race. He humiliated and attacked the character Painless Kumagai for absolutely no reason. He is so bitter about this Japanese man that makes me sick 
 The normal elements of an Anita Blake novel (supernatural detective work, exciting action, and Anita's strong will) are reduced and pushed aside in favor of gratuitous sex scenes.  There's nothing wrong with a little romance, especially if it advances the plot.  However, these repeditive scenes are about as romantic and subtle as a sledgehammer.  They don't contribute to the plot, but instead interrupt it.    The excuse is that Anita has been infected by the ardour, a supernatural hunger for sexual energy.  Supposedly she got it from Jean Claude, even though it was never mentioned in the previous nine books.  It's a very flimsy plot device.   More annoying is the change in Anita.  Always before, she fought stubbornly to maintain her morals against all influcences.  However, she makes no attempt to resist the ardour.    The book is so different in focus, flow, writing style, phrasing, and word choices that I suspect it was partially or entirely ghost written.    I greatly enjoyed all the Anita Blake novels prior to this one.  I recommend reading those.    I advise against reading this one 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 Maybe I am not smart enough for this book, it certainly isn't for the novice!!  I ended up more confused than educated 
 I agree with the other reviewers who cite the authors' numerous contradictions and extraneous information, this book could have been improved with some judicious editing.    There is one disturbing piece of advice in the book that I would like to draw attention to: the author continually recommends using a microwave to defrost and heat baby food.  This is extremely counterproductive, why spend the time and money making organic baby food only to nuke it in the microwave and degrade the nutritional content?  Microwaving breaks down the molecular structure of foods making them harder for your body to recognize and digest.    No, microwaving isn't the greatest evil out there, but in a book devoted to nutritiously feeding your baby it seems quite conspicuous!  
 As many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction, however midway it turns into a romance novel.  I give it 3 stars for holding my attention.  A good beach read that can get you thinking (a little) about a time past.  The one star is a mistake and I cannot seem to change it.   3 ***  stars 
 These noodles have a terrible, squidy texture and a wholly unpleasant smell.  They cook strangely and taste odd 
 Simply put, this was an awful disappointment. James Michener is one of my favorite authors, but I remember when he came to Kent to do the research for this book, and he evidently didn't do any himself, because the inaccuracies in this book outnumber the truths. It's so poorly put together that I stopped reading any of his books for several years after this one came out. Do not -- I repeat, do NOT -- base your perceptions of what happened in Kent on the material presented in this book. There have been so many other books written since then that are more accurate -- pick any of them. Better yet, read several. Everybody seems to have a different idea of what really happened anyway. As a member of the KSU class of 1970, I had several friends who were there that day, and some of them couldn't talk about it for 25 years. This is not a subject to be dismissed so lightly with so little regard for the truth. My feeling is that this was a true American tragedy that didn't need to happen, and only did happen because of political power, arrogance, and greed 
 I never received this item. I thought I ordered it and I just got this email asking me what I think of it.  However I don't see this item in my "last six months" orders.  Did something go wrong?  ANy ideas?  An

 I felt as though the author was sharing many tidbits with readers that are common knowledge such as "always say I love you", and "never go to bed angry". The author introduces that in-laws, sex and money might be issues but does not really do into great detail about how to deal with these issues. I felt like the book just dragged on, and lacked anything of serious value to brides. I think future brides or newlyweds might benefit more from a book by Dr. Phil or Dr. Gottman, as this book was just filled with fluff, and seriously lacked any real substance. After reading the book twice, I did not feel any wiser 
 If you think that a newly-married couple with virtually no experience dealing with family-planning issues is the best source for advice on family planning, you just might be willing to take a risk with this book.  It's chock-full of abstract theorizing and starry-eyed notions about the "blessing" of pregnancy -- it's virtually bereft of factual realities, like the unreliability and burden of following "natural" family planning (if you call daily mucuous-membrane measurements and temperature-taking 'natural'), and the dread of finding out that, once again, you're pregnant but can barely make ends meet to support the children you already have.    In other words, it's one thing to talk about how great it is to 'trust God' when you only have one child -- it's quite another to try to pretend that failure to use reliable birth control is so wonderful when it results in 5 kids under the age of 8.  I've seen far too many couples wax poetic about natural family planning when they first get married -- only to hear them say "What were we thinking?" five years later when they realize the consequences that come from taking such a passive role in their own family planning.    Upshot:  you can take an active or passive role in planning your family.  If you take the passive route, make sure you understand exactly what that means -- and talk to those who have a more experienced perspective than just a couple of years.   
 I read this book, it was okay but the story flashed back to much, and I couldn't folow all of it but I read all of it anyway. I wouldn't recommend it. TOO SLOW MOVING, and BORING because of the flashbacks. The movie was the same way 
 This movie could have been summed up in 30 minutes. I fell asleep several times trying to get through it, good sleep aid, not such a great film. I had way higher expectations from watching the other AMAZING Miyazaki films. This movie isn't a bad edition to Miyazaki's portfolio, but it's not even close to his best 
 Very disappointed.  Purchased 6 of these for an 1100 sq. foot apartment to eliminate the common spider and occasional ants and insects that appear in the Spring and Summer time.  Well, I think these units INVITE the ants in.  We've never had more ants than we do now despite following directions to place these units on opposite walls in the same room, etc.  These devices do not phase them at all - they continue to parade right by 
  This was one of the worst romances I've read in a long time. As others have mentioned, the adultery was nauseating. I've read many books where the hero cheats, but this is the first where the author actually writes the hero and his mistress' 'making love' in painful, excruciating detail. Was it really necessary to put in detail how much the man enjoyed it? To top it off, this Phillip is totally unrepentant and guiltless. Though it's understandable that his bride was afraid of him and gave him his freedom, he didn't have to cheat on his *wedding night* of all nights. Apparently, he has no respect for his new wife even if the marraige was strained.  Another frustrating incident occurs when Sabrina, the heroine, follows Phillip and catches him about to cheat. She thereby throws a tantrum and makes a fool of herself...only to fall into his arms by the end of the book when he claims that 'he wasn't going to cheat' in that crucial scene. Um...excuse me? His mistress was NAKED, he was HALF NAKED, and it's quite OBVIOUS that he was LYING to get the heroine to return. And it worked, because Sabina doesn't seem to have any pride or self respect!  Are we supposed to believe that Phillip somehow managed a complete transformation only a few pages after this? He threatened his wife with violence, shouted that he would 'see his mistress whenever he wanted to', and all of a sudden, he gives this profession of undying love and fidelity...which is totally unbelievable.   
 Holbeins illustrations are brilliant and fascinating.  This book is very inexpensive.  These two factors should make it a great addition to any library.  But the images are something like 2 inches square.  You can't see any detail really.  I was disappointed and I guess I'll have to find another book as I would like to enjoy this macabre and fascinating series 
 This season crearly shows that J.J. Abrams is commited to something else (Lost?). That zombie thing in the final chapters must be a bad joke. The killer robot helicopter chapter was nonsense.  I'm very disappointed with the whole season 
 The plot is confussing and weakly held together by the detailed personal stories. I found little that was morally redeeming or outstanding in this book. Having grown-up in Oklahoma, I found the book unauthentic. I cannot recommend this book 
 Curse of the Pink Panther is weakest entry in Panther genre.  One, Peter Sellers as  Chief Inspector Closeau seem to take the spirit of the Panther films to the grave with him  Two, This was the last Film of David Niven. The rumor of Rich Little dubbing his voice rings true, if you watch Niven's lips and what is coming out of them.Niven who was very ill with MS just did a lot of sitting and limited movement.   Three, Ted Wass tries to bumble and stumble like Sellers's trademark character-however He is NO CLOSEAU. The more he pratfalls, the most we miss and wish Sellers were still alive  Four, the supporting cast (Robert Loggia, Herbert Lom, Leslie Ash, Robert Wagner, Joanna Lumley, Capucine, David Niven, Harvey Korman) are given almost nothing to do in this film, other than to be a foil to Wass's pratfalls or straight men to Wass's so called craziness. Burt Kwouk  as Cato is given more to do in his small scene with Wass and you wonder why he isnt in more of the film. And Roger Moore's cameo as a remade Closeau is poor preformance, playing on Seller's trademark accent and his James Bond Character  Five, Blake Edwards's script seem a weak closure to the Genre. And to make matters worse, he even did another Pink Panther (Son of the Pink Panther)after this,  which was WORSE than this film   AND THOSE ARE THE GOOD POINTS  I give it two stars for the stellar supporting cast alone, that makes this film worth it  Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORL 
 After slogging all the way through this book, I came to Amazon, expecting to see a low rating. I am surprised to see that it has 4.5 stars (as of when I'm writing this review) and a lot of positive comments.  On the plus side, the author did take some interesting ideas and combine them in a way that makes sense. I don't mind the hours I spent reading this book because at least it made me think about a couple of things I hadn't realized before.  But on the other hand... there are really only a few important concepts in this book, and you can see what they are by reading a couple of the longer reviews here (like Coert Visser's or the one from "Dr. Professor Hossein Arsham." There's no need to read the whole thing unless you want to hear those same concepts explained over and over again 
 I completely disagree that eating a diet rich in a lot of fat and protein through animal sources is the healthiest diet.  While following the recipes and outline of the book would be a better choice than the standard processed "fast food" diet of today, it is not at all superior to a plant based diet.  The China Study is an excellent and thorough book detailing years and years of research on how a high protein and high fat animal diet directly correlates to many diseases and ailments.  While I agree with the author's premise that refined, processed and packaged foods are substandard, I also disagree that ANY kind of oil or pure fat is not health promoting (she encourages the use of butter, coconut and olive oil).  All oils are processed foods, but even if they are cold pressed they are still a refined PURE fat.    Appropriate fats occur naturally in ALL fruits and vegetables.   Too much fat floating around in the blood stream will inhibit many body processes.   It also can be a recipe for disaster for those with sugar-related problems, as fat in the blood stream mixed with natural plant sugars (in fruit) can slow down in the digestion process, causing sugars to harmfully rise and contribute to candida or diabetes, for those who have weaknesses in those areas.  Many individuals with hereditary problems between high cholesterol and heart attacks should take caution with eating more cholesterol.  Why put more cholesterol in a body that already overproduces?   My personal experience of having my own father and many relatives with my same genetic problem drop dead from heart attacks made me really take control of my own health.   I have dropped my own levels by over 100 points on a high-raw, low-fat plant based diet, without the use of dangerous statin drugs.     So, although many cholesterol issues are dietary based, there are those with special circumstances that the author failed to address, who would not do well at all on her diet.   It would be a dangerous prescription to give someone, with possible arterial damage or even heart disease, a high protein and high fat animal diet.  There are very little recipes for fresh, raw plant food, and even the recipes such as salads contain dressings rich with animal products.   Most of the other plant based recipes are cooked in butter or egg bases. Many of the recipes are fried in butter or olive oil.  Fresh food is the healthiest food on the planet.   Cooked food, plant or animal based has been denatured so you are not getting the full structure of the nutrient that your body needs.   
 I picked up a copy of this pretentious garbage at a library used book sale. I paid one american buck for it, which was about 100 cents too much.  It's obvious from the start that Rush is extremely impressed with his massive vocabulary. Probably giggled himself to sleep each night after he finished his writings, imagining all the ignorant folks who would need the same dictionary he used to write it, in order to decipher his blather. I would recommend any of John Steinbeck's novels to any human who plowed his or her way through this dire drivel, simply to clean their mental palate. Dumpster fodder. 
 Downloading objects from fan sites can be hit or miss -- I have had many collections I've downloaded work incorrectly or not work at all in the next expansion pack, and items I really liked were suddenly unavailable.  So, I was looking forward to a "Stuff" pack from Maxis.  Bah.  Yes, there are several very nice items, but really, this is an underwhelming collection on the whole.  Items are very limited and the collections are small.  The pictures you see on the cover are a good portion of what is contained.  Like so many here remarked, the money spent is not equal to the value received.  Another reviewer pointed out what the title "Glamour Life" implies -- jewelry, house items, luxurious textures for floors and walls, and clothing for all ages, and most of all, excess and abundance.  There's no abundance here.  I've found items I like, but I am not impressed with the collection.  Maxis knows that its target audience is always hungry for new items, and I think it is taking advantage of the fact, fooling us into thinking we are getting much more than we actually recieve for our money.  I feel a little cheated.  If you must have this, wait until the price drops, or -- better yet -- find a good, reputable fan site  (there are some very good ones out there that have safe downloads) and download for a small fee or for free 
 I bought this because I wanted a cheap no-frills phone with answering system, but it's performed very poorly compared with the one I had previously.  Specifically, it's very hard to hear anything on this phone, even with the volume set to maximum.  Definitely not worth buying 
 I bought this dvd thinking it would be an enjoyable thriller.  Instead my husband and I found ourselves repeatedly saying "how could he go and do that, that was so stupid".  To be honest, seeing that he had been fooled was immediate and obvious.  Rather than sharing the truth with his friend and his wife, he goes and does one stupid/criminal/incriminating thing after another.  The fact that Denzel Washington gets out of this situation in tact is solely because of either a) luck or b) a friend covering up for him.  eg..Good grief, how many police officers don't know their chief's cell phone number in a small town.  When the old woman pointed him out he was wearing the same outfit as he was when he was prowling around the night before.  It gets a heck of a lot worse.  The only reason I give it two stars rather than one is pity because I generally like Denzel Washington as an actor.  
 This thing looks and performs wonderfully out of the box.  The filters capture that disgusting vacuum smell, and its fun to watch all that dust and pet hair swirl around in the translucent box.    Then it quit working.  I figured that was the retailer's problem, not mine, so I returned it.    Second model did the same thing and broke after about two hours of use.  I had to bang on it and manually spin the rotating filter to get gobs of dirt dislodged (a "gob" is approximatley one pint.  I removed "gobs").   So this model has failed twice.  Not what I want from an appliance that costs close to $300 and should last 10 years.    Also, the attachments don't stay put and the little plastic keeper for the hose is in just the right spot to snap off on your thigh.  And the handle broke on my first one.    Come to think of it, this damn thing is pretty junky 
 Why does Franken have to continually "borrow" names from those who are politically opposed to get himself some attention? Without the constant use and abuse of names like "Limbaugh" and "O'Reilly" (with radio and tv ratings to prove their success)in his titles - would ANYONE take a second look? I have to wonder.... 
 The premise behind this book is that by following the techniques advocated by the "Fools," you can pick stocks on your own and do better than the market as a whole and better than most professional mutual fund managers.  Think about it.  If this premise were true, then most of the professional mutual fund managers would be out of a job, replaced by anyone that could follow the "Fools" advice.  The book is principally a big advertisement for the Motley Fool's web-site (www.fool.com) and much of the content it references isn't even there any more.  For instance, the book references real world stock portfolios called the Rule-Breaker and Rule-Maker which you can supposedly see and follow for free on their web-site.  If you search google, you'll find a page on their web-site announcing that both have been discontinued.  I'm guessing it wasn't because of their stellar performance.  Fortunately, you can still *buy* the Motley Fool Rule Breakers Newsletter for $199.00 per year.  Whew!  The book also announces the creation of a new stock index, which the book calls the "NOW 50," but which the Fools renamed "Fool 50" after the book was published.  Today, if you go www.fool.com's stock index section, you'll find no reference to the index.  You can still find links to the old pages if you search google (fool.com "fool 50"), but not if you search on fool.com.  An index that lasted no more than 3 years!  Amazing!  Perhaps the best critique of the Fools is in Investing for Dummies (Fourth Edition) on pages 382-383:  "[O]nly one of their seven portfolios has actually performed better than the market averages--two of their portfolios were shuttered after poor performance (one of which plunged 50 percent during its short six-month existence)."  Fools indeed!  By the way:  "Investing for Dummies" is a great book full of sound investment advice.  Make sure you get the latest editions (the Fourth was just released and the Third is still on many store shelves) The companion title "Personal Finance for Dummies" is also full of advice worth hundreds of times its cover price. 
 While i was inspired by all of other castaneda books (i have not yet read second ring of power)  this one was my least favorite.  It did not have any of the great quotes of don Juan Matus or commical actions of Don Genaro, and it was not inspiring. it did have a few interesting parts here and there, but overall was kinda [crummy] compared to his other book 
  Feel  author has the technical knowledge but should focus on the common classics with enough detail for one to comprehend disassembly procedures. I've got every clock making tool available and I could not get the cover off the winder gear of an old common Cannon 
 Yo.  Don't even do it.  The Worst Ever.  Ever.  You don't have to do this to yourself.  Take your cash and throw it out your window...The First album and the EP,  they're ok.  This is a pile of poop 
 I saw this at the library and brought it home, thinking it might be interesting to watch. I very rarely watch films made after the 1950's, but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable. It ended up being only mildly enjoyable, and a bit boring. I felt that within all the time it ran, we didn't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters; seemed to remain in shallow waters all along. The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn't quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate. I think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity. I am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed. So I would not recommend this film for families with young  children, because of the nudity. 
 My primary use for this camera was to take pictures indoors with very bright lighting, without the use of a flash. The camera couldn't handle taking pictures without the flash at all, despite it being extremely bright in the room (5 different lights on plus 3 overhead halogen track lights). The camera's shutter speed was so slow that it was nearly impossible to get a picture that wasn't blurry. Maybe 1 in every 4 pictures came out clear. I believe the fact that its a 10 megapixel camera is what did it.  I used to have a Cannon PowerShot SD450 that was awesome, but it was stolen and so I needed a replacement. I had no complaints about the 450 and it took the same type of pictures in bright indoor lighting just fine without a flash, unlike the 900. I am sure the camera would be fine for people who always use the flash or take their pictures in bright sunlight but for my purpose, this camera was horrible and it has since been returned. Instead, I just got a Fuji Finepix F30, which is supposed to be better without the flash. We'll see 
 I bought this book 2 years ago - almost to the day...I have the receipt stuck in the book...I can only seem to force myself to get to page 50 and then I just can't stomach anymore and I put it down for 2 more years. Maybe this is a piece of art. Something to be treasured and something that should change your life. But pleasure reading shouldn't be this painful. I wish the store would take it back - but I think I've probably had it for too long 
 Pearl Harbor...December 7th...a date which will live in infamy.  This film took on a subject near and dear to the hearts of Americans everywhere, and failed to do it justice.  Fantastic explosions and effects and a quality score from Hans Zimmer could not resurrect this movie from the stench of mediocrity.  A tacked on love story was butchered further by the B-level acting "talent" of Ben Affleck, but one gets the sense that, even perfectly done, it would not have worked against the backdrop of the terrible attack.  It would be like the soldiers on Normandy Beach stopping for a romantic tryst halfway up a sand dune.  The movie also played out about an hour too long.  The last hour (all AFTER the attack on us) just pushed my opinion of the movie lower and lower.  All that said, I did mention that the movie had solid effects and a wonderful score.  But poor acting and a bad script were just too much to overcome.  Steer clear of this one 
 i was disapointed by this book and the presentation of it 
 I bought a GustBuster umbrella several months ago, expecting that it'd be the last umbrella I ever needed. Wow, was that a bad decision. This "windproof" umbrella had two of the spokes break in a light wind (the weather report said the winds that day were only about 15 miles per hour). So I e-mailed the company because I remembered that it had a "lifetime guarantee." They told me that I'd have to ship it back to them (which is perfectly fine), but I'd also have to pay them $10 for their trouble. What kind of lifetime guarantee is that? For $10 or less I could buy another umbrella locally. Their product has proven that it's NOT superior and it DOESN'T live up to the claims they make for it.  Don't spend all this extra money on a GustBuster because you think it'll work better. It won't. Go out and buy a normal umbrella for 1/3 or 1/4 the price of a GustBuster -- you'll probably get the same amount of use out of the normal umbrella, and you won't be paying an outrageous price for something that doesn't work the way their marketing claims 
 I read the Heart of Christianity because my pastor said that many people had found it helpful.   That might be true.    However, the people most likely to find this book "helpful" are those who are uncomfortable with traditional Christianity and, like Thomas Jefferson, want to cut out all the parts of Christian teaching they don't like.    Borg's  "emerging paradigm" challenges how we view God, Jesus and the Bible.   Unfortunately, his slender book is more interested in setting out a new belief structure than persuading anyone not already in his camp.        The Heart of Christianity sets out to explain an "emerging paradigm" which appeals to "millions" of mainline Protestants in North America.   Borg does not explain why this faction has so much greater insight than the majority of Christians both today and throughout history who have subscribed to what he describes as the "earlier paradigm.".    It is enough for him that some people find his formulation to be an acceptable reconciliation of the conflict between faith and intellect.    Borg is very up front about the fact that his book reflects a conflict between "two comprehensive ways of seeing Christianity as a whole."     While Borg claims to reclaim the "heart" of Christianity, this is definitely not the faith of our fathers.    Instead, he embraces what can be viewed as Christianity lite.    Much, if not most, of the supernatural is rejected.    What is retained is social activism based on the non-supernatural teachings of Jesus combined with a vague sense of spirituality.    The new paradigm is best illustrated through its approach to the Bible, Jesus and God.      *	For adherents to the "earlier" paradigm, the Bible is "a divine product with divine authority."    For Borg, the Bible is a human response to God.    By implication therefore, our response to God is just as valid as that which is contained in the Bible.     If certain teachings are uncomfortable or difficult, we can simply decide that we have moved on to a more mature Christianity and disregard them. *	Jesus is central to both paradigms.    However, Borg rejects the Jesus of the creeds who died for our sins and was resurrected on the third day.    Instead, Jesus was a mystic and social teacher in the Jewish tradition and was executed because he threatened the power structures of his day.   His death, like that of other social reformers such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi, was not a good thing in and of itself (it was certainly not part of God's plan to redeem the world), but was used for good by his followers.      *	Our relationship to God is also central to Borg.   However, Borg rejects "supernatural theism" which envisions God as a personlike being.    Instead, Borg embraces panentheism.    God is the "More" of existence.   He is an encompassing Spirit who is part of the created world.    He is somehow more personal than "the force" but less personal than God the Father.    Because God is so general, no single religion is the sole path to enlightenment.   Instead, all religions have a piece of the truth.  Borg does not really attempt to persuade the reader or defend his elegant construct.    As a result, there are many questions left unanswered by the book.    For example, Borg dismisses C. S. Lewis's assertion that based on the statements attributed to Jesus, that he was either a lunatic or the son of God.    According to Borg, Jesus never claimed to be the messiah or the Son of God.   Instead, these were statements of faith inserted into the gospels by the early Christian community.   It seems rather presumptuous that a 21st Century academic claims to know more about Jesus than the early church.    However, if you accept Borg's logic, why believe anything written in the gospels?   Borg chips away at historical Christianity to leave the "heart" which he believes is important.   However, using the same logic, it is possible to continue chipping away until nothing is left.       This book presents only the tip of the iceberg of Borg's thought.   Therefore, it is dangerous to make overgeneralizations.    However, Borg appears to be the perfect prophet for the narcissistic baby boomer generation.    Borg jettisons those supernatural beliefs which no longer fit our more enlightened age.    The bold proclamations of ultimate truth contained in scripture become metaphors to be reinterpreted by each age.     Whether he does so intentionally or not, Borg leaves us free to create God in our own image.     While he does not completely abandon the possibility of ultimate reality, he makes that reality dependent upon our perception of it.    It is difficult to see the future of Borg's emerging paradigm.    If new generations take his message to heart, there will be little reason to retain even the fa?ade of Christianity.  When all belief is subject to being reinterpreted according to more recent sensibilities, then the very concept of belief collapses under the weight of personal subjectivity.    Borg may have thought of a way around this.    However, it is not apparent in The Heart of Christianity.     The book is not all bad.   In some respects, Parts One and Two are like separate books.   Part One sets out the "emerging paradigm" while Part Two contains much more orthodox views on living the Christian life.  Part Two emphasizes the liberal aspects of Christianity.   However, its liberalism is much more deeply grounded in biblical Christianity.   There are some genuinely useful insights in Part Two.  However, they are useful precisely because they are biblically grounded rather than the product of man's imagination.   
 after frimware update, it completely stop working. Followed all the instructions correctly.  Hard reset and did everything i can. I could not recover.  Do not buy. bottom line 
 This CD soundtrack of the music from the film the Wizard of OZ is poorly produced. Sound quality is poor. Songs run into each other. 
 I'm not sure why they put 'professional' in the title, because this book is an extremely basic introduction. When I think of professionals, I think of people with work to do. And if you have work to do, you will not like this book.  One of the reasons that I chose this book was the examples. I prefer nice short examples to the multi-page full applications examples that were in one of the other books I looked at. But I didn't realize that the majority of the examples demonstrated the execution of 1 or 2 instructions each. You'll have to browse to find one with a loop in it.  The index is poor. You won't find 'conversion' or 'addessing modes' in the index. As a result I frequently end up browsing for the information I need. This is infuriating. And since the book is missing so much useful information, your searches are frequently unsuccessful. For example, the author tells you how to use SSE registers for packed integer operations, but doesn't tell you how to load those registers with integers. Or maybe he does, but I couldn't find it.  I was hoping for some insight into how to optimize loops, how to perform common operations as quickly as possible, but there isn't much. None at all, really. 
 As a 3rd year EE student I have seen a lot of textbooks.  This one is one of the worst textbooks I have seen.  The topics covered by this book are very important but are explained very poorly.  The explanations are longwinded and the few examples are far from useful.  I would avoid this book if possible 
 As a psychology minor, I think Matlin does a wonderfully thorough job of covering cognition.  However, as an English major, I find her style of writing irritatingly repetitive, and much more confusing than it needs to be.  She uses a lot of examples to define concepts, rather than stating them--which would be very helpful. Furthermore, the glossary does absolutely nothing to help the confused student, since it basically reprints the in-text sentence where the vocabulary word appears. I would recommend sending the book to a literary editor who could redo the text 
 This is a long boring tome on Malaysian history filled with a plethora of incomprehensible names of people and places.  The minute details, instead of enlightening, cause one to find it hard not to fall asleep - much less make any sense out of what the authors are trying to relate.  The 344 pages of text could have been easily reduced by 50%, thus making the book much easier to read & understand.  The authors swamp the reader with so many useless insignificant details that it is almost impossible to glean any useful information from this tediously long book.  Given the fact that this gobbledygook is a 2nd edition, the first having been written 20 years ago, it is hard to believe that there could have been much demand for a revised look at Malaysia's history.  I had hoped to use this book in one of my university history courses on Southeast Asia.  There is no way I would inflict such esoteric pedagogic claptrap on my students 
 From the moment I picked up a copy of GUILTY PLEASURES and started reading it, I was hooked on Anita Blake and pretty much devoured the succeeding books. Anita became like a friend and I simply had to know what the author had in store for her, hence I used to pick up the next book as soon as I get to the last page of the previous one. Sadly, this series also proves that all good things must come to an end as we see in the decline of the quality of Hamilton's writing after OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY.   When I write reviews, I do like to summarize the plot. However after reading INCUBUS DREAMS, I was stuck trying to figure out how to begin my review. The problem is that this book has no plot, even though the back cover may suggest otherwise. This is so far the lengthiest book in the series, but there was hardly any of the kick-as* action that I have come to love in the other books, especially the first few. Ask me what I liked about the other books and I can go on about it. Ask me what INCUBUS DREAMS is about and all I can remember is that Anita spent more time feeding the ardeur, which meant getting down and dirty with any man that was available several times a day, whether in private or in front of her numerous male friends. I am certainly no prude but the sex scenes in this book were simply gratuitous and boring. Anita has spent more time on her back and knees than killing those monsters. I miss the old Anita whose sarcasm and no-nonsense attitude I found entertaining and actually endearing. Will someone please tell Ms Hamilton to bring her back?  I will not ramble on much further, but I can tell you now that MICAH is actually worse than this one. I still have DANSE MACABRE to go, but I am leaving that for much much later since I am not sure I can handle any more of Anita's sexual antics at the moment 
 What these 2 artists bring to the table are heaping helpings of warmth, humanity, charm, even sweetness -- not to mention wit and originality.  Their trademark parodies of everyday situations, when they work, are nothing short of uproarious.  "Mother and Son" and "Merry Christmas, Doctor" are priceless, timeless routines that play so well 40 years later as to show the brilliant vision underlying this artistic duo's act and ability to push the envelope in their time.  The question in buying this CD is whether the strength of those cuts, plus the generous quantity of cuts, can compensate for the faded vitality of the others imposed by the passing of time 
 After reading several books about the Founding Fathers and other Presidents, I was excited to read about Teddy.  Now in most books they discuss personalities, events, and impacts of decisions.  This book read like a cheesy novel with unncessary flowery language.  There are lines that were shown as dialogue, when the information was probably gleened from several correspondence.  He writes about facial expressions during conversations.  Morris even wrote about what they thought during events.  Most writers would state, "He would recall later..."  If I had wanted to read a novel, I would have.  I was disappointed not with the subject, just the way it was written.   
 Brief plot summary: two low life hoods kidnap a pregnant surrogate mother.  Her baby's "father" (sort of) turns out to be a mob boss (or has mob connections), said mob boss whistles up his goons, they go after the hoods, and then a lot of people die.  If you like watching characters for whom you care nothing about get slaughtered in bloody gun fights, this film is for you.  You don't have to worry about a plot or being required to use your brain, just sit back and watch the mayhem.  Speaking for myself, the first 10 minutes of guttermouth verbal abuse directed at del Torro and his pal by the woman he ended up punching out was more than enough for me, but unfortunately, the friends I was with wanted to see the whole thing, and I had to sit through the whole thing to the very bloody end. So, in summary, Way of the Gun is just a Pulp Fiction wannabe put together by some Quentin Tarrantino wannabe and you could do a lot better for an evening's home viewing.  If gritty violence is what you like, and feasable plots are optional, Narc with Jason Patrick (one of Hollywood's better stars and one of the least appreciated) and Ray Liotta is a far more masterful piece of film than the sophmoric Way of the Gun 
 Yes, she was Lennon's half-sister. It was necessary for to put a family tree in the back of the book to show how she was related to him. When I bought this book I was hoping for a lot of detail about the early years of John Lennon. There were very few surprises. Take a look at the dust cover of the book.  It is as though she is trying to look like Lennon with her wire-rimmed specs. And you would have expected many more photos of John with the family from someone claiming to be so close. Save your money.  
 Nice addition to all what is out there but as stated before a lot of mistakes in accuracies. I have other books from Jim but this one was a little bit of a disappointment. 
 The book didn't include but one of several hundred older records i had 
 Wow, I was expecting a fun, light read, and in the first chapter already had to skim over a couple of paragraphs relating to "mishaps" that happen to animals in Zippy's life. Well, I thought, next chapter will be better. NOT. The next chapter included a graphic scene of chickens being slaughtered by shovels! Every chapter so far has had something very disturbing about animals in it! If you are sensitive to these things, I would not recommend the book. I'm not sure I'm going to finish it at this rate. Granted, I AM super-sensitive to any animal suffering, but this is really overload. I'm halfway through and so far this is the list: The aforementioned chicken slaughter, a neighbor stealing her cat and starving it in the basement, another neighbor looking to poison her cat, dog-sitting for friends and losing the dog and not worrying about it that much and finding him dead days later, her father going out with a shotgun to kill the dogs who massacred Zippy's pet chicken, joking about a neighbor enjoying "puppy stew", keeping her two dogs penned up, torturing a raccoon by holding in front of 30 braying hounds.... I mean, does that seem like a lot to you??? For a light-hearted "tender" memoir???? Jeez louise! I can't sleep at night from this book 
   Now i must say that I'm a fat man. I'm at least 45 pounds over-weight but i don't make action movies and i don't ask people to pay good money to watch my fat self preform stunts and kung-fu moves. Someone please tell Mr. Seagal that he is past his action movie prime and needs to find new work 
 The pan doesn't have a non-stick coating so the rice sticks (go figure). Not a bad brand from what I hear - I just prefer a cooker with a non stick coating 
 I dont like this mouse, i brought, and never work, its useles 
 Do not buy this book unless you have a very high tolerance for new age gibberish.  There is factual information here, but it is buried in gushy self-absorption.  I bought it for psychotherapy patients who are going through menopause, but I'd be embarrassed to lend it out 
 Granted, this isn't a high-end genre once you leave behind Tim Cahill's "Buried Dreams," Ann Imbrie's "Spoken in Darkness," and the best work of the late Jack Olsen. I wouldn't take too many points off for pedestrian writing.   But this terrible story at least deserved careful research, didn't it? Jones really falls down on that job, offering no substantive background on either the Aryan Brotherhood or (my particular field) dog behavior. San Francisco is home to some of the world's best dog behaviorists, and Jones even cites one of them (Jean Donaldson) in her acknowledgments, yet she winds up unable to offer any informed insight into what went wrong in these animals' breeding, training and handling. Given the notoriety of this case and the horror of Diane Whipple's death, Jones has really squandered an opportunity. If the quality of her dog-related information reflects the quality of the rest of her information, you won't find too many facts in this book.   
 Well, Sufjan Stevens has done it again, that's the really sad part. In his quest to bring a uniquely angst-besotted perspective to all 50 states, Stevens has neatly sliced notch #2 into his belt.  Personally, I'm looking forward to Rhode Island.  
 I purchased a brand new Samsung t809, and right out of the box the battery cover would not stay on the phone.  I went to a genuine T-Mobile retailer and after working on the phone for a good half-an-hour, they were still unable to get the battery cover to fit.  The sales rep had a t809 himself and was easily able to get his personal battery cover to fit.  Clearly, a manufactuering defect by Samsung.  I contacted Samsung for a replacement... after six weeks of hassling them over the issue, the end result was that "the t809 battery cover is not included in the warranty."  What?!  End result, I get to duct tape my battery in place.  Thanks.  If you're going to spend serious money on a high end phone... go with a brand name that actually stands behind their product.  Clearly not Samsung 
 The title of this silly attack book contains the following words: ..."Undermines American Foreign Policy, Coddles Dictators". For one, I didn't realize that we had a foreign policy, second what would Jimmy Carter actually be "undermining"?  Considering the absolutely disastrous attempts at U.S. foreign policy during the past six years, Jimmy Carter's efforts are more akin to a breath of fresh air. He's far from perfect, but has most certainly been a much better president than the guy, who's "foreign policy" he is being accused of "undermining" 
 In fact I found it to be pretty much easily summed up with one word-CRAP 
 So.  Everyone lies to each other and to themselves. They are all poison(ed) (hmmmm, poison...Romeo and Juliet) and all relationships are doomed ~ from birth (or before) forward.  Bummer.  Incredibly negative.  Thank you - No 
 I am using this textbook for an MBA course on Social Issues in Management.  Convincing MBA students of the importance of social issues is a difficult yet important task.  Unfortunately this book is not up to the challenge.  Its concepts are overly simple - attempting to reveal a framework in which business exists that once understood should magically reveal win-win opportunities for all stakeholders 
 In my opinion, 70% of this book is theory.  I don't understand how anybody can use this book as a continuous guide.  The first couple of chapters of the book are great, but it goes down hill from there.  This book is good for those that want to gain a deep understanding of DBMS and how they optimize queries or things of that nature, but this book should not be used for an undergrad course.  This book explains alot of concepts behind DBMS, concepts that might be nice to know, but will not benefit you in your database implementation.  There are a couple of chapters dedicated to SQL, but that is it.  And to be honest, it did not help me much at all.  I agree with another person who made the comment if your course uses only this book, drop it because it will probably be a waste of time, unless you are interested in the inner workings of a DBMS. 
 As far as I can tell, this book is driven by doubletalk, optimism, and magic.  DOUBLETALK: Always take risks, we are told, because projects without risk don't have enough benefit. (A glib assertion, but.. OK.) Then we are told that we should never evade a risk - that is, we should never leave anything up to chance. In the middle here and there, we are told that risks won't go away. And finally, we are told that showstoppers are managed by promoting such risks to project assumptions with ceremonies... that evidently banish evil possibilities. The intent is to give managers the impression that they can take macho keen risks while controlling everything.  Sorry Guys. You can look both ways twice, but every time you cross the street, you stand a chance of losing your life. Deal with it.   OPTIMISM: Those risk diagrams. The wonderful thing about them is that... they're bounded! Ya know what? I'd kill for one of those! Project Management  might actually work for software development then! A bounded risk isn't a risk at all; it's a certainty with the possibility of coming in early in front of it.  Gee, Guys! Many of my risk diagrams are lognormal - and they come from histograms of historical data. You didn't cover those.  And finally there's the   MAGIC: Aside from the banishing rituals, there's the simulator based on magical industry averages. Wherever the data come from, and whatever it does, it doesn't have a large enough sample to make a stable... pie chart.  But that's just it. The book is great for pie chart mentalities, and every moment they spend reading it, they're staying out of my way.  
 I borrowed this from a friend as I read Canseco's juiced. This is what happens when trash come across lots of money! Jessica and Jose should have their daughter taken away from them as they are clearly unfit to be parents. What sort of a parent leaves their child at home to go out and do drugs, have threesomes and participate in screaming matches in front of their child? Unfit parents-that's who.  Jessica is a money hungry little tart who needs to grow up and stop being so self centered. From her awful nose job, to her awful life and her juvenile writing style, Jessica has managed to waste a lot of people's time with this drivel 
 the title of this book should include something that reveals that it is based on and promotes evangelical christianity.  So, if this is your point of view, it is a great book for you and has some good practical ideas along with the evangelical focus. If this is not your point of view and you aren't interested in preparing your daughter to argue against evolution, if you aren't interesting in instilling in your daughter the evangelical point of view on social issues, then you would probably be more satisfied with a book that avoids this religious viewpoint 
 I can't believe I wasted as much time as I did on this book.  This is perhaps one of the worst slap-together-a-story jobs in recent publication.  I was looking for a slice of NY life, and what I got was no Big Apple--just a rotten apple.  Does anyone want to buy my copy (only about 3/4 read and slightly vomit stained) 
 I received this monitor as a baby shower gift, but it was something I had particularly wanted.  I was extremely disappointed when I found it didn't work at all!  There is so much sound interference it's impossible to tell if the noises are the baby or the interference.  We disconnected every electronic appliance in the house (cordless phone, microwave, even turned off our cell phones) and still the interference was there.  The video reception is awful, supposed to be up to 300 feet, we are only roughly 20 feet away and still the picture is terrible. I swear it was supposed to have "night vision" - forget it, non-existent.  I'm off the video monitoring; I'm on-line now to buy an old-fashioned voice monitor 
 I have used this book only when I need thermodynamic, physical or chemical data. However the other sections of this book are not practical at all, for those who can read and apply from pure math this is the one; for those looking for practical applications using the information given by this book, sorry fellas this is not the place for it 
 If, indeed, the true definition of porn is no plot and copious sex, then this book is pure porn.  It sucked (you should excuse the pun). It seems even the editors had their fill (you should excuse yet another pun):  by the end novella there were mistakes galore (to instead of too, stature rather than statue, heroine initially introduced as brunette but four chapters later is described as a willowy blonde).  I wouldn't blame an editor for walking away from this garbage.    Trashy mouthed (wo)men and/or rape in captivity (or under any other circumstances) are not entertaining.  I can't help but wonder what kind of money she made from this waste of time/effort/publishing.  It would be nice it she would donate it to a women's shelter.  I shudder to think this women and her husband also write children's books.   
 SELLER'S: For an honest review go to the CORRECT page for the Bose 321 Graphite w/ Accoustimass 3rd module and two satellite speakers.  That will have the correct retail rate and draw the true end-buyers/purchasers.  This price of $700 is for the 2 speaker satellite system so you would be losing a bit selling here.  I hope this helped you in your endeavors and I look forward to honestly/fairly competing with you in the future!  BUYER'S: Buy as many of these as you can and report any loss or "mistakes" on the sellers' part in contractual agreements to Amazon customer service.  Because if this ad by that company/seller is being honest and selling a 3 speaker system (2 satellite and 1 lrg Acoustimass) you are in for a steal! literally, so get a goin! Lol  Disclaimer: this review is an anti-review posted to make aware the disparity between price and item description (which is it?? 2 speakers or 3???) in this advertisement for above mentioned product.  Why isn't BOSE listed as a seller?! DOH  No slander or libel has ever been implied or attempted unless it was true 
 I am always interested in the intellectual history of science, particularly the Faustian dilemma.  Often we want to sell our souls to the devil for an article or a grant.  For scientists in Nazi Germany, the Faustian dilemma was to sacrifice their Jewish friends and colleagues on the altar of Nazism. Hundreds of careers were made this way.  Overall, I was very disappointed with this book.  First, to fill the first hundred pages, Cornwell spends way too much time discussing WWI without any real connection to the ideological development on Nazi science and the danger of scientists who embraced Nazism fully.    Second, Cornwell deals rather efficiently, without finesse or surprises for that matter, with the usual array of popularized accomplishments of Nazi science during the war.  The book reads as a companion guide to a documentary on the History channel.  Stories of V1 and V2, zyklon B, radio navigation, and the A-bomb have been told better before.    Third, the book avoids the "big" moral and scientific dilemma in Nazi science: Lebensraum.  When the Third Reich occupied Poland, it relied heavily on economic analysis on the economic viability of the occupation.  Economists and sociologists walked hand in hand to analyze the most efficient way to occupy that country and to extract its human, capital, industrial, and agricultural resources.  Cornwell mentions the economic analysis of the viability of concentration camps, but that is only a small proportion on how social sciences supported the Nazi ideology.   Fourth, it was hardly surprised then that genetic experiments in the concentration camps are glossed over in the book.  Benno Muller-Hill is reduced to being a reference.    Fifth, the most glaring omission is the role of social sciences, which I tangentially mentioned earlier.  During the 1930s an entire generation of new academic social scientists were "manufactured" to benefit, polish, improve, and offer scientific backing to the emerging Nazi ideology.  In less than 15 years, history, sociology, economics, linguistics, geography, and political science were rewritten and reanalyzed by this committed cadre of bright, young Nazis.  Following the end of the war, these still young academics were not removed.  Although many of them wholeheartedly embraced Nazism, they were able to keep their academic appointments, except for a few of the older guard.  They sold their soul as much as the younger group; few of them were removed and some became marginalized not because they were Nazis.  Those who kept their academic positions served as teachers, professors, and advisors to a new class of students. Few of these academics retired before the 1970s and they dominated the German intellectual contribution in social sciences for over 50 years from Nazism to social democracy.  
 Considering the fact that the University of California - Berkeley boasts the largest repetoire {sp?} of school songs of ANY university in the country makes the fact that this compilation has not included ANY of them problematic at the very least.  Big C (or Sons of Westwood to you theiving baby bears out there) - Fight for California - Sons of California - Stanford Jonah - Golden Bear - Make Way for the Bear - Roll On - Cal Band March - California Triumph - Palms of Victory - California Indian Song - California Marching Song - One More River - All Hail - Hail to California - California, We're For You --  Take your pick - they are all fantastic - and I think I forgot a few...  To leave out Cal is either shoddy work or bad temperment.  Go Bears - Beat the Cougars 
 Heads Up-This is not a novel or book.  It is a small paperback, stapled-together screen play edition. Print is very small and difficult to read. I do not recommend this edition, even though it is a wonderful story  and movie 
 Reading the posted reviews here, is like revisting the ballessssss white liberals who are portrayed in this preschool-level, skewered portrayal of the 60's. White = BAD (you can finish the equation.)  For those considering Hi, Mom whether for purchase or rental, be sure to watch it with your (white) wife and then project her  into DePalma's puerile depiction of a liberal couple, attending an all black drama (except for DeNiro who conveniently is portraying the viscious hunky cop). Then witness her being raped and mauled while you are beaten. Why? Because you are white!  Stupidity not worthy of further commentary 
 Do a search on the true story.  Find out what really happened and how her "therapist" actually created and named the personalities.  Also, you will discover that this author KNEW the TRUTH about this case and simply hid it away in an effort to sell more books 
 Being desperate for ideas as to what to make my 13 year old son who is on a Candida Diet, I thought I had found a gold mine on discovering this book. I was disappointed, however, when I checked with my naturopath regarding  the safety of vegetable glycerin, and was told that it could cause diarrhea  and/or dehydration, and he suggested that I look for an alternative  sweetener.  I have had some success using Ms. Burton's recipes substituting  stevia.  But thanks for trying, Ms. Burton, for so many of us this is a  recurring problem 
 Your web-page is misleading.  It quotes, and the image displays, the Middle English original of the poem. The inside pages shown are from the Middle English edition.  However, (and the modernized title should be a giveaway, but it wasn't) the edition on this page is in modern English -- a translation, not Chaucer's poem.  You need to clean up this page, take away the Middle English quotations, state that it's a modern translation, and refer the prospective buyer to the actual, modernized edition -- which the buyer may or may not want (in my case I did not), with assistance in finding the actual Middle English masterpiece 
    Just purchased 3 units , thought they would work as well as the Novi units they were replacing however they have absolutely no range . My original Novi 2 channel units worked well from a distance of approx 110 ft from house to barn , these only work in the same room... I am attempting to return these currently. 
 I had to return this product for my son because I couldn't get  his name which is unique. If they make a product they should have something on it to make unique names by typing it in if it's not on the list. I mean there are more and more unique name sout there and there sure will be more. If i was a rich person I am sure I could have had one made just for him. Get witht the real world people and make things so unique people can have things too. 
 The book is well written but lacks in breadth of manager case studies. So much of the book is written toward financial institution managers that it has little applicability to managerial positions in manufacturing, engineering, or other disciplines that don't involve motivating people to meet their sales quotas 
 This EP is very curious in that most of the trademarks of Death Cab's sound are nowhere to be found.  I can't say that I know that Bjork song that they've covered, but in general, I don't care much for Death Cab's cover songs because they tend to play them as fans, rather than playing them as if they were Death Cab songs.  20th Century Towers is a fairly forgettable number, and while Stability is a good song, now that we have a more concise reworking available on Plans (The Stable Song), its lost a bit of its sheen.  If you love everything Death Cab has done, there's probably something for you here.  But if you're looking for an entry into what the big deal with these guys is all about, I would start with something else 
 The book is not even statistical by scientific standarts. It is a vague collection of observations that tend to change every year. This book has lost more money than it has made for people. If you want to get serious about trading read Toby Crabel, read Linda Rashke. You don't like to pay money for their books? Don't expect a $30 book to tell you about making money. It takes thinking, hard labor and teachers like Toby Crabel 
 I didn't know a whole alot about Blancmange when I decided to purchase this album. I had seen the "Living On The Ceiling" music video on an 80'sMTV channel & heard "Don't Tell Me" on satellite radio. I'd figure this collection would be to my liking, but I was disappointed. Alot of the tracks weren't memorable or catchy. "God's Kitchen", "I've Seen The Word" & "Feel Me" are good songs, they have that Talking Heads vibe to them. I'm not sorry I purchased this album, for I enjoyed a small percentage of these songs 
 I had bought this product as a gift, therefore can't return it. Before buying the product, I did alot of reading and was lead to believe that these were the actual bowl games. However, there is not a full lenght game in the bunch. It is only a narrator telling you what football is and decribing what they call "highlites" of the games...believe me it was a total disappointment. If you want to see the actual bowl games, you won't see them on this set...you will, however, see some old film clips of interviews with fans and the famous personallities of the time.  
 What good is a soundtrack of Singin' in the Rain without taps? For goodness' sake, that's what the whole movie was about. Lost is a beautiful artistry of Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly, in favor of bland music that was meant to serve only as a background for their talents. Their rhythms were what brought out the best in the dance numbers, not the dumb orchestra! Boooo 
 If you like physics, this is just an interesting book. It mostly discusses, at length, two ideas: emergence and reductionism. Doesn't sound like much, and it isn't, but at least it gives you a different point of view on the world. Unfortunately, from this point of view to the horizon is not that far. Mr. McLaughlin almost calls the present theories (like string theory) science fiction, easy on science (because of the scales and energies involved, he seems to think they are not provable; I don't have the knowledge to discuss if he is right or not), but he doesn't offer much of an alternative. He even comes close to saying that deeper levels of understanding are not possible, or not practical.  Well, even if he is right, which I hope he isn't, between can't and science fiction, I prefer science fiction. Tomorrow I'll read a bit of string theory, and shake off the depressive mood left by this book 
 The third time I used this slicer on an Apple, it broke apart, giving me the opportunity to see that it's construction is flimsy 
 I DID NOT RECEIVE THIS MOVIE AND I WAS CHARGE FOR IT  I WOULD LOOK TO RECEIVE THE DVD  THANK YOU  CAN SOMEONE EMAIL ME WITH THIS INFO rossannemccullough@hotmail.com or call me at 312-404-0267 my name is ROSSANNE MCCULLOUG 
 This album is not worth buying compared to any other albums that were made near the same time. it has 2 good songs lighting strikes and selling the drama. Definatly do not buy, pick up some pearl jam or even candlebox, just basically anything is better. should actully be 1 star 
 This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Actually I turned it off after the first 30 minutes because it was so dumb. My brother convinced me to finish it because he said it got better. Well it didn't, it got worse. Nothing but violence, sex, and drugs. All action and no plot. The sex scene in the middle of China Town with a bus load of kids watching was the stupidest thing they could of put in the movie. Don't waste your time watching this!! 
 Should Martha Rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a "business decision"? I would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this "criminal spectacle" designed to make the question of Martha/Mdiddy's innocence a moot point. Are honest business practices being pushed to the side? By normalizing, generalizing, and minimalizing Martha/Mdiddy's crimes, are we loosing our morality? How important is integrity to a leader...former CEO of a company? Be "thoughtful 
 I find myself rehashing my own reviews at this point but nonetheless, I aspire to write a review on each instalment.  Producers have tested logistics to new levels by taking Jason on a murderous vacation to New York.  The film begins on Camp Crystal, where two teenage lovers are discussing the legend of Jason.  Whilst they speak of him, Jason is electrocuted (again) back to life by the contact of the boat's anchor.  More conveniently, he finds a hockey mask on the boat to cover up his unsightly face.  Cue two dead teens with very bad gory effects and Jason's off on his way to New York.  Cue once again a series of brutal murders on the boat, with female heroine Jensen Dagett avoiding him at all costs until he reaches New York shores.  As a side story, the heroine has had previous contact with Jason when she is swimming in the water so she is frightened of the water as a result.  At this stage, a change of scenery was needed but it doesn't work well at all.  What's so scary in New York?  Comedy is used to no effect in this movie and again the death scenes are more elaborate.  Can this unlucky lady stop Jason in his tracks one more time? Will this beast ever die? I rest my case 
 Interesting book.  Unfortunately it really plays on stereotypes.  It does have a few valuable things to say though 
 This pocket guide has several APA Style mistakes. The example paper is the most misleading.  The text says one thing and the example shows another. e.g. putting the short title on the figure page.  My students were very frustrated with it 
 The stars tell it all. The future is not happening for this book. But I don't want to be a shrew, so I'll just say, I don't like to be bored while reading and leave it at that 
 I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  It read like a poor book report:  "...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."  We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  Yeahsurerightwhatever.  Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  THIS is how men behave and relate to one another?  I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.    I liked the female characters of the book initially.  They all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  But my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  And the conflicts Steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  For instance, Gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the ADULT children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  Nevermind the fact that he's known about the ADULT children since the very beginning.  Nevermind the fact that the ADULT children live in England and Italy, while Gray and Sylvia are New Yorkers.  Nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient ADULTS who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  Evidently Gray can't see beyond the fact that they are "kids" and therefore "family" and therefore not to be tolerated.  Sorry, but whatever sympathy I'd developed for Gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  Dump the weenie, Sylvia.  You can do better.  The other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.    Considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, I have to wonder why Steel even bothered writing this book.  And why I bothered reading i 
 This book had all the hallmarks of a diet memoir: it was self-indulgent, solipsistic, whiny and asinine. After reading it I ate a pint of Haagen Dazs Vanilla and decided that I blame nobody but myself. It was liberating. I am so sick of people who sit around name-dropping and blame everybody--their mother, their sister, their friends--for their fat butts. The worst part of this book was that it wasn't even well-written! Courtney should quit her day job. 
 The phone has too much static unless you're sitting right next to the console, in which case you might has well have a corded phone 
 I wore these slippers for about one week.  One morning while wearing them, my right foot felt like the material inside the shoe was twisted.  I looked down at the shoe to see what the problem was, and much to my surprise, part of my foot was hanging out the side of the slipper!  The seam had split where the top and side were stitched together.  Very disappointed 
 If you have Kids or Grandkids, who think about politics & like "SF"; give them this book!  It was One of the many Heinlein Works that helped ME grow up.  It is the BEST & MOST IMPORTANT of his "for KIDS novels".  I ment to give it 5 Stars!!!! 
 If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting JET Li movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO 
 The problem that I have with this book is that often the words that it defines tells me to go look up another fine.  That would be fine, except that I go to the word it said to look up and discover that I either have to look up another word.  This book is not helpful in that respect, and given that a lot of PCs run Windows, it doesn't really make sense to release a hypertext version for the Mac but not one for Windows.  So the Windows users are stuck with a book that really isn't that good 
 I don't like to brag, but I'd like to think that I'm a pretty good judge of movies and whether they're good or not.  I wasn't expecting a blockbuster of a movie, or anything, but MY GOODNESS, this movie was awful!  One could ask themselves, "What's wrong with this movie?" But the answer itself is the very broad question, "What isn't?" Ashley Judd plays strong, sexy women very well, but she does NOT convince me when she plays a character whom is heart-broken and borderline desperate. Not only is Judd's character not believable, the actual plot pertaining to men behaving like cows who need many "places" to plant their seeds is just stupid. There are about a million and a half romantic comedies that are better than this, and I recommend all of them wholeheartedly over this joke of a film. Watch A Walk to Remember instead. Although not the best movie ever, it's a heck of alot better than this drivel 
 Knowing I would be forced to study this work for my A Level in English Lit, I was sure I would enjoy it due to the comedy and satire involved.  I was wrong.  As the first reviewer claimed, The Way of the World is just like a soap opera!  I appreciate the intention of Congreve was to satirise the follies of the upper classes at the time but this does not make the play any less tedious.  The plot is unnecessarily complex and rather difficult to follow at times.  It all boils down to romance and infidelity in the end, as one might expect.  Granted, it is fairly well written, but if there's a stupid plot and irritating, useless characters, no amount of creative flair in writing can compensate.  As well as that, the language, while not difficult, is different from that of modernity so makes it awkward.  OK, we expect this from an 18th century piece of literature, but it still causes problems for a modern audience/reader.  The worst thing was being told by the teacher when we were meant to laugh - that obviously kills any comedy value in the play.  Exam boards should add some more modern plays to their syllabus!  Not to mention ones with meaningful, interesting plots and characters.  This is not worth the paper it's written on, in my humble opinion 
 Aaaghhhh! My eyes! That has got to be the scariest looking guy mattel has ever come up with! His outfit is great, but honestly, I shuddered when I first saw his face 
 Current events contribute to the genius of pulp prose. The larger lesson made evident by the Katrina hurricane disaster as well as the recent but already forgotten corporate corruption scandals is that both events had to happen as both meteorologists and economists prophesied they would. Our short sighted judiciary paralyzed but conflicting motives did nothing. So I would say this book proves that, along with staring at the sun too long, money causes blindness 
 This novel has some campy appeal since it introduces us to the famous Sam Spade, the morally ambiguous, hard drinking, but devastatingly attractive private eye.  The rest of the characters in this short novel don't amount to much, and as a result I didn't find the plot of much interest either.  I have to believe that this novel was voted onto the Radcliffe List at least partly on the strength of the movie that was based on it 
 Did I miss something, or did this guy risk his life based on a promise to someone he just met? Too much irrational behavior to mention.  I had to force myself to finish the book just to see how much more ridiculous it could get.  The (paperback) cover refers to Michael Crichton three times, the praises inside, another three, and one reference to Stephen King.  These are two good authors that I enjoy reading but this book was not even close.  
 Although I agree with much of what Ms. Seaman writes about synthetic estrogen, (made from mares' urine,) and progestin, (synthetic progesterone), I strongly disagree that all estrogen is potentially "dangerous" to the female body.  (Pls. see Dr. Uzzi Reiss's comments on bio-identical estrogen in his wonderful book, Natural Hormone Balance for Women, in which he, (Dr. Reiss), states: "Currently estrogen is "under attack" as a major risk factor in the epidemic of breast cancer.  I find this ludicrous.  Estrogen is the hormone that distinguishes women's unique gender.  After 2 million yrs. of human evolution, could the female hormone suddently have turned into a serial killer?  Would nature suddenly decide to create a one-gender species?  Of course not.  Incriminating estrogen is as logical as saying that your liver is the cause of liver cancer." (p. 28 of Dr. Reiss's book).  I thoroughly agree with Dr. Reiss.  I, (along with something like 70% of women in menopause), had terrible symptoms of insomnia, lack of energy, lethargic depression, muscle/joint pain, and minor anxiety.  It took me two yrs. of physical symptoms to finally discover bio-identical estrogen, and I consider it a "lifesaver."  It has literally given me back my sense of who I was before menopause.  Within 1-1/2 hrs. of taking the hormone, I became in control of my mind and mood again, regained my stamina, slept better than I had in 2 yrs., and within a few days started to lose the excess wt. I had gained. My recommendation is that in addition to Ms. Seaman's book, readers might like to read Dr. Reiss's book, (from a purely clinician point-of-view,), rather than just a political one. Hooray for Tri-Est!! (name of the bio-identical estrogen formula I used).    
 IM not sure where to begin with this review, its not that the book was poorly written, quite the opposite it was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal. It was quite infact extremely boring, by page 300 I could not wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point I have LOVED the gunslinger series, they were all very good from front to back. There is way, way, to much about Susanah and the whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged, maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is for sure it was no Wastelands or Wizzard and Glass. It was a far fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement. It got to the point where I had to try very hard to pay attention and often I would find I had read a page and not remebered what it was about and had to read it again. Im giving this book 2 out of 5, very poor story line, poor plot however it was written well I can only hope that the next book is better, cmon King give me the feeling Wastelands did, BLOWN AWAY!! rather than tired and exhausted 
 I ususally like Deepak Chopra but this time he really let me down.  He is just another one trying to make a buck praying on people who a desperate to find a solution to rind those extra kilos 
 I'm glad I found this book in the library and didn't buy it! After hearing the good reviews here I was shocked at how poor this book really was. I'm a fan of the paranormal and have studied it for a long time, I am always looking for new views and info whether it be pro or con. But this book is obviously a debunking manuscript. And a poor one at that! It tackles only the weakest of cases, ignores REAL evidence, and brings forth "rational" explanations that are even more far out than the paranormal explanation. The section on crop circles was horrible, dismissing it as a hoax without even LOOKING AT ANY of the fascinating evidence that this is a real occurance. Pass 
 That's what this book should have been titled. Erica Jong is, indeed, an incredible writer, but not here. Not even close. Her willingness to have two female characters candidly discuss the merits of dildos does not automatically qualify her as a feminist writer. I seriously doubt that Sappho, wherever she may now be, finds it entertaining or edifying to know that Erica Jong thought so little of her as to portray her as a dildo fan. If "Sex and the City" were still spewing out new episodes, perhaps Ms. Jong would have eventually suggested an episode featuring Sappho as a dildo salesperson and Carrie Bradshaw as her devoted dildo-loving customer.  Feminism is not about having to use "scary" words like dildo and (...)to prove how much of a woman you are. It's about knowing that you are enough of a woman to not have to prove your feminism to anyone...ever 
 This book is a load of crap... and thats the nicest thing I can say about it.  I couldn't even stand to finish it, though I got most of the way through it.  Her statistics are all massively out of date (maybe the book is too, I don't remember) and the book is aimed at low level students.  If you're a barely-making-it-c-student who needs a boost, read this.  Otherwise, skip it.  The things she says about Ivy league schools (all the classes are huge and taught by graduate students with thick accents, etc) come off like she's presenting a conspiracy theory,  and I hardly count her as a credible source.  If you want to read a book dealing with about the same subject matter, read "Harvard Schmarvard." The guy who wrote it is a Harvard alum,  so I trust what he has to say slightly more than Pope.  He takes a much more objective- and sane- view about the whole thing, and comes off as much more trustworthy.  Pope completely puts down big schools, saying their wrong for everything, along with competitve and Ivy league schools.  Big schools are wrong for some, Ivy league schools are wrong for some, but the woman is crazy.  I read the library's copy, but I wouldn't advocate buying it.  Even used 
 Usually Carly Phillips books are a quick read for me but I am having a very hard time finishing this book.  I did not find the story interesting enough to want to see what happens next.  I don't know if I will even finish it 
 I bought this as I am a Seattle resident (also 20s/30s female like the main character).  I thought it would be cool to find a book that combined the story of a woman's growth and a setting in Seattle.    Unfortunately, it's not a strong story.  The main character is shallow and self-absorbed, and the other characters aren't compelling- and this doesn't change over the course of the story.  The story revolves around the character's relationships to men and a couple of female characters (mainly her mother and her best friend)- not compelling alternative Seattle characters.  I really don't feel that this is a compelling story of human growth or broadening horizons 
 I don't know about anyone else, but this book was the one that made me completely lose interest in this whole series.  This is the most boring one of them all in my opinion, and, well, how many times can the same story be told?  Bad guy wears horribly obvious costume to try to get children, children figure it out, but all the grown ups in the world are too horribly idiotic to see anything, even when it's pointed out to them.  6,000 times.   
 I just didn't get it. The movie was painfully boring. The only remotely redeeming aspect was some interesting cinematography. 
 I'm not sure, maybe I just got ripped off, but is there supposed to be only 1 song that is 9 minutes long on the cd?  
 With a title like "Apologies to Thucydides," what I was expecting was a more anthropological view on Thucydides' material. What I got what Sahlin's shaky justification for his tenuous and, dare I say, boring thesis.   Within the first few pages I knew this book wasn't going to be what I was hoping for, but I stuck with it, only to be thoroughly confused at the random trains of thought expressed. It seems to me that Sahlins had a list of things to tie the Pelopennesian War to before he wrote the book, and just did whatever he could to connect them. The purpose behind this is dubious and isn't explained in a satisfying manner at all.  I just fail to see the value in this book. My recommendation: don't waste your time. The book I was looking for, as far as I'm concerned, hasn't come out yet 
 My friend got this toy for me saying it was the best, and because I'm a dancer. When I opened it, the doll's head fell off and when I dropped it, it broke. I suggest instead going to a real studio, because this was a waste of my friends money. 
 I thought it was great. I had just seen the musical 'The Producers' while in London so decided to get the full set plus two others. Hilarious. I do get funny looks from car drivers when while waiting for the lights to change I am laughing my head off. This is my sense of humour. Thanks for your great service. 
 Call me whatever you will, but I did NOT "get" this book.  jg 
 I just tried filling my propane tank with the quick disconnect connector and was told by the dealer that this type of connector has now been banned by the government and he could not fill my tank.  I called Weber and they confirmed this.  Probably a safety concern although I never had a problem.  I will now need to replace my grill LP hose with the screw on type of connector (QCC1 connection).  
 Will NOT WORK ON XBOX 360 HD DVD.  I could not get access to the menu.  You only see the first 1 min. of the FBI warning and that's it 
 I purchased this movie with Amazon unbox.  I downloaded it to my high def series 3 Tivo.  It was very disappointing.  The picture was little on my high def screen.  It is a letter boxed standard def program which looks very very small on a high def screen.  I even tried changing the aspect on my television.  No improvement.  Come on Amazon, you know what type of Tivo I have, Tivo knows what type of television I have, let's produce something that is at least watchable on every setup 
 Gad!  Such a looooooong book!  This would better be called "A Year (or Maybe 5) in Only Part of the World" since most of the places visited were European.  Long-winded and loopy with adjectives, Mayes writes about food, literature, food, art, food, architecture, and food.  I'm surprised she and her husband don't roll around the places they visit - they must each weigh a ton or two by now.  I did enjoy the descriptions of the crazy Italian traffic HOWEVER I got a wee bit tired of hearing how fantastic European cities are compared to poor little ole' San Francisco.  Traffic bad in Portugal?  Look at San Francisco!  Beggars in Naples?  Just look at San Francisco!  No place is perfect, and I'd much rather read travel stuff written by someone who has a more balanced prospective.  
 This movie was AWESOME!  Ben Stiller is a comic GENIUS, he's the new Jerry Lewis!  DeNiro, AWESOME!  Hoffman, AWESOME!  Streisand, AWESOME and still very sexy for an old liberal ho!  I thought the sight gags were priceless, and the plot line serene!  This was Hollywood movie watching heaven!  This film should have won some Academy Awards!  I mean if Marisa Torme can win for My Cousin Vinnie, these A-1 actors should've at least been nominated!  This is a highly entertaining film, and I recommend it to every and anyone to see, but wear your Depends, because you might pee yourself from laughing so hard!  Dubya 99, you don't know what in the FRIGGIN' H E L L you're talking about!  Yeah like we're suppose to take the opinion of an anti-social loser, that complains about going out to the movies?  Stay home, I'm sure Dateline NBC will be calling soon about that episode they had recently 
 If you need a decent map of Ireland, New Zealand or anyplace else this isn't the right atlas. Tiny maps require a magifying glass to look at with only the most major cities shown. This is more useful to scientists checking weather patterns. Was useless to me needing a decent map of the British Isles. One 8.5 x 11 inch page covering the main isle of Britain including Ireland and the other lesser isles. I had expected at least one full page for Ireland and was greatly disappointed. 
 It's an entertaining read, but as an earlier reviewer noted, Catch-22 has been written already. A good beach read, but don't look to this one for insight into the world of finance. Joseph Heller can rest quiet in his grave 
 I have read several "Powerful Profits" books by Victor H. Royer, and I can truly say he is one of the biggest phonies I've ever come across. I am in a state of shock that Midwest Gaming & Travel magazine could have hired this idiot. I am at an even further loss for words that Larry Grossman would invite Mr. Royer on his show, and seems to think he is a Gambling God.  Amazon.com has plenty of other books on Craps that are of a much higher caliber. (Especially the ones by Mr. Scoblete)  The problem with Mr. Royer is he has no understanding of even basic mathematics. In the back of his craps book he has a chapter entitled "The Big Secret", in which he attempts to prove that craps can be beaten by betting an intermediate progression on all 4 hardways bets. He lists 2 charts -- the first which shows the rolls of the sequence, the second which shows the size of the winning progression for each hardways bet, as well as the total amount won/lost for the sequence.  The problem is: his numbers don't add up.  Here's a quick example:  Let's say your betting $10 to win on hard 6. When EASY 6 comes in, you lose and now you press your bet to $11. Later in the sequence, easy 6 comes in again and you press your bet to $12. Now you craps out and the SEQUENCE ENDS.  When computing total loss for the sequence, Royer will include the $12, but will forget to include the $10 loss or the $11 loss.  And Royer screws this up for his entire chart, making the chart invalid, and the total loss $$$ invalid.  The hardways bets are truly the worst bets in craps, but leave it to Royer to convince novices to hand away thier hard earned money.  Does Royer really believe he has the answer to turning a negaive expectation game into a positive one? 
 I have read every Leaphorn/Chee book by Hillerman more than once and am a great fan. I just finished this book and discussed it with a friend.. we both agreed it was so disappointing.. we cannot believe it was written by the same person. The writing was awkward and heavy-handed... by the second page I suspected something was wrong here. It reads like some cheap Harlequin mystery/romance. The sensitive handling of Navajo spiritual beliefs, the beautiful rendering of the landscape, the terse but meaningful conversations are all missing.  All I can say is, the publishers need to pay more attention to future manuscripts and insure that a writer of Tony Hillerman's caliber is not allowed to decline in the public eye... he has given us much enjoyment.... he deserves better.  And if someone else is fleshing out Hillerman's plot lines.. the public should be warned 
 After seeing Feet of Flames, LOTD and Riverdance, other shows are hard-pressed to even come close to the adrenalizing delivery of the aforementioned productions.    One of the main characters in the show, an older gent, walks around the stage throughout the production which starts out as simply awkward because everyone around him is dancing and he's pretty much a statue.  It eventually becomes flat out annoying because in a show full of Irish dancers, he does nothing but grimace and stand around.  It's unfortunate the talents of Jean Butler and Colin Dunne came up with something as weak as DODG.  You watch each number with disappointment hoping the next will turn things around but it never happens.  The story had potential but this show becomes nothing more than soda without the fizz.  No wonder it died financially and never reached the States 
 This toaster projectile ejects your toast right to the kitchen floor, even if the toaster is located at the back of the counter by the wall.  I can not vouch for the toast--we never got to sample any as they all were hurled to the floor.  "Avante" toaster--should be called the "Avalanche" toaster--that's what you get 
 I recommend you not buy this book or cd.  I listened to the CD and it was too elementary 
 I'd been hearing about the wonderful writing of John Le Carre for quite some time, so I picked up The Constant Gardener for a fun read . . . and it was anything but.  And while I don't know if this is typical of the LeCarre spy novels, I certainly hope not.  The plot is basically a single man versus international conspiracy.  It's a plot that would normally catch my attention early and have my sympathy from the start. Further, it's a commentary on the abuses of power wrought by corporations (in this case, Pharmaceutical) that are more powerful than governments.  Again, a device that immediately evokes common interests with me, an unabashed liberal.  Unfortunately that's where the book and I part ways.  Justin, the minor diplomat in Nairobi is thrown into an unfortunate series of discoveries when questioning the circumstances of his wife's rape and murder.  Tessa differed from Justin in that she was engaged in pursuing change in the world as a human rights activist, while he was content to follow orders, but say and believe the right things sans effort.  This, I believe is the theme of the work, that culpability lies mostly with inaction and that movements can overcome abuses of power.  Good theme, but . . .  The execution was poor.  Pages and pages devoted to characterization fell short when actions didn't meet the set-up.  As well, Justin's investigation took him around the world to look at a paper trail, not the most interesting tools of the thriller game.  But we, as well as the character, examined the words and trail meticulously to the point where it became a joke how quickly the volume would put me to sleep.  Justin is such a luddite that we, as the reader, are forced to learn about computers, emails, and the myriad electronic communication pathways along with the protagonist . . . LeCarre would have been well-suited to find a heartless editor, because the plot that does exist is not much more substantial than what a novella would handle nicely.  Bureaucracy can be handled in a paragraph where the author wants the reader as frustrated as his bureaucrat protagonist, an interesting irony done uninterestingly.  This isn't to say that LeCarre is a poor writer - his sentence construction is strong and his mastery of the craft evident.  I'm going to try another of his novels just because I believe this was an aberration caused by an author with an axe to grind and no right way to do it.  Another problem was that he telegraphed the plot.  The only one stupid enough not to see who was behind the murder and conspiracy was Justin himself.  While this can work, showing the reader what the protagonist can't see (see Fight Club), in this case it's just painful to have to slough through the machinations of bumbling intrigue with a dull and plodding man.   In summary, I didn't care about characters and I lost interest in the plot and the theme seemed contrived.  I can't recommend it.  - CV Ric 
 Please don't waste your hard earned money on this awful toy. It is tiny! The "hinges" and lock had worn marks on the plastic even before opening the product so you know they will break off soon. The "jewels" never sink, either.  Interestingly, PoolToy doesn't list the size of this product. In fact they don't give much information at all which is very misleading and disappointing. What a rip off. I hope Amazon discontinues its association with this company. Look at the feedback record for them. It's as terrible as this toy is 
 There's a lot to like in this book, theoretically. The worlds themselves are well-drawn, the language curt and no-nonsense with occasional flights into a kind of hard cyberpunk beauty (that sort of mimics but doesn't really ever come close to the best that William Gibson has given us). The science is seamlessly integrated into the story, and you come away with the impression that a lot of thought went into its structure.  The theory doesn't hold, though. This just isn't a very good book.   The action follows three different characters, along three different threads. At first, and for most of the book, they have no obvious connection with each other. Their stories appear to unravel aimlessly, and although lots of stuff happens, none of it seems to be in the service of an actual story. It has the effect of three brutal picaresques without destinations, physical or moral.  There is a payoff, but it takes a long time to get there, and by the time I did I was so exhausted and dispirited by the intervening unpleasantness that it didn't really have much of an impact.  There are three major problems with this book:  Information withholding: I like books with central mysteries, that make you wait (and work) to understand what's going on. It's a good propulsive technique, plot-wise. But the mysteries need to resolve. The author keeps us confused pretty much the whole way through, dropping occasional hints that aren't so much tantalizing as frustrating. As I said: by the time I figured out what was going on, I'd stopped caring. This might just be my limitations as a reader, but I gather, from other reviews, that a lot of people feel the same way. You work so hard to understand what's going on that it's difficult to enjoy any of it.  Dreams: Harrison uses dreams both in the service of both theme and plot: to elucidate the characters' psychology, and to give us a window into their past. This is unfortunate, because (in my mind) dreams are lazy plot devices that give the author an excuse to stop the narrative and jump back for some convenient exposition, instead of wending it into the story. Generally speaking, as soon as I hit a dream sequence, I lose interest. I lost interest a lot in this book. Which is a shame, because the content of the dreams here is often wonderful, strange and sometimes even touching. It just needs to be presented better.  Unremitting dourness: There is nothing pleasant about reading this book. The main characters are either savage and unlikeable, pitiable and unlikeable, or mystifying and unlikeable. Often all three. And, with the exception of the wife (who I liked almost as much as I pitied), none of the supporting characters are much use either. The worlds they inhabit are brutal, dire, unpleasant, and dour. There's a lot of sex here, but as portrayed it's mostly just another kind of violence. The whole thing's kind of a downer, pretty much the whole way through, and the strange note of hope at the end comes off false and unconvincing, as if it's been grafted on from another, happier book.  The writing itself has some odd lapses too, given the care that went into the structure of the book, and the obvious attention to detail. Lots of tortured, passive sentences. A few bits of dialogue that sound like campy Chandler.   Harrison is obviously very talented. I wanted very much to like this book, and I suspect I'll pick up another one of his novels sometime in the future. There's a great deal of potential here. It's just that most of it went unrealized 
 This book is a boring and useless effort in self-promotion and basic prostitution.  Wish I could get a refund.  
 Ok! Being the richest human being on the planet called earth, Bill Gates decided that he's not wealthy enough. So he released this Microsoft office 2003, which I really think is not much different from previous edition. The price is, as usual, very expensive. What's worse is that Bill Gates decided all the pre-installed windows in new laptops and desktops come with the trial version. So mere mortals like us need to spend extra BIG money buying the full version to simply do some basic documents. I can see Bill Gates, being a deified bloodsucker, using $100 dollar bills as toilet paper, and laughing at us who work their butt off just to make enough money to live. SO SHAME ON YOU BILL GATES AND MICROSOFT 
 While I applaud the intended message of this book (modify your current clothing and thrift-store finds to better represent your personal style), the majority of the projects suggested here are just bad.  Really, really bad.  This book merits its one star based on the directions for expanding a shrunken t-shirt (which will come in handy for extending the utility of the many no-longer-fashionable teeny-tiny t-shirts I've purchased over the past 5-10 years).  Actually, I feel a star could be deducted from the rating due to the abysmal pillow-case dress project, for an overall rating of zero stars, but I'm feeling charitable... In short: promising concept.  Rotten execution.  
 This story is one of the worst "fantasy" stories ever.  It is completely unoriginal and is a hodge podge of borrowed fantasy and mythological creatures set in a preachy judeo-christian story line.  Don't waste your time with the books or the movies and look to Lord of The Rings or Harry Potter for original (not to mention secular) fantasy and escape.  
 The front man of this band needs to quit spending all of his time teasing his hair and write some decent songs. I'm sorry, but this album was disappointing. I'll admit that there are a few catchy songs (i.e Attractive Today, Everything is Alright, Better Open the Door), but other than that, I found it to be very annoying. All the songs sound the same. This album has no balls! 
 I've previously purchased Memorex media DVD+R and have not had any problems until recently. My latest purchase has given me infinitely more grief and frustration than the initial purchase price... Where do I start, how about the fact that the media is labeled as 4X and only burns at 2.4X (gray spindle)? How about the fact that files and videos have errors causing file corruption and/or video dropouts (stutter or DVD lock-up)?. I thought it was my recorder until I read all the reviews... There has been a HUGE drop in quality recently. If you want to gamble with the recent sub-par quality of the Memorex branded media and "hope" every thing turns out ok by all means make your purchase here. For me, I'm dumping more than 50% remaining on the spindle because the media is completely unreliable and worthless for anything other than coasters 
 Any band that puts out more than one "best of" or "greatest hits" or "definitive collection" or "ultimate collection" and doesn't include everything on at least one of those releases gets 1 STAR. Period. TH have released several hits compilations and once again "Love For Sale" is omitted. Piss on these record companies and bands that can't deliver a complete hits collection 
 These Cats Are Clowns looking like BOzOs Laffy Taffy Worst Single in the history of music. If You Have this trash kill Yourself or what on this list kill yourself    CASSIE CHINGY 50 Cent Khia  
 In my opinion, one would be hard pressed to find much of beauty here, or even of interest... Listen to clips, at least, before spending good money. Although perhaps beside the point, a good alternative is The Nine Horses project, featuring Sylvian, Jansen, Sakamoto and others 
  Tired of all the hullaballoo surrounding Tolkien I finally purchased LOtR. I enjoy fantasy and tried to give it a fair shake but put the book down from boredom a quarter of the way through. I found myself rereading pages because my mind wasn't getting into his prose. There are better works out there, IMHO.  Everyone sings the praises of him so YOU might enjoy it, but I much prefer George Martin's series A Song of Ice and Fire 
 Before buying this book, I did research online at various bridal sites.  Most of the information in this book could be found online for free!  I also found that the majority of the information pertains destination wedding brides who are planning celebrations in tropical places (of which I am not).  Some good information, but buy it used 
 After reading the first 15 pages of the book, I was appalled at the numerous amounts of 4-letter words she used. A few 4-letter words are okay to make a point. But Janice couldn't write a book without using every other word as a 4-letter word starting with F and S. I am no saint, but there was too much profanity and not enough of her life as a model. She also put down other models, and called them "mutts", claiming she was the worlds first supermodel. I grew up with Janice and Gia and a few others, and I can tell you she was not the first supermodel. This book was written only to promote her upcoming TV show that airs in June of 2006. Janice needs to clean up most of her potty mouth and admit she has an inferiority complex that is in dire need of mending 
 Honestly, tell me what is musical about this. The only thing that changes through any of these "songs" are the lyrics.  Let's summarize: some tub of goo talking about being a low-life to the same beat for a few minutes at a time. I'll stick with music 
 Flimsy, throwaway and ultimately utterly forgetable. This "song" just reeks of novelty. It's like the bastard love child of MC Hammer and Milli Vanilli, and actually no better than either of them. If I am to believe all the hype surrounding this group they are the hottest thing going. It quite frankly makes me glad I'm not a teenager anymore. 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  This so-called "producer's journey" included many anecdotes about shows with which the author was not even involved!  Misspellings of peoples names and incorrect facts  abound.  He barely covered 1776, a seminal show that he should have many  stories about.  Read Ethan Mordden if you want provocative insight on  Broadway musicals 
 I bought this because the two Dino Crisis games on the Playstation 1 were fantastic survival horror fun, and I was very taken with the hype around this game which billed it as a lightgun game that was free roaming rather than on rails. What they didn't say was that it's almost impossible to use the PS2 gun as a fully functioning controller, which is what you really need to do. For anything but shooting, all the buttons you need are in really inconvenient places all around the gun and after half an hour's play time, I had to take a break to rest my aching joints.  In case you haven't seen it, the G-Con2 gun has a teeny-weeny directional pad on the back of it, and it's this that you are expected to use to move yourself around. Now, if you try holding the gun in a standard "aiming" style, you'll soon realise that your fingers are in nowhere near the right position to be able to reach it. You could just hold the gun wrongly and reach it, but you need to be able to fire at the screen regularly to kill dinosaurs. And they don't sit still waiting to be shot! So for most of the game you need to be able to move and fire at the same time. And guess what? It's impossible. Bravo, Capcom. Oh, sorry, they didn't stop there, but added a further control scheme to allow you to strafe. To do this you need still more fingers so that you can still press the directional pad, along with two further buttons way down on the gun barrel at the same time. And be able to pull the trigger. But even that's the end of it - if you want still more pain, try using sniper mode!   As you may have realised, the control scheme completely spoiled the gameplay for me. I'm not fumble-handed by any means, but you would need to be an octopus to manage all this. Which is a shame, because a free-roaming game about shooting dinosaurs is a very exciting idea. And Dino Stalker is otherwise presented very well. The graphics are very good and the monsters all look very impressive. Some stages are really good fun but my favourite ones are those when you are riding some kind of vehicle, which means you don't have to worry about movement at all - hooray! The levels where you get chased down a tunnel by an enraged T-Rex are probably the most fun in the game. The rest is ruined by the controls, which make your life hell. I'll tell you something else too - most levels have a TIME LIMIT!! In case you thought a slow careful hunt would save your fingers, this has been rendered an impossibility by the levels having a clock that counts down to zero - so if you don't rush through the stage, it's game over for you. Kind of negates the joy of free-roaming, doesn't it? You are basically stuck with dashing from point A to point B, killing everything that moves...might as well be on rails. I don't know why this stupid condition was added, as Dino Stalker was not created to be an arcade game.  It's a real waste of potential, but it's only fitting that Dino Stalker was a miserable failure after release. If you buy it, you have only yourself to blame. I managed to finish it - the final stage in the volcanic pit was actually pretty good fun, but this and the other bosses towards the end were endurance tests that caused me agonising hand cramps to get through. Save yourself - I made it through so that I could come here and tell you that you don't have to. Could have been a great game, but it all went wrong due to the impossible way you are expected to be able to use the gun. 
 It's not really her fault, but Cynthia Lennon has written a fairly bland book. She obviously doesn't realize what is so interesting about the guy, and what' makes a decent memoir. Gossip, juicy stories etc. For me, one of  the most fascinating things about Lennon was that he was a Liverpool thug  who had to wear a Beatle suit. Cynthia Lennon really comes across as being  a bit dim. For my money, the most interesting part of a famous person's  life, is what they were like before they were famous -  she could have done  a better job on this early period. For a decent book, read Albert Goldman's  book or Pete Shotton's "In My Life" 
 Anime and manga have to rate as the down side to art and  eroticism...The art is childish and bland at best, more the art of someone on LSD and a migraine than true art. The ugliness of women with purple hair and eyes the size of trash cans does little for the imagination; this is the art of anal retentives, pure and simple. 
 I bought this from Target and wish I hadn't now.  The images on the box are deceiving.  I think Atari or orginal Nintendo may have had better graphics than this!  It's not even close to the game you'd play at the local tavern or bowling alley.  What a waste of money, hope you don't waste yours on this too because you will be GREATLY disappointed 
 I had heard of the importance, and significance of "The Education of Henry Adams" for a long time. I finally determined I needed to read it.  I acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first.   I am sorry  I missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.   Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there.   Granted, he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day.   He was a very good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams.  "The Education of Henry Adams" does not have much real information. He got education in one place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book.   When Eric Sevareid wrote "Not So Wild a Dream," it was compared to "The Education of Henry Adams." That was meant as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry Adams.   Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic. Forgive, please, my ignorance. 
 This book is a very quick read, and touches on the most general concepts of digital recording. It packs a lot of information for such a tiny volume (it's only slightly bigger than your wallet), but unfortunately this doesn't leave room for much detail. At best, this book would make a handy quick-reference to keep in your back pocket during recording sessions. But as others here have noted, this is not a book to recommend for newbies who really want to get their feet wet in the fast-moving world of digital recording 
 I returned this book as soon as I received it.  I thought it was  overpriced for its small size.  I'd also expected the pictures to be irresistable; they turned out to be very mundane and cliche.  I've seen better amateur pictures taken by lab owners themselves.  Bottom line--I would have given this book 0 stars if it were an option 
 Wow.  Some people actually liked this film.  Sad, sad, sad.  This has got to be in my all time top 5 worst movie list.  The Doom Generation is a piece of cinematic suppository.  It is a waste of film, time, money, and energy. For the people who don't find this review any good because you actually liked the movie, you're pathetic.  Really, you must be retarded to actually like this movie.  The person who lent this movie to me said (and I quote) "Oh there is, like, great symbolism in the movie!"  Yeah great symbolism, every number is 666.  WOW!  That must of took a lot of thought.  Also, to thise who liked the movie, I ask you this: "What is the point of this movie?"  Oh yeah, the point is that no matter how bad a movie is there will be some cupcake who actually will buy it and like it.  Much like some people who eat blood sausage in mayonase.    For all of those who are debating to see this movie . . .   Don't.    I mean that in all sincerity.  Don't put yourself through the agony.  If you are into self mutilation and self-inflicted pain of watching a lousy movie, go right ahead.  
 I started reading this book expecting to like it - it's historical, related to Little Women, won the Pulitzer, doesn't feel like fluff, etc. However I had a really difficult time getting into the book.   For one, the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate. I've read other works from the time period she's supposed to be writing in, and rather than feeling in keeping with that era, this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus.   Also, I haven't read her other book so i didn't enter this novel with a trust for the author. Consequentally, I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women, I became defensive. She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work. In some of her character choices, such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (I'm not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene), I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters, and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original.   The first half of the book is also really dry. This could just be my personal taste, but the first half moved so slowly! The book started to pick up about half way through. Overall, the story being told and the Civil War aspects weren't bad, and could be a decent story in their own right if she'd just speed things along at the beginning.  However, I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women. I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book, because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March). The choices that Brooks' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott's book.   In the afterward, Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women, even commenting how the March Family in Alcott's book isn't very interesting, and how "Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee." If she felt that way, then why use them as the basis for her book? Seen in that context, her earlier *huge* liberties with Marmee's character seem to just be a way to "stick it" to Alcott: "ha ha, look how much more realistic Marmee is now! 
 i would review it if i got it. come on guys. i placed the order on 1/6/06. 
 I don't know why I do it to myself anymore.  Goodkind brought a real gem into the world of fantasy novels when he wrote Wizard's First Rule.  Unfortunately, as with most novel series I have read, it was all downhill from there.  The most common complaint in the reviews I have read seems to be that Goodkind's novels have become thinly-veiled philosophy essays, and I concur with that.  I'd also add that the story is predictable, the characters behave foolishly, and (how can I put this in a way that won't spoil the ending?) things just seem to work out a little too conveniently.  After this one, I don't think I'll continue to torture myself with any more of Goodkind's work.  I no longer care what happens to Richard and Kahlan, and as much as I liked them in the first book, that's pretty depressing 
 I'm sure this won't win me any popular votes but, this musical is one that I feel I have to comment on. What has happened to Broadway? Why has London's West End taking over the musical theatre industry? Well, when Broadway produces musicals such as "Little Women."  As a fan of the book I had high hopes for the show expecting it to be as beautiful as "The Secret Garden" or "Jane Eyre." But, this musical does not enhance the book in fact it morphs it into some kind of mindless garbage.  The songs are mindless garbage with no feeling, depth, or emotion and listening to the CD is what one Broadway fan might consider torture. There are a few exceptions "Take A Chance On Me" and "Small Umbrella In The Rain" somehow manage to stand out but,are not enough to save this show from a slow death on Broadway.   The cast is dim witted and has little to no connection to the actual characters they are meant to play... Susan Foster who is well known as Millie does a decent job as Joe but, misses that magic sparkle and tom-boy nature that one would expect from the character Joe. Danny Gurwin- however makes a breakthrough apperance as Laurie seeming to be just about perfect and should have recieved a Tony nomination ... I can only hope he makes a few CDs after this show.  It's obvious why when you listen to "Little Women"- how it came to die slowly and painfully on Broadway- the songs and the script lack the sentiments in the book- with no real love story... or perfect ending this musical is a truly tragic loss.  Made for the sole purpose of becoming a money maker knowing that fans of the book would stand by the show- the producers seemed to hope to make a quick buck. But, I will not stand by this show- their is something in the story that could be turned into a musical that fans could enjoy. All in all Broadway needs something more and fans need something else.. 
 The scenes on the porno set read like some bored housewife's fantasy. I kept rereading them and laughing my head off. The book is awful, only worth  buying for a laugh 
 I find myself in the minority with these reviewers.  "Emma" in this book is the same character as the "Shopoholic" series main character (whose name I have forgotten already).    After reading the Shopoholic series, I was hoping to find a bit of something different in this book and I was disappointed.    The "Emma" character is flaky, shallow and insecure and for the most part so untrue to herself that I find myself (same as in reading the "shopoholic" series) hoping that something horrid will happen to her because she's so annoying and unrealistic.  And yet, the great successful rich man falls in love with her for being her quirky honest self.  I sincerely believe in being honest in relationships too, I agree with the theme that you should be yourself and not settle, that was the best part of this book.    However, I'm left feeling like the rich successful man wouldn't have fallen in love with her if she wasn't a (in her words fat) size six(which is a US size four).  Please.  It's always a lot more believeable that the man really likes her for who she is if the main character isn't so "perfect" physically.    Good things about this book and author:  Good escapism, can read book in a day, good English references.  This is why I keep buying the author's books, perhaps hoping one of them will be more realistic.  So far hasn't happened.  But we all love reading some fantasy/fluff once in a while, and for that I'm grateful for this book. 
 I bought this book and was sorely disappointed. Nothing specific. Just lots of references to self analyzation to see what you think you want to do. You could do this yourself without a book 
 I'll just write a short review because I can't even bother wasting my time writing for this awful film. Avoid this film at all costs unless you want to torture yourself, it gave me a huge head-ache 
 WARNING: There is much hype surrounding this book.  I searched for meat on the bones of this tome and was left hungry.  It reads like a term paper: always talking but not saying very much. At the end there are 40 pages of notes and bibliography listings that left me wondering where all the results of this extensive research went.  Honestly, this entire piece of writing could have been condensed into a solid magazine article, but instead it was stretched out for the sake of filling 2 covers. In conclusion, if you want to read on the legal issues created by the Internet, surely there must be something better out there.   If you are looking for a book that talks of the effects of technology on society, try The New Renaisance by Douglas Robertson 
 I have tested this CD several times and the results came out the same: I still could not sleep. It must work for some, based on the other reviews, but I found the melodies distracting if not annoying. 
 I wanted an inexpensive, small device that I could keep in my backpack with addresses and telephone numbers, and synchronize with a "master" that I'd keep on my PC.  So I bought this.  First, I learned that the advertised "PC Synchronization" capability requires you to shell out another $7.95 and wait another few weeks for delivery.  Second, when I installed the PC Synchronization software on my PC, I learned that it lacks even a rudimentary import or export feature, so I'd have to retype all the 300+ addresses currently in my electronic addressbook.  Finally, I learned that there's a limit of about 36 characters on the "address" and "notes" fields of the database, meaning I do not even have room to store enter my own, relatively simple address, let alone a multi-line business address or reasonable notes like the names of people's children or the date that I updated a record.    I'm sure there are more gotchas I could learn if I spent more time working with it, but I don't have more time to waste on this useless piece of electronics.  
 The professionals in the law field in this book aren't the type of lawyer or law professional most people want to become.  I understand not everyone becomes a six-figure-paid lawyer right out of law school, but this book is ridiculous.  It shadows a guy who wants to only be a law clerk?  Give me a break 
 This is not a serious examination of the "Paul is Dead" clues and should not be mistaken for one. The credibility of the book is nil because it is full of obvious factual errors such as...        Pg 14: Glen Campbell spells his name with one "n" not two. It's Bruce Johnston with a "t". Page 65: Though an early working title for the Stones lp was possibly Her Satanic Majesty's Request, the actual title of the final release was Their Satanic Majesties' Request.  (Neither title makes a whole helluva lotta sense)        Pg 21: Robert Fraser is misidentified as a "photographer," when in fact he was Paul's heroin-addicted gallery owner friend, a business partner with the actual photographer for the Sgt Pepper sessions, Michael Cooper. All this is detailed in the book, Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now by Barry Miles, released after Patterson's book, but Cooper is clearly noted as photographer on the back cover of Sgt Pepper!       Pg 27: Though Lennon may've said that Paul's major contribution to "A Day in the Life" was the "I'd love to turn you on" bit, surely his major contribution is the well-known middle eight, the "woke up, fell out of bed" bit. Paul wrote that exclusive of John and Paul sings it.             Pg 40: The assertion that it "took a full night" to record the "inner groove" is wrong. It was a fairly quick effort on Friday 21 April, part of a session that also included mono mixing for "Only a Northern Song." Surely the mixing took up most of the time. Why, when Patterson's own bibliography lists the Lewisohn book, The Beatles Recording Sessions (univerally admired for its accuracy), did he go to the suspect Dowlding for the lowdown on this issue? (See page 109 of Lewisohn).       Pgs 99-100: The Question and Answer session described as a "press conference" is no such thing. Those questions and the answers were authored by Paul McCartney as part of a promotional insert given away with some early copies of the McCartney lp. There was no real press conference, just a self-serving fake one by a recently solo Beatle.   There's too much reliance here on bad secondary and tertiary sources, and no fact checking. It's just plain awful. This odd pop culture phenomenon deserves  better treatment. (Comments are based on an earlier edition by Dowling Press 
 Definitely must be a children's book. Written by a child for a child with absolutely no life experience.  I read many books of many genres and this book is completely and utterly boring...Maybe he puts together some fancy little one liners and a couple of odd pairing of words. This is definitely not a timeless novel. Not a book I would recommend wasting your time on. Sadly my boyfriend recommended this book to me and I am quite disappointed at his lack of taste and style. My imagination needs a bit more colors than this. Anyone who can rave about this book has absolutely no clue about art or true writing. It is rigidly boring and a pretentious piece of writing. I don't see how anyone can waste there time on this book...It is really very pathetic and disturbing. 
 I can't believe the touch of B.B. King. I enjoy his playing immensely. I know this album gets buried in accolades. But I don't like it. The quality is poor and, differing from other's opinions, the crowd noise takes away from the music. B.B. said, in so many words, that Live at the Regal was far from his choice as his best recording. Typically, he said he wouldn't argue with success--and left it at that. There are so many good albums by B.B. You can't go wrong for $4.65 for the "Ultimate Collection". Sure it doesn't have them all--but it has quite a few of his great songs, including a few from Live at the Regal. I would steer clear of this selection. Or I'll send you mine for free 
 What I expected was a well researched history of marriage laden with colorful commentary, humorous ironies, and insightful analysis.  What I discovered is a heavy-handed argument for gay and lesbian marriage that is tedious to slog through.  The author makes much of the fact that a)marriage has always been a strictly controlled institution that generally has financial implications; and b)that the institution has undergone constant, radical change.  Somehow, this is supposed to support the thesis that states should revise their laws to include same-sex marriage.  Somehow, I missed the logic.  On one hand, since marriage has always been strictly controlled by the state, where's the injustice in the fact that it is still strictly controlled by states who allow only heterosexuals to marry?  And on the other hand, while marriage has survived constant change through the ages, one thing has never changed: it has always been a heterosexual institution.  My bottom line: flawed logic expressed in a pedestrian writing style makes for very dull reading 
 I consider myself a music expert or something close to it. I own close to 10,000 albums. I say this because I hope that you will listen to some very good advice. Do not buy this album. Do not borrow it from the library. If you see it in the record store, look away as fast as you can. 'She used to be my girl' is the WORST song I have ever heard. That is taking into consideration all of the generic bubblegum pop, 80's hair metal, disco, and rock blands that I have had the misfortune to hear. To describe it as infinitely dreadful would be giving it too much credit. 'The O'Jays' should be ashamed and embarrassed that they are responsible for this miserable catastrophe of a 'song.' Absolutely horrible! Hearing this song is like being forced to eat cow dung while suspended by your toe nails above a steaming pit of molten lead. Please, do not buy this album! (Rating: No stars whatsoever! 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 The blurb by Pattison, himself a sensitive analytic reader of Heidegger, is misleading and cautious readers should be advised to take care.  Rudd offers for his own part a "sensitive" analytic reading of Heidegger (and he managages to do so in the context of Wittgenstein's thought, a thinking long hijacked and somewhat deformed by insensitive analytic readings -- which may, perhaps, explain the plaintive wish Pattison expreses). But such approaches only attempt to undo the damage done by the analytic tradition and, sympathetic as this may be, it does not make them continental.  This is by no means a warning against the book, which has to be judged on its own analytic terms, but it is a plea for fairness in making distinctions between the contested terms analytic and continental.. 
 When I first discovered the Stephanie Plum series (I started with Four to Score, then backtracked), I was delighted with the character of Stephanie Plum.  Although she was down on her luck, she was plucky, endearing, and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered.  In earlier books, Stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy, held her own in her on again/off again relationship with boyfriend cop Joe Morelli, and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with Ranger.  She even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin Vinnie, her ex-husband, and her nemesis Joyce Barnhardt.  But now, Stephanie Plum has morphed into someone who is selfish, stubborn and just plain stupid.  She has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself.    In Ten Big Ones, Stephanie is stalked by a gang hit man and, being the intrepid bounty hunter that she is, Stephanie walks right into the eye of the storm.  Deciding that Joe's concern for her safety is too oppressive, she moves out of his house and into Ranger's unoccupied apartment.  In one of her silliest schemes yet, she wrangles Lula and Connie into helping her kidnap a gang member, putting them all in jeopardy.  And as her sister's nuptuals approach, Stephanie becomes more and more obnoxious.  All this is played for laughs, but it misses the mark.  The plot is deja vu, the characters predictable.  Sadly, the loveable characters created long ago by Evanovich are now stuck in a time warp where they never grow up, never change and they go through similar events again and again.  Come on, bring back the old Stephanie and give Morelli something to do other than walk his dog Bob and answer his cell phone.  I'm taking a vacation from this series.  Bring on James Patterson, Laurie King, Lisa Gardner... 
 This book was as much the author's opinion and imagination as anything else. He makes claims that are not substiantiated by facts, biblical or otherwise. I will not purchase further books by this author 
 This was my first experience with Stephen King and I made it to page 150 before I quit.  It was agonizingly slow and it just wasn't my cup of tea.  I told myself that I would quit at page 100 if it didn't seem to go somewhere but I gave it another 50 pages because it was Stephen King.  It was brutal 
 I was disappointed in this book. The photos of the altered patterns are sometimes frustratingly small, and often it is not clear exactly what aleration was done to the pattern piece. In addition, some of the fitting advice is not very good. For example, if you have a wide base of neck, simply making the collar circumference larger will not improve the fit, because you do not have a thick neck--only the base of the neck needs to be accomodated. This book would be suitable for beginning sewists, but it will not satisfy people with advanced sewing and fitting skills 
 i would like to comment on the review by miss dautzenrot but i do not know german or whatever language it is in. so i guess i will have to give a bad review. next time write in english please 
 The point I would like to make is this movie doesn't even deserve that 1 star I was forced to give it...and I shudder to think I HAD to rate it, because it deserves way way below a zero! I never laughed. Not once. I am serious. All I can remember thinking while watchiing this movie was "just keep on sitting, it HAS to get better." But it didn't. It just got worse, worse and worse! Stupid, childish humor can only be funny for the first few times you watch it, there was just an overload of that junk in this movie! There was no real redeeming qualilty to this movie, and I honestly can't understand how it made it into theaters. Final point to be made-do not waste an hour and a half of your life watching this movie, you will just feel stupid after it is over. You would be better off staring at the wall, I am dead serious 
 While this is a great movie, this DVD reproduction does it severe injustice. The sound track is out of sync and the production quality of the DVD is marginal 
 Hated it. Read 45 pages. Aimed to read 75 before throwing in the towel, but couldn't make it that far. Not funny. Not clever. Not even especially entertaining. 
 The book reads like a gripping novel. Unfortunately, the evidence the author uses is pretty much innuendo, hearsay, and rumor. Having been a student there, his comments are exaggerated. Yes, there are some problems about the curriculum and professors who deem themselves self-important, but I doubt this problem is only at Harvard. This book capitalizes on the desire in America to see the  top stumble once in a while 
 seriously, if you've read the joy luck club you've read them all. in case nobody noticed, her books are all the same. whoever said that the kitchen god's wife was a duller version of the joy luck club wasn't that far from the truth because it just WAS the joy luck club, only you've read it already so you knew what was coming. ie fights between mother and daughter. how profound/prosaic. really, read one of amy tan's books and you can talk about all of them with some kind of authority. 
 This is a copy of the review on Amazon.com for Van Zant's Get Right With The Man which is another Sony corrupted title.  "This CD secretly installs DRM (digital rights management) software on your PC without your permission. Not only does it do this, but the software then hides itself by installing as a "root kit."  As per WikiPedia,  -- Root kit From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A root kit is a set of tools used by an intruder after cracking a computer system. These tools can help the attacker maintain his or her access to the system and use it for malicious purposes. Root kits are known to exist for a variety of operating systems such as Linux, Solaris and versions of Microsoft Windows.  A rootkit typically hides logins, processes, files, and logs and may include software to intercept data from terminals, network connections, and the keyboard. In many sources, rootkits are counted as trojan horses. --  In this instance, Sony installs DRM software to copy protect their CD, and prevent it from being copied to various devices, all the while not telling you, the user, or letting you uninstall it because it hides itself from the user and Windows.

 Who would ever wear this monstracity? First of all you got no color, no padding, no pazazz! This shirt makes the garbage bag I wear look like a royal tunic. It is also from a company called Jerzees and it's not a jersey? What up with that? Michael Jordan is probably spinning in his grave 
 John Hodgeman is great when he's on the Jon Stewart show.  The book, sadly,  is boring even as bathroom reading 
 I struggled quite a distance into this book because I love France, but finally I gave up. I found the author to be a poor writer, found her stories to be so farfetched that I decided that she was not being truthful, found her values to be very superficial, found her to be describing things that were not worth reading about--e.g., the car trip to St. Tropez, and her apparent fixation on sex--e.g., her negative descriptions of the way females dress and act in St. Tropez, and her imagings about her husband's indiscretions with the Prince's wife and his dalliance with the girls in the village. Who cares if it happened! Who cares what the author imagines about her husband! You might think her husband would care and the Prince and the Princess would care. I doubt that there even is a Prince and Princess. And if the picture of the author half in a shadows, on the book cover is an example of her professional photographer husband's work, forget it.  With the car trip to St. Tropez, I couldn't take anymore. I took the book back and got a refund 
 Windows XP, and basically any other windows based OS is junk. After using Windows 3.1, 95, 98SE, 2000, ME, and XP, I was getting very sick of the same old boring basic programs. Linux however, has tons of programs with a lot of extra features to it. Spellcheck is one. I have to buy Microsoft Word or some other office program for spell check, and how much?!?! I'll tell you one thing, it ain't free. Linux however, there is spell check, and not just in their word processor. I also found this in their messenger program, email, and even in web browsers, free!  The other thing I hate about Windows is "You must activate your copy, and only one copy per computer". With linux, there is no activating, or "one per computer". You don't have to fear changing hardware and having to call in to reactivate, typing in a ton of numbers and answering questions. You can give someone a copy of linux, and they can try it, for free, and for life! It's not 30 days free, or free for only a few people, it's free for everyone for life!  As for one who mentioned that Linux releases more fixes than Windows, that is true. The difference between Windows and Linux when it comes to releases is like this. When Microsoft finally gets the operating system done enough, they will release it. Linux will release free their OS/software right away. You can download it right away as it becomes available or simply wait until they fix the bugs. So in other words, let's say both OS's have the same software. Day 5 comes along, and this software pretty much works, but may have some bugs. Linux will release this, and you have the "option" of installing it and trying it out, or wait until more bugs are fixed. Windows will not release this until it is more offical and finished. This is why linux has a lot of patches, they give it to you when they first get it going, and as they continue to improve this, you can enjoy it right away and not have to wait so long.  It is also true that Windows can be attacked by viruses within hours, where as linux can take several days/weeks/months. Also, Linux has been proven to give your hardware/computer a longer life span. It can also work better with older hardware so you don't have to be compelled to upgrade all the time.  Why not try out linux? It's a lot cheaper, and you may be amazed by how great it really is. I prefer Mandriva 2006. It's a great system.  Final note -  Windows: Very costly, even more so to get the benefits/features Linux: Free  Windows: One per computer, or buy more licenses Linux: One copy to everyone for life, or each person can have a copy for life  Windows: Boring; basic programs Linux: Several programs, multiple browsers, more than one type of software to fit your needs.  Windows: New hardware/reformat PC: You must spend time on phone and answer questions and type in SEVERAL numbers to activate your PC. Linux: New hardware/reformat: Here's your OS installed; you're good to go!  Windows: Constantly gets attacked by viruses Linux: Quite a lot safer  Windows: Support? lol. Yeah, there may be some Linux: Various sites where you can ask questions for free and get help on your OS  That's just some of the reasons why I love linux 
 I don't understand how people can find these movies funny.  I enjoy a crude comedy as well as the high-brow stuff, having been raised on ANIMAL HOUSE and CADDYSHACK and AIRPLANE!  But the Broken Lizard movies are just lame and laughless.  I realize that humor is very subjective...but these movies are horrible.  I laughed once in SUPER TROOPERS (that's one more laugh than I had for THE WATERBOY or any Kevin Smith film).  I've caught most of CLUB DREAD on cable and, though the blonde chick is smokin' hot, the movie just lays there like a dead teen in a slasher film.  Their latest film, BEER FEST or something, is being advertised as a worthy successor to SUPER TROOPERS, CLUB DREAD and Broken Lizard's last masterpiece, THE DUKES OF HAZZARD. At least they're consistent 
 A fun book yes. But accurate? No. There are many many flaws. For a couple of examples, it says John plays lead guitar on "Dig a Pony" when you can see George playing lead in the film "Let it be" from were the recording was made. It also states that George only played Tamboura on "Within you, Without you" when it's be clear for many years even by George himself that he play the simple "Sitar" parts on it. Did John really play lead guitar on the Let it Be version of "One after 909" and "I've Got a Feeling"? A lot of real info can be found in Mark Lewisohn's book "The Beatles Recording Sessions". This is someone who went thru the original tapes. Anyway, I'm sure there is correct info here but I just don't know what is correct and what isn't, (unless it's obvious of course.) Maybe someone can write a book and correct all these flaws. 
 I haven't got this item because it is too expensive for what it gives. I have a Fujifilm E550 camera which cost is USD 250.00 by this date. This lens cost is USD 95.00 and it need a special adapter ring that cost extra USD 20.00. That means you will pay USD 365.00 for a 8x zoom camera. For that price or less you can get a +10x SLR like camera like the Fujifilm S5100 or S5200. 
 Do not buy this for your xbox.  It sucks.  The unit was functional (well, not defective) and by 'dialing in' to the unit it was able to communicate (with and w/o wires) with my computer.  The first red flag was when the xbox did not recognize the DWL-G820 as a wireless adapter.  This is normal.  It has to be configured with an IP address, which is ridiculous because the wired router connection is normally plug and play.  However, no amount of configuration in the xbox dashboard would allow the xbox to connect wirelessly.  This was even with the assistance of tech support, which is spotty at best.  The folks are nice enough, but getting through can take a very long time.  I'm okay with networks - all of my other stuff works great - but definitely not an expert, and I could go on and on about the changes I made.  I won't, though.  If you prefer painless set-up it's probably best to match brands when designing a wireless network.  I'll give D-link the benefit of the doubt and admit I was using a router of a different brand, but with all of the configuration options on both ends, this should not matter.  Oh, and I read some of the earlier reviews and I agree that this thing runs real hot.  Who knows what that'll do for the product's longevity because I don't plan to keep it.  If I ever got it to function properly and I had small children, then I'd probably mount it out of their reach 
 I READ MOST OF WHAT THE OTHER REVIEWERS WROTE AND I AGREED WITH THEM. THERE REALLY WAS NO DEPTH, BARELY ANY EMOTIONS, THE HERO IS SO VERY DULL. WHAT I DIDN'T GET WAS THE FACT THAT HE WENT AND KISSED THE HEROINE'S SISTER AND RESPONDED, WHAT'S WORSE WAS THAT, THAT PART WAS ONLY 67 PAGES TO THE END. HE DIDN'T REALLY ADMIT HE LOVE HIS WIFE UNTIL SHE ASKED HIM! AND HE REPLIED,   "AYE. I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE. I AM YOUR HUSBAND. HOW CAN YOU DOUBT IT?"  THERE WASN'T EVEN ANY EMOTION AS HE TALKED! BORING! I STILL CAN'T IMAGINE HE WENT AND KISSED SOMEONE ELSE AND FELT NO REMORSE OR GUILT. NO FEELINGS, PRATICALLY FOR WHAT HE DID!  ANOTHER PROBLEM, IS THAT HE SEEMED TO TAKE A LIKING TO THE HEROINE'S LITTLE BROTHER WAY TOO MUCH! IT'S ALMOST DISTURBING!  THE FACT THAT IN THE SEQUEL, CLEVE MENTIONED OF THE HERO'S LOVE FOR THE BOY MORE THAN THE WORLD AND PERHAPS HIS WIFE TOO. PREHAPS? I MEAN THAT IS EXTREMELY MESSED UP! '&'  I'M NOT GIVING THIS BOOK A TOTAL ZERO BECAUSE IT IS COULTER AFTER ALL. I STILL HAVE HOPE, HER OTHER BOOKS ARE BETTER.  
 I tried to read this book(translated) to the portuguese, about 15 years ago.Even never finishing it, I as a brazilian (unemployed) agronomist must tell the reality about weberianism. At first, Max Weber was a man looking to show the reality.He wasn't a bigot(or mad) such as Loraine Boettner, Eric Jon Phelps, etc. With no doubt, Max Weber was a great scholar, a man with great IQ, a man man looking for reality.Even with this qualities, Max weber was wrong.Even a man like Max Weber, like you and me, is ever a prisioner of his times, informations and reality. The core idea of this book is that capitalism, industrial revolution and modern science were made by protestantism. Very believed idea in Weber's times. In fact, Weber puts "the cart ahead of the horse", in this idea.In fact, modern world wasn't created after Luther.It was shaped in XV Century, with the press and Great Navigations. The press was invented by a catholic german, called Johann Gutemberg.All the great navigators were catholic men.Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Bartolomeu Dias,Cabral, Gil Eanes,etc. 100% of then were catholics and were under catholic kings money and orders.With the Great discoveries the American continent was under Europe's hands.The claim that protestantism was the source of Europe's power was and is a fraud. In fact economically and lively, after Luther, protestant Germany became a nightmare until the end of 30 years War, in 1648.The claim that protestantism was good for Europe is a possibility, not a fact. In fact, we could see protestantism is a result of nacionalism, church's abuses, education and greed for church's money. Not all protestants countries of Europe had good economical results.Germany was doomed after Luther's Reformations.Not all catholic countries had bad economic results, as France shows.Spain and Portugal were bad, after jew's expeling, not after any reformation. With the Industrial Revolution, coal became condition "sine qua non" for economical sucess.And the Geology(not theology)decided the future for nations in Europe.With no coal Portugal, Spain, Italy were senteced to relatively poverty, in Europe.France with bad coal reserves, has some dificults in industrialization.Belgium, even more than 90% of his population in catholic church, had no economical problems, because Belgium had great coal's mines. Why England had so good economic results, ahead of every other european country?Beeing an island, England shouldn't have an expensive army against invasions.Then, England could built the biggest navy in the world.Geography, not theology gave economic sucess to England in XVI and XVII Century.With the Industrial Revolution, England had coal reserves looking to be minerated. Geography and later geology gave England industrial and economical sucess.With the 30 years War, Germany was splited in about 300 feufdoms. The England's decadency also came from no theological problemas, but geological, political and tecnological problems.With the reunification of Germany, an industrial enemy was created in continental Europe.With the invention of airplane, England could be attacked by an enemy with no navy.With the coming of oil's age, England (North Sea oil's reserves not found before the 1960's) had to import100% of his fuel.With both World wars, England's empire was sentenced to death. Protestantism in fact, like today, was ever divided in thounsands of cults, since his beginnings.If fact all kinds of protestantisms are image and similarity of his human creator, culture and society.Luther made a anti-semithic protestantism suc as himself.Calvin made a bank's friend protestantism, as himself was.And the England's king Henry VIII made an english protestantism.All reformator made a Jesus equal to himself.This fact is true until today.Protestantism don't make a society and culture.In fact a society and a culture makes a protestantism. The brazilian and latin american reality shows that protestantism itself don't make economical sucess.Here in Brazil, 80% of people who go to a church, go to a protestant (pentecostal) church.Do we have economical sucess with all this protestantism? NO!!!! This same fact happened in many parts of latin America.Bad economic results followed protestantism growing.El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua all are as protestants(pentecostals) as Brazil.All with bad economical results. About 35% of brazilian population are protestants, against about 80% of brazilian maids are protestants.In fact the brazilian protestants are, poorer than the general brazilian population.Also brazilian states with more protestants have bigger crime rates.In fact, more protestants, more crimes in Brazil.The poorest of all religious groups in Brazil are, the protestants(pentecostal).Only protestantism as a medicine for economical, political and cultural troubles is a quackery. Not a single african or latin american country had good economical results after protestantism's growing.At the same time, Spain with less than 1% of his population protestant, is an economical sucess.Italy and Portugal with only about 2% of protestants are also developed countries.  This book is a source with some good things to read.As I wrote up, Max Weber was an honest scholar, not a mad or a bigot.After all, Max Weber was looking to show us the reality, but he only wrote us rooted, in his own times, believes and realities.Every man is a prisioner of his times, friends and realities.And Max Weber wasn't an exception.          
 The Virgin Suicides starring Kristen Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Kathleen Turner and James Woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline. This film is directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), I really tried to like this movie but I was fooling myself, you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the Coppola legacy but just because your father is Frances Ford Coppola doesn't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time. Sometimes magic does not stirke twice. How can all five sisters end up killing themselves, their homelife wasn't that unbearable, a lot of parents are religious, but that doesn't mean you'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide. Kristen Dunst just gets on my nerves, her acting is the same in every film. Don't believe the hype, The Virgin Suicides is not a groundbreaking, poetic film 
 I think someone else wrote the title. It doesn't fit the book, to begin with. Then there are these reviews. Half seem to be written by someone on the payroll. What positive sales information I managed to extract from this book (as minimal as it is) could have been written in a 5 page summary. For anyone that is new to sales and involved solely in real estate sales, then I could see them getting something to add to their arsenal of tricks. I am in automotive sales, however, and though the title suggests that I could find nuggets and be able to sell "anything" I am disappointeed in what I read. A better book (for automotive sales) is "Cars and People; How to Put the Two Together" or (for a good sales foundation) any EARLY Zig Ziglar book will do. 
 Anyone with the name Luke Timothy and a background as a Benedictine monk (called "black" monks and with a history dating back 1500 years) surely can't be impartial when looking at the historical Jesus. And true to form, Luke Timothy Johnson engages in Christian apologetics rather than historical analysis in his 1996 book "The Real Jesus." Almost the entire book is spent criticizing other people's work, from the Jesus Seminar to Barbara Theiring, Bishop Spong, Burton Mack, John Dominic Crossan, A.N. Wilson, Stephen Mitchell, Marcus Borg, etc. In each case Johnson seems to begrudge the authors their financial success and 15 minutes of fame. Personally I find little value in  books that are critical of other people's work. I much prefer to let an author state his own case. This Johnson doesn't do, apart from a few cursory pages at the end of the book.  If you're looking for Christian apologetic criticism of historical Jesus works from 1980 to 1995, then this book is for you. Otherwise, give it a pass 
 2 and a half stars.  This is not an accurate representation of Bay Area Hip-Hop. It's a mediocre attempt in trying to appeal to the mainstream audience. Bay Area artists that signed major deals never made an album that was creatively better than their independent releases. Don't waste your time with this record and buy his last album "I Give You My Word".  Highlights of "The Rock"- Frisco Stand Up, Planet Fillmoe, So Young, Way More Than They Can See, Pimps & Hustlas 
 James has always produced until this album.  Laid is outstanding and their previous albums have more of a full connection, but this is definitely an attempt to assemble Booth's poignant lyrics with music...all in vain.  If  you like James and lyricist Booth, get the sheet and read that greatness 
 I bought this book thinking that it would be fascinating!  I read online reviews that made it seem credible.  Unfortunately, many of these reviewers did not have a background in psychology but I do. I was disappointed with this author's ludicrous claims and sloppy scholarship.  Some claims are loosely supported by actual studies with some validity while other claims have no valid or reliable experiments/studies to back them up.  For example, Verny claims that babies that are induced are more prone to sexual sadism and masochistic behavior!  He cites no study to back up this ridiculous claim!  Also, Verny equates emotional health with the personality traits of openness and extroversion.  To suggest that a child who is shy and introverted is maladjusted is bad psychology. Personality theory has proven that these can be innate and inborn traits.  My complaints go on... PLEASE, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK.  It's muddy...some valid claims mixed with very stupid ones.  It's an example of how someone with "M.D" at the end of his/her name can sell a book that the layperson believes due to the author's credentials.  However, I can assure you that my graduate school professors would have given this research writer a D 
 I compared a few wedding vow books and although I thank all the authors for their efforts, the one I found the most useful, comprehensive, progressive in thinking, and with a generous mix of both spiritual and secular vows is "With These Words...I Thee Wed". Guess that's why it's been around the longest 
 This film is painfully outdated -- and it was never good to begin with. I suppose you would have to call this a "romantic thriller comedy." And it fails on every one of these fronts. The thriller portion is preposterous, nothing but a convoluted story from a 60s TV show. It's not particularly funny either -- oh, but it tries to be. The romance portion probably comes across the best, but this is only because of the excellent actors in the leads.  No, what "Into the Night" has going for it is a quirky, unique premise that it never delivers on. Landis seems more concerned with jamming the scenes with pointless cameos and in-jokes. This film, which could have been regarded as an underground classic, has none of the substance to garner such praise. And it does not receive it. "After Hours", which came out the same year, is vastly superior.   The best thing about "Into the night" is watching a young, gorgeous, pre-Catwoman Michelle Pfeiffer, some LA landmarks that have since been demolished (Ships diner) -- and the original one-sheet poster is very, very cool 
 I have friends who might be into this stuff, if only because they like the old and the strange. Me, I'm just like -- Is this "It's a Wonderful Life"?  I think I might have enjoyed this more if it was a novel or maybe if I picked up the script. As it is, this just barely seems to translate into a movie, and--forgive me for I have my own opinion--"City of Angels" was a good movie. Too bad if you don't like all this "contemporary nonsense." I feel like it worked.  My opinion: it's long, it's boring, it's hard to hear. Even if it has a message, I just can't relate to it. So maybe that's my problem.  Your opinion: your own. keep it. you're lucky I gave it two stars 
 Can be easily captured without buying the DVD. Firstly, rip up $13. Then, beat yourself over the head with a hammer until your brains are coming out of your nose. Then, have Dana Carvey spit on you. Finally, shoot yourself in the stomach.  This movie is not funny, entertaining. It does not even have a remotely interesting story. As some of the other reveiwers have said, this movie has the same terrible joke, repeated throughout the whole movie.  Avoid this one like the plague 
 While being easy to read, this book is not exactly the "practical guide" that some may be looking for.  This book is more about history and stories than "how to".  The actual writing, leaves a bit to be desired as well.  For anyone looking for a book oriented more toward Tantra, I would recommend "Tantra: The art of concious loving" 
 This book exposes nothing.  There are way-better books out there, better written and better researched.  I bought it after watching her much needed bashing of these retarded Neo-Cons on Bill Maher's show.  Here's the lowdown:  She grabs one subject and repeats it dozens of different ways, adding new twists, puns and jokes.  The book has no cohesive structure.  Like an ADD-sufferer on coffee. Worst of all, she was part of that system.  She gets divorced, and boom.  Her politics take a 180 degree turn.  How's that supposed to work?  If the payoffs from these interest groups are providing for your cushy life, it's good.  But if you divorce your Neo-Con husband, then, all of a sudden it's bad.  Honestly, I see a lack of integrity here.  So, if tomorrow she marries a communist, will she be singing Lenin's praises?  Or how about a devil-worshiper?  Will she go satanic? Then, I watched her devolve on Maher's show, constantly doing nothing but vent her anger at her ex-husband in a thin veil of politics.  She ran for Cali governor and her points were high.  Then, she started opening her mouth, and her points plumetted.  For good reason.  Because she ran a negative campaign against the Governator. (Which is exactly the same thing she acuses Neo-Cons of doing in this worthless book). But, of course, knee-jerk liberals love her, because they see her as a repented sinner who sees the error of her ways.  LET ME SUM UP THE BOOK FOR YOU:  A party holds on to power too long, it becomes corrupt.  Campaign reform is needed.  End of story 
 Dear Sean,  Thanks for sending me your book "Deliver Us from Evil : Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism." Before I put the book down and turn off my light and go to sleep I just wanted to dash off a quick letter to you so you could clarify a thing or two for me. Let me get this straight. You'd like to see all Liberals vanish from the face of the American political system and have only Conservative Republicans running the show...is that right? Hmm...Let me see, if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system. There was the Soviet Union 1917-1991, Fascist Italy 1923-1945, Nazi Germany 1933-1945. Those are three just off the top of my head. They didn't like Liberalism either. Well, Sean I got to get going. I'm sure I'll write again soon.  All my best,  Bill  PS. Remember, fanaticism is far from being fair and balanced 
 I agree with the other negative review below- Uninspired, simply forgettable radio trash.  Cliched lyrics?  Check.  Muddy, simple riffs?  Check.  Boring drumming with a couple of poorly played double bass kicks?  Check.    Thank god I got this in a box of cd's from a DJ buddy of mine for free awhile back.  If I actually paid for this crap I'd have to kill myself.    Judging from all the "positive" reviews however, it seems some people at Lava records or possibly the band themselves (if they're still around.  I hope not.) have been trying to plug this  sorry excuse for music.  
 I brought this movie a couple of days ago and I was very very very disappointed. Don't waste your money on this movie 
 Has everyone gone insane?  As an English teacher who has taught this novel for a couple years, I was looking for a little something more faithful to the novel than the original version. Hah!  This piece of trash is the worst version of a classic novel I've seen in 20 years of teaching. There were approximately three moments in the movie that actually had to do with the text, and I'm sure that was purely accidental. The monster is a gangster, Frankenstein looks like one of the Spartans in The 300, Elizabeth is a deranged emo, and Clerval has been relegated to to role of idiotic womanizer. When the credits rolled at the end and I saw that Branagh had directed this film (he who created the most watchable, beautiful, and textually accurate version of Hamlet ever), I thought I may as well burn myself on a funeral pyre (one of the few textually accurate details in this horror of a film).  Here's the deal - don't waste your time. Read the book. Byron and Shelley were right - Mary had somehting going with this story - too bad Branagh forgot to read it 
 This book is full of lovely photographs of English cottage gardens but I found it to be of no use to me as a gardener in the United States. The so-called layout plans are just rough sketches with no labeling of plants. The growing guidelines and plant lists are standard--nothing new there. I enjoyed looking at photos of Tasha Tudor's gardens but I think this book is a waste of money 
 Atlantis: Milo's Return plays out more like three saturday morning cartoon episodes that they added interconnecting scenes to. It has the poor quality of the average saturday morning toons.   This is not really much of a sequel. They present three seperate, unrelated tales of misadventure that Milo and the gang have to go through. Sure, they are all related to artifacts that were created by the king of Atlantis, but that's about it.   Poorly conceived, blandly presented, and with an ALL NEW VOICE for Milo (they obviously couldn't get Michael J. Fox back for this due to the poor quality), the standard Disney trademark is on this when everything turns out perfectly peaceful in the end.  Kids might enjoy it, but Scooby Doo at its worst is more entertaining 
 There are enough reviews of the main movie story so I don't need to add anything in that regard.  But, what on earth does a lesbian sub-story (in both regards) have to do with the story as a whole?  Nothing.  So, we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue-grass music and the Appalachian way of life that, instead, heads for the trash bin 
 No star is the best rating for this garbage.Here's a great idea if you want to hear Kid Rock songs listen to THE REAL KID ROCK, not this goof.This guy has some talent so why doesn't he do his own original music.Your money would be better spent buying beachfront property in Alaska 
 Though this book discussed and touches on many different performance modifications it lacks ANY true technical information and is merely a good read for those interested in history and development more so than how to get true performance gains. Most of the technical information is severely outdated (late 80's and early 90's) and supports methodology which has been proven as a performance LOSS in this day and age (such as mirror finish port polishing!)  Is a nostalgic rag to be read but not a guide to go by... 
 I have to say I truly hated this book. The premise sounded interesting so I decided to give it a try.  I've read all her other books in the series and found the characters to be quirky.  This time I found her usual friends and co-workers to be boring and self involved caricatures. The groundwork was there for an interesting serial killer with complex motivation but it never developed that way. The constant head hopping was annoying and the ending came out of nowhere.  Cromwell has obviously gotten bored with her characters and it shows.  This is my last Cromwell 
 This dvd barely worked and didn't do any good. This might be good if your potty training a boy. It is very boy oriented. They need to list it for boys and make a separate one for girls. How can a girl relate to a story about a boy potty training, they are not the same 
 I could sum up this book very quickly:  1) Trust in God for everything  2) Read the Bible  3) Attend church  4) Ask your husband, church, other Christians for help  The book is full of fluffy ideas like: "We need to know ourselves the way God knows us" "Find a Christian counselor" and advice for single mothers to simply attend church if seeking help.  The book primarily revolves around the Bible and its interpretation of parenting. Why not cut out the middle-man and just read this "wonderful book?" It's not like the Bible is a work in progress.   This book is more about proselytizing and keeping Evangelicals reading "inspired" books rather than competing viewpoints. And with America being one of the most pure Christian nations in the world ( US is more Christian than India is Hindu and Israel is Jewish ). Anything published by Zondervan should be looked at skeptically.   I also dislike how males are stilled deemed unworthy parents in the Christian community. They can assist and help , but cannot be considered primary parents. But given this books lack of true substance, I doubt it would have made any difference 
 I bought this book because I was intrigued by the title. I expected a book that considered words used with criminal intent, in general.   I am disappointed that pornography is the only crime considered here. I wish the author had examined other kinds of cases--not to mention many many more specific examples. There is probably a wealth of legal material on such crimes, if only the author had broadened her horizons.  While I agree that pornography can be a crime, I find the author's arguments used to ban it fundamentally flawed. As other reviewers have noted, this book is argued poorly, uses a shoddy set of examples, and definitely runs afoul of logic.   Had I been interested in an anti-pornography book, I would have preferred one showing practical means to legally limit its damage.   This book does not argue cogently that the first and 14th amendments are NOT considered equally in cases of criminal use of words.  Neither does it effectively show that words can be criminal, or suggest means to prosecute such crimes. A pity.  --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 Purchased this TV December 10 after much research. Unfortunately for me the TV was defective on arrival! When it is working it is a very nice TV, but the customer support from both Olevia and Target leave a lot to be desired. Target will not replace the item... the corporate policy I am told is the item must be returned via shipping... you are responsible for packing the item and putting it outside for the shipping company to pick up... and once target receives the TV back and it is processed thru receiving a credit will be issued... they say within 30 days... my credit card company AE says it will take 6 - 12 weeks... All this time with no TV, paying interest on the credit card or paying the balance and not be able to purchase another one until everything clears... I don't know about you but that is pretty steep! Now Olevia... though it is under warranty I again must pack up the TV in the original box, ship it back to Olevia and when they receive it back they will ship another one to me... the TV weighs 100lbs packing it up is not easy and again I am without TV for a month or more while the transaction takes place. If I want a TV at the time the defective one is shipped I must give Olevia a $1600 credit card hold while they process the transaction.  EITHER WAY THE CONSUMER GETS SCREWED!! The television has a one year warranty, I purchased the extended warranty... What else could I have done!?! I am told by both TARGET and OLEVIA this policy falls under the "other terms and conditions" ... I wonder why they don't actually say that?  BUYER BEWARE OF TARGET AND OLEVIA!!! 
 These sheets are aweful.  They are so wrinkly and stiff.  I should have listened to all of the other reviewers when  they said the same thing.  TRUST   me.  They're not worth the money not matter how good the deal sounds 
 It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.  It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends?  I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something.  
 I think that if you are into literature than you might like this book but I think that it wasnt as great as my professor said it was going to b 
 It is a shame that American film classics ( like L and H)  get more attention and love outside of the US than in it. I just bought the Universal Laurel and Hardy 21 Volume Box set which is only available in Europe from Amazon UK (region 2). This set is EVERYTHING people are saying it is. It is a complete film history of the boys which starts with the boys early silent films ( some solo efferts) and goes though the Hal Roach Features. All the prints are restored and of pristine quality. A truly beautiful set and a worthy tribute to the boys. There are some missing films ( I assume for copyright reasons) such as Babes in Toyland, The Devils Brother, Bonnie Scotland and Flying Deuces.   To acomadate these DVDs I bought a region free DVD player off Amazon,which is the only way to go if you really want to collect. The DVD player was very cheap. plays beautfully and  is well worth the investment. As a side note if you have a region free player all the DVDs in the Universal Box set are also availble as single dics, in case you don't want to spend all the money at once or just want a few of the films. If you love Laurel and Hardy this is the only way to go! Anything to screw Hallmark and the corperate monster!! Why did they buy these great films just to sit on them and distribute half-A prints!!!  
 Prometheus Deception, like most of Ludlum's books, is very fast paced with little break in the action. It is full of twists and turns, with the unexpected occurring every now and then. However, the book seems like a desperate attempt at coming up with a plot and then trying to make the whole story somewhat sensible (needless to say, Ludlum fails miserably). There are instances when you're left wondering whether the sequence of events or the events themselves even make sense. Yes, we are living in a world of increased government surveillance, but I'm sure Ludlum, being the espoinage maestro that he is, could come up with a better plot than this 
 White Teeth was a tolerable read however I tried to read this on and off over a period of 2 years until I was determined not to let my money go to complete waste. Result was I skim read it all just to get it over and done with. I found the phrases repetitive with a lot of useless details. I think the characters were written with the aim to have enough flaws as to appear realistic but I found them all rather flat and I held no particular regard for any of them. In the end I couldn't care less about what happened, I just wanted to get to the last page 
 When you do a search for Shania Twain this video pops up. I can't even find her in the half time show. Is there a football player with the same name? She is the greatest female vocalist of all time and is much prettier than those football players, but I am sure she doesn't play football. LO 
 I saw the NY Dolls at Mercer Art Center back in their first year. Frankly, they were amateurish at best; simply awful on a bad night. And time has changed nothing. This record is tedious bordering on unlistenable noise. What time HAS changed is the reverence and "importance" people have attached ot them. In reality they were and are at most a footnote on the glam and pre-punk scene. WIth other bands like the Miamis, they tried to be something that they simply wer enever competent or creative enough to be. So despite all the posturing and pontificating about their alleged importance, instead, I suggest you listen to anyone of the clips provided and see for yourself that this is a record not worth buying 
 This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever 
 But it;s from the 70's.  It starts out pretty good with pai paio looking like a baddassss in a cool white suit.  And it actually gets very unwatchable from this pint on.  I actually stuck through this for about 45 minutes until I had to fastforward to the end, and it still did not live up to the begining, and the beginning really sucked, I just thought it had potential.  Pai paio actually looks pretty good, but NOTHING else was good in this.  It truly deserves that 1/5, and wouold have gotten the 0/5 if they had it.  Very sad movie.  I paid 5 dollars and 99 cents at the local cd used place and this is seriously worth around, can't think of a price, so I would say if you payed nothing for it you will get ripped off.  So do not buy, movie starts out ok, but jimmy wang yu's screaming tiger is better.  I thought that was bad, and jason is so much better than jimmy, it is just truly horrible to watch this movie.  DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
 Am I the only person on the planet that thinks Rent is garbage? Saw it at the National Theater and had a hard time sitting through it. The music is pop bubble gum nonsense. I think it never would have become a hit had Larson not died the week of it's opening. 
 I thought this book was about the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. This is not the book I was thinking about. It was a book written by Benjamin Franklin but which is written after he wrote his famous autobiography. The book did not contain the contents of his autobiography but contains his writings that were written during his last years that was not included in his widely read autobiography.  The book title says it is 'compleated' autobiography. The book's title should be 'Last memoirs of Benjamin Frankilin 
 the book the color purple is a very good book.The book is kind of hard to understand because of the way that they talk. The book is about a girl  name celie and she and she was the oldest out of her sisters so she was picked 2 marry a guy and that guy used 2 beat her and rap her. this book make me think about what do i what to be when i grow up and that im going to make more of my self as a black young lady 
 I love movies and watch at least two movies a week.  This was one of the worst movies I've ever had the displeasure to watch. The characters were not believable, there was no plausible story or plot, the horse the Skeletor rode kept changing color (a brown horse to a black horse)as did his cape, (it went from new to tattered). Do not waste your time watching this movie, it made absolutely no sense.   
 If Paul and Ringo decided to record an album together and called themselves "The Beatles," would everyone think that was cool? Of course not. Big Star was a quartet, ultimately reduced to two by the time this uneven and often gloomy collection of songs was recorded. Chris Bell defined the sound of, and essentially produced, the excellent debut album "#1 Record." If you want to know how much the Big Star sound had already been crystallized before "LX" Chilton got involved, listen to the three eventual Big Star tracks on the album by Bell's previous band "Rock City," now commercially available on CD. Fast forwarding back to Big Star, Bell was involved in the first demo session for "Radio City" and wrote a good chunk of "Back Of A Car" before departing the band. Yes, Chilton deserves credit for carrying on and writing great songs like "September Gurls," for the second album, but by the time his sometimes-cowriter Andy Hummel had also departed, the band had essentially ended. Chilton and drummer Jody Stephens admitted as much when they called themselves "Sister Lovers" on the session sheets for the album later mislabled as "Big Star's Third." Stephens, as noted by other reviewers, actually writes and sings one of the better songs on the album, "For You." Alex has his moments here and there, but seems to have lost his spark for writing and recording what we would now refer to as "power pop." And despite his eventual cult status, has never really regained it in any sustained way. Personally, I prefer Bell's "I Am The Cosmos," but if you're going to pick up "Third," get the Bell CD as well, and decide for yourself who still had the chops 
 This really is a mixed lot with some catchy tunes and some haunting melodies and also some fillers. Like 'In Blue' before it, this does not reach the standards of 'Talk On Corners' or 'VH1 Live in Dublin'. Standout tracks are 'Summer Sunshine', 'Long Night' and the Gavin Friday/Bono collaboration 'Time Enough For Tears'.Other than that, the rest are B-Sides at best...Disappointin 
  Author Joshua Harris, who have scored (no pun intended, mind you) a great hit with his first book on the subject of dating called I KISSED DATING GOODBYE, spawned a sequel documenting his courtshipping days with his now found wife called BOY MEETS GIRL. This time Harris had come up with a third installment on the subject of Lust, particularly on the aspect of human sexuality.  Eventually the book just went on as being more of a stuff to only propagate organized churches' ideals rather than to convey to its readers what its premise supposedly have guaranteed: a book to help Christians overcome their problems with sexual temptations - presenting a certain idea of dependence to the common church communities' norms (chapters 8: "Lone Rangers are Dead Rangers") although it did affirmed that the key to total deliverance from sinful problems IS a sturdy connection with God (chapter 3: "You Can't Save Yourself"), which at the same time apparently only show the inconsistencies of what are the currently and commonly accepted prevailing concepts amidst the church circles of our day; along with their popular explanation regarding God's salvation - that runs like a confusing pretzel logic, which only go around in tangled circles, proclaiming that being Salvation is only attainable by Grace, one has no real need to obey God, and yet they would strain a gnat to follow into their church's system, or otherwise condemnation is not too far around to be driveled out into the particular if one wouldn't submit into the dictates of their church's ideals.  Thus, unfortunately this book never delivered; and in the long run, Harris stated it so in the book that he has no solution and there is no secret method at all in overcoming the lust problem.  Harris' book NOT EVEN A HINT live up to its title under the constriction of being a completely impotent material to help anyone who has a great problem with sexual temptations.  And not as to dismiss or belittle every person's own strengths and capacities regarding an individual's own area of weaknesses - I find it crazy on the author's part to have strong sexual problems when it comes to seeing a copy of lingerie catalogues. I mean being that he is a Christian, and married to his wife, which would mean that he loves his wife synonymous to his devotion and commitment with his wife in that respect, presumably - and in being thus out of his respect for his wife - sure enough although its automatic within a male's psyche to have that sexual suggestion in the mind whenever the sight of an `insufficiently' clad woman comes along - he would've not have a problem at all with that and be tempted to indulge in it; or otherwise there is something wrong with his own perspective as a Christian, and for that matter: about his love for his wife and how she really meant to him. 'Cause if one is really in love and needless to say devoted out of that condition to his wife - he wouldn't have the knack to look lustfully at nor desire any other women at all but his very own wife (believe you that!).  Thus at this point, it only gives the idea that Harris should've taken more time in analyzing his own personal condition, and learn more about the topic at hand before coming out with this book on the subject.  The aspect of a person's sexuality is the most private and personal thing that each person possessed. As occultist and book writer Donald Michael Kraig wrote on his book MODERN MAGICK, "Therefore, sex is totally involved in our psyches. Control a person's sex life and ... you control the person." Kraig cites that the matter regarding sexuality is the very aspect wherein those who'd like to manipulate and control its subjects within a group, sect or cult is the very effective means to do so and is indeed used for "brainwashing" methods. It's crazy that in most church communities these days, they even control matters of courtship within their members.  Not for the purpose of trying to peeve away many "christians" that perhaps this little review have done enough already for those who are so Up with Joshua Harris (as he's someone who's in the camp of their church's idealisms) - I think so-called Church of Satan founder Anton LaVae presented a more better idea regarding the method to solve the problem of sexual urges (although I bet that his motives could be moot as far as his sincerity goes, under the context that he's on for the faade of trying to assert an appearance of some idyllic pretense against the Christians, and that it's not for the sake of plain earnestness in itself) - that one could have the means for sexual release or relief, through indulging in sexual fantasies without committing to involve anyone upon it. Such as in example - one would masturbate without fantasizing to involve any real person within those fantasies, but are such that are consisting only of self-created images (kinda like in the movie COOL WORLD) or of a fictionary person visualized for those sex-fantasies. Therefore under that context, not only would the individual be free from the act of fornication but is also not guilty of committing any mental adultery towards another person .  Deliverance from sexual struggles involves one's own personal acceptance, understanding and knowledge about his or her own sexuality.   There are other books and resource materials that are much more helpful than this one by Joshua Harris that are available out there. Hence regarding the topic, NOT EVEN A HINT scores not an inch of any helpful doze for its readers.   Rather, Smooch unnecessary church demands goodbye. 
 Appleseed suffers from the problem most big budget, CGI enhanced anime theatrical releases have: Gorgeous visuals, but a incomprehensible story filled with dull cliche dialog. Trust me, I was sucked in by the amazing trailer like most of you. I wanted this to be a great movie (as I am a fan of the OAV animated series). Appleseed is worth seeing for the visuals alone... but that is about all 
 I'm not a big fan of Maddox. The beginning of the book is funny and got me interested to read more. I was disappointed to see the rest of the book to be predictable and boring, if not it would be just plain stupid 
 sucks. If you like this album you are a poser. That means you think cradle of filth is black metal and slipknot is death metal. One guy I know that listens to norma jean, as i lay dying, and unearth, called me emo for listening to acid bath. How stupid can you be? You posers need to wise up and listen to real metal, such as Morbid Angel, Darkthrone, Amon Amarth, OLD Sepultura, and Dissection 
 As someone who lived through and participated in the events Michener described I was deeply upset by his book which I feel is nothing less than a falsification of history. Clearly Michener, who was on friendly terms  with Nixon and his crowd, had a hidden agenda in trying to discredit  radical student activism and the movement against the War in Vietnam, a war  which Michener supported.  Anyone interested in getting both sides of this  story should read I.F. Stone's book, "How Murder Went Unpunished at  Kent State."  Stone's view is diametrically opposed to that of  Michener whom he denounced in person as a shameless propagandist for the  Nixon Administration on NBC's Today Show in 197 
 I see from another comment that this shoe was listed as having a real leather upper, which is why I bought it.  I see now that the description has been corrected, but too late for me.  also, the sizing does not run true as the current description states.  I usually wear 9.5, but I have bloody blisters from trying to play in these shoes 
 The Vibram soles leave black streaks all over the floors, and make it so I cannot wear them at work.  I love Rockports in general, and these are comfortable and well made as expected, but they leave a trail of scuff marks 
 Employment Law for Business, 2nd Edition, is a text that covers legal topics such as; The Employer-employee Relationship, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Affirmative Action, Employment Discrimination, Sexual  Harassment, Job Performance and Behavior, Rights of Privacy, Protection of  Employee Safety, Income, Retirement, and Health.  This is a good tool for  managers 
 I absolutely loved the Left Behind series...some installments more than others, of course, but it will always remain one of my favorite series. At first I was excited to hear that they were going to write prequels...a chance to get to see how the characters in Left Behind became who they were, and all that...but after getting a few chapters into the book, I was struck by how boring it all was. Also, it felt like the authors went a little too into detail about some of the Satanic stuff...but maybe that was just me.  Despite my disappointment with The Rising, I will probably continue to read the prequels; one can only hope that it gets better from here 
 This must have been a made-for-TV movie. I struggle to remember when I've seen anything so badly put together.   The animation is even worse than that of some movies in the 60's and 70's. The casting, acting, and directing are a complete shambles. I wish that instead of selecting one star for the rating I could have selected no star at all.  I made the mistake of thinking that because Patrick Stewart was in it playing the role of Captain Nemo, and that because the movie is 170 minutes long, that it was perhaps an artfully-produced, in-depth production of the original story. But from the way the scenes are cut apart, obviously to make room for insertion of TV commercials, this thoroughly awful treatment of Verne's classic masterpiece has "made for TV" all through it.   They got the whole thing with the pirate ship wrong, focusing instead on the badly-acted performances of a bunch of people we rarely, if ever, saw before, and hopefully won't see again. There wasn't even a grand finale with the volcano. The horribly animated lava just kind of slops along the landscape and intercut with that are the survivors rowing out into the open ocean. We don't even get to see the death of Nemo and destruction of the Nautilus. All in all, without doubt, one of the worst movies I've seen in years. You have been warned. 
 how come this book thinks school is about...boys,firneds,hot outfits.thats not how my school is.some schools have unforms.and shool is not about hot clothes.school is about larening things not makeing things 
 Having not seen the orginal Rudolph TV show in a very long time I forgot what the story line was... remember that in this version of the story the snowman eats reindeers and apparently elves or anything else that would be upsetting to a child. There are a couple of scary illustrations in this book. My 3 year old was in love with the Rudolph movie but once he saw this book he refused to ever have anything to do with Rudolph again because he said he "didn't like the scary snowman".  Yes, I know it's a classic, but be warned 
 Got "When Jolson Was King" today. What a disappointment. It's the kind of book you can read straight through at one sitting. Not because it's so engrossing, but because there's so little there.   I had hoped for a history of the Jolson era, placing him and his achievements in context and including comments by those who were there. Instead there were often entire (two or three page) chapters on peripherally related people or places without even a relevant Jolson citation. The writing is uninspired and often in need of proof-reading. There are short semi-biographies of Jolson contemporaries, often including only a  sentence  or two of quotes concerning Jolson. Plus many pages devoted to contemporary Jolson Tribute Artists who are well intentioned and complimentary, never actually met the man.   Sorry, but it's a waste of money. 
 "Sudden Death" is the second Andy Carpenter book that I've read(I was introduced to the series last year when I read 'Bury the Lead'). As with the previou book, the charaters are inteesting, well-developed and quirky without being too annoying.  The plot is the biggest problem with 'Sudden Death'. There's a lot of build-up, but very little payoff. This won't stop me from reading other entries in this series, but Rosenfelt needs to tweak things a bit. Some of the similarities to Robert B. Parker and the 'Spenser' cast are rather obvious here. Maybe Rosenfelt needs to work on finding his own 'voice' and motivation for these characters, rather than simply emulating what others have done before 
 Mark Bittman's "How to Cook Everything" is a treasure trove of vegeterian recipes, including tons of recipes for cooking legumes, grains, and vegetables. Unfortunately, those sections are all missing from "The Minimalist Cooks Dinner," which is essentially about cooking meat, poultry, and fish. Vegeterian Bittman fans would be better off sticking with "How to Cook Everything" and/or trying out "The Minimalist Cooks Vegetarian.&quot 
     Should have been a pop-up book so as not to confuse people with all those words strung together.  Thinking for ourselves is dangerous, let's all hide under Ramtha's skirt and see if she says it's all right to come out.    Cliff-Notes For the Retarde 
 I generally hate writing a bad review since I believe in every effort being praised, however this book was an absolute waste of time. The book is a compilation of clichés and myths about the Balkans, having worked there for three years after I read this book, I can with full confidence congratulate the publisher on the selection of a catchy title for the book - aside from the title there is nothing of value in it. I wanted to find out more about other works of this author since I was shocked with the amount of ignorance he had of the Balkans and yet embarked on writing a book on the region - there must be something to it! Well, I noticed that Mr. Kaplan seems to have set a similar pattern in writing for other places of the world without knowing them! Like in Balkan Ghosts so in other works of Mr. Kaplan, the reader always comes across a mysterious personage that the author has met quite by chance and has had a conversation with on a subject that oddly fits the plot of his book, be it the Serbian lady or the African monk in his later works - there's a work of this, is called fiction! And this is where Balkan Ghosts should be, in the novella section, for it makes a nice fiction.  
  This product is not good at all I had to return mine after only 2 weeks. I found out that it is really inaccurate and it doesn't work when you want it to. As for as the body fat percentage I couldn't even get it to work. Do not buy this product 
 We bought our daughter this little giggle phone thinking that Sesame Street would be a trusted vendor that would use the highest quality materials to construct the toy.  Our child put the toy in her mouth once and chewed on it a little bit (as many kids do)....and we noticed that the paint on the eyes had immediately scraped off.  We took that toy away and haven't given it back.  We just wanted to let others out there know that despite the age recommendation, if there is any chance your child might put the toy in their mouth, then this is not the toy for you 
 For some reason, Amazon deleted my earlier review, although it was not obscene or offensive. So I'll restate it in really simple terms: David Brock contends that critics of the mainstream media are all narrow-minded conservatives who simply don't want to read about social trends they don't like. This is nonsense. You don't have to agree with the Christian right - I certainly don't - in order to perceive liberal bias in the media. I would give some examples, but I'd probably get censored again 
 I found this a difficult book to read.The author uses long meandering sentences frequently enough to distract attention;and her thesis is unclear.The author also tends to make generalising statements,with no evidence to back the statements up.The book does not say anything new;I was disappointed overall 
 We have all had that experience as we grow older of being with a beloved elder who has reached an age when their view of the world just doesn't square with reality. It is heartrending to listen to them repeat their nostrums for a better world, and know that they are sadly locked in a worldview that was of their time but clearly mistaken. This is the experience of reading "A People Adrift" if you are among those who came after the Boomers and suffered from that generation's social experiments.   There is nothing to test a worldview like having to suffer under the hand of it. Sadly, the Boomers, of which Mr. Steinfels is one, unleashed a host of experiments into the Church which had more to do with "drugs, sex and rock and roll" than authentic Catholic Faith.  The culture of experimentation and protest rallys led to a culture within the Church that agitated for change in doctrine and discipline. This began with the rejection of Humanae Vitae and has blossomed now into the "demand" for women's ordination, the blessing of homosexuality, the end to celibacy and the democratization of the Faith.   Mr. Steinfels book is a genuine attempt to come to terms with what appears as a crisis in the Catholic Church. But what is saddening is that Mr. Steinfels, like that beloved uncle, is locked in a worldview that imposes a blindness on him. A blindness that has him advocating that the Church take more  doses of the poison that got us sick in the first place!  Somewhere along the way, many of the Boomers and Mr. Steinfels, missed the fact that one chooses a Faith because it is True, not because it should be changed. Politics is the sphere for agitation and change, not Faith. Those Catholics who work at being authenticly Catholic, do so because they recognize that the Faith is True and the more one is conformed to the Faith the more genuinely human they become. No one became more human by seeking to change the Faith!   What Mr. Steinfels and so many of his fellow travellers failed to learn since the 60's is that THEY are the crisis of the Roman Catholic Church because they have spent the last 45 years trying to change the Faith instead of allowing the Faith to change them.   This is why they argue about contraception, they have been using it and have convinced themselves that God doesn't care. He does care, and those who live by the Church's teachings understand the beauty of this teaching from the inside out (not to mention all the other un-PC teachings too).  What is lacking in Mr. Steinfels book is a sense of diverse perspective, for example from those among "The New Faithful" who Colleen Carrol wrote about a few years back. If he had asked the New Faithful about these issues, he might have discovered that the Spring Time in the Church that John Paul II foresaw is sprouting up all around us where Mr. Steinfels' sexual revolutionary worldview is keenly understood and rejected in favor of the Faith of the Apostles and the Saints of the Catholic Church.   Perhaps the greatest indication of the ossification of Mr. Steinfels worldview can be seen in his book's failure to even mention, never mind deeply grapple with, the "Theology of the Body." The closest he comes to it is in this paragraph:   "[T]he contraception debate has been affected by the pope's own extensive writings on sexual morality, which have injected a very different set of terms and categories into the discussion, drawn from his personal blending of traditional scholasticism and contemporary phenomenology. The sifting of profound insight from idealized "nonsense on stilts" has only begun, not made any easier by the density and ambiguity of the pope's language." pg. 265   He doesn't go into the language or open this up at all except to conclude:   "To justify an absolute ban on contraception, however, these approaches always seem to be forced and tortured into supporting a foregone conclusion. The final links in the argument always seem to depend on stark assertions (for example, contraception is 'hostile' or 'degrading' to the spouse; it ruins the 'spontaneity and depth' of the experience) or cloudy rhetoric (such as Pope John Paul's) that simply doesn't ring true to the lived experience of too many religiously serious and sensitive people." p. 265   Granted, the Theology of the Body is not easy material - it is subtle and complex, but it holds more than Mr. Steinfels seems willing to engage.   You have to wonder who the "religiously serious and sensitive people" he is referring to in this passage. Again it seems he is speaking of his cohort who broadly rejected Humanae Vitae, used contraception and continued to recieve the Eucharist despite the mortal sin involved. These people are the ones who have numbed their conscience over contraception. How can he possibly describe them as "religiously serious and sensitive." He needs to attend a Couple to Couple League conference to get his bearings!  I would love to see Mr. Steinfels try to pass this off in front of a hall filled with twenty-somethings who have attended one of Christoper West's presentations on the Theology of the Body. He would be laughed out of the room for being out of touch.   What Communism and Socialism was to Eastern Europe, the Sexual Revolution was to the West and America. The jury is still out as to which revolution cost more lives and devistated more people.   John Paul II brought down Socialism and Communism with his teaching. History will eventually tell how he brought down the Sexual Revolution of the west and restored authentic civilization through the Theology of the Body. For Mr. Steinfels to have missed a discussion of this in his book is very telling of how out of touch he is and how he is a card carring old guard member of the Sexual Revolutionaries.  There is a revolution happening at the grass roots, but unfortunately Mr. Steinfels can't see it coming because unfortnately this beloved older uncle is simply showing his age.   
 If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.    Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY" 
 I thought the narrator was terrible. She is under the impression that people in upstate New York have southern accents.  Or maybe she never figured out where the story takes place. It must be the mint juleps that confused her. You'd think there would be an editor or coach that would notice this discrepancy, but I guess if nobody could be bothered to edit the author's work, they certainly couldn't worry about the narrator's accents 
 This book was really quite disappointing.  The idea presented is quite simple (how to place landscaping for the greatest impact), but the illustrations and landscapes presented are very unusual.  Do you live in a desert?  They have a desert landscape in there, just in case you do.  Mountain views? Probably not!  Mountain stream running through?  Most of the yards in this book are extraordinary before someone even begins to put in bushes and flowers.  This is not a book for the average person with an average-to-smallish yard and a budget 
 "Laconic" may be a favorable description of a Western hero, but it should not apply to the book which tells that hero's story.  This is a poor effort by an otherwise talented writer.  The big gunfight is a poor rip-off of the OK Corral tale, the characters are not well developed, and the book ends with a thud.  The only good thing about the short chapters and wide spacing is that the reader has wasted less time with this hollow core of what should have been a good story.  Read "Ride the Dark Trail" to see what a Western should be 
 I have eagerly purchased every Lois McMaster Bujold book that has been published in recent years, usually in hardcover as soon as it was released, and I did the same with this one.  I was horribly disappointed.  The plot is hazy.  The characters are not nearly as well drawn as her others.  The overall theme - younger woman, older man, clash of cultures - rehashes "Shards of Honor" but much less compellingly.  The distinctive and lovely use of language so characteristic of her earlier novels is missing here.  She resorts to telling rather than showing on nearly every page.  Finally, as other reviewers have commented, the novel leaves you hanging with an utterly incomplete story - a cheap marketing trick the author should have resisted!  Unlike every one of her previous books, with this one I had trouble getting into it and trouble staying with it and kept asking myself, Why am I wasting time with this? Will I buy the sequel?  Maybe, but not in hardback.  I'll wait for the paperback and read the reviews with care.  Even for her fans,  I can't recommend shelling out for the hardcover version.  For those new to her work, read something else of hers. Finally, why 2 stars instead of 1?  I didn't utterly give up reading the book in disgust.  That's the only reason 
 I didn't find this book very helpful. What it refers to as "advanced topics" such as persistent storage and networking are basic concepts that aren't explained very clearly. Seems put together too quickly with only average coverage of j2me 
 I think that this book carried on longer than it should. A good chuknk could've been cut out of this, and one sex scene was a little over the top and completely unrealistic. A lot of the scenes in this book seem to drag pointlessly on and on and on, like the descriptions for example. It would go from someone's hair, to their eyes, how the color of their eyes or hair contrasted with other colors. The it would go to another person's eyes and hair and how those contrasted with other colors. This book started off really well with the press conference, and finding out about the murders...but then the murders kinda get dropped for the rest of the book until the last chapter they get brought up again. I seriously think this book could've been written better. I almost considered not finishing it because the chapters carried on way too long. I did like, however how the different little things ths sithen did for Meredith helped with the story later as the book drug on and on 
 The book is about court poetry, court architecture, court philosophy, and how well courtiers felt cultivating their court culture. It is definitly NOT about the entire culture of al-Andalus. It is not about those who worked and suffered to pay the courtier lifestyle, the dependend farmers, the craftsmen, the merchants, etc. Their music, dance, food, workman skills, etc. is completly neglected. It is no wonder that Ms. Menocal wonders why the court culture was destroyed. Maybe a lot of people were not willing to pay for it any more. Worse, it is not about the international musicians and dancers, the gitanos who breathed life into Spanish culture. The book is written by a bourgois raised and educated in safe homes and university bubbles but definitly not by someone who ever took part in creating culture 
 "Raise the Red Lantern" is justifiably recognized as one of the great films of the Nineties and one of the most visually striking movies of all time. Unfortunately this DVD release by Razor Digital Entertainment is a travesty. The colors are dull and washed out and the English subtitles are poorly translated, ruining the stately mood of the movie.  This is not how a classic film should be watched! Hopefully a legitimate DVD company like Criterion will decide to release the movie with a properly done transfer. In the meantime, avoid this hideous DVD at all costs 
 I have to agree with other reviewers who call this the weakest link in the trilogy. Its tone is very different from "Out of the Silent Planet" and "Perelandra". Those stories were magical, this one was... bewildering. I think the key is that the other two books were timeless, and still work today; but this one is too focused on a time and place (British society and universities in the 1940s) for most of today's readers to be able to connect to. If you want to finish the trilogy, this is worth reading once; but be prepared for something totally different from the first two books 
 First of all, pot doesn't make you aggressive. It's absurd to think that a person would spill the beans about their sexual fantasy in such a mean way after taking a few puffs from a joint. The argument after the pot smoking seemed too contrived, just like all of the dialog and action in the movie. Things only seem to happen to lead you into the next scene. It's ludicrous to think that a man is going to go off in search of a prostitute because his wife THOUGHT about having an affair.   Certain things seemed to be thrown in for shock value--Nicole Kidman on the toilet wiping herself, the nude, large-breasted patient that Tom Cruise was examining (what exactly was his specialty anyway?), and the father pimping his young daughter. Other things were thrown in for no reason at all: The patient whose father died and pathetically professed her love for the doctor. The prostitute, Domino, being diagnosed as HIV positive.  Another annoyance: Cruise's character always walked around saying "I'm a doctor", like that means something in NYC in the 21st century. (Sure, I'll let you into my store after midnight!)  The movie took us on a journey and then left us hanging. Too many questions were left unanswered: How did they know the doctor didn't belong at the party if everyone was wearing a mask and why was he such a threat since no one at the party could be identified? How did Nicole Kidman have a dream about an orgy the same night as the real one? How did the mask end up in the bed? Was there really foul play involved in death of the junkie prostitute and the quick exit of the piano player? What the hell was the point of this movie?   P.S. London only looks like New York City if you don't live in New York City 
 I loved the first book (and all of her other works) but this one while it held my attention also annoyed me.  Way too much time was given to the spoiled little girl and she lost me from the very beginning when it was explained that if she didn't get to watch the movie every day she screamed.  Sadly the adults were almost as spoiled as the children and it was hard to feel any kind of sympathy or empathy for the main character when she was the one who had created these brats 
 I have to admit that I gave up on this book.  I'm hoping to find a more readable biography of Mrs. Roosevelt.  Cook's style and grammar are just too jumbled for me.    Look in the "look inside this book" section here and go to page 14.  This is a prime example of Cook's overuse of quotes.  I appreciate that she did her research, but if she was going to quote so much, she should have just included one whole article.  As it is, the whole page is a mish-mash of sentances and words taken from various sources creating a confusing unreadable mess.   
 We bought it and watched it with our daughter last weekend and I found it to be AWFUL.... I grew up with the Mary Martin LP and was IN a performance of it when I was in about 3rd grade, so admittedly I know it better in the musical version and would not tolerate any deviation well, but YE gods. Cartoonish, offensive caricatures of Indians, pirates, busy dads, women and girls, a portrayal of Tinkerbell as homicidally jealous of Wendy, and not even the redeeming "Clap if you believe in fairies" line - that was completely left out. I do not remember this version from my childhood and ended up sorry that it was my daughter's introduction to the story 
 Thomas M. Disch approaches what should be an engaging topic to any SF lover with a holier-than-thou attitude that is both condescending and unappealing. I purchased this book believing it would study the impact of SF on American culture-as the title suggests. Instead, Disch taints his diatribe with his own offensive bias.  Perhaps his sourest assertion is that of SF as the ultimate Boy's Club-run for and by the Men. Why, Disch is so enamored of this male-dominated theory, he proceeds to deny Mary Shelley as the true founder of the genre, and instead raises Edgar Allen Poe to the pedestal instead. His weak reason? He asserts that fewer people read Shelley than Poe. Furthermore, he credits Shelley's parents and husband as the reason behind her success at all. Because God forbid a woman might have laid the foundation for Disch's beloved genre.   The entire book is tainted with these sort of chauvinistic opinions. What I thought would be a dissertation on SF in American culture is little more than one man's attempts to inflict his bias on the public. Spare yourself the indignation of reading such arrogant and bigoted opinions as this, you'll find nothing but rage at the ignorance of some folk 
 As an avid fan and owner of every book she's published I was VERY disappointed in the storyline, plot, sub-plot, character development (actually lack there of), dialog, I can go on.  When the story moves into dream sequences it's disjointed, choppy and is like flipping channels and watching a movie that has been on for over an hour.  I haven't finished the book, I have no desire, inclination or motivation to.  I stopped reading the book a week ago and haven't felt the urge to pick it up again. I am barely 1/2 way through the book.  I feel like I wasted money.  I feel robbed 
 I read this in Vanity Fair, but I understand that what is in the book is the same as what appeared in that article.  I found the article to be absolutely offensive on multiple levels.  Though Mr. Tosches claims to have some reasonable intentions in his quest for opium, his search for an opium den can certainly not be justified on the grounds of seeking a cure for his diabetes.  What he really seems to be seeking is to fulfill a neo-colonialist, romantic, sexually and culturally exploitative fantasy of the mysterious ancient customs of the elusive far East.  Mr. Tosches would do well to read Edward Said's "Orientalism," or any number of other writings that have examined the American/European fascination with the East.  Mr. Tosches' "Asia" and the people he meets there seem to be drawn directly from nineteenth- and early twentieth-century European expatriate fiction, right down to his description of one of the people he meets as a "Graham Greene character."  What place do fictional characters have in this supposed journalism?  Furthermore, Mr. Tosches completely avoids the subject of opium addiction and the harm it may bring to the addict and those close to him or her.  This book may be worth reading if you are looking for a contemporary example of exoticism or if you have any doubt that the West still desires to colonize the rest of the world and to use it as a setting in which to act out its fantasies 
 This dvd purports to be the "very best of" this series, but it is anything but.  First off, the first fifteen minutes or so has little to do with in the way ghost hunting, rather "introduces" the various persons involved with TAPS and is in fact quite boring.  I couldn't care less that these guys are plumbers and have wives that are pissed off with their preoccupation with the paranormal.  When we finally get around to the various investigations they turn out to be quite mundane and at times frustrating to watch because of the apparent amateurishness of the investigators.  If these guys have been doing this for as long as they claim, it certainly doesn't seem like it.  And in the end, despite the claim in the blurb on the gack of the dvd case that watching these episodes would convince one that ghosts really do exist, they certainly don't.  Sadly, the two episodes that seemed somewhat promising are not included in the dvd, although they are mentioned briefly in the "in the next episode" segment of two of the episodes.  What's more, in the five minute bonus feature in which two of the investigators discuss their favorite episodes, both the lighthouse and penitentiary investigations are agree upon as being favorites, while--if I remember correctly--only two of the fore included in this video are mentioned, and not with much enthusiasm.  I just can't recommend this dvd 
 Just another example of white racist rhetoric!  For a thoughtful analysis of the genesis of this thinking, read Ron Walter's White Nationalism...the truth shall set you free 
 I hope I get program to receive it next month  Patty Jone 
 This book is an interesting collection of chapters, interviews and ideas by Drucker.  There are a handful of good ideas, but as a whole, the book is disjointed and no clear point or argument is raised.  While it is good fodder for quotes, don't expect to emerge with any great ideas or new perspectives 
 Basic concepts but a good read for those under heavy-handed leadership 
 Although I am a dedicated fan of John Wayne and dearly love his movies, I found this movie, which I have never seen before, to be slow and for lack of a better word boring. I will view it again and add it to my collection because John Wayne is in it 
 We loved the strawberry book, and were very excited to see this one, but it was disappointing. The drawings are great, but the story lacks the charm and depth of the original 
 If you're a commissioned sales rep calling outbound biz to biz, this book is NOT for you. Nothing new or original here.  I suggest you read books by Art Sobczak, Bly or one of the best books ever written on the subject.  Telesales Tips From The Trenches by Joe Cata 
 I miss you, Terri Windling!  Come back!  That having been said, I have read over ten volumes over the years from this series.  I have found among them some of the best stories I have ever encountered.  Do yourself a favor and read some of those.  Numbers 4, 10, 13, 14, and 16, especially.  Kelly Link established herself as a good author years ago, but she makes a crap editor.  None of the stories she or her husband chose made me do anything but yawn!  The problem is, there's no magic in any of them.  I understand magical realism.  Hell, I write it!  Most of the stories they chose I could have sampled in a college writing course.  I have a piece of advice for Miss Link:  There is a reason that older more experienced authors count for something in anthologies of these types.  It is because they have refined the art of story and know how to pursue achieving what they set out to do.  Most of the stories you have chosen are either redundant, boring, ordinary, devoid of interesting characters or good characterization, lack subtlety or flair, or are just plain irritating.  The newer authors you chose you most likely did so to get noticed, because it is a responsibility and joy to discover new authors and introduce them to the public at large, but I fear that you have done this too rushed and avoided finding the seriously moving or intricately touching stories I and others are used to from this series.    Too many of the stories are too similar a vein as well.  Daily slice of life in America types of stories with a little "fantasy" thrown in on the side that doesn't impress as such.  I feel like it's just a gimmick thrown my way, like you would give a dog a rag to chew on.  It just doesn't sustain.  I can recommend the LeGuin and Gaiman stories and the rest?  Not worth the money 
 I'm having a hard time believing the reviews I see here. Gucci Gulch is by far one of the most boring books I've read this year. Perhaps, it's because it was required literature for Intro to Poli Sci, but that's beside the point. This book is too detailed. I agree with the comment where it should have been condensed, but I want to stress that this information cannot be found elsewhere without intense research. I commend the author for his diligent work, but this book just wasn't for me. It's 291 pages on the Tax Reform of 1986. If that's your cup of joe, I would highly suggest it. Avoid it if you are a casual reader. 
 Every time I write on it holes go right through it! Dont by this! If you fold it, it rips in the fold!! Dont Buy this!!! You will be sorry 
 I have long been hoping to find the ONE career book that will point me in the write direction of finding the career that I want out of life.  I'm coming to believe that these books are mostly a waste of money.  This book contains a personality test that is not unlike any other career assessment test that you can take online, for FREE.  It then contains a boat load of charts...50 highest paying jobs for this personality type....50 jobs for this personality type with the highest amount of women/men employed...ect ect.  If this sort of thing interests you then by all means this book might be for you.  Most of the book however is a list of different jobs for the different personality types that contains descriptions, experience/education needed, related job, ect but it is all on a VERY BASIC level.  Save your money and speak with a career counsler 
 I was very disappointed with the digital version of this book.  It was little more than what is usually available for free browsing.  I could not believe that I had paid $4.95 for 9 pages.  In the future, I'll be much more careful when I purchase an edocument or book 
 This is one of the worst written books I've had the displeasure of reading.  I can spare you the misery.  Companies recover from slumping quarters and dissapointing returns by increasing their communication, co-operation and collaboration.  That's the entire book in one sentence.  The hubris that wreaks from this book is denser than the arrogance it oozes on each page.  The text suffers from redundancy to the millionth degree, by the way.  I vote less than one star, however Amazon forces a one star minimum 
 I started this book the same way I started almost every Marquez book in the past - expecting to be mesmerized and taken away for a while from my world to one of the magical-real worlds of Marquez. The first few tens of pages of this book took off the way those in any other Marquez book do: slowly, but promisingly creating a solid loom to weave a tale on. And then the next tens of pages continued in the same vein, as did the next few chapters, and so on and so forth.   Actually, to be fair, at least a part of the problem could be with my expectations. I was expecting another stunning piece of writing, even if it was a recount of reality. But then, how many readers of Marquez would hold that against me and expect differently of him? After all, his books have been as much about his writing style as they have been about his vivid imagination, haven't they? So that's primarily what I felt let down about in this book - the book just fails to grip. Marquez's writing seems weak like never before (except for the odd brilliant phrase here and there), and there aren't enough interesting tales to tell anyway. The book never moves beyond the context-setting; there is almost no dramatic arc, and; there is hardly any climatic resolution.   To summarize quickly then, I would recommend this book to very die-hard Marquez fans only. The only real value of this book lies in helping Marquez's readers undestand how he came to be the writer he did. If you are prepared to go through 500 pages of tedium for that, go for it. 
 This review may sound pretentious and ignorant, but in truth I'm a big fan of British history, so bear with me!    Even as a film itself, it's surreal, and I don't like the acting.  But as with any historical film that includes the British, they're made out to be the absolute bad guys!  Sure we were forging an empire within France (i.e. The Hundred Years War), but rapists and murdering pillagers!?  Never!  Historically accurate, full of British sentiment, and down-right weird.  Avoid this film today, folks! 
 He's shot on a remote arid pasture of New Mexico. Loses his memory. Wakes up on a hospital cot with all these flashes, you know, US president being assassinated by snipers and all that jazz. No one quite comprehends what White House has to do with this forlorn desert but that's the rote mystery of it all.   Intriguing setup? Well, borderline. But the execution is so flaky, so pseudo-MTV like, it annoys more than it entertains. Strange characters spring up periodically for no rhyme or reason, accompanied by high octane outbursts of sepia and B&W -- flashbacks one concludes.   All of which resolves into a painfully deja vu plot. Every time a clue comes up it feels like a stray clip from a Depeche Mode video. The experience is grating, not so much for all the adoloscent 'twists' up its sleeve, certainly not for a lack of top stars (Val Kilmer, Neve Campbell, Sam Shepard), but for its aesthetic predicated on sudden bass thumps and scattershot imagery.  In other words, a loud B-grade thriller that induces amnesia in its audience faster than its own protagonist could try and remember. 
 I didn't watch Millenium when it was on ten years ago, so I thought I'd give it a try on DVD, as I'm a big X-files fan. I watched two shows: "The Beginning and the End" and "The Dogs". They were ridiculous AND boring. I'm done with Millenium 
 A good friend of mine insisted I'd read this book, because she knows I love exploring the spiritual aspects of life.   In the end I was very disappointed.  Not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book, but Michael Crichton's whole attitude.  He would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant, narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter.  How can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in?  Sadly, this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.  I have no desire to read any more of his books 
 I love other "teach yourselft VISUALLY" books, but this is not one of them. the reason is that this book isn't detailed enough. in fact, it's content are mostly about introducing readily availble wireless technologies (e.g. bluetooth phones, micro-wave wireless, AP, WI-FI A, B, G,). it doesn't teach the readers how to configure for wireless securities, networking connectivities or explain the functions (e.g.deMilitary Zone) in the router 
 I've just returned this unit. It doesn't play videos as advertised.  I was able to get it to properly play .avi files at 320 x 240 resolution...see other review below. But 320x240 gives a postage stamp size picture. At 640 x 480 the playback was full size but jerky and broken....more later.   I have now had 3 different brands of 8" photo frames in my possession: a Phillips, a Pandigital, and this Coby.  I have developed the following list of features in my "ideal" photo frame. First, video playback: I've been taking a lot of video clips with my digital still camera...they come out well and the convenience of not having to lug my camcorder along, and the ability to quickly transfer clip files within/between chips and my computer is attractive. I would like a frame which will play the format my camera is taking (.mov, more later) I'd also like the frame to play a multi-media show...that is, to play movie clips in show presentations, intermixed with .jpg photo files.  Second feature is to play .wma music files, in addition to MP3. This is because I have a non-Ipod personal music player. All my music is in .wma format because it is roughly half the file size of MP3. Third, I would like a timer on my frame...set it to come on in the morning, off at night, for example. Fourth, I'd like an audio or speaker out feature. None of these frames has home theater-like sound, and I have an extra pair of computer speakers I'd probably hook up. Video out could come in handy too. Fifth, I'd like to be able to rotate stills from within the frame's software, manually or automatically. Yes, you can rotate them in the computer, but the frame may or may not preserve the rotation. (This may depend on which photo edit program you are using.) Sixth, I'd like a folder hierarchy file management system in the frame's software. Especially with the huge chips now available, I see an advantage to push a couple of buttons and change the picture set (folder), rather than switching out chips.  Here is where the 3 units I've had stack up, followed by my next (fourth) unit.   I am keeping the Pandigital....which Costco has for $140. It plays .mov video files, but not within a slideshow. It has no speaker out jack and the sound is tinny. It requires MP3 music files. It permits picture rotation.  No folder management system. No clock/timer. No ability to play stills/video intermixed. I think the Coby and Phillips picture quality is brighter but the Pandigital is ok.  The phillips didn't play video, and since it also had a software glitch when I returned it I decided to look elsewhere. (no remote and no music with the philips either.)  The Coby won't play my videos, even after I used my converter program to try about 10 different MP4 and AVI variations. The Coby plays .wma music files, won't rotate stills, has no folder system, no clock/timer. It has a speaker out jack. It does not permit intermixing video and stills in one multimedia show. Picture quality is fully equal to Philips, generally the recognized standard. If all you want is photos, and never turn your camera sideways, this unit will be a good value.  Another unit I'd like to get to play with would be the Image Moments model by Digitalfoci. I've exchanged emails with someone there who clearly knows what they are talking about and I believe this unit will intermix my photos and videos.  
 This is the most boring collection of Irish music I have ever heard. Mostly military songs with a snare drum and a spare penny whistle peeping out. There's a couple semi inspired drinking songs and a couple pretty ballads with milk toast guitar accompaniment. I have been in Pubs in Ireland (Dingle Pennisula/Dublin) and they would not be singing most of this stuff now or then. It would put everyone to sleep.  This is just not my cup of tea, nothing rousing, nothing to raise your glass of stout for... For soggy purests only...  
 I have purchased a total of three of these collar. They seem to work great for a while then they they need the dog to bark louder and more often to get them to activate. Then, after a few months, they quit working altogether. I check the charge and the batteries and that's not the problem. I don't think they are for large outdoor dogs 
 I did not like this audio book.  Out of all of Danielle Steel audio books this one was the worse and most depressing story. In a world of finding a new job and starting to date again. It was a story of a women who was having a problem finding the right man.  It tells you a sad story of the man who used her and the man who was afraid to commit himself to another woman long after his wife died and he tryed to started to date again. 
 I'm puzzled as to why anyone should pay $59.39 for these three DVDs that currently retail on Amazon for $11.24 (Signs), $14.99 (Unbreakable), and $26.99 (Sixth Sense*) totaling $53.22?    *There is also a less expenseive "Collector's Version" of the Sixth Sense that only costs $14.99 if you'd rather not pay the $12.00 for the "Vista Series" extras.  I'm also skeptical as to whether the version of Unbreakable sold here has as much content as the Vista series edition sold seperately that contains 2 discs (I assume this edition does not because this box set only includes 3 discs, 1 per movie).    I love the movies, but where's the price break on buying them all together when the package is $6.17-$18.17 more than purchasing these DVD's seperately???  
 I found myself continually frustrated with the stupid actions of Miss Zukas, constantly putting herself in harm's way 
 I am a teacher who reads this book to my class every year.  I show the movie and this is a terrible version.  They leave out almost the whole story, and change the rest.  It is such a great book and I think they could have done a better job on the video.  I am always hoping a newer and better version is made 
 I cannot agree that the information in this book is what EVERY woman must know about hormones, the brain and emotional health. I was quite bored with it after the first few pages. I guess I thought I would learn something new and cutting edge.  .................wrong 
 I'm sorry I ever started reading this book.  The writing is so good that I couldn't stop -- but man . . .  Somewhat like the fictional author's fictional readers, my nose started to bleed and most of my goldfish died.  You need to be really hard up for a book to read to knowingly choose this one.  After much cursing and gnashing of teeth, I finally finished it.  Somebody owes me money 
 So there were lots of great parts of this book, and lots of relevant historical information, and, at times, it really shines.  How paved streets came about in London, for example, the Macaroni fashions, and other important historical phenomena are covered and are covered pretty well.  However, the book does not read well at all.  You will find yourself reading and re-reading and re-reading again.  Good information, but not very digestable, and the conclusion needs work, as it's difficult to see the relations of all of the "spaces. 
 If you were raised on Getz, "Bird", Ellington, Hampton and all the other greats, don't plan on enjoying this CD.  While the vocals are OK, none of the tracks are memorable.  I've given it several listens today, but fear that this one is destined to go to the bottom of the stack...........maybe I should have waited until tomorrow, and bought the Sunday Times, but I don't think that would get me in the mood for these Jazz Moods 
 Whatever felicity Edwards manages in this work, do not credit the ideas represented to Edwards himself.  All of his central points on freedom are no more than a Christian appropriation of secular English philosophy in Hobbes, somewhat in Locke, and certainly of David Hume.  In the old philosophy, choice is an illusion, because in any course of action we are determined necessarily by our nature; Edwards agrees fully, adding only that our nature gets some extra help from God when it comes to sanctification.      He advances the idea that in every snapshot of human life, we make decisions in accordance with our nature and disposition.  Free will is compatabilist in that we have no autonomy other than to follow our greatest desire in any given instance.  Not only does this exposition rule out the chance for true virtue--some good thing we do which we might not have done--but Edwards also has a hard time explaining how God is not the author of evil, given that human decisions are consistently determined according to a divine decree 
 The whole idea of checking this book out from the library began when I realized that this story I was writing had a pretty similar plot as the story: a bunch of kids with these talents get called up to go to a special school, where they have their own rooms.  	Since I had taken some ideas (or as I call it, ripped off) from this series of books (or maybe it was from Harry Potter...?), I went to see the next installment in the series for some more ideas, hoping that this book would be better than it's previous counterparts.  	I was wrong.  	From what I had read in its Amazon.com description a long time ago, I thought it would be a bit interesting. The story concerns Charlie Brown, a person with a strange talent for hearing voices from pictures. After finding out his talent in the first book, he gets sent to Bloor's Academy, where many of his classmates have strange talents like him, such as being able to call up storms or having the ability of hypnotism.  	In this book, one of Charlie's friends, who is an orphan and lives at the academy, finally gets adopted by the D'Greys. But it is revealed that they are a child-hating couple, who end up forcing the orphan to sign an oath for obedience. They then end up locking him up behind a force field in an odd place called The Passing House.  	It sounds pretty suspenseful, right?  	But the truth is, the actual story isn't. Not only is the character development lacking, with the characters having no personality, everything gets solved within three pages of the events. Yes, I am sort of exaggerating, but the point I'm trying to make is that there are really no important conflicts, because they just all get solved without much difficulty.  	Another thing that I highly dislike about this story (plus the rest of the series) is that everybody is either good, bad, or good, but being controlled of the bad. Maybe it's just that I've been watching too much anime, where you can actually sympathize with the villains, to various extents. And the fact that none of the villains really have back-stories doesn't help much either.    	I suggest to you not to waste your time on the book, and instead read something else instead, which I have no suggestions for 
 Okay, the script is not the most imaginative I've ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben's best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part.  I didn't even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don't they use them?  Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC.  I didn't even mind the fact that the whole "We're married and my husband's a doctor." charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he's pretending to be a doctor and he's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D'ya think someone might have a heart attack and "Dr. Holmes" might have to step up?  And uh, they're pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there's the best man and maid of honor! D'ya think they're gonna get busted?  What killed it for me was that ridiculous ending.  It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience.  I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah's little boy and all that.  I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other.  The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen.  RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he's breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let's just go ahead and get married after all.  Huh?  He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back.  This man obviously doesn't have a clue what he wants in life, and I'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after?  Not only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously?  It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us "don't do it!" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway.  It's just marriage. It's romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after!  It's been my experience, when things aren't feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run. The last thing you should do is close your eyes, grab your balls and take the leap 
 This is probably the worst book I have ever read. Granted the topic can be very vague and confusing at time, the author makes little attempt tp explain adequately the concepts.   Would highly recommend NOT getting this book 
 Not as good as the original but at least it is in color! This was not one of Daryl Hannah's finest moment. Some of the special effects were laughable especially the miniaturization of the city. Over all, the cast wasn't that good. However, if remakes of old classics are your bag this might be for you.  Now we wait for the Wasp Woman to be remade! 
 So the truth was stated finally by William Dembski in this popular account explaining the origins and principles of "Intelligent Design"; in which he admits that there is  indeed a religious link to what he claims is primarily a scientific hypothesis (But a scientific hypothesis proposed originally by William Paley hundreds of years ago, which was rejected soundly by leading scientists afterwards.). There is nothing in this book which explains how science works, by careful observation and rigorous testing of ideas (hypotheses). Those ideas which are accepted through this rigorous scientific method are either incorporated within longstanding scientific theories, or may themselves be the incipient idea(s) of a new scientific theory which replaces an outmoded one (Most notably, in exactly the same manner that Einstein's Theory of General Relativy and the Theory of Quantum Mechanics replaced Newton's theories of physics, known now as classical mechanics; the latter are now subsumed within the two 20th Century theories forming the core of modern physics.). Dembski clearly doesn't understand how modern science works; he pretends to have such understanding via sloppy logic and intellectually dishonest statements which occur frequently throughout this book.  Intelligent Design is not scientific since it does not adhere to any of the long-established tenets about science itself (Intelligent Design has been judged correctly as the latest flavor of creationism enjoying some popularity amongst fundamentalist Protestant Christians; one notable biologist has referred to it as "reborn creationism".). It can not be tested, simply because it does not generate any testable hypotheses. Moreover, despite claims to the contrary, I have yet to see any peer-reviewed articles testing Intelligent Design; instead, every single book and article published in praise of this idea is merely an attack on the Modern Synthesis Theory of Evolution; this evolutionary theory is itself the central underlying theory for contemporary biology as much as General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are for contemporary physics (Any current scientific controversies about the Modern Synthesis are related to understanding the tempo and mode of evolution as seen from the fossil record and the relative importance of random genetic drift as the primary means of causing evolutionary change; they, themselves, do not mean that the Modern Synthesis is in trouble as the successful unifying theory it has been for nearly a century in explaining biological phenomena.). And Intelligent Design is not a new idea at odds with mainstream science, but rather the latest incarnation of an idea dating from the 17th Century regarding a "Great Chain of Being" which was subsequently tested - and rejected - by Enlightenment and later scientists, most notably naturalists, leading up to of course Darwin and Wallace, who almost simultaneously came up with the Theory of Evolution via Natural Selection (The Modern Synthesis Theory is its direct descendant, and includes its principles, as well as evidence from biological sciences as diverse as genetics, molecular biology and developmental biology, which were unknown to both Darwin and Wallace.).   The arguments presented by Dembski are not only intellectually dishonest, but now, irrelevant, as determined by Republican Federal Judge John Jones in his landmark, historic decision for the Kitzmiller vs. Dover Board of Education trial; Jones concluded that intelligent design is a religious doctrine masquerading as science (His decision is posted online at: htttp://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-12-20_kitzmiller_decision.pdf). Furthermore, thoughtful, reasonable conservatives like Charles Krauthammer and George Will have written lucid, brilliant columns praising the theory of evolution via natural selection, and condemning intelligent design for being an unscientific, religious doctrine.   There are other, more important - and intellectually sound - books available on the so-called "creation vs. evolution" controversy, which I regard as more worthy than any of Dembski's self-serving defenses of Intelligent Design. Philosopher Robert Pennock's "Tower of Babel" is a splendid historical overview and philosophical deconstruction of creationism, including the best written rebuke of "Intelligent Design" which I've come across (He also covers Dembski's "explanatory filter", and demolishes it too from a philosophical perspective.). Philip Kitcher, another philosopher, published "Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism" back in the early 1980s, but his arguments are still quite valid today. My friend Ken Miller's "Finding Darwin's God" has an eloquent critique of Intelligent Design, focusing on Michael Behe's mousetrap model of irreducible complexity which claims to bestow validity on Intelligent Design. Distinguished American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) invertebrate paleobiologist Niles Eldredge offers yet another brilliant critique of Intelligent Design in his book "Darwin: Discovering the Tree of Life", the elegant companion volume to the AMNH Darwin exhibition which he curated, soon to embark on a tour taking it to many of North America's and Great Britain's finest science museums. And last, but not least, Eugenie Scott, Executive Director, National Center for Science Education (www.ncseweb.org), has written a fine textbook on this issue, "Evolution vs. Creationism". All of these books are more desirable than Dembski's "Intelligent Design:The Bridge Between Science & Theology". Otherwise, if you insist on purchasing this book, then perhaps you might choose to acquire instead a splendid text devoted to Klingon cosmology (Neither Klingon cosmology nor "Intelligent Design" can be regarded as scientific, since both depend on faith, not reason, to validate their principles.). 
 This text is one of the worst in terms of technical merit and correctness.  The author obviously does not have much of an idea about statistics and how to implement SPC... 
 We received our Kinyo UV-230C 2-way VHS rewinder/cleaner yesterday and tried it out today. The very first tape that we rewound (a much-loved Disney video) slammed against the beginning of the tape so hard that when we pulled the tape out it was hanging out of the cassette housing, crinkled. I'm afraid that repeated rewindings of a given tape could break the tape.  I had a blank T-120 tape so I put that in and fast-forwarded to the other end to see if it would happen in that direction. It did. I rewound that tape to the beginning and this time it ended properly, so this problem is not consistent.   The tape that was rewound initially was not a full 120-minute tape (the movie is 77 minutes long). I suspect that the sensors on the unit are calibrated for 120-minute tapes and will not necessarily treat shorter tapes as gently. (More tape = more weight = slower overall motor speed?) But I'm not going to experiment with tapes we want to keep! This unit will be returned ASAP. I may exchange it for another in hopes that this particular unit is out of whack. 
 This book is okay. It never really immerses you in the world--instead you just sort of skim along the top of it, half-caring about what happens next. Everyone feels like a stock characters: the "bad guys" are bumbling idiots, and the good guys (even Peter) are self-sacrificing and far-seeing. We barely even see the task force which calls itself the Starcatchers, and the book really could have survived without them. Tinkerbell doesn't show up till the last page or so (I spent most of the book wishing for the fairy to come breathe some complexity and life into the cast), and the croc never eats the clock.  As an avid Dave Barry fan, I could literally pick out which lines had been written by him. Not to say that the book was funny (because, unfortunately, it was not)--his style just flashes off the page in neon colors.  A few innuendoes will raise eyebrows--they really shouldn't have been in a book so geared toward children.  There are better books out there. Buy them instead 
 I would still probably recomend someone to buy the book, but it's nothing special.  Any of this information and more can be obtained on the internet from sites like 'www.duckcentral.com'.  Many specific tips like putting pvc  around your blind to keep beavers frow chewing on it.  I hate when that  happens.  Anyway, buy the book, but don't expect much 
 This book is a nice idea, but does a pretty bad job of execution. I don't know if it's just this one in the series or the whole of them, but I wouldn't buy them. In fact I'm glad I picked it up from the library to see if it was worth getting. There problems range from outright errors, a picture of 1st avenue labeled as 3rd which is almost exactly the same as one used of first avenue. Did the book even have an editor? Other issues are less erroneous, but overall more objectionable, including 90% of the modern photos being of poor quality, bad angles not matching the originals, or just uninteresting subjects. The only good point so far as I'm concerned are the old photos themselves, which is what I'm really looking for and have to imagine exists out there somewhere 
 I bought this book immediately after we found out I was pregnant and was really expecting it to be "the guide" to pregnancy.  Basically, it gives pretty accurate and complete information, but every time I pick it up, I am quite turned off by the condescending tone (i.e. if you eat a slice of white bread with butter, vs. whole grain with nothing, you are probably not fit to be a mother sort of notion).  This book doesn't even make me feel guilty...just irritated that an authority on the subject could be so demeaning.  As a first time mom, I would advise you NOT to get this book.  I know I am not alone either because every time I see used pregnancy books for sale or for free, it is among them.  Many of my pregnant friends have gotten rid of this book for the same reason.  In terms of getting good info, the internet is great and of course there are many many pregnancy books out there.  It is really unfortunate that this is considered to be "THE" pregnancy book, when it is such a disappointing read.  If you insist on buying this book, check a garage sale or Goodwill.  There you will probaly find an abundance of rejects.  
 When I first played this game, I got bored in 10 minutes.All you do is shoot and kill people for nothing, have the police chase you and you shoot them, Bring girls into your car and do it with them. I dont recommend this game at all its overrated 
 This could have been a very exciting book if it had been written by someone such as James Dodson instead of by Mr. Palmer.  Although he shares with us information about many exciting moments of golf matches and  facinating individuals, the book becomes incredibly boring because of all  his first person I-Me-My references 
 This is a story that never needed telling.  Stephen King is incredible with words and ideas, but I suppose I could be considered a fair-weather fan.  "Gerald's Game" did nothing to enhance my life, creativity, conversation or writing skill.  And I was not entertained.  It drained me.  If you haven't read any Stephen King, he's great, so don't start with this one.  Skip it if you can 
 I bought my light timer from Target. when I got it I thought "Hey, this oughtta be a good one..." seeing as it's made by Timex, I figured it would be a good buy.  I found out it was a piece of [...] I would set the time just as it said on the back instructions, I had everything set correctly. When the day ran to 5PM, I expected it to turn on, but it didn't. I pulled out my couch and looked behind it to find that the dial AM/PM buttons on the timer had went all the way around with the ticker and pulled themselves next to eachother and the time had been reset. No matter how many times I fixed it, over and over again it would repeat the same process. I was VERY annoied. so... on my 23rd attempt at setting it correctly, I CAREFULLY read the instructions on the back of the timer, set it, making sure it was correct, and pluged it in once more. five o'clock rolls around and nothing happens. When it turned to 5:30 the light timer turned on.  I had the timer set to 5PM turn on time and 2AM turn off time.  the timer turned off at 11PM. That was the one and ONLY time it ALMOST did something correctly.  Today, frustrated with the timer, I tried setting it again. Well, it's broke now. I twisted it the wrong way on purpose, putting the horrible item out of it's misery.  I wouldn't reccomend this timer to anyone. 
 This has the overwhelming acidic taste that is characteristic of canned spinach, that frozen and fresh don't have. If you know what I'm talking about and like that taste, then this is OK, but for us it's inedible 
 I was hoping to identify at least a few of the 11 different mushrooms in my garden.  Unfortunately not a single one is shown in the picture plates.  I am now in search of a better book 
 As an introduction Zen, what has been presented in this book is fine though it could have been done with lot less elitist overtone. I agree Zen and its true comprehension does not come easy (I am talking of regular mortals such as myself here) and words as mere symbols for concepts are distorting when conveying Zen.   I do not propose that I am an expert on Zen or even Buddhism in general but I have read a few books on Buddhism by Thich Nhat Hanh, Dalai Lama, Chogyam Trungpa and others. Though an agnostic who does not care for much for organized religion, I do believe the most fundamental benefit of any spiritual/ religious framework is to instill a sense of compassion toward other beings. You need some kind of cultural creation (religious or otherwise) to counter act the natural tendency of a human to be self-serving. In this aspect, I have high regards for non-theistic Buddhism and the inclusiveness of Vedanta (Hinduism) that proposes all religions eventually lead to the same attainment. From this viewpoint I was surprised with this author.  This author may have been one of the leading authorities on Zen in his time, but unfortunately he comes as an arrogant, elitist, full of prejudices. He does not miss any opportunity to put down other religions or even other sects of Buddhism. Only Zen as practiced by the Rinzai sect is pure, strong and generally worthy of pursuit. Any form of spiritualism from the West is of course hopeless since the western mind cannot escape the conditioning of logical thinking.  Any spiritualism from India is complex, ceremonial and not practical. Other sects of Buddhism generally do not have true comprehension, lost their way focusing on non-essentials etc. He reserves his most disparaging remarks for Indian religions and monks (and does his best to show that though Buddhism originated in India, it is really the Chinese and Japanese due to their practical nature made something of it).  Is this just the standard fundamentalism/ misplaced racism?  I will definitely read other books on Zen and go beyond this author. 
 My brother picked up this cd used for a few dollars at the local record store because it looked interesting.  Wow, we couldn't keep a straight face throughout this album, it's so amazingly terrible, we just laughed through every song.  I don't want to offend any of our friends overseas, but wow, this guy doesn't even rap!  he just talks with his deep accent over boring beats, I honestly tried to give this album a fair chance, and it hurt my ears.  I mean, have you ever heard something just so awful (like Men Without Hats) that it's funny?  That's the vibe this album gives me.  I have no idea why this guy is successful, maybe there is subliminal messages in the music brainwashing people to like it, but then again, people LOVED the Macarena at one point, so it doesn't surprise me.  Anywho, I'm gonna go ahead and end this review, to the serious hip hop fan, avoid this album like the plague, get a restraining order if you have to.  For people that are charmed and fascinated with English accents and bad music, this cd is right up your alley.  The Zappe 
 Forget the terrible layout, labeling and location of buttons. Forget the fact that the cover won't close if the mic stands are in place. Forget the lack of any type of anti-skip technology. The overall quality of the machine is OK. I had a hard enough time finding a CD player that DID NOT include a radio tuner and my daughter loves to sing so the karaoke is a nice bonus. Sanrio should be ashamed of selling this player WITHOUT an AC adaptor. There is alway a fair amount of "batteries not included" at Christmas, but a even your basic $12 CD player includes a AC adaptor. I now have to search the electronics store for a plug that will match so my daughters Cars soundtrack doesn't drain my bank account and continue to fill the landfill with dead batteries. 
 When my husband developed acid reflux, it was recommended that he lower his carb intake. As long time lacto vegetarians (no fish, meat or eggs, yes to dairy), this sounded particularly challenging.  I bought 3 different low carb cookbooks from Amazon a month ago: "Low-carb Vegetarian" by Celia Brooks Brown, "Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes For Healthy Lifestyle" by Robin Robertson and "The New Glucose Revolution Low GI Vegetarian Cookbook: 80 Delicious Vegetarian and Vegan Recipes Made Easy with the Glycemic Index" by Dr. Jennie Brand-Miller   After a month of consistent cooking I have rarely used Brown's "Low-carb Vegetarian" which is laden with ~50% recipes that use eggs.  There are some great recipes in there if you eat eggs though.  On the other hand, my copy of "Carb Conscious Vegetarian: 150 Delicious Recipes For Healthy Lifestyle" by Robin Robertson is a bit dog-eared already.  Delicious, innovative recipes with new ways to use foods common to the vegetarian and wonderful exploring of unusual but easily available new veggies and protein options.  "The New Glucose Revolution Low GI Vegetarian Cookbook"  by Dr. Jennie Brand-Miller was rich with information and great recipes.  It taught me a lot.   But by far Robertson's "Carb Conscious Vegetarian" is the best.  I will say that I don't know either of these authors and am doing this to help a buyer who may be wondering which one to get...  By the way, a low carb/lower acid diet has really eased the acid reflux my husband suffers from. We eat a main meal during the day and a protein drink at night, even if working: switched when consuming. And I am starting to lose weight...  Hope this helps!        
 I have to say I am a huge PKD fan, and have read just about all of his books.  And before you dismiss this review, know that I read and enjoyed Valis and The Divine Invasion, precursors to this book, the third in the series.  But, sadly, this book just was not the vintage Dick classic that Ubik, or A Scanner Darkly was.  In fact, I was disgusted with this book, and to date, I have loved every one of Dick's books, even the more obscure ones (Galactic Pot Healer).  Though Ubik and my personal favorite Now Wait For Last Year had a strong, cohesive plot littered with welcome digressions and departures, I can't help thinking that Transmigration was just one long digression lacking any sort of structure, and without the strong and interesting characters in Dick's other books.  With a slew of obscure references to various operas, epic poems, and other pieces of the impotent intellectual vangaurd, it seemed Dick was trying to prove to us his cultural superiority and sophistication.  And that is not the Philip K. Dick I know and admire.  I suppose if you feel compelled to read everything that Dick has written, then read this, but do yourself a favor and borrow it because it is not a book that you will want to re-read 
 Songs like this are nothing but desperate last ditch attempts at making a few dollars before people forget who you are. All anyone ever knew Shakira for was her hips and her stripper style dancing, so what does she do? Releases a song about that exact attribute and plays on that single attribute like there's no tomorrow. This song is equivalent to J-Lo releasing a song in 5 years about her huge butt after she's all washed up and everyone has forgot about her.  Truth be told the hips DO lie, the hips are so full of bs it's not even funny... It's gotten so bad she cant even sing any more, so they digitize her voice Cher style and feature some poser mainstream idiot like Wyclef who hasn't done anything even half decent since the Soul Assassin days.   We're all waiting for Shakira's money to dry up and for her to do Playboy then fall off the face of the earth. Hurry up already 
 I agree with the other reviewer. I bought all of the books in this series and am shocked at how much of the advice has been taken from previous authors on these topics. She is copying classics like Emily Post and simply re-wording the text. Except for the cute drawings, this series is a waste of money. If you want to know how to do things "correctly", read Letitia Baldridge's "The New Manners For the '90's". It covers everything and is written by a woman with the education and experience to know of which she speaks! Not someone who using her fashion connections to flood the magazines and talk shows with her "discovery" of this information 
 Well, it sounds like a great game, but after five hours of upgrading and downloading all of the specified programs and upgrades, I couldn't get the video to work at all, couldn't get technical support at all, and I gave up and have returned it to the manufacturer. a great disappointment because i love and still play the previous versions 
 The book meanders around, involving detailed descriptions of trips to and from airports.  Never gets to the point of what the Queen Jade is, and about three pages from the end the author apologizes for never arriving at the point of the novel or what the mystery is 
 This was one of the first books in a good while that I almost didn't finish. It is, without a doubt, one of the worst books I have read in a long time. The style of the writing is cramped, and hard to comprehend at  times. I also found it hard to keep track of most of the people in the  book. I do have some pity for her, it must be hard to write a biography of  such a mean spirited man 
 For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie 
 The expectations for this film were high- a good cast and a promise of a remake of an old movie using today's technology.  Alas- the movie was disappointing. The characters were not developed and the were quite flat.  The action starts very soon in the movie (the wave striking the ship) and thus there was no opportunity for them to develop.  The course of the movie did not allow for any significant development. Moreover, the special affects and all the action are not very well tied together or simply not believable. For example all the surviving passangers, including a young kid prove to be record swimmers that can hold their breath for a long period.  It is a pity as if the script was a bit better and more developed the film could have been enjoyable. 
 A neighbor gave me this book to read.  I have read the DaVinci Code and I thought it was good fiction mixed with some fact.  Of Course Dan Brown strings together many unrelated truths half truths and fabrications to make his story interesting, so it is quite easy to write an expose showing where he stepped over the line.  This critique of The DaVinci Code goes too far the other way trying to spin "Orthodox" Christianity as the only true religion and the "Orthodox" point of view the only "true" history of the last 2000 years.  The authors have dumbed down the subject matter, omitted information and scholarship contrary to their point of view, and created a book that borders on propaganda.  One part of the book that I found very annoying was the failure to address the historical excesses of institutional or "Orthodox" Christianity.  The Authors criticise Brown for writing that the Church (both Catholic and Protestant) Burned or otherwise murdered "Millions" of heretics.  The authors concede that the number is closer to 50 or 60 thousand.  So which is worse?  Making a mistake concerning the number of heretics murdered?  Or defending the institution that actually murdered thousands of people?  (And I would assume if we add in the Crusades both against the Muslims and the "heretics" we'd probably get a lot closer to the million than thousand figure.)  Another spin made by the authors actually caused me to laugh out loud.  You should read how these "Orthodox" scholars are spinning the female responsibility for the fall/oppression of females nexus.  Here's what they say.  The original sin in the Bible was Adam not working hard enough to spiritually protect his family.  This is a very "unorthodox" and "unbiblical spin designed to distract you from the fact that Judaism, Islam and Christianity have for centuries oppressed women because Eve ate the Fruit First.  What does Brother Paul say about it     11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.  12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp* authority over the man, but to be in silence*.  13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.  14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.  15 Notwithstanding she* shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety   I think Paul would be very angry reading the Author's attempt to put a "new age" spin the scripture to fit a more modern interpretation of the story.  This spin also flies in the face of Christian History.  And I do not feel any better about it even though the Authors point out that pagan cultures have abused women as well.  So what?  Do two wrongs make a right? If Orthodox Christianity is "true" why did it take the institution almost 2000 years to figure out that men and women were equal and figure out that the story in Genesis and Paul's exposition of it were wrong?   Ultimately this book fails because it is plain dishonest.  Yes it points out some issues where Dan Brown obviously inflates the truth, or even creates it out of nothing.  Brown's book has historical errors and it does have a point of view and an agenda.  However, this does not excuse the propaganda and misdirection contained in "Cracking Da Vinci's Code." 
 I was tempted to toss this book into the trash after reading the first two paragraphs that pronounced God dead and the character Anna master, oh, excuse me, mistress of the earth.  But then I begin to wonder just what kind of point was this author trying to make. I forced myself to trudge forward with the novel and found the story line and characters quite novel.  But too many times shivers ran down my back as the author pronounced, through the heroine, Anna, her hatred of people, especially those who believe in God.  How can anyone who cares so much for plants and animals wish for "an Old Testament God to visit the peak with one of His famous scourges: a lightning storm that would blast the rock clean of cloying humanity".. 
 Peter Beard has not gotten wiser in his old age. He has given into his vices and chosen the superficial payoffs over any morals. He has found no escape from his aimlessness, no direction from his chaotic meanderings. Where has this man ever really gone? Why has he become so tragic? This book reveals the illusion of greatness, the anticipation of accomplishment. But sadly, decades later, we see how withered and little this man has become. One wonders, was he ever even exceptional? He seemed fearless and passionate. Now, he just seems fatally emphatic and senseless. He is like a machine grinding to a halt. 
 While the book was plentiful of wild, sensual fantasies, I was disappointed in some of them.  Many were hard to believe even for fantasies and many sounded like they were written by illiterates.  If you're looking  for this type of book, I strongly recommend "Women on Top" 
 Mr. Lord could have written a good book.  He has the tools and the know-how, and he did his research.  He made one fatal error, however.  Actually he made not one, but two mistakes.  The first mistake is that his starting point is wrong.  As a trained journalist, he does as a journalist does - he keeps trying to find "dirt", or rather manufacture dirt - all in order to give us a "balanced view".  One can't help feeling, as one reads interview after interview, that Mr. Lord has somehow picked only the disgruntled, caustic and jealous remarks to print.  The second mistake was in underestimating "James Herriot"'s fans, and familys goodwill towards him.  He treats his subject manner as just another subject, as routine grist for the gossip mill, but Alf Wight was not that kind of person. He was a person totally out of Mr. Lord's scope and understanding.  He underestimated Mr. Wight's fans and family's tolerance for having his name besmearched, and, indeed, his son wrote another book in response, a beautiful book about his father, and in it he easily refutes all Mr. Lord's accusations - and turns Mr. Lord into a laughingstock.  Because anybody who has read the two books side by side - which I just did - would realize that Mr. Lord has indeed made a laughingstock of himself.  While there are some good parts to the book, they are very much overshadowed by the other parts.  There are two good chapters - in the middle - which were written factually - the chapters dealing with the content of James Herriot's first books, and the publishing history.  There is a good reason why this is so - Mr. Lord was indeed part of the publishing business and would have been privy to that sort of information.    But much of the book is exactly what he accuses James Herriot of writing - pure fiction.  It would take too long to point out every one of Mr. Lord's mistakes, but I would like to simply write just a few of the many mistakes Mr. Lord makes.  The rest, if you still want to read this book, you could find out for yourself.  The first accusation Mr. Lord makes about James Herriot is that Alf Wight did not write a semi-autobiography, but rather pure fiction.  He maintains that even if this were so, it would not matter, because the books are still entertaining.  With that salve to his conscience, he methodically starts to take apart many stories in an effort to prove them fiction.    His first assertion - that it would not matter if it were actually fiction, is simply not true.  It would matter, and matter a lot, to both his fans and friends and family.  His son says as much in his book- that it would matter a lot if his books are fiction.  Fortunately for us, Mr. Lord does not bring a single proof that could stand up to scrutiny.  His method seems to be - I don't think this story is true, so it's probably not.  That's it.  Not one single proof.  For instance, he says that Alf Wight's memoirs of his war years are fiction - because the dates are wrong.  He says that Alf Wight joined the army in March, 1941, and was discharged two years later, and therefore his story that he was called up to the RAF while his wife was expecting their first child is a fictional story.  His son, in his book "The Real James Herriot" explains that he enlisted in the RAF in March, but was NOT CALLED UP until 15 months later, in November 1942, when his wife was indeed, expecting their first child.  Is it possible his son and wife might know when he joined the RAF better than Mr. Lord?  Especially since Mr. Lord actually admits that he is going from hearsay - since the RAF would not give Mr. Lord access to their records, claiming that they were still classified?  This should be enough of a blooper to discredit Mr. Lord; however, there are many, many more - so many that it would be funny if it were not also very, very sad that someone could so easily print a book full of lies and get away with it (by prefacing all his explanations with "perhaps" he covers himself from libel, I suppose).  Another example of Mr. Lord's innuendos -  he quotes from one of Mr. Herriot's books that James Herriot was taken aback by the red (and squished) face of his newborn son, and asked the nurse if there was something wrong with the child.  Mr. Lord asks how can this story be true if he is a vet?  Just so, explains his son, animals are born much more fully formed than humans are.  (A horse is born already able to walk as soon as he is born).  Mr. Lord falls flat in the mud.  Mr. Lord quotes James Herriot as saying that 90% of his stories are based on real life.  Mr. Lord asks how that can  be - when the Herriot books say that he joined Seigfried's practice in 1937, when he actually started working there in 1941?  Mr. Lord, I think we are ready for a lesson in English.  Do you know what the words "based on true life" means?  "Based" means "based", not "actually, exactly, fact".  When he first started writing, he was hoping to remain anonymous, and therefore disguised his stories so that the people he was writing about would not recognize themselves.  He changed the location of his practice to the Dales, he changed the dates, he even changed the characters - some from a man to a woman, for example.  He put two stories into one, etc. etc.  This all falls under the heading of "based on real life".   There are many, many more examples of this in his book - where he "proves" that James Herriot was writing fiction - and he has no proof whatsoever.  Not even one single time.    If there is one person writing fiction, that person is Mr. Lord.  Mr. Lord spends two entire chapters on a conjecture of how Alf's childhood might have been like - all based on the assumption that Alf had grown up in grinding poverty.  These chapters become almost a farce when we read his sons portrayal of his real childhood - although his parents were not rich they were certainly never poor, and Alf had a very happy childhood.  He also explains the economics of why this was so.  Which puts Mr. Lord's two chapters of conjecture on how Alf's unhappy childhood might have been like in the category it deserves - pure fiction.  While the poverty of the under-class in Glasgow in the 1920's is certainly very sad, it definitely does not belong in a biography of Alf Wight.  Another mistake that Mr. Lord makes is that he constantly contradicts himself.  For example, in one chapter he spends many paragraphs conjecturing on why Alf was always poor, when he should have had a thriving practice - and the fanciful castles he builds in the air are very elaborate indeed.  And yet in another chapter he quotes a neighbor as saying - "oh, they claimed they didn't have any money but that wasn't true.  They had money for everthing - a tennis court, ballet lessons for Rosie, etc."  This came across as a vitriolic statement, but of course in contradiction to his earlier assumption that he was poor.  Mr. Lord, you can't really have it both ways, can you?  Another example - he constantly quotes Eddie Steanton throughout the book, with all kinds of outrageous comments, yet he himself quotes one of Eddie's colleagues "oh, Eddie always exaggerates, you can't believe everything he says".  And later in the book it comes out that Eddie had had a falling out with Alf Wight, and I would assume that his "memories" might be somewhat tainted by those sentiments.  And yet Mr. Lord accepts Mr. Streaton as a fully credible source.  As matters stand now, this book is laughable and barely deserving of a review - except for one thing:  if Mr. Wight's son would not have written his own biography, Mr. Lord's fictious book would have remained as the factual biography of  Alf Wight.  He would have succeeded in besmirching Alf Wight's name with his book full of lies (oh, excuse me, fiction).  The fact that his son wrote his own biography, and a beautiful and moving one at that, has turned Mr. Lord's book into a joke, a book that his fans would not touch with a ten-foot pole, but Mr. Lord did not know that in advance.  He tried to change James Herriot's fans opinion of their idol, by trying to find "dirt" on him, and that was a very low thing.  The fact is that he fortunately did not succeed, but that does not take away from what Mr. Lord tried to do.  Mr. Lord, shame on you 
 Since the end of the Cold War, writers and political commentators have suggested that we have entered a new war - a war brought on by the "clash of civilizations". The theory, as told by writers such as Samuel Huntington and Bernard Lewis, amongst others, suggests that "the west" is at war with Islam and that this global divide will replace the earlier Cold War acrimony. Not for any particular reason or circumstance is this war being waged against us, they suggest, but merely because of its violent nature and hatred of western civilization. It is the very essence of Islam, a religion that does not share core values with ours which is the problem, and the only way to contain its violence is to be merciless in our efforts to do so.     Aside from this rhetoric being advocated as "fact" by news organizations such as FOX cable news, CNN, and most newspapers, this thesis has been regularly used by the powerful to justify wars. The U.S. used it to justify the war with Iraq and Afghanistan; Serbs and Croatians used it to justify ethnic cleansing of Bosnian and Kosovar Muslims; and it is used by Israel to justify their "war" with Palestinians.    The Clash of Civilization rhetoric suggests that the world will always be at war. As opposed to the Cold War with the Soviet Union (a country only in existence for less than a century), Islam is an old religion spread  throughout the world. The framework of the Cold war between the Communist "east" and the capitalist "west" did prove useful in making this theory. The new war is between the rational, democratic, secular, and tolerant "west" and the irrational, fundamentalist, and violent "east". Orwell could have predicted this well: the new enemy created on the morning after the old enemies fell. It almost seems that for the "west"  to feel at home with itself, it needs to be at constant war with some "other". Perhaps it provides some guidance to what we are and what we are not - we are simply not the "other". Perhaps Chomsky and others who have suggested that a major reason that states fight wars is for domestic reasons and for the disciplining of a nation's own population are right.     Not according to the "clash theorists" like Bernard Lewis, who claim that the clash will continue as long as Islam exists. He believes that the radical Islamic militants are not deviants from Islam, but actually have a more correct view of it. They will therefore likely become more influential over the years. But if such a clash really existed, why then do western nations continue to support both financially and militarily such Islamic groups and nations? As Eqbal Amad noted, the U.S. has long supported this very enemy, be it with Iraq (during and after the Iraq-Iran wars), the Saudi Monarchy, or the Afghani Mujahadeen.     Perhaps this theory falls within the entire framework of colonialism. Western colonial nations conquered the world and forced its non-western inhabitants to submit to their authority. It was believed and advocated that colonialism would help these "backward" people in the long run to become just like the colonists. Beyond the arrogance of the idea, colonialism developed sophisticated systems of slavery and servitude that sought to extract valuable natural resources from these areas for the sole benefit of their the colonizers own nations.     Interestingly anti-western Islamic militants use the same kind of "absolute conflict" to frame their war with the West. They say the conflict is between the hedonistic, degenerate, repressive, soulless West and the just, truthful, and moral center of Islam. Speaking to this subject, writers Qureshi and Sells note:     "Those who proclaim such a clash of civilizations, speaking for the West or for Islam, exhibit the characteristics of fundamentalism: the assumption of a static essence, knowable immediately, of each civilization, the ability to ignore history and tradition, and the desire to lead the ideological battle on behalf of one of the clashing civilizations". 
 If you're looking for a book that will give you practical, nuts and bolts, down to brass tacks advice on how to make a quality, professional looking DV movie on an ultra-low budget then "Digital Moviemaking" by Scott Billups is NOT the book you're looking for. This book was obviously written by a tech-nerd for other tech-nerds.  The majority of this book is technical information and history and should instead be entitled:"Hi-Definition Video Moviemaking" as this is what Billups spends the majority of the book discussing. There is precious little in this book that a low-budget filmmaker will find of use. Billups and co. are apparently of the opinion that it's a waste of time shooting on anything other than HD video or 35mm film and seem to have nothing but contempt for Independent, low-budget filmmakers.  If you are an aspiring filmmaker who has a good movie idea and want to know how to shoot it on an ultra-low budget then don't waste your money buying this book. I recommend instead reading "Digital Filmmaking 101" by Dale Newton and John Gaspard which is a much better book that explains in layman's terms how to shoot a quality, professional looking movie on digital video. It was written by 2 guys who have made good low-budget films and have a lot more respect for and understanding of independent, low-budget filmmakers than Scott Billups. 
 I loved A Fire Upon the Deep and A Deepness in the Sky, so I was looking forward to this one.  Unfortunately, Vinge bobbles the ball with flat, uninteresting and unsympathetic characters. The world envisioned isn't all that strange from a technical perspective (which is fine), but it is also characterized by a nearly unrelenting nastiness. I don't have a big problem with that, as it isn't too far off from the way reality is headed, but without anyone I care about to make the journey with, it simply isn't worth the time 
 This book is an example of an anti-intellectual propaganda movement born inside Israel that aims to disprove the existance of palestinians.  The idea behind works of this sort is that if the claims of Palestinians to the land they live on can be weakened, unthinkable measures such as mass deportations will become possible.  The book starts with an argument that what is now Israel was empty land before european jews started to arrive in the mid 1800s.  That every census and every bit of historical data invalidates that absurd idea does not bother the author in the least.  The same old story is repeated:  There were no palestinians.  Almost all arabs in what is now Israel are claimed to be savage migrants from surrounding countries who were drawn to the great european civilization brought into palestine by the early zionists.  He draws greatly on the universally discredited work "from time Immemorial" by peters in support of his case.  As usual, anti-arab european sources are quoted to show how what is today Israel was a wasteland.  The problem with how those sources are used is that they could be used to draw the same conclusion about every other country in the middle east.  Europeans saw every country outside europe as savage uneconomic wastelands in that colonial era.  The writer fails to make the case that Palestine was especially different.  The worst problem the book faces is that none of the census data validates its claims.  The census data shows a consistantly increasing native palestinian population.  Peters' work was demolished years ago.  Neither the British Archives nor any other source confirms any of the outragous claims made.  The book then moves on to the 1948 war.  It makes the rather incredible claim that the all the palestinian refugees were not refugees at all.  They all voluntarily decided to leave their towns!  The war didn't matter.  Civilian massacres didn't matter.  They all just decided to leave.  When looking for a reason, the best Avneri can come up with is that they all deserted their homes as part of the sinister arab conspiracy(tm).  They left their homes and became refugees so the arab armies could better destroy Israel.  Further, they were all expecting to share in some sort of loot after the war was won so their homes didn't matter to them.  It makes no sense to anyone outside the close world of the Israeli right.   The book might find use as a doorstop, but aside from that its of no value to anyone.  Those who agree with its ideas will learn nothing new, at best it can provide reinforcement to a closed mind.    Anyone else is going to see through to the political agenda of the author and the false nature of the work.  Beyond that, the reality in Israel today is a palestinian population in the occupied territories mostly born long after 1948.  The so-called right of return can be solved easily.....the solution is called American Cash.  The irony is that the so-called right of return for Palestinians could have been settled by the americans for an amount of money far less than what they have spent so far civilizing Iraq.  
 This is more of a pamphlet than a book. It is very small and does not contain much for the BBQ'er unless you are a complete novice. Most of the sauce recipes are not "from scratch". They have you adding things to store bought sauces. There are much better books for yo 
 First, the thesis of The God Code is an intriguing one. I applaud new and creative ideas that attempt to meld science and spirituality. Nonetheless, some aspects of the book I found a bit difficult to get down with. Some of these one could reasonably expect an editor or proofreaders to catch, as accidental typos and incorrect transcriptions do happen. There are several in this text. Without tiring you with a list, let me give one example: on page 16, Braden states Pioneer 10 is almost 11 light years away, and then he writes it took 11 hours to send a signal to it from Earth. Nothing humans are apt to use travels faster than the speed of light, so the existence of any signal that could reduce the amount of time it takes light to travel in one year to the space of only an hour is truly questionable.  At times Braden had to rely on other experts in telling his story. The feedback he received on evolution certainly was not as precise as it could have been. First, even though he treats creationism and evolution as competing theories, it must be noted that a scientific theory is not the same as the way "theory" is used in the vernacular. So although one can refer to creationism "theory" in conversation, to put it in the same sentence with evolutionary theory may mislead some readers who do not beforehand understand the difference between scientific theory and a conjecture. Generally, scientific theory is not only testable, but has more or less passed every test to which it has been subjected. That it may need modification from time to time-or be incomplete-does not place it in the same category as belief or faith or hypothesis or revelation.  Speaking of evolution, yes, the evidence does appear to support it. Braden's questioning of evolutionary premises seems based on a few assumptions that are not even in the theory. For instance, new forms of life do not "descend" from others per se as he suggests the theory claims. Evolution does not proceed in a line, but is rather a motley series of disparate forms resulting from what appears to be almost random motion away from simple beginnings toward forms where more complexity may or may not be present. Increasing complexity is an incidental consequence of natural selection. After all, bacteria still dominate on almost every level. Life appears to seek ways to reproduce itself, period. Sometimes more complex life forms do develop from other life forms (as they secure new niches in which to prosper), but more complexity is not always advantageous.  Another point: even though Braden appears to suggest otherwise, species can and do co-exist, even if one apparently provided the basis for another. There is a huge number of such examples in nature. Further, there is no reason to assume humans should have evolved other species by now simply because our genotype has been around for 160,000 to 200,000 years. Plenty of species have been around essentially unchanged for millions of years, and this is not a problem for the theory of natural selection (for to be more precise, evolution is the fact and natural selection is the corresponding theory).  I found his analysis of the "God code" itself interesting, but not compelling. I do not say that to be disparaging, because I know that the advancement of human knowledge often begins in flights of fancy. However, as Braden takes his logical leaps, some things stand out. Let's just accept for a moment that his conversion of "atomic mass" to what he calls "simple mass" is a logical progression. Given that (and that is a stretch), the atomic mass of oxygen is 15.99, which converts to 16, not 15 as he states. That gives us Z, not V (in the charts he provides). This may not invalidate his argument, depending on the meaning and history of Z, but he doesn't even address Z.  Furthermore, I believe Figure 6.5 needs further development or explication. As it is, it adds nothing to the discussion. I would have found an analysis of the chart in Appendix C much more enlightening (e.g., how the number of atoms in each DNA base relate to the numbers in the God code). Perhaps that is a subject for future writing?  A couple more nit-picks. Throughout the text, he often uses "while" when he actually means "although." I realize new uses for words become more acceptable in writing as people insist continue to use words incorrectly in conversation and informal prose. My favorite example not in this book (and mind you I understand it is simply an example of how language develops and changes) is the ubiquitous current use of "impact" as a verb. For all I know, "while" can now correctly be used in place of "although," but my publication manual still draws a distinction. The other irritant is the man uses way more exclamation points in this book than any school girl would. 
 the writer's attempt to deconstruct Paul only shows how much he does not understand Paul's epistles. It is a sad fact that those who cannot grasp something, simply because that understanding is not in them, try to make it into something else completely. Hoping, thus, to 'justify' themselves. 
 I liked Terry McMillan's "The Interruption of Everything", so I was really looking forward to reading this book- but it was one of the worst, most frustrating books I've ever read. First of all, the writing is on about a sixth-grade level. Example: "...Charles asked me if I wanted to dance. I said yes. So we danced. He danced like a man who was sure of himself. He watched me. I watched him. He smiled at me. I smiled at him." That's when I rolled my eyes and gave up. Unfortunately it was on page 365!! From then on I scanned the rest of the pages, just to satisfy my curiosity about what would happen to the rest of these characters. Secondly, most of the characters are complete morons, except for Gloria, who seemed real to me. (Working mom, single, trying to do the best for her son...) The other three jump into bed with EVERY man they meet, usually within the first three hours of meeting him. Then they whine and moan about how there are no good men out there. Well, DUH!!! Perhaps this is the point of the book, self-fufilling prophecy. I do like the title. It describes that feeling of waiting while what you want (husband, job, baby, etc.) hasn't happened yet. But this book was a disappointing waste of time. 
 This movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and Amazon customers that I was expecting great things. While I agree the acting (especially the girls playing Christy and Ariel) is excellent the story is just too implausible and I got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from Canada to the US (yes they are Irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the US from Canada). Anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the US with their two kids illegally, without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country?  I know the dad is an actor but couldn't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to Manhattan? The mom is a teacher but can't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally. Yet there is money for private school, fixing up the dump of an apartment, an expensive camcorder, betting the rent money on an ET doll etc.  I can't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the "drug house" with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please.  Mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child - a son - that has recently died.  I kept expecting someone to call Social Services.   And the medical situations with both Frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched. The symbolism between Mateo, the new baby and Frankie is very heavy handed. Though the film is told through the oldest daughter's eyes  because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children.  And there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all.   Maybe if I had taken it more as a fable I would have "gotten" this movie more but I was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed. 
 This film tells a story about LaSalle Parish in Louisiana (and by extension the rest of America). Sheriff Darryl is shown handling the rigors of his job. Oddly, he carries no pistol - a symbol of lacking something? A truck overturns on a curve, and spills its load of shoes. The poor people show up to carry off their free shoes, recalling that scene in Charles Dickens "Tale of Two Cities". Then a dead body is found, and this scandal should be censored, says the political boss and judge. Sheriff Darryl is visited by an exotic dancer who reports her husband is missing (after dancing at a private club). The rest of the film tells how the murder was solved.  The language and contents of this film would have been banned prior to the 1990s. While "realistic" about the lost souls it portrays, it seems to have no redeeming social values. Yes, it gives a view to politics and personalities not usually seen in films, and which can educate the viewers. The film does not mention the corporations (like Big Oil) that dominated the politics of Louisiana, and other states. We see how the Twin-Party System meets at the top to accomplish its missions. Like in a small county, the heads of the opposing parties meet to divide the spoils. In this film the Governor loses an election. Was he too clean? So a new Administration takes office, and life goes on unchanged. There are some winners and loser, but that's the way the ball bounces. Blaming a small businessman who has a claim against the county seems too cynical. 
 I read the other reviews praising this book and have to assume that I was not in the right space to appreciate this book when I read it. This was the most boring piece of literature ever written. I know it was a period piece/coming of age story etc., but pages upon pages of people picking cotton, talking about cotton, and talking about picking cotton...zzzzzz....it took me forever to finish because I kept passing out and having nightmares of- yep, cotton 
 I was really disappointed with this item, especially as it's nutrition info is really amazing.  It's very gritty and strong tasting and did not blend well.  It's also dark green, which isn't a big deal for a lot of items but can turn things a very weird color depending on what you blend it with.    I am returning them as there are better tasting and equally nutritious protein powders available. 
 Talk about long winded!!!  I find this a difficult read, he goes from one subject to another leaving me saying "whaaaaaat??".  Maybre I'm just a moron, got up to page 75ish & chucked. I read for pleasure, why tourture myself??!!!  It's too bad because he has always facinated me... 
 First, to any stray Zep fans, this book is nothing like the books you're used to reading about the band. The book is written by an associate professor of music, in hideous modern academic jargon. You know, the blocky, obfuscating style the professors deploy to make their subjects or themselves seem more profound than they really are. Examining a Jimmy Page solo note-by-note is of extremely limited interest to anyone but graduate musicology students-and has high music culture declined so much that they now have to fill their syllabi with Zeppelin's catalog? Sure, I'd rather listen to "Gallows Pole" than some atonal serialist composer, but this book is laying it on way too thick. Tedious and unrewarding 
 This is a great book for people aspiring to become a professional gunsmith.  It may have some usefulness for the normal gun owner as well.  The detail and comments provided show this book was written by someone with an extreme amount of knowledge and experience in the subject.  Unfortunately the author realizes this and wrote this book to reflect it.  His egotistical lectures of exactly what the reader should do go beyond what I expected to gain from this book.  Then there are the contradictions that lead me to not believe in the author's knowledge as much as I did when I started.   If you want a very technical guide on how to become a professional gunsmith, this is the book for you.  If you want a Do-It-Yourself Gun Repair Manual (Gunsmithing at Home) look elsewhere. 
 This book is getting mixed reviews. It seems like friends of the author say its great. Those who tried to actually use the book are disappointed that everything is so out of date. This edition was not updated since the first edition and is now really out of date. Things change, but sloppy research is always out of style 
 The Carafe design on this coffeemaker is not very good.  No matter how careful or how I adjust my grip, water/coffee leaks from the top and down the side.  I have to place a towel under it to prevent a puddle on my counter 
 Many reviewers on this site read TLGPE in the 70's, when we were young and impressionable. (I happened to be 13 when I read it.) If one could be sued for intellectual forgery, Lindsey would certainly be found at fault.  Most of us, thankfully, have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years. After all, when we read TLGPE, we were young. We were searching and seeking. We didn't have all of the facts. There were wolves who knew this, and they preyed upon us. Many people who were older, yet still intellectually undeveloped, read this book and were moved to 'believing'.  For most of us, our minds matured. We began to see the vast chinks in Lindsey's pompous Christian armor. We began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen, by people who use a subtle, gentle cloth of manipulation to control others.  This is beyond dangerous. It is beyond extreme, as most of us have now found out.  I love a good horror novel. I love a good 'true crime' thriller. But the fact that people read Lindsey's books and take them at face value is, perhaps, one of the scariest notions I have ever imagined.  That, dear reader, is beyond horrific . . . and far more terrifying than anything you'll find in the bible or any of Lindeys 'books'. The only thing scarier is that Mr. Lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated, silly, contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago. Please don't be the next sucker. Please don't add this one to your cart.  
 There is no need for this item.  It is a huge inconvenience to have this big stiff box in the middle of your bed.  I hated having a wall between my baby and me.  When I woke up to nurse, I had to take her out of it anyway.  Co-sleeping is intuitive, naturally safe and easy easy easy... please don't spend your money on this unnecessary complication of a natural arrangement. 
 Professor Gardner himself is an example of a learned person who has mastery, but lacks understanding. People, including bright persons, do apply their knowledge to reality. They are not all stuck in a time warp where the false values of their childhood control their "understanding."  Lawyers practice law. Physicists do physics. Historians write history.  Where is the gap between mastery and understanding that he opines? May it not be that there are levels of understanding? Is there really an opposition between knowing and understanding? Perhaps for Prof. Gardner, but not, I think, for the rest of us. Those who can think out of the box, so to speak, in their respective fields, the ones who can be creative are a limited number. They help and enlighten us all. Can a teacher show a child that he or she really doesn't understand what he claims to "know"? Of course. Children are malleable. Even adults can be persuaded to revise their thinking by a sufficiently persuasive speaker even if what that speaker proposes is false. We've seen it time and time again. He's riding that old hobby horse that rote learning is destroying society. It's not. It's reformers like Prof. Gardner that are driving sincere educators to despair as they drive more and more dictators of our schools to believe that the education we are giving and have been giving is inadequate through and through, based on too many false premises, and that we are all up a creek intellectually. It's the height of elitism, and hides a deeper lack of understanding 
 this thing sucks, as does their telephone support.  was told that it didn't support using 2 computers.  it seems it should.  am still on hold while i write this 
 this book is extremly bad,,too mucho technich and encripted,,with stupid examples and long long lines,,saying nothing,, this book is so bad,,that I did not finish reading it,, is so boring,,if I could I would give 0 star to this book,,,I highly reccommend the book "the first time manager,,,"  that book is master and exceptional,,written in a very simple a open language,,this book is 100% excellent.. 
 Koontz is one of the best writers of fiction today, but Cold Fire and Hidaway are two of his worst books in my opinion.  Not much there.  Readable but I would check these out from the Library before you add them to your collection.  Ironically I own Hard Cover copies of both of these books.  I made the mistake of buying them when they first came out because I was a big fan of his other works.  I don't own  much fiction in my library and I would gladly swap these two books for Hard Copies of Dragon Tears or The Bad Place.  I will trade both for a Hard copy of Swan Song by Robert R. McCammon 
 Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  But, this IS a good concept... unfortunately, Amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality!  So, until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds... DO NOT try and download Season 1, Episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7!!!  1, 3, 8, 9, and 10 were the only ones that were 100% complete for me 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 Barber's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism. It works, somewhat, but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question. Not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology, as the War in Iraq has shown us. 
 If you want to read a book by someone who does not have any entrepreneurial experience... This book is for you...  if you want to read a summary of all entrepreneurial ideas... This book is again for you... Otherwise it is a big zero... Do not spend your money or time.. 
 Let me start by saying that I would have given this book zero stars if I could.  The reviews I've read are all true.  This book is boring, extremely repetitive and a waste of time.  The only reason I finished it was because I paid for it.  I truly believe that Danielle Steel has lost her gift of writing.  She has not published a good book in a long time.  I also think that she's lost her editor, because to me, a good editor wouldn't let books like this be printed.  This story pretty much follows stories she's done before except it's told from the guy's point of view.  There's the rich guy, Charlie, who can't seem to find the "perfect" girl to marry.  He finds a flaw with every one he dates.  He lost his parents at a young age, his sister left school to raise him, and just before he graduated college, she died of a brain tumor.  So of course he's afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him.  Then there's rich Adam, whose wife left him and took their two children with her.  It was a bitter divorce, so he has no desire to ever marry again.  He dates girls half his age and never stays with one long.  His parents blame him for the divorce.  Every time he visits them, his mother let's him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family.  The last of the trio is Gary, a struggling artist.  He has no desire to ever marry or date.  The three men spend the month of August each year on Charlie's yacht, partying and going on and on about how they don't want commitments.  Well of course, each one meets someone, they start to date, they argue, they break up, they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after.  Same old story.  Danielle Steel should stop writing.  You can't tell me she doesn't have enough money to live on.  I for one will not read any more of her books, even a paperback, and I won't even bother renting them from the library.  I won't waste my time having to check the book out and worrying about getting it back on time.  There are better authors available and I'm going to read them 
  Whatever else the GLTB community may find laudable about this waste of a video disk, the undeniable fact is that the cover blurbs coyly and disingenuously suggest that it is a comedy, and that is a boldfaced lie.  Featuring world famous funny man Dom DeLuise, the movie is described as what happens when he casts real life lesbians in the roles of two on-stage lesbians...and "sparks fly."  As it is, the only sparks that probably flew occurred when someone with greater sense tried to set fire to the master reels and destroy this boring piece of tripe.  From the movie's self-proclaimed description, and with DeLuise in a major role, the comic possibilities that suggest themselves to the potential viewer are endless:  Does DeLuise KNOW that the actresses are lesbians?  Do the production's other members? Does that derail the production?  What mayhem ensues?   In point of fact, however, the single attempt at "comedy" comes from DeLuise's portrayal of the director as a prissy, fastidious old queen, pampered and catered to by his boy-toy assistant each time he gets the vapors and overheats.    The bulk of the movie is essentially dull documentary monologue, as the "actresses" explain to the camera their respective experiences in being cast in the roles of on-stage lovers.  Unfortunately, there is nothing endearing or even slightly interesting about either character and the result is a great bore.  The few flashback scenes where the viewer actually sees the two characters practicing their on-stage roles under DeLuise's fevered direction come across as uncomfortably voyeuristic.  There is an inescapable feeling that the camera, the viewer, AND DeLuise, are intruders.  About the only thing that CAN be said about this film is that Director Lee Friedlander mercifully eschewed the usual Hollywood practice of casting preternaturally beautiful women in the lead roles, thereby adding at least a touch of reality to this otherwise banal effort; the lead actresses look like just any two women off the street.  Other reviewers have commented on the bad, infomercial level acting of the two lead characters.  Whether or not that is accurate depends upon whether the leads, Robin Greenspan and Lacie Harmon, are actually lesbians simply playing themselves.  If so, then this IS bad acting.  If the women are straight, however, one has to at least give them credit for convincing performances.  Sadly, there is not much other credit to be given to anything else about this film.  
 My dell Photo 964 and this server weren't compatible.  I think it is my printer's problem not the server's 
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation. 
 If like some reviewers you love and embrace New Age books then skip this review.  I am a scientist and teacher with no patience for the way in which authors in this genre attempt to cloak themselves in legitimacy by using scientific terminology. This book co-opts a term from quantum physics, 'tachyon', in order to cynically exploit any person unfamiliar with the term who thinks it sounds kind of neat. Ironically *tachyons do not even exist*, and thus can not 'create frequencies', a very concise bit of total nonsense. In fact the book grabs huge handfulls of real and pretend terms--biophoton, superconductor, energy, vortex and on and on--to try and produce an aura of authenticity. And thereby sell you the book.  It's like packaging styrofoam peanuts and selling them as free money on sale cheap! In contrast consider this: Hydrogen atoms are real and *can* create light particles called photons (not 'biophotons' which do not exist).  These have very well-understood intrinsic frequencies related to the structure of the hydrogen atoms from which they originate. Marvelously we can measure these frequencies not only in a laboratory but also in the light coming from distant stars, which tells us that like our sun the distant stars are made primarily of hydrogen.  This is a real, tangible result from real science, and you can repeat the experiment as often as you like and come up with the same actual result.  It is entirely repeatable and entirely self-consistent. If you're interested in learning more about quantum physics, check out the many great books that are out there, for example _QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter_ by Richard Feynman, guaranteed completely devoid of styrofoam peanuts

 Hi,  I have used this book among others to get accepted to McKinsey (and with success) and I think this book gave me less then others.  The advantages are the more or less detailed frameworks chapter and the real-life interviews chapter, but the cases themselves are rather superficial and sometimes even obviously ridiculous(like for example the case in which a Star-Trek like omnipotent people transporter has been invented, and the book claims that it wouldn't replace cars because it costs 100,000$. Come on, they would buy one for every block). I think there are much better resources than this.  Good luck with your interviews 
 I gave up counting the mistakes and misunderstanding after I reached 100 - and had only reached the third chapter. The author opposes every major medical advance of the last 200 years: X-rays, vaccination, pharmaceuticals, blood tests, antibiotics, contraceptives, surgery etc etc  etc. Although couched in terms of "patient empowerment" this book  is, in reality, deeply reactionary. The author imagines a "golden  age" (in medaeival times) when humans and nature lived in perfect  harmony, a friendly local white witch brewed magic herbs to cure all your  ills and the sun always shone. In reality, life was nasty, brutish and  short. Life expectancy was about 30 years, 75% of children died in infancy,  50% of women died in childbirth. The advice given is particularly damaging  to women. Any woman who followed this book would end up continuously  pregnant (no contraceptives)with breast/cervical cancer (no screening)and  smallpox (no vaccination) living in a hut with no TV/telephone/computer (EM  radiation) and, in fact no electricity (radiation from cables). She  couldn't leave the house (pollution) and certainly not use a car (fumes,  toxins etc) and would only eat what she could grow in her own back yard  (organic food). Ms Heimlich seems rather irritated that people (in the  West) live longer than ever before and are healthier than at any time in  human history - since this contradicts her basic premise. If you want a  good laugh, read this book and make a list of all the things you have to  stop doing in order to stay "healthy". I find it very disturbing  that people are prepared to exploit the fears of the vulnerable in order to  line their pockets with cash 
 Not all Microsoft Press books are equal. This one is difficult to read, overly complicated and poorly organized. I stopped studying with this book and switched to a CDROM-based video training program, which proved much better. 
 This is not the product I wanted and would like to return it.  How can I do that? 
 This is one of those films that makes me think it must be impossible for anyone to make a truly great film.  The back cover makes it sound like a must-see for anyone going through a tough time in their lives and wanting a shoulder to lean on, and it seems all the critics concur that that's not an inacurate description, yet when I tried watching this film, I couldn't stand it!  The whole thing was a jumbled mess.  It kept going back and forth between things that I just didn't care about, tedious, boring things, and I think it focused too much on the criminals involved in the story, making them sound sympathetic or whatever, when the film was about a cop who was overcome by grief (supposedly, or something like that) at the death of his partner who was VICIOUSLY KILLED by a criminal.  A story like this shouldn't spend petty time detailing the exploits, trials and tribulations and whatnot of why the vicious killer kills people and does whatever else and all whatever...and when the writer wasn't focusing on the goodfornothing criminals, it focused on a bunch of pathetic backstory, the kind that makes teenagers cringe at the thought of reading a book (too much "character development").  And then I saw a truly breathtaking film, titled BATMAN RETURNS (1992) and was blown away by its depiction of heartbreak combined with stunning visuals, and everyone else is like "oh, who cares?"  I truly hate this film and I hate the society that lets people make such mediocre crap and then acts like its THEIR civil duty to put up with it (as in watch it) and then say they liked it.  And no, not all my favorite films are action/pop-corn flix.  I also liked 1999's BRINGING OUT THE DEAD, as well as 1976's TAXI DRIVER, and I even enjoy the occasional "little movie" (there's too many to mention, but I'll start with the last one I saw that I enjoyed: THE WILD DOGS, by the director of THE HANGING GARDEN - another film I hated).  Ok, that's all I have to say about this film 
 Harlen Coben is an fabulous writer and I usually adore listening to his books on CD. But Promise Me was a difficult listen because of the reader. When I checked to see who the reader was, it was Coben himself! Coben should stick to writing and have his books read by actors 
 The first third of the book was interesting in a Tom Clancy-esqe near future meets the past with a bang sort of way.  However, after the inital encounter, no one from 1942 behaves the way that real Allied leaders would have behaved in 1942. The task force from the future had enough information and firepower to take out the leadership of all the Axis powers *easily* and likely end the war immediately, yet they do nothing of the sort.   But that would mean no sequel books 
 My son hit .515 as an 8 year old last year.  This year, he moved up a division and has struggled at around .250, even though he has a fairly nice swing.  Using this device for two weeks, he suddenly can't hit anything.  I pitched him hardballs today and he swung over the top of every one of the first 60!  The problem with this device is that the ball doesn't drop like a pitched ball, so it actually trains them to swing higher than normal.  I'll be putting this away for the season and trying to recover my son's swing and confidence.  Don't get me wrong, the kids love it.  The entire team lines up before every game and begs you to throw fastballs with it.  It's great for use around the house - just tie it to a tree and you can take swings that you couldn't otherwise.  Beware if you intend to use this for much more than casual practice and don't let it replace live pitching.  Fun-factor is a 5, but as far as a training device, I have to question its value 
      After using Dr.Dyer's aaah meditation CD for a month, I decided that I wanted to learn more this meditation. Therefore, I bought the book Manifest Your Destiny.  The book reads like a personal journal about nine insights he has gained from his own search for spiritualism.  There are many things that disturb me about this book.        Dr. Dyer cites quotes from the bible to substantiate some of his points without citing the book, chapter, or verse.  One of the bible quotes he uses is "Is it not written in your law `I have said, You are gods?'" (John 10:34)  This is the passage to which Jesus referred when He said this to the Pharisees who were attempting to charge Him with blasphemy: " God standeth in the congregation of God; He judgeth among the gods. How long will ye judge unjustly, And respect the persons of the wicked? ... I said, Ye are gods, And all of you sons of the Most High."  (Psalms 82:1,2,6). The unjust judges of Israel (i.e., the Pharisees) were the subject of these verses.  They were civil magistrates because of their authority and power; and, they represented divine majesty in the government of the twelve tribes of Israel.  Dr. Dyer uses this verse completely out of context.   Scripture cannot be broken.        Jesus believed in the bible because it is infallible and immutable as are God's other laws.  A true seeker of spiritualism cannot reconfigure God's Word for his own purpose.  Neither can the true spiritual seeker be ignorant about God's Word and actually expect to know God's and come into a relationship with Him.  Dr. Dyer takes a little bit of truth and expands upon it in a somewhat convincing way to fit our desire for an easy road to spiritualism. The fact of the matter is that according to Jesus the door to God's kingdom is narrow (Luke 13:24).   There are no shortcuts.       Lastly, a true spiritual seeker does not strive to become spiritual with the intention of manifesting worldly possessions.  This appears to be a main theme of Dr. Dyer's book.  Those who seek God first gain all they need to be happy in this world as a "gift" from Him.  We do not need to grasp at anything as long as we trust God and put Him first in our lives.  Dr. Dyer seems to miss the point. 
 There was such promise, a woman who had "escaped" her ho-hum marriage, gone back to her roots was finding herself, starting her art work back up, caring for her mysteriously crazy mother, and then she "had" to fall for a monk, and turned this story into a romance novel.  When she "married" herself with knots into the sea, and lovingly talked about mermaids, it had some hope of independence, then it failed, going back to her husband after the "affair" (she got dumped for God.)  She didn't go back stronger, she went back wimpier and needy.  Sure, she had art in a gallery, but whee....where was her growth??  There wasn't any.  Sorry.  This novel leaves the reader disappointed and sad.  Ugh! 
 I am fascinated with this machine.   It has incredible detail although it lacks a little lattitude and details are lost as soon as there are some shadows.  The battery so far usually lasts me the whole day when I go touring.   If I take care to shut the display down as soon as I dont need it anymore I find that when I am on a cruise ship or visiting another country I can take all the movies I usually want - - and recharge when I get back to my room at night.   The only problem is playback on a TV or PC.   The bundled software made by ULEAD is not user friendly and, whereas the previous Xacti I had played back images and video clips in the order I had taken, this one separates  them and plays back either clips or images.   Before I played back through my Panasonic Hard Disk DVD recorder and recorded a DVD directly.   Now I have to go into my PC and do a whole lot of editing and so far the "Movie FActory" program keeps crashing.  I imagine somebody will eventually suggest a better software program, or I will learn to use Ulead, but for the time being the pictures and clips Ihave taken have very good detail, and the machine has operated flawlessly. 
 "Take most of the equity out of your home by refinancing into an interest-only mortgage. Then use the cash taken from your home to buy a permanent life insurance policy." That's the brilliant strategy that Snow weaves between rants against other financial professionals. Why don't these other professionals recommend such a strategy? Ethics. Not because it wouldn't be luctrative - the insurance policies Snow advocates pay huge commisions - just one of the many reasons to be wary of the network of "Hero" advisors this book has spawned. Fortuantely the economy is providing its own warning against Snow's silver bullet - the very loans she advocates are defaulting in record numbers just as the book was released. Underscoring perhaps the biggest hole in her strategy - rates won't necessarily stay near their all time lows. And saving yourself from mutual fund expenses doesn't mean that UL's are as bad or worse. Can you say 7.5% front end load? Snow can.  
 The subject matter of this book is something that is of tremendous use in an elementary classroom. However, the text is choppy, and the subject hard to follow from one idea to the next.  Even the illustrations fail to  provide a common thread woven throughout the book.  The collage style  pictures are beautiful to look at, but confusing to tie together,  especially when paired with the choppy text 
 This new avengers book is more of marvels great line of crap.  If you have any apperation of any of the heroes in this book don't get involved with it.  They ruin the image of wolverine. he gets his butt handed to him by Spider Woman.  NOT Cool.   When will marvel get their act together.  Stay away from this one 
 Actually to call this crap music is an insult to every musician. All this is are a bunch of uneducated punk racists spewing out hate and disrespect. They have no class and no morals and anyone who likes them is about the same 
 If you are a complete beginner with respect to many of the skills needed for Ajax: HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript, then this book might be for you.  All of the O'reilly Head First/Head Rush series are excellent teaching books and do a wonderful job at teaching skills in small bite-size chunks.  Lots of pictures, exercises and games.  This is about as fun as a book can get.  But once you've read the book, you'll realize that you really didn't cover much ground at all.  400 pages of Head Rush Ajax is about the same amount of Ajax technical material as 40 pages of Ajax in Action.  All those fun pictures and games take up a lot of pages!  Only the most basic topics of Ajax are covered.  Much of the book is wasted explaining web-development 101 level subjects...  So it wasn't possible for me to give the book 2 different ratings.  As a pure beginner's book - this is a 4 or 5 star book.  But if you already know HTML, HTTP, DOM, and CSS -- then this book becomes a 2 star Ajax book because it teaches so little about Ajax.       
 This book is packed with arguments, facts, theories, and ideas that anyone in the sociology of religion will be interested in. Stark and Finke are leaders in their discipline, and their work demands attention.   There is a lot that is good here. For example, their illustration of the ways in which social networks determine religious identity is key. I also appreciate the whole "religious economy" metaphor; indeed, religions do compete for customers these days and definitely "market" themselves, which I agree does cause more people to actually get involved. In short, advertising works -- and religions have figured that out.   I had problems with a lot of their assertions. For one: secularization. They claim that secularization theory is dumb, dillusional, and dead. Are they serious? C'mon. Just look at the data. The evidence is strong and clear: belief in God and church attendance are CLEARLy declining in places like great Britain, France, Holland, Germany (especially east germany), Czech Republic, and religion is at an all-time low in Scandinavia (!!) -- and also Japan. Secularization may not be happening in the U.S. or much of the world, but to deny its reality in most of Europe is simply blind. Look also at Jews -- most are now non-believers, even in Israel. Compare that to Jews 200 years ago -- yet another major example of secularization that S and F avoid dealing with. And also see the rates in Canada, where belief is also down (see Reginald Bibby)....for the evidence of secularization in selected countries, see the work of Steve Bruce, Grace Davie, and even the recent World Values Surveys from Inglehart, et al.    Another problem with this book is the wacky "rational choice" silliness. Please -- and these guys claim to have degrees in sociology? Rational choice theory is so pithy, so lame, so weak it is hard to believe ANYONE takes it seriously. The bottom line is that "costs" and "rewards" are subjective. And to say that people "choose" their religion is obviously true on some basic level, but it obfuscates broader cultural, historical, and social forces that make up the heart of the sociological imagination - see Phil Zuckerman's solid critique in his latest book on soc. of religion.     Finally, their clear argument in the Introduction that only persons of faith can be "truly scientific" when studying religion is laughable 
 The Book from Alex Haley when I read it some 10 years ago changed my life and views of people with color, and everyone should read it, yes even conservatives, manditory.    however, this movie something just wasnt good.   to long?  the over all acting?    Spike, you make some great movies, Summer of Sam is one of your best, Do the Right Thing. Spike has a gift for cinematography, however   Spike Lee Interview on ESPN? The interview said,   interviewer:  "Kanye West said that Bush doesn't care about black people. Would you agree with that?   Lee:  "Yes, I agree with that, BUT I'll go one step further and say that Bush doesn't care about people who don't have any money (whether they're black or white.) I guaranteed you that if this same disaster happened on Long Island or let's say The Hamptons, you would have had an entirley different response from FEMA and his administration."   But you should have seen how he said it, it was as if he was staring right into the camera with this smirk on his face. The dude is bold man, I'll give him that and I applaude him.   Spike said either black, white, Mexican, or asian.  But what he DIDN'T say was Italians!!   That dude has been getting flack forever for his dis'n of Italians in his movies, they call him a racist all the time.   HERE WAS HIS CHANCE to say something, and he blew it.   just didn't happen to say Italians?   NO  So HE is a racist too.   And so are the Africans in Africa, they never have liked white people either, so what about that Spike? Try going over their and applying for a job!   And while I am at, the African Americans in even Baton Rouge don't want the blacks from N.O. coming up their! How come spike never said anything about that?   Fkn whiners, so many the world over! give them a mic and let them talk and will put it on TV and let the world see it for the fools they are.   And ignoramus white liberals eat it up as its gospel and he is telling Da Truth  
 UFO creativity was gone for sure after Schenker left. They tried heroically to survive, released some good albuns ( MECHANIX, mainly ), them succumbed to commercial interest, transforming themselves (lyrically, mainly ) into a kind of Bon Jovi or Whitesnake pos-1987. The album is ridiculous, the band should have stopped right and then 
 This is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.  I really enjoyed "Single's Ward" and thought I'd give this a try.  The characters were overplayed and the movie seemed drag on and on.  I would have been disappointed had I spent $4.00 renting this movie--unfortunately I bought it.  If you really want to buy the movie, email me and I'll give you a great deal on mine.  My copy has only been used once 
 I wouldn't recommended this workout DVD to anyone! There was way too much chit-chat and it was very difficult to follow the three instructors. I've had this DVD for less than two weeks and sold it in a local pawn shop for $2 
 Most of the strip were either hard and brittle or so tough they could barely be chewed. They put no expiration date on the bags so I don't even know if I was given old product or they allowed the salmon to leave the processing plant this way. On top of this, they were too spicy. My dog seemed to enjoy it though.  The Ahi tuna, on the other hand, was great 
 While I do not actually possess this recording, I can tell you right now that you should not ever buy it.  Baktabak is not U2's label.  U2's initial Irish releases were on CBS (U2:3, Another Day, and 11 O'clock Tick Tock within Ireland), and then they switched to Island with the 23 May 1980 outside-Ireland release of 11 O'clock Tick Tock.  In the US, they are represented by Interscope, a division of Universal (who also own Island).  U2 has no relation to Baktabak - this is an unofficial, unauthorised bootleg release and U2 do not receive any profit.  I have nothing against unofficial recordings.  I possess many concerts and interviews myself.  However, NO-ONE should ever profit from bootlegging.  If you want a copy of this, organise an equal trade - many in the fan world will be happy to do this.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOTLEG.  Amazon should not be selling it 
 Typical O'Rourke drivel. Heres how it goes.  PJ gets Rolling Stone to pay to send him to Lebanon, Panama (circa Noriega) and some other places where they have lots of guns and bad manners and little of anything else, in the hopes that he will get drunk enough to wander out from the hotel bar, see some "bad stuff" and come up with something funny to say about it. His humor is pointed and well placed at times. Most of the time though he, merely, uses the humor to set up some libertarian screed. Heavy reliance on Cato institute,intern-toadies(who fact check, research and do the academic heavy lifting) at times gives O'Rourke the appearance of knowing his arse from a hole in the ground....do not be fooled. PJ is a Hunter Thompson wannabe, but who lacks HT'S gonads. SKIP IT 
 The premise of this series is fun-- a group of servants are behind their employer's success.  Unfortunately the writing is very poor.  Language is repetitive, even within paragraphs, and the author makes zero effort to use historically accurate language or incorporate norms of social behavior of the day (the only "historical" details I saw were relying on fires for heat and horses for transport).  The characters all speak in 2006 English-- the only nod to Victorian language seems to be use of the terms "lass" and "lad".  The dialogue just wasn't very well done.  It was odd-- the book had many, many typos and obvious editing problems, too-- just seemed thrown together in a short time vs. well-written and well-produced.  I was disappointed-- this book could have been so much better.  
 Mr Silber must indeed be very good at self-promotion: he obviously got all his friends and extended family to write great reviews about this mediocre book.  When I set out to pick a book on self-promotion, I wanted useful insights (something a little deeper than "smile, and the world smiles with you"), or at least a clear method -- a set of carefully selected and tested steps. After reading so many reviews praising this book, I thought I had finally found what I was looking for.  Big mistake. This book is not clear, or organized, or particularly insightful. It's just a big, long jumble of ideas loosely grouped into chapters that all seem to talk about everything and nothing. It is not very well written in terms of either formal grammar or style, and is only mildly amusing, as the lack of a clear direction quickly makes it boring.  But that's not all: the book is filled with quotes and pseudo-scientific "facts" that may be appropriate for a casual conversation among friends over a beer at a bar, but definitely not for a book that the reader would like to be able to rely on. In other words, it reads a lot more like The National Enquirer than The Washington Post.  In my opinion the author makes the mistake of confusing creative people with ignorant, unsophisticated people lacking a critical sense 
 Flynn offers up a fast-paced, if unbelievable story.  Unfortunately, character development is paper thin and clearly portrays Flynn's political preferences.  Characters, like Rapp, with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles, have all the answers and are always showing those good-for-nothing politicians how the "real world" works.  Meanwhile, Flynn's politicians (the majority of whom are Democrats) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election.  While there are grains of truth in his characters, Flynn consistently goes for the cheap, partisan stereotype.  I was looking for a well-developed political/military thriller.  I'm still looking. 
 First of all, Rufus Wainwright's vocals are extremely annoying throughout a MAJORITY of this album. I REALLY, REALLY tried to enojoy it, but his voice inevitably blends into this muddled mess of sound that requires a focused concentration to understand.  The only real exception is on track 1 where he manages to create an interesting sound with his voice.  Secondly, the production on this album is terrible. The tracks don't know when to end. Each track goes on, and on, and on......and when you think it's gonna end, the song goes on some more. I love long tracks, but give me something to listen to. The various layers on each song simply cover each other and create a listening clusterf&*k as opposed to complementing each other to form a unique and enjoyable listening experience. (Listen to 'The Fragile', compare, and you'll understand completely.)  Finally, Rufus Wainwright's lyrics (on THIS album) do absolutely nothing for me. They are extremely boring, meandering, and do not hold my attention for more than about 15 seconds. Honestly the only lyrics on this album I remember are 'bread crumbs in the big black forest'. (repeated about 100 times)  I understand some of you will hate this review because you think this album is fantastic. But, I ASSURE YOU, there is an abundance of music (in various genres) waiting to be heard that is, quite simply, MUCH BETTER. So start looking and I hope you find something you WILL LOVE soon 
 A wonderful series with outstanding military and historical foundation and detail, gone bad. The writer doesn't even seem to know his own characters anymore. The sex scenes seem like they were written by a 14 year old kid. When I began to get the distinct impression that the author had lost his way, I put the book down. As a historian, I'm disappointed that Whyte has chosen to sell out with this drivel 
 I was under the impression that this book was a true to life accounting of events leading up to the Tet Offensive of 1968.  I bought the book based upon the recommendations here.  I was disappointed to find that it was more of a heavily gilded diary, with little to no credibility where actual events are recounted.    Further, I did not enjoy the overall ego-centricity of the contents, and would've like to read about the accomplishments of the men in this LRP unit, rather than the personal jabs (sometimes scornful) and off-hand speculations of the first-person author.  I've judged the contents of this book as misleading, but perhaps others will enjoy it more as a story that plays fast and loose with the facts.  I guess I was just expecting this book to be more of a hard-core Vietnam era combat account. [... 
 Lots of common sense. A few good insights. But all buried beneath mountains of endless repetition. Simple ideas obscured by turning them into psudo-mathematical formulas. Endless repetition. Dozens of made-up acronyms. Did I mention endless repetition. Of the same ideas. Repeatedly. Author laments no room for specific case studies, which might have actually given some color and life to the book. Of course there was no room for real-life examples. He was too busy turning simple ideas into obscure psudo-math and impossible-to-follow diagrams. Repeatedly 
 This jacket is so tight that it holds down all the buttons at once and the Creative Zen will not work with it on.  Do not waste your money on this product, you will be very disappointed.  
 PLease consider how many books there are out there before you pick up THIS one.  Though you may be a fan of suspense or romance, this has a plot that has managed to be predictable, dull, and pretentious all at once.  The story is a basic spy story, and the little romance is obscured by slang which has no place in today's literature.  The author tends to describe things in a way that could take paragraphs (if not pages) to explain.  The only reason to go near this book is for a school project or in class assignment.  Otherwise, ther is no reason to read through this "classic".  
 For me this movie is a painfull thing to watch. I wish that I could give this 0 stars. The infamous fake "O" scene kind of recked true intamacy for me. It may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable.   One of the truths for us guys is that when we are cuddiling with a woman we fanasise that we are with the first girl we fell in love with.   Just FYI.   
 The reviews posted on the site are longer than the book. It is less than 100 pages long and about 1/4" thick. I know it is a "value" book but it's a tiny, quick read that would be more suitable to a Good Housekeeping magazine (granted not PG rated!) than a book 
 I enjoy the pottery barn style and since we are doing minor renovations that give me an excuse to redecorate my bedroom I couldn't wait for this book to arrive. I checked the online reviews of all the PB books and saw some complaints, but I thought overall I'd be glad I made this purchase. Wrong! I flipped through it once right after getting it and I doubt I'll pick it up again. I recall a reviewer of one of the other PB books saying there's nothing in here that you can't get from one of the PB magazines and that reviewer was right. I actually think the bed and bath magazines are better than this book. I'm very glad I purchased just this book and didn't waste money on the entire set. I guess I'll wait for the next PB magazine to come in the mail for any redecorating inspiration 
 i think Susan Sontag is missing the political nature of illness.  as far as i'm concerned there is a culture of blaming the victim in our society that is not limited to medicine.  the victim is blamed because the victim has little power.  the ill person is blamed because the tobacco companies are powerful, the oil companies are powerful, the sugar companies are powerful, the retail chains are powerful, the manufacturers are powerful, the health insurance companies are powerful and the governments are powerful.  they have armies of lawyers to defend them; they have armies of doctors, scientists, and psychiatrists to fabricate pseudo-scientific evidence to support their self interest, but the victim is powerless to defend themselves against blame.  this isn't about language, it's about politics of money and power.  language is only one of the tools that the powerful use to blame the ill, and victims more generally 
   If you think Bill's other books were a laugh a minute then you'll enjoy this lexicon of hyperbolic spin. He doesn't prevaricate about everything, but O'Reilly's pontifical assault on people who ostensibly lean toward the left gets to be over the top. Bill Clinton and Al Gore are just a couple of Democrats that he caustically lambastes in this book, which isn't a bad thing. The Clinton and Gore Administration committed many serious moral crimes; NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) being the worst of them all, unfortunately O'Reilly doesn't even mention anything about it. If he wanted to make an airtight case against the Clinton Administration, nailing him on the NAFTA issue would have been the way to do it, considering many Americans lost their jobs behind this travesty. O'Reilly then goes on about Bill Moyers, Ted Kennedy, Hillary Clinton and so on. The issue I do agree with O'Reilly on is that if Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2008 the Democrats and the nation will see more dark days ahead of them.  Moreover, if you're looking for typical rightwing reactionary commentary you've come to the right place. O'Reilly is Rupert Murdock's propaganda pigeon through and through. When O'Reilly attacks the media's insalubrities, he focuses his attention on celebrities instead of the source. He slams individuals such as Whitney Houston, Jennifer Lopez, and Bobby Brown because of their nefarious practices. Instead of slamming these people why not slam the media for promoting their acidulous behavior. His boss owns over eighty tabloid newspapers in Europe. So, why not reprimand Murdock.  What made the arguments in this book really silly was when O'Reilly said "I believe George W. Bush is personally honest but [he] is also a charter member of the power-establishment club that plays by its own rules. To credit, Mr. Bush has a vision he thinks will help working Americans. But theoretical caring and actively looking out for people and crusading for justice are two very different things." I can't believe this guy has the audacity to claim that Bush is honest and that he cares. If Hurricane Katrina reveals anything about Bush, it reveals where his heart truly resides, and it's not with the American people or the ethical side of politics. It's scary to even imagine that many Americans actually take O'Reilly seriously. This book is an easy read (in other words it's very simple). Just remember to investigate his facts before buying into his rightwing rhetoric. Many things he magniloquently articulates are accurate but there are always two sides to every story. If he spent as much time lambasting the Neo-Con like he did the (so-called) Leftwing then maybe he would be taken more seriously.    
 I saw Jon Stewart interview Kristol last night on the daily show.  As best I can remember, Jon said:   "Bill, you people were way ahead of the curve!  This book proves that you were wrong about Iraq _way_ before everyone else was wrong about Iraq!"  That sums it up pretty nicely.  I think history will show that Kristol & Co were also wrong about Bush being a conservative (as that word is currently understood) but it'll take a few more years to be sure.  Conservatives: buy this book, get extra copies for your friends, remember how sure of yourselves you were, and never forget how wrong you were.  Moderates and liberals: all you need to know is summed up in the Jon Stewart quot 
 This book is about as bad as it gets.  Whether you support evolution or disagree with it, you won't find anything in this book that suggests an intelligent analysis of the controversey.  The author has been caught in several instances of plagarism.  His best defense of this book would be that he stole it from someone else 
 If the first book was a struggle then this one was pure torture. Once again we are subjected to mountains of macabre deaths while the protagonist consistently regresses each time you THINK he will grow from the events around him. The female counterpoint is pure stereotype and if you can't guess the ending by the fourth chapter then you might have a chance at enjoying this author's work. McIntosh has managed to make the second book move the story backwards, a trick I have not seen done before. The glaring question is WHY 
 Don't let a fondness for Proustian luxe sucker you into purchasing this book containing mediocre photography and a text of perfumed flatulence.  The ostensible purpose of the book is to reveal French urban, aristocratic taste as of the late twentieth century, or more accurately the taste of their designers (the usual cast of Henri, Renzo, etc.)and other arbiters of taste (Hubert, Alexis, Carlos, etc.).  Certainly, there are more than enough interiors of the mummefied magnificence that comes from cocooning staggering numbers of objects in layer after layer of fabric (WARNING:  Do not try at home.  If you do not possess first-rate things and have access to the production from the best mills in Italy and France, you will achieve only The Old Junkshop look), but the pictures are uniformly fuzzy, muddy and printed on poor quality paper.  Most maddening of all, the photography neglects genuine masterpieces (you cannot catch more than a glimpse, for example, of the incomparable Ingres portrait of Betty Rothschild) while devoting page after page to boring tabletop vignettes usually consisting of a few knicknacks and photographs of long-dead nobodies as children.  In fact, the real purpose of the book is apparently to provide the author with a vehicle to boast about her ancestors (many of those same long-dead nobodies) and the elegant life they led.  There is also a stench of moral decay most evident in the fawning description of Lady Mosley with an outrageous defense of British fascism before World War II.  Mostly, however, the premise of the book seems to be that you are what you own, or more accurately what you inherit -- a concept so inherently ridiculous that even the owners of the homes depicted in the book had the good sense for the most part to insist on anonymity.  If you truly want to revel in the atmosphere of things past, make yourself a cup of tea, find a hard biscuit and settle back in your recliner with the first volume of you know what 
 What it this? Disney's original animated film `The Jungle Book' was made in 1967, and after almost 40 years they released a sequel `The Jungle Book 2.' What is the point of doing this anyway?  To be fair, the sequel is not a horrible film. It has more colors (more light colors in the jungle) and comes with the original's exhilarating `Bare Necessities.' Who can dislike this song? And the introductory part using stick puppets is cleverly done, letting us into the world of the wild child Mowgli and his friends.  But after that, about 10 minutes or so, the film suddenly starts to look not-so-ambitious attempt to re-tell the story of the original, which should have been ended 40 years ago. In this sequel Mowgli, who is fed up with the rules of the village, goes back to the jungle where his friend big bear Baloo is living and dancing to that charming song alone. Now Baloo is happy to meet the boy again for he is lonely and needs a partner to do the musical number.  But we are not so happy. That is partly because their reunion virtually ignores the original film's conclusion, and partly because we know the same story has just begun again. The difference between the 1967 version and this one is that Shanti also steps into the jungle with a little boy Ranjan, but this slight difference means little to us because both of them are quite unmemorable.   After all, the problem is not the fact that the story of `The Jungle Book 2' in fact retreads that of the original because few people would still remember the details of the film made 40 years ago. The real drawback is that in `JB2' nothing interesting happens except the last 10 minutes where the bad tiger tries to kill Mowgli. The film provides musical scenes (which are decent themselves), but they only stretch the thin story. Even though I love the song Bare Necessities, I don't want to listen to it three times in a short film that only runs 72 minutes.  To me (I am living in Japan) the most shocking thing about the film is that like the so-so film `Return to Neverland' `The Jungle Book 2' was originally made for video, and then was chosen for theatrical release in USA and UK. That they can do such a thing is as unaccountable as the company's choice of the material for the sequel 
 This is a very cool toy. If it was just a toy rating I'd give it 5 stars. The current price of near 60 bucks is way to high. I picked up this three piece set at a warehouse store this weekend for 17 bucks and each individual potato is only 8 bucks a piece.   This rocks. The case is cool and my two year loves the giant potato to play with, just don't pay more then 25 bucks for it is all. 
 I read the book to see how far Lindsey could go,and it's way too far.This book is nothing but hate filled lies to flame up the hate against Islam by evangelical neocons who want to make  their form of Christianty the main religion in the world.I'm terrified by how many people but into Lindsey's mindset.It's a  tragic time we live in when all that matters is using religion for power and economic controll.He refuses to see the mistakes the United States has made to support Israel at all costs,especially our security.He has absolutely no understanding of cause and effect,of how we are in the mess we in now.Muslims aren't the ones destroying Christianty,it's  people like Lindsey who make followers into rabid Islam  hating war mongers 
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 I bought this game 5 days ago and when i finally got it it was missing a pice of plastic in the middle so that i could not play the game and the case was also damage 
 Having never read a book by Danielle Steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels, I was looking forward to reading Answered Prayers, since I usually always find the books more deep and interesting. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before.  Secondly, the moment Brad is introduced into the plot, I could foresee with certainty, how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end. So as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading, I reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable, the book couldn't possibly be Danielle Steel's "Number One Bestseller" as the cover proclaims...seems like I have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a "bestseller".  The major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination. Even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other. Faith is sweet and caring, has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Her husband is cold, unreligious and gives her no attention.  Brad is sweet and caring, has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving him feeling lonely and sad. His wife is cold, unreligious and gives him no attention. Even Faith's "deep dark secret" is too unoriginal, and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book, leaving no room for curiosity and suspense.  Halfway through the book, I was so bored that I considered giving up reading it altogether. However I kept pushing on, praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere, to at least make reading Answered Prayers worthwhile... Unlike Faith however, my prayers remained unanswered... It's going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a Danielle Steel novel again...  
 Kenneth Roberts Deepening Democracy? The Modern Left and Social Movements in Chile and Peru (Stanford, 1998)  Dr. Roberts is a professor of Political Science at Cornell University and has spent the last 15 years studying and lecturing about leftist politics in Latin America.  This book is essentially an outgrowth of his dissertation from 1992, "In Search of a New Identity: Dictatorship, Democracy, and the Evolution of the Left in Chile and Peru."  In this book, Dr. Kenneth Roberts chronicles the path of the socialist and communist movements in Chile and Peru over the last century.  He pays particular attention to the transformation of the Socialist and Communist parties in Chile immediately from 1970 until the early 1990s.  While the title purports to investigate both Chile and Peru, the bulk of the book revolved around the Chilean experience; a mere 67 of 300 pages was dedicated to Peruvian politics.  Thus, a reader looking for Peruvian insights may be disappointed. However, he juxtaposes both Chile and Peru because of the relative success of leftist parties in Chile and Peru; Chile has one of the more successful experiences while Peru ranks as one of the least successful.   In his forward, Dr. Roberts states, "I offer no magical solutions or bold prescriptions to resolve the dilemmas of the partisan Left and social movements in Latin America.  My more modest hope is that his book might contribute to a clearer understanding of the nature of these dilemmas so that they may one day be tackled more effectively."  Thus, he lays out his observation of existing leftist parties in Latin America and his prescriptions for them to improve their political lot in Latin American nations.   First Dr. Roberts lays out his political theory of `deepening democracy' and `extending democracy.'  Simply put, the deepening process is a solely political process where more people participate in government, and the extending process is one where democratic processes continue in social or economic spheres.  Both of these processes are necessary because these nations do not have long histories as democratic entities.  However, he focuses on the deepening as especially important throughout the book.   He bemoans the fact that this deepening process also dilutes the fervor that some political organizations can wield.  For example, the Socialist Party in Chile has changed its tactics from an outside revolutionary party to one that has agreed to live within the rules laid down by the exiting Chilean autocracy.  In contrast, the Communist party in Chile has evolved into a more revolutionary stance and is unwilling to compromise its core beliefs.  As a result, the Socialist Party has deepened itself while also diluting its former power base.  This phenomenon is essentially the `big tent' theory of American political parties; parties need to branch out from their core constituencies to reach the center.  While branching out, they risk alienating the same core constituencies that form their foundation of support.   Roberts left out some key explanations regarding the Communist Party's challenges in Chile.  He implies that the Communists have been denied participation in the last ten years solely because the centrist Christian Democrats will not allow the communists to participate in their coalition.  A more probable reality is that the Christian Democrats will not willingly include a revolutionary party in their governing cabinet, especially one that has continued to campaign for a revolutionary overthrow of the existing government.  For this reason and many others, the Communist Party has been unable to capitalize on the removal of Pinochet.   In his description of Chile's success since Pinochet's departure, Dr. Roberts never intimates that the dictator's legacy could be partially responsible for the continued success of the Chilean democracy, only that these conservative institutions impede the progress that the left desires for Chile.  In other words, it is anathema to him that the socialists and Christina Democrats might actually be less successful without the neo-liberalism in Chile and without the constitutional impediments to the left's social agenda.      Dr. Roberts also leaves out some key economic information in his book, which leads to suspicion.  For example, all of his economic data, such as "Evolution of Employment and Unemployment in Chile" and "Main Economic Indicators for Chile," start in 1973.  A better economic analysis would have shown at least 5 years prior to Allende's government, which started in 1970.  Roberts simply does not show the reader the economic depths to which Allende plunged the Chilean economy during his presidency.  Thus the reader is forced to either ignore this economic reality or perform research outside the book.  We are left with the following description regarding Allende's economic performance on page 93: "...the economy stagnated and inflationary pressures accumulated as consumption surged, investment and productivity plummeted, international credits dried up..."  In contrast, he carefully notes each economic setback suffered under Pinochet such as this statement on page 121: "...when a financial crisis plunged Chile into the worst recession in its modern history, causing the economy to shrink by nearly 13 percent in 1982-1983."  The reader is left to ponder whether or not the economic crisis of 1973 was better or worse than the crisis of 1983, and also must ponder what year marks the start of Roberts's `modern history' of Chile.  While these omissions may seem trivial, examples abound throughout the book and weaken his argument.  A more analytical analysis might have provided weaker support for Roberts's arguments, but it would have been more intellectually honest.     With this and several other omissions, it is obvious that Dr. Roberts is more concerned with advancing the political fortunes of leftist political parties in Latin America than he is with actual progress in these nations.  On page 1 he states, "The shallowness of these regimes (new democracies) can be seen in democratic procedures...and the accentuation of socioeconomic inequalities that mock the formal political equality of democratic citizenship."  Thus he shows his disappointment that these nations have not more quickly evolved into social paradises with more equal representative governments and a more socialized distribution of wealth.  He obvious holds the military dictatorships of Cuba and Nicaragua in high esteem while disparaging all other military dictatorship in the region.   In other words, Roberts is characteristic of several Latin American scholars and Latin American studies programs in the USA.  All in all he cites more than 464 works and nearly 600 footnotes.  Not one of these footnotes or published works apparently has a good thing to say about neo-liberal economics in Latin America over the last 50 years.  At the same time, not one of these footnotes seems to be critical of the military dictatorships in either Nicaragua or Cuba.  This book is hardly a balanced account of how nations can grow using at least some principles from either the classical or even modern day neo-liberal economic models.  This disparity is even more surprising when noted in the light of the Soviet Union's Perestroika and the fall of Eastern European communism that occurred in 1989.  In short, if you want a one-dimensional perspective of a United States academician regarding the leftist parties in Latin America, then this is the book for you.        Post script:  I had to smile and copy this passage from the book when I read it,   "The enduring irony of the Chilean Left is that those who most persuasively articulated a theoretical vision for the deepening of democracy through the political protagonism of collective popular subjects have been the least connected to such subjects in practice." (p. 121)   This real irony of this statement is that the entire book was a persuasively articulated vision for deepening democracy, written by a tenured professor in the United States, whose primary connection to the Chilean left appears to be his writings and occasional visits!    
 Ethan Canin is a great short story writer, but when it comes to novels, he misses the target.  His short stories are great because they are brief, and are told through actions and conversations, not sentimentality and excessive introspection.  Blue River, like For Kings and Planets, are undisciplined works, perhaps too ambitious, with overwrought language and too much filler material.  A much better story with the same theme appear in the Palace Thief, called Batorsag and Szerelem 
 I purchased Thomas' book with high hopes that it would be a reasoned, intelligent review of the history of Mossad, one of the world's most effective intelligence services, along the lines of Israel's Secret War's.  Sadly, such was not the case.  Thomas is a conspiracy theorist who relies on innuendo and rumor to justify mindless theories and meaningless concepts, all in lieu of research and facts to tell what is an incredible story on its own.  From little things, like referring to the Echelon surveillance system operated by the National Security Agency as monitoring every conversation between every individual virtually anywhere in the world (Echelon monitors electronic conversations, not every possible conversation) to secondhand references to the late William Casey, the then-director of the CIA, as suggesting that Mossad supplied arms to Hezbollah in the early 1980's when Israel invaded Lebanon, Thomas studiously avoids anything approaching professionalism or reasoned analysis.  Mossad is a rich topic for investigation, and there are excellent treatments on the subject.  Thomas, unfortunately, is an unprofessional, sloppy and pathetic writer whose book demeans its subject 
 While this book covers all of his works, it doesn't cover any of them in any depth.  Each chapter is mostly an incomplete synopsis of the plot, followed by an very abbreviated analysis.  The analyses are shallow and vary greatly in their acumen.  
 Horror movies are a dime a dozen now, and nothing really speical about them anymore. Sad to say, considering its probably my faviorte genere. This movie was a disappointment from the start. Whoever did editing on this movie needs to be fired. I mean they are standing there talking, and it just cuts away when you think something is going to happen. I didnt watch the whole movie, it sucked that bad. I bought this movie used, and I'd gladly give it back to the owner free of charge. 
 Reading Reclaiming God's Original Intent for the Church  reminds me of panning for gold in a river; there is allot of useless mud and dirt but every once in awhile you come across a tiny gold nugget.  Overall I was incredibly disappointed with this book. I felt like I was simply reading another polemic against The Purpose Driven Church, or two men whine about what they dislike about the "modern" church, instead of really pinpointing what God's intent is.    Three things really aggravated me about this book.  The first was the tremendously poor church history that is implored.  The authors contrast some magical perfect pre-Nicaea church that never existed, against this tremendously flawed corporate "Christendom" that was birthed by Constantine. Their claim, that if only we can shed modernity and get back to our early-church roots is a complete farce, because it fails to understand that the church throughout the ages, yes even the early-church, was made up of sinners.    Secondly, I was offended by the broad generalizations they made.  As a former youth pastor I was insulted by their claim that many youth ministers leave there ministries because they are looking to climb that corporate ladder (118). I don't think the general statements that the authors make in this book are part of God's intent for the church.    Finally, the chapter entitled "It's About Listening-Not Just Preaching" was awful. The authors are correct to say in counseling and evangelism Christians spend way to much time talking instead of listening.  However, they have gotten good counseling confused with good preaching.  As a matter of fact I would argue that one of the reasons the church has become so irrelevant is that there are very few gifted preachers in this country. Romans 10:17 say "faith comes from hearing the message." I would contend that preaching is central when it comes to reclaiming God's original intent for the church.  I will say that I did appreciate their point: that the role of pastor is about a calling and not a career.  I believe there is something to learn from the church of Antioch; that sent people of proven maturity and effectiveness to new areas. I would claim one of God's original intents for the Church is to send young pastors to our modern day Antioch parishes (large and stable churches). And dispatching our pastors of proven maturity and effectiveness to unchurched areas, instead of vice versa.   This book is a quick and easy read; however it does not come close to effectively reclaiming God's original intent for the church!       
 I had high hopes for this DVD as I'm looking for good insightful information re 9/11, especially in relation to the collapse of Building 7. I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed and really learned little from it. It is like a home movie in real time. Could be edited to a fraction of its length and not loose much. Yes, devastation was shown but that alone is not sufficient to make it worthwhile. Of course Steve Spak did not know WTC7 was going to collapse but one reviewer referred to the fires in it, as though there was significant information in the DVD about them. There is not. No hard feelings but I wasted my money 
 Believe it or not, I had actually expected to hate this because it just doesn't suit me for the good kind of music. It sounds just the way I thought it would sound: crappy. It isn't hard enough to be all that good if you ask me. It is just too calm. {And now you probably think I'm a hypocrite because I like Enya}. At least Enya doesn't sound like someone who sounds like they are in a garage band attempting to record bad music. Not my style. 
 I've watched this film about 4 times.  I don't really know what it's about.  I should go out, buy a copy, and watch it about 10 more times.  The story starts off with a expedition into a jungle in search of an old relic.  It ends with a finding of a greater one.  In between there's a blur.  I think I'm going to buy it.  That's all 
 Like many of the other reviewers I feel cheated.  Anything contoversial was left out.  As a dumb suburban honkey myself, I demand the reissue of this dvd with "Kill the White People".  What good are all those funny sketches if SNL doesn't have the balls to put them on dvd?  I also didn't read any reviews as I assumed I was getting the same product that was put on vhs years ago.  Instead I got scammed.  What's even worse is the "bonus scene" is the Opie Cunningham interview which was already on the original vhs.  Please explain how this is a bonus.  I was furious when the movie ended.  The least they can do is put out a part 2.  I thought I was buying the Cadillac of comedy.  Instead I got the Ford Pinto of crap 
 Perhaps this book would have seemed less trifling and annoying if I had never read any of the Scriptures, and had no previous knowledge, however slight,  of Middle Eastern history or mythology. But since that was not the case, I thought this book was a very poor introduction to this fascinating subject. It begins with a DeMille-like soft porn depiction of an ancient pagan ritual which had me laughing out loud. To be fair, the author doesn't claim to have any historical documentation for the temple scenes he describes. It probably seemed like just the sort of thing that polytheistic goddess-worshipping simpletons were likely to get up to under the influence of hallucinogens and muddled thinking. Perhaps this is a good introduction after all, as muddled thinking plays a major role throughout this book. As long as the reader understands this, there is probably no harm in reading the rest for its entertainment value.  Maybe if you are interested in learning about the ancient world and its religious thought, and don't know where to begin, this is better than nothing. However, please don't don't let this lightweight feel-good fluff be the only thing you read. If you want to find out what people in the ancient Near East really wrote and thought, you might start by reading primary sources, such as the Bible, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and the many other ancient documents which have been translated by scholars who actually care about historical accuracy. Museum websites and publications are another great source of easily accessible information. If you persevere, you will soon know enough to understand why this book seems so silly. 
 I went through this cookbook after going through the new Southern Living Slow Cooker Cookbook and what a disappointment! Not only does this book use many pre-packaged items (if I'm making it myself, I'd rather not use that junk), the recipes were dull. Almost every recipe was in the other cookbook and was MUCH better. I also purchased the More Betty Crocker Slow Cooker Recipes and MANY of the recipes were the same--picture and all! What a waste of money. Purchase the new Southern Living Slow Cooker cookbook and you'll be MUCH happier 
 You win some and you lose some. This purchase was a definite loss. What a dissapointment 
 I had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews. I used the razor as directed in the instruction manual. The manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use. I used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse. I had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal. Do not buy this product 
 Not nearly up to the level we'd expect from Mr. Rogers. The pictures are dated and unattractive and the text is boring and uninformative. Don't be fooled by the September 1997 date--this book is a reprint of a slim volume  originally published years ago, and seems  old-fashioned to today's  children. It looks like a cheap imitation of Alison Mack's delightful and  effective TOILET LEARNING: THE PICTURE BOOK TECHNIQUE FOR CHILDREN AND  PARENTS, using tacky photos instead of Mack's cute drawings, and leaving  out the all-important section that gives guidance to parents. Mr. Rogers'  book is just the thing for parents who want to save a few dollars at their  children's expense 
 This collection of forgettable, tired-out tracks ("You Light Up My Life" and "God Bless America"?????) are an obvious attempt to simply cash in and make more money off a hot new star. These warbles may have been charming when LeAnn was six or seven but astute listeners won't enjoy them for more than one listening session. Wait for her next REAL album instea 
 I wanted to like this book, I really did. Killer crabs, the promise of violence reminiscent of 80's grindhouse horror, crazy pulp type stuff that would have me chuckling at the craziness of it all.  Here's the primary problem with this book, and the reason I could not finish it. Editing. From the very first page, grammatical errors were the name of the game. Missing words, screwy punctuation, etc. Now I've read many an underground press book in my time, but this was quite noticable.  However, the real issue is the lack of proof-read prose. I am not a professional writer by any means, although I have written my share of stories. But I think even an average reader would not be able to get through the first 20 pages without finding numerous sentences that could be reworded to form smoother prose. Words used repeatedly in succesive paragraphs, sentences begun with the same word 3 or 4 times in a row (not for effect, just out of laziness)... it was an unbaearable read because I wanted the writing to improve so I could get to the conclusion of a pretty cool story.  I don't know why the other reviews here leave this book with an average of 5 stars, but it makes me seriously question the authenticity of their authors. I am not nitpicking here, this book has serious problems with the grammar therein, and if someone would just take the time to make a final draft out of it, I think it has a lot of potential.  Wait for the 2nd edition : 
 This book does not compare with 1) Atlas Shrugged, or 2) The Fountainhead.  In my opinion, those are two of the finest books ever written.  If you haven't read them, put We the Living aside and read them now.  I could not finish We the Living.  I got sick of the stupid relationship.  I guess I got about 1/4th the way through.  Maybe my tastes are changing 
 I'm a huge fan of Lawrence Block as a novelist. Well, as a short story writer as well come to think of it, but I can't really say that he has a gift for writing about writing.  First of all, this isn't really a "book" per say. It's a collection of essays taken from various issues of WD (Writers Digest) and thrown into chronological order. Because of these much of the book feels lacks flow. The articles are all but three pages long and only cover the bare minimum requirements for talking about their topic.  Yes it is conversational and that's a plus, but there are plenty other books on writing which have a similar style and say MUCH MUCH more. The main problem with Blocks book is that he throws one useful tidbit out there and surrounds it with two and a half pages of fluff. For great books on writing - books that feel like the writer is speaking directly to you - pick up Stephen King's "On Writing" Anne Lamott's "Bird by Bird" or Noah Lukeman's wonderful but virtually unknown "The first five Pages: a writers guide to staying out of the rejection pile. These have been my favorites so far, and I've read quite a few. Let Block get back to the fiction, (I read Everybody Dies awhile ago and it was amazing.) He's great at storytelling, just not so great at teaching it, at least not in this too-brief format. 
 It's good for its purpose but not resistant. The lock that close the ball broke in the first use when I tried to open. The other one worked fine. It's a cheap plast material, could be better and more resistant. But for now it's ok since there is no other solutions for my bras. Besides, this product is for medium and small bras. Who has large sizes will have difficult to fit the bra in the produc 
 You guessed it.  I'm a cracka from England that has no idea or grasp on African American life; therefore I'm really not qualified to give a justifiable review of this book.  I just figured I would chime in like all racist Saltines do.  Sorry 
 I purchased this item the middle of May.  It is now Oct. 1st and it won't heat up anymore!  Product should last longer than 5 months! 
 The ghost writer was probably afraid to put his own name on the book.  It was totally predictable without any of the depth found in real Ludlum books 
 This book is waste of time if you really want to learn about anorexia.  It's very difficult to understand and the author seems to have some odd ideas concerning his clients.  I also think he tends to encourage being too blunt and forceful with anorexia sufferers, something that only pushes them away. He also doesn't permit his clients to have enough choices in thier treatment 
 There is nothing I could add here that wasn't already said by the other 1 star reviewers that preceeded me. Just a couple of generic trends: 1. Lots of books get published (and unfortunately read) based on the author's name. Although Moss Cnater has never belonged to the senior guru league (in my opinion and I have read her revious works - tedious and uninspiring), Harvard Business school still carries some weight, although one has to wonder why, based on many distinctly ordinary, even bad books they publish through their Press. And if you read Harvard Business Review, you should have realised by now how mediocre and way overpriced that publication is.  2. One reviewer wonders how could she, a professor at already mentioned uni write so badly. People erroneously associate things together. Just because somebody teaches at a university does not make them good writers; heck, it doesn't even make them good teachers. How many truly great teachers do you remember from your uni days? Zussamenfassung (a weird German word for Summary): Avoid like a plague 
 This book is utter nonsense.  Spoon bending? The author, Dean Radin, fell for spoon bending??? (see endnote 1 on page 331). Sorry, but given that, his credibility is zero or less. (Spoon bending was totally discredited and shown to be a complete fraud more than 30 years ago by Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman.) Just as bad, Radin can only offer lame excuses (page 290) for not pursuing some of the many prizes that are being offered for a valid, definitive demonstration of psi. (If the evidence is as strong as Radin claims, he should have already walked home with several of these prizes.)  Radin complains that he'd have to spend more than a million in order to win the million dollar prize James Randi is offering.  But all Radin would have to do is demonstrate his spoon bending ability under scientific conditions.  If Radin can bend spoons as he claims, it should be an easy million for him.  
 As to the best of my knowledge, there were two major intellectual responses to the seemingly endless and insuperable crisis which the capitalist system had got itself into after the Great Slump of 1929: Keynes`s "General Theory of Money, Interest and Employment" of 1936 and Schumpeter`s "Capitalism" which was first published in 1942. Like Marx before them, both Keynes and Schumpeter reject the "classic economists'" contention that what they called the market system wll always automatically swing back to an ideal equilibrium - expecially one that implied full employment - provided only the state kept its hands off as much as possible.   However, that is just about where their concurrence ends. While Marx sees the only solution outside the system, in its bloody overthrow and its succession by a "dictatorship of the proletariat" introducing the next evolutionary step in human history, called socialism, Keynes considered the market system as basically viable. All that was needed, according to him, was governmental involvement by which the lacking demand in times of a slump would be lifted to more agreeable levels. Schumpeter, in contrast, agrees with Marx in that capitalism's days are counted and that it is about to be replaced by socialism, even though he doesn't share Marx`s more aggressive notions: according to him, the present day capitalists need not be dealt with by the guillotine alone, they may indeed have a useful function as entrepreneurs employed by his envisaged omnipotent and omniscient super agency that will ideally plan everybody's well-being in his imagined socialist system.  What to think of the book today? First, it is hard to fathom how Schumpeter could have turned such an absolutely blind eye on the totalitarian tendencies necessarily inherent in a state that not only controlled the political field but also was quasi the monopolist employer and as such responsible for the economic side of peoples's lives as well, in particular when one considers the time when it came out: 1942! Second, it is a fine example of how wrong you can get things even if (or: because?) you know so much as Schumpeter did - maybe that is the best argument of all against the establishment of such a super agency planning everybody's life to the extent envisaged by Schumpeter. Finally, even if such an agency did not err - is it not a basic right - and half of the fun of life - to make mistakes - for oneself that is, not forcing them on others 
 Using the "search this book" feature led me to the same 9-word conclusion:  this book is full of fiber itself.  The fiber talk contained within helps to stave off reader hunger for more depth and compelling reading within.  I just wish the doctor bothered to look into L-glutamine, an amino acid that staves off hunger signals at the brain, making us THINK we're hungry instead of the stomach telling us.  I guess it was too much to hope for in light of farm subsidies and food politics 
 Terry Silber deserves credit for making her move to Maine work. It should  be noted that farming is not the reason for her success, retail would be  more accurate. Throughout the book there is the feeling that she feels  herself above her new neighborhood. I would be curious to see how her new  homestate views her.  A finacial success; she has achieved.  Beyond that 
 I think the most frustrating thing about a fax machine, is when you put your four or five page fax into the feeder, and the machine sucks two or three sheets at once ruining your whole fax!  I especially got this machine because I thought it was a quality machine, and wouldn't do that, but I was wrong.  Sometimes this machine sucks more than one sheet at a time which is very frustrating.  I would stay away.  It prints nicely, but it doesn't help if it ruins your faxes.  I see other reviewers have the same problem 
 I bought this for my four year old for Christmas.  The net was broken on the second use when my four year old lightly banged it on our car bumper.  A week later, his friend, also four, broke one of the sticks when taking a shot with the feather-weight plastic puck that comes with the set.  Don't waste your money. Even for little kids it's probably worth it to just go ahead and buy real equipment that will last. 
 I am an avid U2 fan and understand that as the band experiments, reinvents, pushes the envelope, etc. that we have to be patient and listen, re-listen, and give the music a chance. So it is with this record. But finding the U2 aspect of the soundtrack is a little like finding Where's Waldo. On some tracks its very obvious, on others its virtually impossible.    I'll keep listening but so far its a disappointment. 
 I was completely disappointed in the size of this book. The city guide of Possum Trot, Kentucky has to be bigger then this. Measuring in at a hefty 3&1/2" tall, its no Abe Lincoln. It was more like something you find in a CrackerJack box 
 I based my purchase of this book on the review here on these web pages by psychologist Craig Chalquist, based on his comment (in effect) that life well-lived necessarily has highs and lows in it, one must accept, even embrace both dark and light phases, as a tree needs both sunlight and dark night to fulfill its potential.  It was with that understanding well in hand I began reading St. John of the Cross.  Other reviewers have said it's difficult to read, perhaps because of the tranlator's stated goal of being as true to the 16th-century Spanish as possible, not rewriting it to make it more accessible and losing the literary voice of the original which, apparently, is the more important value of this work.  I don't have a problem with the language, and it's not a big book, just over 200 pages, but I haven't quite finished reading it and I'm not sure if I will (oh, I probably will) because something about it makes my skin crawl. I reject this sort of ascetic mysticism on grounds that it's philosophically flawed--it's the tortuously convoluted path of a labyrinth from which one exits by the same gate as one entered, and for what?  To me it suggests nothing more than pathological, compulsive, sado-masochistic auto-eroticism.  Union with God, indeed; get your hand out of your pants, go outside:  God is everywhere.  Turn off the computer, get some exercise; let God find you.  I shall serve no god who demands obedience from slaves; my god loves me for my willful independence.  If we are made in God's image, does that mean God is a self-flagellating crybaby?  Get up!  Get on your feet!  Be Lightning!  Be Thunder!  Be Earthquake and Avalanche!  Be Iceberg and Volcano, Tidalwave and Twister! Make God proud!  Don't buy this book! 
 This photo is very misleading.  The table legs are gold with stripes of black and what is described as slate top is black tile.  The photo showes the tables very light with a light slate but that is not the case with the product we received.  
 Huge disappointment. Trace wasn't that good either. Having read all Scarpetta's previous storiesbut I was hoping Trace would be only bad one. However, the downhill trend seems to continue. These two books are not the usual intelligent plots Cornwell is capable of writing. Save your money, don't buy it. I completely agree with all the reviews posted so far, so I won't go into the plot -or rather lack of a real plot -details 
 This review concerns the original 1936 edition and the revised 1974 edition which is slightly different from the original but basically tells the same story.  Nancy meets a young Indian boy (named Coya in the original, Rishi in the revised) who lives with a circus.  The boy is being mistreated by a man named Rai who claims to be the boy's father, but Nancy doubts this claim.  Nancy saves Rai from an elephant and to show his thanks he gives Nancy an ivory, elephant charm which he says can protect the wearer from harm.  Coya/Rishi runs away from the circus and Rai and the Drews take him in.  Later, Rai changes his mind and wants the charm back and he will do anything to get both the charm and Coya/Rishi.  Also figuring into this "mystery" are a strange woman and a bizarre house out in the middle of the woods.  The house, apparently, has no floor, but it does have a secret passage and a bunch of swings and trapezes hanging from the ceiling.  This book was just plain awful!!  The mystery, what there is of one, is stupid and boring.  The house serves absolutely no purpose other than to use up pages and it makes no sense.  Who would build a house like that out in the middle of nowhere?  The strange woman in the book is more annoying than anything and comes off as too scatterbrained and weak-minded to be the great criminal mastermind that the plot requires her to be.  The book has little in the way of action or suspence.  This book is just bad, bad, bad!  Take my advice and don't read it 
 I winced on almost every page of Phayer's book. Historians are paid, presumably, to help us understand well......history,  the perceptions, motivations and issues at play in a prior era. Historical analysis, synthesis and judgments should say something to us about the actual conditions people lived and experienced  -- in doing so an historian is even better positioned to pass the moral judgments Phayer is so addicted to.    In Phayer's book we have no such thing but instead an overblown thesis that Pius XII can only be understood as obsessed with anti-communism and his role as peacemaker. Phayer arrives at his negative judgment on Pius XII largely by anachronism in his analysis, and selectivity and bias in his use (and lack of use) of key references. Considering all the ink that has been spilt over Pius XII, his detractors no longer deserve a pass when they fail to even mention now well documented and thoroughly vetted evidence that disproves parts of the Pius-the-bad-guy thesis. Almost every page is loaded with these errors.   One example will have to suffice. Phayer condemns Pius XII's 1942 Christmas message as weak and ineffectual, "...no one, certainly not the Germans, took it as a protest against their slaughter of the Jews."  Contrast Phayer's assessment to that of a German government report which described the pope's 1942 speech as, "...one long attack on everything we stand for, HERE HE IS CLEARLY SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE JEWS [emphasis added] and makes himself the mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals."   There are plenty of other references to the contemporary impact of Pius' 1942 speech, to include the German ambassador, the New York Times and Mussolini's government.  None of that matters to writers like Phayer and his ilk, they are, it must finally be said lousy historians ---- using anachronistic reasoning and blithely ignoring or otherwise suborning evidence that does not meet their prejudiced preconceptions. They are hardly writing history at all, but are themselves mouthpieces for anti-catholicism.   The end result of their endeavors though is transferring blame for the holocaust away from its perpetrators and exploiting the deaths of millions for their personal prejudices.        
 My curiosity got the best of me and I finally decided to go ahead and watch it anyway. I am a big Kurt Russell fan and I think that John Carpenter got it right with Starman. I had no idea what I was in for. What should have been a red flag for me was the fact that the movie was placed in the horror section of my local blockbuster and rightfully so. This movie stands out in my mind as more horror film than Science Fiction. Think of the most bloodiest, goriest, frightening movie you have ever seen or imagined (have you got that picture in your head yet?) Good, now forget anything you have ever seen because this movie is far worse.   Its goriness so revolting at times that it bordered on being disgustingly sick and inhumane. There is enough blood and guts in this one film to cover every horror movie ever made in hollywood.   As bad as that sounds that is not the only thing wrong with this movie. Contrary to popular belief this was not a well made movie and I would say that the critics got it very right back in 1982. The characters, all but Kurt Russell's are easily forgetable. At times I found it hard to keep up with what the movie was actually about and honestly I didn't get it. The further along the movie went the more It felt like a low budget Matinee barfbag horror flick.   The movie leaves too many questions unanswered and isn't consistent with building on the story that spurned the original. Instead, it took what was a genuinely great plot from the original short story and twisted it into something so shocking and disgusting that it is no longer recognizable. After a while it gets very exhausting both physically and mentally but somehow you keep watching, hoping that maybe the culmination of this mess of a movie will somehow redeem itself with a very solid mindblowing conclusion. Speaking of endings, maybe they were so busy working on all the special effects and gross out scenes that somebody forgot to actually write the ending for the movie......   Disgustingly disappointing 
 When I first read the premise for this novel, I hardly thought it was creative, (I have seen American History X), but decided to give it a chance anyway. Prose's writing is so unbelievable that I could hardly finish the first few chapters. She has no knowledge of what a thirty-something male ex-skinhead might be thinking, and it shows. Her use of slang is awkward and difficult to read, as are the passages of Vincent "looks too much like McVeigh" Nolan checking out Bonnie's "ass." This novel is forced and it screams it. Read something else 
 this item is horrible! It is flimsy and didn't even come with any instructions. Even though it was so cheap I feel so ripped of 
 The title could be misleading...don't be confused. This book is great for discussing skills needed by presenters.  It is not a how-to book for designing or promoting  seminars 
 It's sad that the world has become false and fake enough to welcome this drivel. It insults our intelligence when businesses have there employees wear fake smiles and kiss the bottoms of overly rude and obnoxious customers. A rude customer at times deserves it in kind and there are not always two correct sides to every customer altercation.  I'm sure the tactics put forward here work fine for companies but small business owners (2-4 employees) who treat their employees poorly and always take the side of the customer are sorely misguided. Small business owners would be better served to use the positive feedback of their dedicated employees over the cruel complaints of a disgruntled customer.  Any small business owner using these strategies only cares about themselves and obviously is not concerned with keeping their employees happy. It's difficult to get good and loyal help if you don't stand by your staff at times 
 ...because that's how he makes his money and fame. Without it, he'd be known for what he ultimately is: a poor charlatan posing as a "scholar. 
  I thought that I would love this book because I am interested in JFK.  	 What I found was a lousy book that spent much of it detailing Kennedy's political career and leaves out or does not go into much detail about significant events that happened to him while in Political Office. Also much of the info can be found in numerous other books about JFK or the Kennedy Family with little new information.  I was also disappointed about his discussion about the assassination. After all this time and all the information out there the author still thinks that Oswald killed JFK.  If you are interested in JFK, this might not be the book for you 
 Not my cup a tea. Poor sound and average picture. Just for Excalibur freaks...?! 
 This book was such a disappointment to me! The majority of her information is completely inaccurate. I would have expected a little more coming from a dietician. The only thing I can say about this book on a positive note, is a few of the recipes are okay and she supports breastfeeding. I felt like this book was/is right with our culture...focused on how mom looks after having a baby. New mom's have enough on their plate worrying about how to adjust to this little person who's taken over their life. They don't need another book emphasizing how their body should look or perform. Every mom is different, I know.  I just think mothers should be focused on breastfeeding successfully and loving their sweet baby, not trying to fit into prepregnancy pants 2 weeks postpartum. A lot has changed in 14 years and new mom's need to realize that as well...this book is 14 years old. Good luck 
 Jeez, I almost vomited when I heard that he was coming out with another CD. He has some of the worst vocals I have ever heard, and plus he needs to get over the fact that he split up with Jessica. What's Left of him? NOTHING.  And sorry for making my review so short, this is all I can say 
 I saw this book in the store and the title got my attention, as I am always looking for more material on women in the Bible. However, as I sat down to read through it, I realized that the author -- and we don't know if it's a male or female -- writes with a punishing view. In the story of Jepthah's Daughter, for instance, the daughter is portrayed as quietly accepting her fate, and she is upheld for that decision. In the story of the Concubine in Judges, the re-telling is written in such a way as to suggest that if she had listened to her mother and not complained about her husband, she would not have been raped, murdered and dis-membered. This is a dangerous book for anyone with a serious bent to study the Bible; it is especially dangerous to our daughters.  PLEASE! Do not buy this book 
 Breaking changes in the June CTP make going through the samples frustrating and there are no updates on the publisher's site.    These guys work for MS so they should have known about the breaking changes and delayed the book by 6 weeks so they could release it with updated content. If they are as deeply entrenched with the architects and developers as they say then they would know about changes long before they were implemented and released (i.e. they would know about June CTP changes in April).  Now you have to drudge through the author's blog postings to find the updates. At the very least they could consolidate the updates into one zip file and put it on the publisher's site.  Does it really make sense to release a book on May 25 only to have it out of date 4 weeks later 
 There are two things which tickle me about this book.  One is the sample Zack's report at the back which has a strong buy #1 rating on a -.3% return on equity stock.  The other is the section on practical use of the system.  It, of course, is for any type of investor including long term investors even though the effects that the system measures lasts only for 1 - 3 months.  And don't forget about growth investors and value investors either.  This section is so short as to be laughable.  Also notice that in the 2002 A list there were 216 stocks.  Most are going to have to buy a subset.  But what subset?  No info is provided on the performance of typical subsets for each investor class.  Perhaps an MVO addict or a Monte Carlo hack would have the answer 
 When I purchased this item I got the impression that the kit (looking at the picture) included everything but the gazebo - which is the frame. You should be more specific and mention that the kit is just the screen around the frame and the top cover was not part of the kit. I need the top part of the gazebo more than the screen around it. The title of this item should say: "gazebo screen" and not "gazebo screen KIT"...    Unhappy custome 
 Choice of words, writing style and teaching of biology is NOT satisfactory in this book.  Not a good way to learn CELL bio, maybe functional at higher levels but definitely not useful in explaining new concepts.  Occassionally the sentences do not even seem properly formed. i.e. fragments and more often ultra-run on sentences with no structure and no clarity.  Frustration - the emotion experienced while reading this book.   
 This is just another re-hash of the 2001 Gaye compilation with one twist.  The "Gold" series that Universial is releasing now comes copy-protected so you can't burn a CD-R copy for your car stereo.  Plus they want you to spend more thinking it's something else.   That's why I boycott copy-protected CDs.  Think about it.  Why else would the eariler comp be deleted from Motown's catalog after ONLY four years 
 A book only a family member could love. Topics include: what Tom thinks of maple syrup, the Peterman catalog, and Amerigo Vespucci. Questions answered: Does Tom jog, swim, or walk? Does Tom like the new Italian restaurant near his Vermot estate? And speaking of Vermont estates: What is his happiest memory of spring? If you are hell-bent on getting answers to those burning questions, then this book is for you.  Insights range from the helpful if somewhat inane (you can change in a second, but making good on change takes commitment and time... or design matters) to the plain old whacko ("revel in life's yeastiness.")   I'm not saying there aren't good insights or that the book is a dull waste. Peters is a good storyteller with a lot of business wisdom. It's just too bad he puts neither skill to much use in this droll dress-up of dross 
 This is yet another compendium of contributed works.  While this book isn't awful enough for one star, it isn't good enough for three.  I woudl have felt more neutral if it said anything new or anything that you can't get from the fixed income research group of an investment bank or trading house for free, such as one right here in Greenwich 
 BREAKING THE CODE, by Princeton Theological School professor and New Testament paleography legend Bruce Metzger, is an attempt to explain the Revelation to St. John the Divine in an approachable and easy-going manner.  While many Christians hear of Revelation from those who would interpret it exceedingly literally, Metzger's emphasis is on the book as a form of apocalyptic writing where so much is meant allegorically. He makes comparisons with the Book of Daniel to show the Old Testament roots of Revelation. Most helpful will be his explanation of what we know about the seven churches which John addresses.  Metzger's book is something of a disappointment because it underestimates the intelligence of the average reader. He deals only with the surface of the text, but there's no need to be that simplistic when anyone, even the non-theological layman, can get the same information from merely reading Revelation itself. The biggest failing of BREAKING THE CODE is that it does not deal with interpretations of the work through the long history of the Church. This might not bother Protestants, but members of other denominations will want to take Tradition into account. Metzger also does not explain why the early Church Fathers closely linked Revelation and the Gospel According to John, even assuming they had the same author, and how (as Sofia Gubaidulina put it) John's Gospel might be seen to represent the temporal/horizontal and Revelation the eternal/vertical.  Instead of relying on BREAKING THE CODE, one interested in Revelation would do better just to carefully read the book itself and consider each line attentively. Those who want to explore the ramifications of the work in Church history should turn to more extensive coverage 
 I bought two sets of these towels. The ad said name brand, but when I saw the label, I had never heard of them. They feel nice, soft and cushy. But they are not very absorbent. When drying my hands, after repeated rubbing and patting,  my hands were still wet. My old towels (17 years old) do a much better job of drying me off quickly 
 I recently purchased this model from a source outside amazon.  It is easily unlocked to play all region dvds and the picture quality is excellent, however, the unit would only work using the S video connector, not separate connections.  the spinning of the dvd itself was ridiculously loud 
 This book is one of the most obnoxious partisan screeds I have come across in a long history of reading about this region. The authors conveniently ignore the entire political context, that of Isreal's belligerent military occupation of Palestinian territories, which is what the people they have written about are fighting against.  Such decontextualized, depoliticizing representations lead readers to interpret the subjects of this book as simply deranged individuals, rather than politically motivated people who are shaped by and reacting to their history and social context. In addition, the authors either misunderstand or deliberately misrepresent the range of complex meanings associated with martyrdom in Palestinian society, which in fact go well beyond the issue of suicide bombers. Drawing on the most cliched set of Orientalist caricatures, the authors portray their subjects as alternately murderous, backwards, bizarrely exotic, sadistic, or simply crazy. This is not a book for anyone who actually wants to learn about the social, political and religious situation in Palestine and their relationship to martyrdom and suicide bombers 
   I bealive what the people write about this product so I tried and it doesnt work. My ipod have the same scratches, but a little little little bit less the only things that really change is that is more shine or bright. I tried it on a cellphone and nothing change. 
 This software is a waste of money to say the least. The templates on this software are terrible and ugly. You are lucky if you have five good templates to choose from. If you are looking for something quick and easy to use this is not it.You have to format everything. Please don't make the same mistake I made. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT 
 Sorry to say but this book is a dud.  While the concept of presenting interesting mathematical facts is great the presentation is so brief, so wrought with errors, and so incomplete that the work is not worth perusing.    Some of the "chapters" have answers at the back of the book and some do not.  It appears that the author could not make up her mind wether this was to be a "math tricks" book or a "popular mathematics" presentation substantiated by theory.    There are many other excellent books that are more fulfilling.  Journey Through Genius comes to mind.   All in all a disappointing work 
 I hate to trash on an American Classic... but this was truly horrible.  I thought my son would like this due to the flying car.  It took hours of TORTURE to get to that scene.  Horrible, horrible film.  Mindless, drawn-out banter, and weak story line.  Our copy eventually broke (stepped on?) --- we felt SOOO lucky to have it gone.  "One Star" seems like a generous rating 
 Contrary to the maker's claims, this product is not made with whole-grain flour. Instead, the first-listed ingredient is "organic unbleached wheat flour," an unhealthful, refined carbohydrate. The product is sweetened with common, refined cane sugar and corn syrup. All things considered, this product is nutritionally equivalent to common grocery-store fig newtons, except for the claim that it's "organic." Snacks like this could be made with healthful, nutritious ingredients; unfortunately, this one is not. I would not choose to buy it again. Instead of this junk snack, I would choose Barbara's Whole Wheat Fig Bars, which are made with real whole grains and sweetened with fruit juices 
 I used to respect Mr. Butler's work. I was a big fan of "Good Scent" and especially of "They Whisper." But this is yet another superficial, lightweight offering. It makes me sad to see a once-great author sinking to such depths. Anyone interested should go back and read the old works. They had some real magic to them. The last few books are all just dead weight, a finished author plowing ahead simply because he's expected to. I wish I could say something more nuanced and objective. But this is just a depressing last straw. I am finished with Mr. Butler from here on in. 
 It goes without saying that this man is a pioneer of his craft, however there are throngs of contemporary chefs who are doing things with food that show that they know their ingredients better than Peterson does- good cooking is a result of knowing your ingredients and knowing them well. Peterson claims that there is little, if any, difference between Wild, farm-raised, and Atlantic salmon. This is preposterous! The difference is oceanic. Perhaps Peterson has never eaten Wild King Alaskan salmon or Copper River Sockeye salmon or anything from the Yukon River, which is a real pity, because one of our lifetime's greatest foodies is missing out on the greatest culinary experience of all time! Save you money and spend it on Peterson's Fish & Shellfish. Even the salmon recipes are better 
 On our recent road trip, my girlfriend and I brought along some audio books to help us stay awake. Both were historical fiction set in ancient Greece. Sappho's Leap was read by the author, and her mangled pronunciations and over-dramatic tone may have influenced my reaction, but I don't think so.  Unlike Thermopylae, the subject of Gates of Fire (review coming soon), virtually nothing about Sappho is known, Ms. Jong was free to make up just about any story she liked. And she did. Sappho's Leap is a sappy love story with a long interlude where Jong basically plagiarizes Homer, only watering him down to speed the plot. Further, and to make matters worse, Sappho's Leap is not very well-written. It is melodramatic, banal, and overly adjectival. It reads like syrup. Jong apparently can't think of a word for vagina other than "delta" and nothing for penis other than "phallus," which words are like comedy catchphrases by the end of the novel.  The book starts out well. Sappho has climbed a cliff, but pauses to reflect on the story of her life (in media res, like every Greek story). She starts at the beginning, relating how she runs away from hom with Alceous, a famous Lesbian singer. They are exiled from Lesbos for trying to overthrow its tyrant, and her adventures begin. She is married off to a paunchy lush who lives in Syracuse, although pregnant with Alceous's child, to be named Cleis (mispronounced by Jong). When her husband dies, the adventure begins in earnest. After a stay in Egypt, Sappho takes off with the fabulist, Aesop, for Delphi, but is frequently sidetracked along the way. Jong sends Sappho to the Amazons on Crete (?!?) where she causes the return of Pegasus, the island of the centaurs, the underworld, Medusa's sister, etc. In an age where the Greeks occupied the majority of the Mediterranean, Sappho manages to elude everyone for a space of ten years or more, which occupy maybe four chapters of the book.  These adventures are trite, simplified copies of the Odyssey, and add almost nothing to the plot. Nothing really improves from there. Once Sappho returns to the land of the real, Jong wraps things up quickly and predictably. The novel ends with a syrupy, happy ending. Sappho and all her lovers and friends end up living on another random island with her friends, until her daughter sails up with her grandchildren. Ugh.  And don't get me started on the "poems" at the end.  This was my first Erica Jong book, and I think it will be my last. It gets two stars only because I need a lower rung for truly pulp romance, which this book just barely isn't 
 I picture Chomsky in a sunless, cluttered apartment full of scattered yellowing newspapers, surrounded only by walls of his own clippings.  Yes, his recent writing is the result of too little exposure to the real world.  Not everything is a conspiracy theory, and not all facts or events paint an overall trend or picture.  The world is too random for all similar events to be related.  But when you surround yourself with your own highlighted facts of history and dwell on them day after day trying to sell your thoughts, the result is going to be nonsense.  I respect Chomsky's right to say what he thinks, and as a liberal I often find myself agreeing with him (but for vastly different reasons).  What I do not respect are those readers who take his words as gospel, when they are simply the rantings and ravings of someone who has lost touch with how the real world works.  Throwing together a bunch of events across history does not make for a lucid view of how we got to the present and what to do about the current problems.  To me, he is no different from those who have assembled enough disjointed evidence as to convince themselves that 9-11 was perpetrated by the U.S. government.  I am not excusing the actions of any U.S. administration, past or present.  All that I am saying is that the actions of the U.S. 10, 20, even 50 years ago bear little relation to each other or to the present.  And where they do, it is not worth arguing that it is the result of some long-term phenomenon of evil U.S. power.  The world is comprised of random actors interacting constantly, and to say that the U.S. should be able to control or foresee the future is nonsense.  All the U.S. can do is preserve and fight for its own interests, which is all that any state does.   Chomsky's anti-capitalist, anti-globalization, anti-aggression stance is based on an ill-conceived vision of a utopia, one far distanced from the real world in which we live.  In Chomsky's world, it is possible for everyone to get along in a state of equality, and no interests ever conflict.  In the real world, interests do conflict, and equality is impossible without sacrificing absolute welfare.  While I often disagree with the chosen approach to resolving those conflicts, I at least accept that the conflict needed resolution and that doing so presented difficulties beyond the ability of a human mind to conceive.  Sometimes we get it right, sometimes we don't.  But it is only a fool who would take all of the failures and weave together a story of evil intentions.  That Chavez would brandish Chomsky's book while ranting and raving about good and evil on the floor of the U.N. shows just what company Chomsky's theories find for him.  Chomsky's theories could use less lofty language and more grounding on planet earth.  It is no wonder that half of the evidence provided cannot be backed up with verifiable sources 
 My review of this book is somewhat conflicted.  While I would state it would make a good book if you did not know anything about Windows 2000 Security, I find that it fails as a preparation for the 70-214 exam.  I read some of the paragraph length sentences to others at work, and they too got a chuckle out of it.  The simplest of items are presented in a wordiness that would make reading Our Mutual Friend or even War and Peace akin to glancing through the Sunday comics.  At the same time, many items that should be the meat of the book are glossed over in an almost trivial manner.  If this were simply a training manual, it would have received 3 or even 4 stars.  While Windows NT 4.0 Server can be considered archaic, not even a full page in this text is given to security concerns during the upgrade procedure from NT 4.0 to 2000.  I would heartily suggest brushing up on upgrade issues for the exam if this book is to be your sole study guide.  With only 50 questions on the exam, it would not take many NT 4.0 questions to blow your chance at passing the 70-214 exam 
 I've had this camera for 2 years and I am glad that it broke so I can (in good conscious) buy a new camera. It is so slow that it is impossible to catch anything but the back of my kids heads as they run away because they got tired of saying "Cheese". I always thought the battery life was sufficient, and that the quality of the images was fine, but I hardly got good shots because of how slow the camera was. I'd put the shoot button and it would take about 2 seconds before the camera would click. I actually sent it back to the manufacturer thinking there was something wrong with it, but they said it was functioning normally. It was probably the most disappointing $200 purchase I've made 
 I purchased this and regret it.  The translation is from the early 20th century and this volume is from one of those discount publishers that use writing that has fallen out of copyright.  They don't even disclose who the translator is -- but he or she did a poor job.  Much better is to purchase Hollingdale's translation (or probably any modern translation) of the Untimely Mediations.  Use and Abuse of History is the second essay in that volume.  The work itself, of course, is incredible.  This review is about the translation 
 This book provided some good information and presented some of the stodgy content of the PMBOK in a matter-of-fact approach.  I would not rely on this book, however, as it delves into a lot of material not covered on the exam.  If you get caught up in the complex formulas in the CAPM guide, you are likely to miss the key 4 or 5 formulas that the CAPM exam actually covers.  I passed the exam, although I relied principally on the PMBOK.  For an entry-level exam such as the CAPM, the PMBOK is really all you need.  For those with little to no PM experience, a couple of supplemental readings such as this one may be helpful.  Good luck!  
 This book seems to be written by a woman frustrated by the men she dated. So she is writing this book according to her personal tastes and air her frustrations as it seems. Silly clichees like "man don't have showers enough, so have one every day and you're ahead of loads of your competitors" are used. Another actually rediculous opion of hers is that it is a MUST FOR EVERY MAN to have a silk suit. This might have been true for the 80ies, but surely not nowadays anymore. Who in the right mind would want to wear something like that still today? Should you are really looking for a good book on how to get in touch with women, have a look at Eric Weber "How to Win the Woman of your Dreams". For more details read my review on that 
 This may have been fun to listen to...16 years ago. A lot of the music from back then has aged into some of the best music of all time. This has not. This CD is just not that good to be honest with you. It is very immature (which is not a bad thing), but you can tell, like the reviewer below me has said, that they lived off of controversy and not true talent. If you want some real rap, or just good music in general, I think that you should look elsewhere 
 I think, like many readers of the Anita Blake series, one question keeps coming to mind. Why do I continue to read her?  The reason is that there is always hope that the series will shift again.  Laurel K Hamilton has invested a great deal in Anita.  She is a necromancer, a succubus, and a panwere, with a very convoluted and confusing personal life.  She is also a Federal Marshal licensed to handle Preternatural crimes.  That is the part of these stories that captured many readers.  However, Laurel K Hamilton has not been paying any real attention to Anita's job, and has focused instead upon the ardeur- the power that makes Anita a succubus.  I tend to find this aspect of Anita the most uninteresting.  And this novel is no exception.  We have some new characters which promise some intrigue in the vampire world, but nothing ever comes of it.  Two of Jean-Claude's "friends" arrive to help celebrate an all-vampire dance troupe.  Both of them have ulterior motives for coming, and cause some problems.  But we don't focus on that.  Merlin, the leader of the Dance Troupe, makes a power-play against six Vampire Masters.  But we don't focus on that.  Instead, we have many sex scenes- some of which are just far too long and descriptive.  The plot seems to stop whenever this happens, and therefore, the story never really gets going. This was the exact same problem in the last two or three Anita Blake novels.  I love the character of Anita.  I have enjoyed watching her deal with her growing powers and her growing understanding of herself, while trying to deal with some interesting preternatural criminal.  But the last few novels have been solely focused on her growing powers and the problems they create. My problem is that there has been no resolution to these problems.  Anita has stopped growing and changing, and is becoming whiny and uninteresting.  In the preview of Harlequin, we find out that Edward is returning. We haven't seen him since Obsidian Butterfly.  Since that was also the last Anita Blake novel I could recommend to someone, I have hope that the series will shift into something worh reading.  We can still hope.  Which is why we're still buying her books 
 I found the book "A Gathering of Days" interesting and filled with small pieces of history, but it was hard to comprehend and hard to read. The format of the book, journal entries written by a young girl, is neat, but her usage of out-dated words is odd and it takes time to grasp her meaning. Although this book was directed to a younger audience, I believe that older kids would better understand the phrases and words used. If you are interested in reading and seeing for yourself how life was and how people spoke in the 1800's, this book is perfect. The story was sweet and descriptive, but in my opinion, it is a one-time around book, and did not leave a huge impact on me. 
 This book is written by an annoying, weak man.  The formal innovations are vaguley interesting, but in any case do not rescue the work from its primary deficit: you must sit there for several hours with the voice of a neurotic chatty little wimp who reminds one of a certain kind of homosexual man streaming through your mind, mostly in the form of digressions and non-sequitors.  This is neither entertaining nor enlightening, and since it's the product of design it is actually a little infuriating.  I too listen with good faith to the academic hierarchy present and past for recommendations, and I had in my version the hitherto utterly reliable Frank Kermode as Introducer; but damn, this book - its characters, its plots, its language, its taxing convolusions - is just annoying.  Its only virtue is that reading it might raise awareness that vaguely condescending moralistic little works like this about unheroic, petty, neurotic, sordid, idle, superficially cosmopolitan people are a mistake to begin with, and - since we all have only 70 or 80 years on earth and aren't all compulsive aesthetes - time would be better spent elsewhere.  There is nothing of the hard Sophoclean light here 
 I read this book as part of a book discussion group I had joined and it was so wretchedly lackluster it proved to be the death knell of me ever going back to the group. This book was half-baked, boring, and grievously devoid of even the tiniest bit of interest. I can't even give it credit for having any sort of vocabulary beyond the comprehension of an average twelve year old. The characters were so flat that I didn't even finish it. Later I heard from the other book discussion members even the title was a let down as Morgan never actually passed away (`twould have been a fitting end though - much like converting a testy horse into glue, something of actual use.) I've never read any of Anne Tyler's books but after this little gem I doubt I'll ever pick up another. 
 I'd thumbed through this book a couple times at the bookstore, but had always decided against it.  I should have said that again when another Fool book "Rule Breakers, Rule Makers" came up as a ... bargain hardback book and succumbed to the whole in my wallet and got this book too.  It's too condescending even for the investing novice, and the workbook part is scant and carries little value beyond the writing.  Stick with "The Motley Fool Investment Guide" which has almost the same info, plus more 
 Even Amazon's review is no more than two sentences long. Talk about damning with faint praise. Here's why I would not recommend this book.  First, it's Robertson's constant repetition of analogies about the use of the words, new world order. (I get it already. Move on!) You get the feeling that he is regarding his readers as simpletons.   Second, he explains things in such nauseating detail, which educated Americans over the age of ten would not need explained. (I get it already. Move on!) You get the feeling that he is regarding his readers as simpletons.  Third, he talks about this mysterious group, the Illuminati. This is a supposedly secret organization that every superstitious Christian knows about, but which no one has found a single, live Illuminum to bring out of the overthrow closet. I get the feeling that I am regarding him as a simpleton.  At the risk of sounding effete or pedantic, this book is suited more toward a fourth or fifth grade reading level. It's repetition, simplemindedness, and whackadoodle philosophy will give you the thousand yard stare.  I sure am sorry I bought this. (I feel like such a simpleton.)The only thing this book might be good for is sleep apnia. Use with a strong toss of rye. Otherwise don't go near this book unless you have a cross and a charm of garlic. (Oh, the irony!)  You'll find more excitement in a bottle of Geritol and a lost episode of The Lawrence Welk Show.  This is the new world bore 
 OK so this book was written in 1991, but were women still that far behind then??  I trudged thru this book.  It was drivel.  A 25 y.o. woman heading a corporation the size that it was??? Yikes, run for the hills.  This girl loved the abusive relationship she had to begin with then found a millionaire who took her in and trained HER to run his Corp?   Puleeze, even giving the benefit of the doubt, I would not believe this!    And Cy, well, he should have imploded right after he and his mother ran Meredith out of town.  What a non-redeeming man he was and then at the end he 'saw the light'.    This was a first Diana Palmer that I read, and I dont know if I can stand reading another one.  I cant wait to give this back to my neighbor and wonder why she would buy a book this bad 
 I picked up this book hoping it would live up to its title, but what I found was that it was rather boring and lacking in character development. The ending seemed rushed and many of the issues raised were left unresolved. I was disappointed. 
  This story was about a boy named Robin who could not move his legs at all. His mom went to go see the Queen and his father was fighting the Scots in the North. While they were gone he stayed with a lady named Dame Ellen. One day she left and did not come back so a monk took him to a hospice. He wrote a letter to his father to meet him at Castle Lindsey. They met each other and soon his mom came home, by then it was Christmas time. They lived happily ever after.    I would give this book 2 stars because it did not hold my attenttion at all.   I did not like this book at all it did not hold my attention.                                                                                                                             
 I don't think I've ever read a book as blind to its subject matter as "Race-ing Toward A White Future".  Bernardi misinterprets many of the episodes, taking certain scenes and characters way out of context, and  ignores the vast majority of scripts that would counteract his hyper-PC  argument.  I found myself disagreeing with him in almost every paragraph.   For example, Bernardi seems to think that every use of the color black in  Star Trek and other Sci-Fi shows and movies is an automatically racist  gesture (!); this is a paranoid, ignorant and ridiculous assumption. And  just when it seems like he's about to make a valid point about a particular  episode or scene, he takes it too far by making grandiose statements which  have no basis in reality.  AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COSTS.  It is poorly  written, narrowminded in focus and misinterpretative of Star Trek's  position on race 
 The stationery is cute and colorful, but the pages are very cluttered. While the envelopes have spaces to write addresses and put return labels, the pages are too colorful and bold. A ballpoint or ink pen doesn't look good on the paper. 
 sensationalist, titiliating, and as a result, a total let-down (much like "heavier than heaven")  while Cross's journalistic eye provides some interesting detail re: Jimi's early years, after that, it reads like "Hammer of the Gods" meets the National Inquirier.  just plain silly, and a disservice to the greatest guitar player ever.  Cross spends more time examining Jimi's proclivity for groupies and drugs (which, of course, is part of the story...i guess), than the music itself.  It would have been nice to know, say:  In 1966, preceding acid rock and living in a relatively tame NYC, how did Hendrix come to write the songs that comprised "Are You Experienced"?  how did his playing transcend his predecessors?  how did dylan influence his songwriting?  (we learn Hendrix *did* emulate Dylan's hair.)  we don't know.  now, if Cross was unable to formulate  answers on his own, then could have easily dialed up a litany of rock critics, musicians, and fans who'd be happy to extrapolate.    instead we get only crumbs, which are ultimately overshadowed by second-hand stories from druggies ("jimi didn't like alcohol!", ex-groupies ("jimi wanted to marry me!", and hangers-on ("jimi slept with 8 chicks at once.")  it was thorougly exasperating.  if you came from Mars and read this, your impression would be that yes, Jimi was messed up and reckless; but you would have no idea he was one of the most influencial artists in the history of the world.  if the book meant to honor Hendrix, it did the opposite.    if you want incisive analysis of the *music* itself, simply read Amazon readers' reviews of his records.  The fans themselves -- not an overwrought author -- can encapsulate the power and beauty of Hendrix far better, and far more consisely. 
 As a fan of N. Farmer after reading The House of The Scorpions, I had grasped this book with enthusiasm.  Sadly, I now question my admiration towards the author.  This book, set in early saxon era, gives overly descriptive and frank and straight forward counts of the Norse people's heinous actions, without consideration of the ages of her readers:  page 105 - "The sad eyed woman collapsed.  She hadn't been strong to begin with.  Olaf dragged her up, and with a swift movement that made Jack cry out, he cut her throat and threw her over the side."  And, that's just a tip of the iceberg.  Try a search on "cut" within this book and you will find dozens of more of these decadent actions that I truly do not believe that a young person should be reading.    	In regards the characters, I have to agree with other one-star givers, that there are no character buildings within the story.  I did not see any special ability nor courage in Jack, who was chosen to the bard's apprentice.  His sister, Lucy, is a retard - thinking the Norsemen who captured them are some king's men who came to take her back to be a princess.  Thorgil, who is one of the "shield maiden" is absurdly defiant - how she still survived the odyssey, is outrageous.  And, of course, Olaf - whose suicidal downfall was inevitable in a battle with an invincible opponent called a troll-bear.    	Only good part I see in this book is how the author tried to weave and bestows the knowledge of Norse mythology upon the readers.  The book is crammed with trolls, Asgard, Jotuns, Freya and etcetera.  It is filled with good knowledge.  Yet, the storytelling is very hectic.  Surroundings and atmospheres are left undescribed.  The novel bounds along with hiatus leaving to wonder as if this book should have been a trilogy where many sections seem detracted to fulfill the publisher's encumbrances rather than the author's artistry to shorten a potentially a greater novel to a mere kiddies' read.  	To fulfill the knowledge of Norse mythology, I would recommend "D'Aulaires' Book of Norse Myths"  
 There are two very good songs on this album: Man In A Box (duh) and Love, Hate, Love. The slow-brewing intensity of the latter song sets it apart from the straight-up metal of the rest of the album. I really liked AIC back in the day and think both Cantrell and Staley are great talents, but I could never get into this album. Dirt, Sap, and Jar of Flies are all superior to Facelift so if you're new to AIC check those works out first 
 THIS COMPILATION FEATURES SOME OF THE WWE'S WRESTLERS PERFORMING THEIR OWN SONGS. AND JUST FOR THAT FACT ALONE, THIS CD IS DOOMED TO FAILURE. LET'S FACE IT, THESE GUYS CAN'T SING!!!!!! ONLY TRACKS THAT'RE EVEN WORTH LISTENING TO ARE THE DUDLEY BOYZ' ''WE'VE HAD ENOUGH'', JOHN CENA'S ''BASIC THUGANOMICS'', AND CHRIS JERICHO'S ''DON'T YOU WISH YOU WERE ME''. EVERYTHING ELSE ARE JUST LAUGHABLE ATTEMPTS AT MAKING MUSIC. STONE COLD'S SKITS, WHICH ARE STUCK IN BETWEEN SONGS, ARE QUITE FUNNY. BECAUSE THE MUSIC IS STUPEFYINGLY BAD FOR MUCH OF IT'S RUNNING TIME, YOU COULD ALMOST SAY IT'S SO BAD THAT IT'S FUNNY. IF YOU LIKE WWE'S MUSIC, BUY ''THEMEADDICT'' INSTEAD. 
 The songs are truly awful.  The voice is there, but as another reviewer said, not used, almost monotonal.  Get some writers 
 Despite what the tag line promises, this is not an epic story of WW II's most dramatic mission.  It is ridicuous to even suggest such a thing.  At best this is a superficial recounting of a late war mission which turned out not to be not nearly as dangerous as it could have been.  The bravery of the men who took part in the raid cannot be questioned.  However, there are countless other tales of WW II that recount much more horrificly dangerous events than the one depicted here.  The book simply fails to deliver.  If you are looking for a gripping tale of the horror and heroism that defined WW II this is not the one 
 Unless your almost dead this DVD is just too easy and is not really Yoga. I have an old Rodney Yee VHS 20 minute tape that was great for a quickie and thought this was the same in DVD. It is not 
 I purchased this machine in November 2005. When working it is a wonderful but it started to leak within 6 weeks. I sent it back for repair or replacement, 3 weeks later I received a badly damaged box, not the shipping box but the Bodum box. The replacement had a manufactures date of 03/04, 2 years old. It had obviously been used, coffee and water stains were present several scratches, and parts were missing. I called customer service and the supervisor promised they would ship a new one immediately and I would receive it no later than 2/23/2006. Three days after I was promised I would receive the new machine it has yet to arrive.  I called customer service today and was informed they have no record of shipping a new unit and could I call back next week. The very used replacement machine was shipped back last week.  I regret making this purchase  
 The presentation of this book is confusing. The book presented is the study guide to Mankiw's "Priciple of Economics" prepared by David Hakes, not a paperback Edition of the Hardcover Testbook. Caveat Emptor 
 Like other reviewers, I also found this book to be disappointing due to lack of any explanation (as seems to be the case with 'Jean Marc Belkadi' books, I also have 'slap and pop guitar' by the same author).  The `diminished scale for guitar' book contains a myriad of interesting and sometimes esoteric examples of the diminshed scale in use (which is why it gets a possibly generous 2 stars).  However, this is literally all it is.  There are no explanations or *music theory* (???!) pertaining to why the dimished scale functions over any of the examples, neither any mention of which dimished scale is being using (ie C/Db/D and their symetrical equivalents), or which version (ie Half/Whole Whole/Half), which he does introduce, but *very* briefly at the beginning (certainly no guitar charts).  This was extremely frustrating at the time.  The consequence of this is that the intended audience will not understand how to use the diminished scale (like me when I first aquired this book, and any other reviewer of 'Jean Marc Belkadi' books, seriously, check out his reviews), and are even prevented from extrapolating correct usage/theory from the examples by using knowledge of which particular diminished scale is being used over certain chords (and people who can actually do this must already have good knowledge of the diminshed scale anyway, and so would not need this book - fathom that!).  In summary, if you want to learn how to use the diminshed scale, I urge you not to purchase this book - rather than "Jean Marc Belkadi reveals the secrets of using the diminished scale", he merely plays examples with `secrets' in without explanation or mention of music theory - the secrets remain secret! (though we are endowed with the knowledge that he can play guitar in a fast manner)  However, in fairness the other jazz tuition books I have used are not particularly clear, and I've had to use a lot of pen and paper to generalise the knowledge provided; my general advice: be prepared to think!  (As a side note, the "thanks to" page in the book probably gives an insight into the author's work ethic - "Thanks to: Mareello for his patience in transcribing these thousands of notes" [ie the actual examples] 
 If Maureen Dowd was a woman I would think she was sexist.  But since she is a cyborg sent to "dowdify" quotes to serve her own purpose, I will just think she is a moron.  Because let's face it.  No one wants to be called sexist 
 I enjoyed everything I've read from Robert Heinlein.  This book had lots of potential and I liked the concept but hated the voice of the story.  It was like he was getting lazy, sounded bombastic and I hated it.  I cherish books but this one went into the nasty garbage can at work, only ever threw away one other book and it was worse but it went in the garbage for the same reason, I read for stories not to hear an author try to show off how famous or witty he can be. 
 Mr. Yancey better clean up his act.  This is another me, me, me book by Mr. Yancey.  He has no respect for Jesus Christ and the honor of the Name of Christ.  What book of substance has he written besides all the pop-psycho-theology junk.  Has Mr. Yancey written one book to protect the integrity of the church against those who try to destroy it.  For instance, has he written one book against homosexuality?  This is the most important issue today in America's Christianity and the greatest insult to God.  Hasn't he heard of Sodom and Gomorrah?  What does he think will happen to America?  Does he think that God will pleasantly turn aside as America's Christian churches ordain homosexuals?  What does Mr. Yancey think about spiritual battle.  Obviously he is blind as a bat when it comes to spiritual war.  Even when homosexuality is the most important issue facing the church, he refuses to stand up for Christ and His honor and protect the Body of Christ.  What a man writes shows a lot about his character and goals.  Certainly, Mr. Yancey cares only about making money and not about defending the Christian Church against those who attack it 
 It is difficult, nay, impossible, to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious, money worshipping parasites, and that is exactly what we have in this novel.    Out of the blue a godfather appears, a deus ex machina, who offers an idealistic lawyer, Clay Carter, more wealth than he can imagine or use.  Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait, a very sharp, very large hook.  With apparent ease, this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble.  Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him, he immediately loses sight of reality.  What a hollow and useless individual he is, as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.  Whether or not there are such individuals (Enron?) is beside the point.  They may exist, but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories. The atmosphere in which they live is boring, as are their conversations, their lack of values, their hobbies, their sex lives, and their comeuppances.  Somehow, even in their fall, they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.  Having read most of Mr. Grisham's other books, I expected better from him.  
 Sounds like the background music used in the 70's Rockford Files TV crime show...and a little like the CHIPS music too. Similar to music by Tom Scott from back then. The crusaders never really get hard funky or dirty funky, they are more smooth groovin funk. The sound for the times is very clean, too produced for true funkyness. Don't get me wrong I like the old 60's JAZZ crusaders, just not this 70's phase of their career...they sold out to a large extent, and continue to do so, it's where the money is.  No improvisatory feel either. This is for smooth jazz lovers. hard funk lovers will be disappointed, as will true jazzers.  I wish the crusaders kept their jazz chops from the 60's but they keep burying it like it never happened, even to this day, afraid to lose sales if they get too musically adverturous like their mid/late 60's true jazz albums. Their 70's albums like this are partly to blame for today's smooth jazz... in other words, not really jazz, not really funky, just kind of smooth groovin, more for casual adults and offices. not challenging, not offensive, formulated to an extent. But hey if you like this, that's cool, just dont think it's realyl jazz, or really funk. it's watered down versions, but this water may float your boat. It's smooth and casual, slightly simmers, is pleasant background music, but doesn't COOK like so many other groups from the same time period that mixed jazz, funk, and fusion...but I'm betting you don't like that stuff...you'd say it's too "out there" or just "musician's music" and you'd be right, but that's what true jazz sounds like...it challenges you a bit to like it...making it all the more rewarding once you "get it", if you ever do. if you don't then you can always lsten to this. The point of my review is that since I know they had that spark in the 60's, it saddens me that they waste their talent on more conventional music like this just to make more money. It just sounds like they are holding back as I know they can play more advanced stuff, and write more creatively, they just choose not to ever since the 60's. oh and please dont buy the comments in another review that say that larry carlton's guitar playing here is complex and burning over hard chord changes...he's actually very laid back here and mostly plays typical simple blues rock solos with very LITTLE harmonic content as the songs are mostly based on simple repetive blues scale funk riffs that go nowhere. This is not real fusion either! again real lovers of true jazz, real funk, and real fusion will not like this 
  This book is very hard to read. It is not for an average person, more for doctors and other professionals. The whole book is written in 'doctor's language'. I wouldn't recommend it. It's now just sitting on my shelf 
 If you're a "member of the choir" and enjoy righteous indignation this book is for you. A well documented compendium of violations, abuses and near-abuses perpetrated by the right during the run-up to the 2004 presidential election. It contains some important information. You'll read both about evidence of widespread ballot tampering and the expulsion of democrats from Bush campaign events (shocked, SHOCKED!), all presented with the same seriousness. There is litte of importance here that has not been reported elsewhere so if you have been paying attention to the media (beyond the "mainstream" sources) this book will be a re-hash. If you are an Independent concerned about the integrity of our electoral system pass this one by 
 The 1994 Blackstone Audio Book version of "Turn of the Screw" is read by Pat Bottino.  Mr. Bottino's uninspired presentation destroyed the story. Perhaps Mr. Bottino got better in later ventures, I don't know, but he mangled "Turn". Avoid this version at all costs 
 I wish that tCoJCoLDS was as good at applying these principles as GBH is at writing them.  "He can talk the talk, but he doesn't walk the walk."  I'd be glad to provide anyone with details, andersandrobintronsen@yahoo.com  Love & Honesty are the Foundation of Christ's work here on earth, NOT endless, mindless details such as earrings, piercings/tattoos,'pretty' clothing: suits & ties, floor length dresses/skirts. It's thoughts of Kindness, Mercy & Forgiveness that count with Heavenly Father, NOT what we wear, how we look. Have a Great Day, God is Love.  
 THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE. The positive reviews all seem to come from Jungians who know little to nothing about tarot. I'm a devout Jungian and also an avid tarot reader. Sallie Nichols clearly doesn't know what she's talking about, and she hides it through dense language that I can only assume is supposed to make her appear intellectual. I tried many times to read this, hoping for some glimmer of Jung's knowledge to seep through Nichols' inanity, but just kept throwing the book back on the shelf in disgust. I really wish I hadn't wasted my money 
 This is in response to reviewer Natasha Lofft's claims that she is the half-sister of Natalie Wood in the review of Gavin Lambert's "Natalie Wood: A Life," dated on May 23, 2005.    Natasha Lofft is the daughter of Maria Gurdin's first love, Captain George Zapalov and his wife Nina.  This story originated from a fantasy that Maria Gurdin, Natalie Wood's mother, harbored for years because Captain Zapalov was her first love.  Maria Gurdin first met Natasha Lofft while vacationing on the Russian River when Ms. Lofft was a teenager.  Maria Gurdin, it must be noted, was a woman who suffered mental illness and Alzheimer's for many years before she passed away.  George Zapalov had blue eyes and Maria Gurdin had green eyes.  The two of them together could not have had a brown eyed child.  Also, Nina, Natasha Lofft's real mother, had brown eyes.  How could Maria have given birth to two kids around the same time?  If Natasha Lofft wants to prove that she is truly Natalie Wood's half-sister, she should pay for a DNA test and stop wasting people's time with this fantasy 
 I could not help but to watch this film with all of my African American female sensibilities. Despite the proficient acting, cinematography and directing, I found the content highly offensive and trite. Mr. Kinksy claimed to love Shanduri and was willing to do anything to possess her affections. He was put off to find out that Shanduri was married, but not deterred. Shanduri gave him what she believed was an unattainable challenge to have her husband, who was arrested for speaking out against the government, freed from an African prison. I recognize that it is possible for a servant to fall in love with her employer, however I know that it is extremely rare. (Ask any black woman who's cleaned a white person's house, `how much love do you have for your boss.' The relationship between Shanduri and Mr. Kinksy was one of abuse of power and emotional manipulation. During the `relationship' that I watched develop, not once did Shanduri refer to her employer by his first name. Clearly indicating an uneven balance of power and control...not much different from a slave owner offering to free his children born to his African concubine. So, Mr. Kinksy gave up some of his prized possessions; it was European influence that created the climate that allowed Shanduri's husband to be detained indefinitely. Though I am one among several with a different review about the film, I have no reason to forget the long history of abuse past and present that women of color experienced at the hands of white people, especially white men. To see such a film is an insult and another example of how Europeans do not understand the masses of African Americans 
 My own solace, is that I purchased this book as used.  I was truly hoping to gather ideas on how to take some of my found treasures and turn them into more useful and interesting pieces.  But the Grimm truth is that this is just a fairy story about a shabby chic princess who can afford a home on the beach.  My little Craftsmen bungalow is about a ½ mile from the river...does that count?  I found no inspiration here but rather an excessive use of white paint on walls, ceilings, beams, etc.  Does she own stock in Sherwin Williams?  I did order a few of her other titles which are a bit more useful.  Alas, I should have perused the shelves of the Carnegie and checked it out before spending my hard earned shekels.    
 What the listing doesn't state is this book is written for children.  Probably good for a 7 year old but had that been stated I wouldn't have purchased in the first place 
 The Adkins diet works because decreasing your carb intake decreases your calorie intake and it also works by your body loosing significant fluids secondary to increased urine excretions of ketones (from fat burning) and nitrogen (from use of protein for energy rather than the body's first choice of glucose from carbs).  Problems related to this diet include:  * increased protein diets heavily burden the kidneys to excrete exessive amounts of nitrogen which has been shown to lead to loss of renal (kidney) function with aging.  *Inadequate carb intake compromises glycogen storage in liver and muscles (the body's 1st choice for energy source) risking fatigue and poor performance  *Protein in excess of need is used for energy (but if you are fatigued from lack of carbs you wont use the energy), the other protein is converted to fat, and its a well known health risk to have an increased body fat %  * Also, high protein is associated with increased urinary excretion of calcium, and may therefore contribute to osteoporosis.  * High intake of animal proteins are linked to atherosclerosis (related to saturated fat and cholesterol content) and to colon and prostate cancers.    Honestly this diet is not healthy for you at all. Eating a well balanced diet and regularly getting excercise will help you stay healthy and can remove you from the burden and cost that all of these fad diets offer. No matter how Mr. Adkins died doesn't matter... what matters is that you have a choice to make good decisions about your health and realize that sometimes these fad diets are too good to be true and we could be putting ourselves at risk by believing they are the answer to our problems. 
 Ok...I'm disappointed.  Many tracks that should have been there, are missing from this CD.  Where are all the beautiful scoring tracks by Don Davis? The opening and ending track in"Second Renessance I and II for instance? Or the finale in Kid's Story? To all you score lovers out there this CD is a joke.  While on the subject of "Kid's story", one of the best tracks in the entire Animatrix is missing - namely "Masters of the Universe" by Juno Reactor. (Yes, the track when he rides his skate board, escaping from the agents) This awesome track that is so totally "Matrix" in sound and style is NOT on this CD, most probably due to some F-up between record labels or something. If you want it, it's on Juno Reactor's own album "Shango".    Then what are we left with?  Well, there are a few good tracks on this CD like "Who am I", "Beauty Never Fades" and Super Moves but that's pretty much it.  the rest is a bunch of uninspired techno/electronica tracks with cheesy sampled quotes from the Matrix movies. Some of them are flat out embarrasing and sound like they're made by total amateurs.   SO unless you are a total Matrix fanatic who has to have EVERYTHING made in the name of the Matrix franchize - stay away from this CD.  
 OK, first off, I bought this full price($27+) at a local independent bookstore. So you can get it here instead and that price savings might be more worthwhile for what you get.  It's really sad but I just didn't find it funny enough. I bought it for a gift and after reading it, now will return it and spend my 30 bucks on something actually worth $30.   Don't get me wrong, parts of this are absolutely hilarious, but not enough parts to make it worth the price. I wish it were shorter, because such a big book should be jammed packed from start to finish with rib-splitting humor. Instead, I felt like I really had to look for the funny parts. The photos are amusing - all 60's & 70's retro stuff. The recipes are out of the same era - good housekeeping influenced etc.  I think it fails because it is too much in the middle of the road. There are actually recipes and hostess tips you can actually use in this book but you have to sort them out of everything else(all the humor/irony/retro stuff). Or if you're looking for the humor side of it, then yes, the humor is here too, but you have to sort through all the actual practical mundane tips & recipes as well.  Here's my tips: Look before you buy - and this might be a really good gift item for those under 30?  And here's my favorite tip from the book: "A good trick is to fill your medicine cabinet with marbles. Nothing announces a nosey guest better than an avalanche of marbles hitting a porcelain sink" 
 Our book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book.  As the facilitator, I was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection.  The writing is disjointed to the point that Ms. Krauss loses her reader.  Then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters, the reader is left extremely frustrated.  I really cannot imagine how Ms. Krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews 
 This is on the overall a good book as the other reviews have testified.  There is one major problem, the author talks very little about risk.  She recommends that you get deeply into debt and use that leverage to make money.  That's ok and many people have made money that way.  Many people have also lost their shirt that well as well.  The book would have been much enhanced is she spent a chapter talking about the risks involved with taking on massive amounts of debt, especially for the small investor - the target audience - who likely doesn't have much to lose.  She should've included several case studies, some that look those who have successfully used leverage (debt), and looked at some who lost everything.  Then she could've analyzed what were the underlying factors and decisions that led to either failure or success.  Instead the author casts debt in an overly positive light, saying almost nothing about the risks involved.  This is all well for her, she began to buy several years before the biggest real estate boom in the history of the country.  But there have been plenty of real estate markets in the past where investors took on too much debt and lost not only their investment properties, but everything else as well.  Any credible book about investing has a responsibility to spend a healthy amount of time discussing risk.  It's like being enthusiastic about a medication but not saying anything about the potential side effects or hazards.  Such an approach is bad medicine, and Ms. Thomas' book is bad teaching because she ignores the subject of debt, and for that reason I took off 3 stars.    Beyond that, it's a very good starter book.  
 Anti-corporate Cassandras grind axes to sparse audiences these days.  In O'Boyle's piddling attempt to make us outraged at GE, he destroys his own credibility.  By attempting to pin every social ill of the late 20th  century on Jack Welch-- a good, if ruthless CEO-- his ideological ship  spins wildly out of control.  Downsizing is his fault. (Hello,  organizations are becoming streamlined all over the developed world)  Media  sensationalism is his fault. (Welch personally delights in the bottom  dwelling content of Dateline NBC) Anybody who has ever worked for a  corporation, especially one as big as GE, knows a few things that should  make readers way of O'Boyle's hokey cause and effect analysis: 1. The CEO  does not micromanage his or her company-- thousands of important decisions  are made under a CEOs jurisdiction every day. 2. Corporations are not  social utopias, and shouldn't be.  People get fired sometimes.  But people  are also given opportunities to do interesting work.  And competition is  good. 3. If there is a ubitiquitous problem in society, e.g. families are  no longer as stable, a corporation, which is sample unit of social  organization, will usually reflect, or possibly be linked more directly to  that problem.  However, small minds confuse this with causality, not  understanding the methodological pitfall of ad hoc ergo propter hoc.  For  example- families break up more, partially because people don't balance  work and family very well. Lots of people work for corporations.   Corporations caused the decline of the American family. Read the book--  O'Boyle is guilty of not understanding these truths and more 
 Many of the reviews I read felt strongly in favor of this remake, but some of the people had not seen "An Affair to Remember".  Cary Grant & Deborah Kerr had the spark so lacking in this "Love Affair" remake.  The original "Love Affair" with (forgive me, I can only remember Irene Dunne as Terry, and my opinion that film was not as good as this "Love Affair", however. I missed hearing the original scoring of "An Affair to Remember", but Annette Benning's music with the children was lovely.  As most of the reviews that stated they were in favor of "An Affair...", I missed the climactic ending with Cary Grant's reactions, and also the shipboard scene where he want's to be "worthy of her love".    I don't wish to underrate or "dump" on this film, but I wish all reviewers would watch the Grant/Kerr version just once.  I believe they will become "old movie buffs" too.  Thanks for reading my review 
 I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start.   I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad.   I really couldn't recommend this book any less 
 Of interest to hitech execs and MBA students...  A simple idea dragged to many, many pages...  The real value of the book is a) interesting examples b) familiarity, to fend off above mentioned IT execs and MBA students, who'll pretend it's ground-breakin 
 I could give 5 stars for the pictures but becouse of a big mistake, stars come down. Okay the photos are good but somewhere I am very dissapointed. On page August 22, where the comments for the picture were about the genocide of Jewish, it was written that Turks did the same thing to Armenians. But that was a lie. Some nummamorous people told this allegation and the writer believes them. This is very sad. If someone writing a book, he/she must be very careful about his/her words. Books must not contain allegations. Or author must tell that it was an allegation, unless it is proved 
 Nothing more than a retelling of the Merry Melodies classic, "The High and the Flighty." In the 1956 toon, Daffy Duck sells torture devices to both Barnyard Dog and Foghorn Leghorn who have drawn the lines as if battling over territory -- or perhaps just intentionally aggravating one another -- in the manner of the "Lord of War"-friendly Israelis and Palestinians (even so direct as Foghorn uttering the line, "This, I say, this calls for massive retaliation," after getting hit in the head with a watermelon). Except that in the cartoon, the two warring parties eventually unite against the "Lord of War." Cartoon director Robert McKimson presents a much more optimistic view on humanity. Nicolas Cage should be ashamed that he signed on for such an unoriginal and weak-spirited project. Er, never mind, he's sort of left a guinea-pig turd trail of stinkers: "Honeymoon in Vegas," "Con Air," "8MM," "Gone in Sixty Seconds" and "Leaving Las Vegas," just to name a few 
 Andrew Carnegie was such a boring book, especially if you hate history.  I couldn't get interested in it.  It went too much in depth with numbers and statistics.  Those things took away from what,I think, the author was trying to get the readers to understand.  Every time I read it I would lose interest right away!!  One paragraph and I was gone. I would even fall asleep when reading it!!!  I had to re-read sections multiple times because I couldn't even tell you what I was reading. It went in one ear and out the other. I had to make sure I understood it though because I had to write a 5 page paper on it for my history class 
 It does not give any practical guides on switching power supply design, it's just an overview of topologies. Useles 
 I sell my services as a scientific consultant and I have learned that prospective clients are interested in themselves, not in me. As I redirect my professional practice and revitalize my marketing/selling program, I have read many helpful books. All the professional services marketing books stress the importance of focusing on benefits. So does a very good cold call selling book I just read. Goldner's book, in contrast, never mentions benefits to the prospect, only features offered by the caller. His scripts have the same artificial structure that turns off my interest immediately when telemarketers call me. I know I'm not alone in this response. I am very disappointed in this book and it will not remain in my library 
 I was browsing for 2-way radios in a store and this set caught my eyes because they use Li-ion batteries.  Most other radios use the older NiMH technology so I thought the extra battery life would be good.  Well, I just got back from a trip and the radios perormed horribly.  From the beach to my 4th floor hotel room, the distance could not have been more than 1/4 mile with a line of sight, and the reception was hit or miss.  Even when the call button worked, the speech usually was not intelligible.  I am trying, but I cannot come up with a single positive thing to say about this product.  I will go back to using my older Motorola set until I find a suitable GMRS set 
 I bought this CD not long after it came out.  It didn't last long in my collection because it only has a few good songs on it!!!  I like Somehow Our Love Survives and Abandoned Garden.  Other than that this is a mediocre effort for Michael. He has used this kind of Brazilian theme on Sleeping Gypsy already. Stick with your roots Michael...you are from California...not South America. Try buying Blue Pacific instead!!! I abandoned this one a long time ago 
 I've had my Micro for over a year now, and when it worked, I loved it! However, I'm having the notorious ear phone jack issue; the sound is output in layers, and I am constantly trying to "reposition" my headphones to get full sound. My husband called Creative Labs for assistance, and he was told that it would cost him [...] per month for a "customer service subscription." After reading these reviews, it seems we'd be paying Creative Labs [...] so that they could tell us there's nothing they can (or will) do. Next brand, please...  
 This album is mainly for big time guitar fans. Of course Robben Ford is a very talented guitar player but I find this one rather slow and very boring. I can hear one or two songs at a time, then I just can't stand it! The music of Robben Ford is a blend of blues, jazz, funk, and I'm almost certain that most of his fans are guitar players themselves. I'd buy "Handful of blues" instead of this one 
 My husband was so excited, when he got this station and could not wait to get it set up.  He is a phone guy so he wired it all up under the house and spent many hours setting it up just right, only to have issues with  the wind barameter.  We have tried to trouble shoot with the online and  handwritten manuals.    Unfortunetly there is no one to contact nor is there an option to return this product once you have it out of the box.. sooooo needless to say the  excitement is gone..   
 This is the first time I have written a review.  In this particular case, I felt it was my responsibility to forewarn potential readers of the disturbing contents of this book.  I've read several "self help" books on subjects ranging from introversion to optimistic thinking.  I found this book to be of little help and quite disturbing.  The book is filled with tests and self evaluations.  I do not believe it is necessary to know where one falls on the optimist/pessimist scale.  Often, such tests can only further depress or make anxious an already vulnerable reader.  In Chapter 5, the author uses an extremely horrific and disturbing story to illustrate a five step process to forgiveness.  I was further sickened by the author's list of "bodily pleasures" in Chapter 7.  Rather than feeling uplifted by this book, I found myself feeling upset and outraged by the author's egotism, ignorance, perversion and insensitivity.  I caution anyone seeking advice on optimism 
 Best in genre? What genre are these people talking about - most boring book about Russians?  I threw this out after 100 or so pages. I couldn't take any more.   BORING 
 Previously, I read the first two books of the His Dark Materials books with ease. They were easy to get into and the plots were more interesting. The third book is just a disgrace. I read the first couple of chapters and just could not say, "Oh, lets continue reading the Amber Spyglass." I practically had to "force" myself to read it, and eventually, I got tired of forcing myself to read it, so I decided to abandon it. There are three main keys that has led me to discontinuing this book. 1. The plot, the characters, the settings, etc. was just absolutely boring. There were no action-packed parts of the book in the beginning. And a major have-to-do thing for authors is to draw the readers in right from the beginning, and Mr. Pullman has not done that in this book. 2. This book is way too long. The combination of boringness(not a word, but oh well) and lengthiness is definitely not a good combination. 3. Why does PHilip Pullman have to be so against Christianity? I read his bio on wikipedia and he has all these critical comments on C.S. Lewis. It's okay for him to hate the religion, but others have the right to appreciate their own. He's also in these associations that are just so religious related. I just think he shouldn't show his hatred in his books 
 Well, what can I say about this book? With a due respect to the authors, it's the same usual American bias toward developing countries. As an American living and working in China for the past 2 years:   1)It's hard for Americans/Westerners to understand how business is done in China? Well, my answer it's because China is NOT in the West and Chinese people are not westerners. Try learning the language first, be respectful, and don't be so obnoxious.   2)This is the same background noise that I hear from overeducated ideologues: If a country is not like the US, then it must be wrong. I guess the Chinese should have a 4th world healthcare system like the US?  3)I personally feel that some authors wish China to stay poor so Madonna can have a concert there and pretend that the rich countries care. Well, maybe Africa, but not China.  4)Just because you watch CNN, FOX, and NBC, it does not make you an expert. 5)Just because you went to an Ivy League school, it does not make you a genius about other countries and cultures. As matter of fact, it does not make you a genius (period)  6)US should comment less on China and worry about the pointless war in Iraq, the death of our soldiers for a pointless cause, broken US healthcare, outsourcing of the American jobs, broken borders, broken education system, children killing each other at schools...and the list goes on. 7)China has many societal problems; please tell me something I don't know. China is working on it, it takes time, and they are not magicians.   8)If China is so awful please don't do business there nor go visit there. For the fact that there are SO many foreign investments there, makes all business executives and companies from the West idiots.   
 And folk revivalism is what it is, folks; I'll label it even if the populists fume at me because I know of more than 5 genres.  Meloy admits in interview after interview his taste for the Fairport Convention, Pentangle, and above all Shirely Collins.  He even did an album of "covers" of Shirley Collins' arrangements of British traditionals, a ridiculous concept if I ever heard of one.  Why cover another singer's versions of TRADITIONAL songs?  This idiocy should evince Meloy's alienation from a long tradition of reinterpretations of British folk music, and indeed most of his oeuvre consists of feeble attempts at ballad composition.  With no prosodic skill, he goes about constructing narratives modeled on such work as Shirley Collins' repertoire.  Evidently Meloy believes he can pen ballads as if he were a Walter Scott, S.T.C. or John Keats, but his weak stories show throughout the imaginative poverty of an American desperately attempting to beat an escape to the land of faerie.  The wistfulness and Romantic nostalgia of Meloy's work come off as trite and calculated for NPR yuppies.  Moreover, his vocal range consists entirely of yelp, melancholy warble and nasal whine--this whingeing troubadour sounds as if he constantly has a cold.  I'll admit the band is at least competent, but do yourself a favor: buy Comus' "First Utterance," the Incredible String Band's "The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter" or Shirley Collins' "No Roses" instead 
 I checked the book out of the library (thanks be to God I didn't buy it, I wouldn't want to give it away - that would be wrong) with an anticipation that it would inspire me.  I believe I am able to discern, when I come across material, whether it is faithful and in keeping with the Truth. I found there to be a special emphasis on relativism - as in "there's no thing you can do that is really evil - it's all relative"  Walsch also makes representation as though God refers to Jesus as just another man among other masters. Jesus was nothing special please pass the salt.  Sounds like Walsch's God is not God at all - but rather someone or something else.   Walsch would have us believe that merely because he is a fallen away catholic who wanted to be a priest when he a was a kid that he has some advantage to knowing a thing or two about the faith.  Almost like saying "Hey back in the day I was way more Christian than ya'll... matter of fact I was....Catholic... and I even wanted to be a priest!"  So?  This book does not lead people to the true Jesus, Son of the Living God.   It's the flavor of the month krispy creme doughnut in the spiritual food pyramid.  All so sweet, warm, and yummy - and not that good for your soul either 
 After the 1700s, this play fell into obscurity. It was later revived in the mid 1900s. Its period of obscurity does not surprise me. Believe me, I am a champion for Shakespeare's underrated "Timon of Athens" and "Coriolanus." I honestly TRIED to like this play, but I was forced to concur with the great Isaac Asimov who said: "Though it ends happily and is therefore technically a comedy, it lacks a carefree fun and happiness of the previous comedies. it is, indeed, rather an unpleasant play..." Well, onto the play. We meet the widowed Countess, her son Bertram, and the elder Lafew. We learn that the king is ill and quite possibly terminal. Possibly, Helena's father could have cured the king, but alas, he is dead. The Countess gives Bertram some advice that is not so far from the advice Polonius gave Ophelia. (Though the bumbling Polonius ends up being easier to like!) Helena loves Bertram, but feels beneath him and contemplates virginity. One comical moment is when Parolles reveals that in a way, virginity is a form of vain self love. Later, Helena cures the king, and Helena asks for Bertram as a husband. Now this is where I have a problem. Bertram is made out to be a villain. But how can we possibly not sympathize with him? Maybe Helena deserves something for saving the king, but does she really have the right to impose marriage on someone who doesn't like her? Well, Bertram is forced to go through with the marriage, but he quickly decides to help Florence against Siena. Poor Parolles who knows this forced marriage was unethical is constantly made a subject of ridicule in this play. This is where I have another problem. Rather than the clever misunderstandings of "The Comedy of Errors," the clever marital confrontations and errors in "Midsummer Night's Dream," or the comical and clever passages from Jaques in "As You Like It," the comedy in "All's Well That Ends Well" is reduced to the lowest possible form. (Flat out ridicule! It is interesting that in the word ridicule, we have the letters for cruel, but I am digressing.) In one decent elemenet of comedy, Bertram makes it clear that he would rather go to war than lie with his wife. (And perhaps in time, Bertram can appeal to the king to release him from this marriage. It wouldn't be unheard of.) One interesting thing is that Bertram remains honorable in the sense that he does not 'ravish' Helena. He doesn't love her, and therefore will not engage in sex. It is rather repulsive on his mother's part how she fails to understand the situation. Even if she was on Helena's side, she might AT LEAST understand Bertram's frustration in that he did not consent to the marriage. (And possibly try to at least talk things over in hopes of coming to a peaceful solution.) But no. She just rants and raves. Later the Countess reads a letter from Helena stating that she will leave so Bertram can come home from the war. This throws Bertram's mother into yet another rage on Helena's behalf, and perhaps moves the reader into sympathy with Helena. THAT IS, UNTIL OUR GOOD OLD UNCLE ISAAC ASIMOV points out the hypocrisy of Helena: "Helena is not quite as unselfish as she is presenting herself to be. She does not go to the shrine at all but sneaks off to Florence in disguise as a pilgrim hoping that she may yet return her reluctant husband." Well, onward. In Florence, Helena meets with Diana (whom Bertram loves). And Helena thinks she can trick Bertram into making her pregnant. We then have the cruel practical joke on Parolles where he is blindfolded and threatened to reveal military secrets (to friendly forces of course) or else. Perhaps even Shakespeare felt bad over this scene as he has Parolles say: "Who can not be crushed with a plot?" (4.3.340). We also see Bertram try to win the affections of Diana. Diana of course feels nothing for Bertram. But again, the hypocrisy of the play is prevalent. If we accept the fact that Bertram should respect Diana's wishes that she doesn't love him, how do we account for the fact that Helena imposed an unwanted marriage on Bertram? But of course Diana consents to meet Bertram and of course it will really be Helena who meets him. But even tricking Bertram into getting her pregnant is not enough. Helena decides to throw a sympathy party for herself by spreading the word of her death back home. Now in "Much Ado About Nothing," Hero had a valid excuse for staging her death. She was humiliated and disgraced in front of several people for something she was totally innocent of. But Helena was the one who imposed an unwanted marriage on Bertram, and she still wants a sympathy party. One redeeming element of the play is that Lafew shows some sympathy for the disgraced Parolles and offers him a job. And of course, in the end Bertram feels bad over Helena's staged death and is happy to see her alive again. Helena may very well be the Britney Spears of Shakespeare's characters. 
 The Apple Remote is included with the iMac G5 and works great with it and Front Row.  However, for the iPod, it's almost useless.  The lack of menu navigation capability using the remote is crippling.  In short, don't buy this remote, look at other non-Apple remotes that are more full-featured 
 Yeah, i bought this CD because i heard she is one of the better Drum N' Bass DJs....and she's really damn cute.  Problem is...this CD isn't very good at all.  Trying to go too main stream popish, some of the lyrics are laughable, there isn't a single song on this CD that would make it into one of my sets.  I'm sure she's a very good DJ, but someone led her down the wrong road this time 
 I got one word: RETARDED. It fits this album and also every one of the reviewers here, that gave this bs more than one star. 
 I bought this book for Dr. Norman's class at the University of California, Riverside.  I must say that this is one of the worst textbooks I've ever read.  It is confusing, unorganized and the charts and diagrams are  difficult to understand. It tries to be comprehensive but fails to clearly  explain most concepts. The only thing worse than this book are Dr. Norman's  lectures.  There are plenty of other better books on this topic than this  one 
 Possibly the worst book I have ever read.  The "style" could be bested by a not-too-bright fifth grader.  The plot is an imbecilic rehash of the Divinci Code.  Don't bother keeping track of any details, because everything turns out to be irrelevant.  If you want to entertain yourself and your friends, however, check this out of your local library and get mildly drunk.  Now open the book at random and read aloud.  This should cause hysterical I-can't-believe-this-got-published laughter.  
 I was excited to begin reading this book because the author has good credentials and I find the subject matter fascinating.  Imagine my disappointment after I began reading it and discovered that it seemed to be written in a style that was designed to challenge a reader to get through the material.  The sub title of this book should have been "or why you hated your history textbooks in high school".  Surely there must be a way to take this interesting material and write it in a way that makes it a good read.  If you want to make your high school age child hate to study American history force them to read this book next time they deserve to be punished.  In all fairness the picture on the dust jacket of the book was pleasant.  Apparently this author has won some impressive prizes for his other books.  It is no surprise that he didn't win for this one.  It almost makes a reader surmise that it was edited with the intent to bury interesting material in a sea of boring writing style.  Could the writing have been worse?  Probably yes.  Was it really edited with the intent to make it unpleasant to read?  Probably not.  Should you buy this book?  Only if you have to write a paper on The Founders and you can't find any other resource material (even then I'd suggest you either buy it used or try and find it at the library because you will be disappointed to have spent good money on this poorly written book.)  Was it a book you'd be glad to read?  Hardly.  Does it contain interesting information?  Yes.  But is it readable?  Barely 
 This was a very...very...very... uh... well... interesting DVD. Let's see... how can I say this uhh... IT SUCKED. I'm the type of person who usually loves everything I watch, I love almost every genre and its easy for me to like things. Especially anime. If I say an anime is bad...its pretty dang bad. This anime is about 2 siblings who win 2 legendary skins for the online game, .HACK. They won the skins of 2 legendary characters who beat the game. Even though the sister is excited (her skin is Black Rose, yea, you know who I mean .HACK video-gamers), the brother (he has Kite's skin) well... isn't excited. It's just a pretty lame show that insults the amazing video games and the OTHER .HACK anime which is a masterpiece. If you really--and I mean REALLY--want to check out this series, I reccomend the manga; it's MUCH better. 
 I was disappointed in this book. Given the editorial reviews and other reader reviews, I thought it might be a humorous look at sex and the lack of sex in the post-baby relationship as well as ways to rekindle the romance. What I read was much different. There was information on how the sex life changes (hence the 1 star), but I was turned off by a lot of the recommendations. For example, women who are suffering from post-baby negative body image probably wouldn't find the tip to rent a pornographic movie or let her husband read pornographic magazines helpful. Nothing like comparing that body to the idylic ones in the magazine pages...Also there were sections called "hide your smut" and instructions on how to handle when your children find your "treasure chest" of adult materials. Not exactly what I had in mind 
 I've read great reviews about this book so I finally bought it because I could not get it at my local library. Never ever finished the book - it was god-awful. Badly written, incoherent story - it jumped around - JUST PLAIN BAD.. 
 My twins are 3 1/2 and have not wanted to start potty training. I thought I would buy this book and see if I could have success. The day after I ordered the book, I bought my daughter some princess underwear and she suddenly became very excited about the prospect of not wearing diapers. My son immediately followed suit. Unfortunately, the book had not arrived yet, so I just had to use some common sense and good instincts. Lucky for me, this worked and my twins were potty trained by the end of the week and ready for school after Easter Break. I offered no rewards other than praise. I did not use a doll. I did not do any of the ridiculous things suggested by this book which seems very outdated. At the end of the first week back at school, the book finally arrived. I decided to read it just to see what it said and was glad it arrived so late. If you have not bought a book yet, don't buy this one. Just use common sense, don't try to train too early and let your child's success be its own reward 
 I purchased this book, not realizing "Prevention" books had decided to move into ... publishing.  If you read the disclaimer, it says this diet is controversial, etc., etc.  (shorthand for someone's theory on how things COULD maybe be).  Whether you decide Adkins, Sugar Busters, Smart Women series, etc., this is so far off base, I'm sending it back.  I thought Prevention magazine had a little more credibility 
 Page after page of vapid ranting relying on ad hominem attacks buttressed by footnotes the National Enquirer would be proud to cite. Not thoughtful, not thought-provoking, but an addition to ditto-head "uh HUH!" conformity to whatever outrage du jour (or du hier, so 1970s are his examples) is promoted by neocon ideologues.   There are good conservative writers out there; Flynn is not one of them 
 I ordered this ram two weeks ago! They haven't even shipped it yet 
 The problem with this book is that the author completely overlooks the culpability of the U.S. in the acts of genocide discussed.  The U.S.bombing of Cambodia although not in itself an act of genocide was the reason why peasants flocked to the Khmer Rouge who previously were a marginal group.  It was the U.S. who blocked any attempts of the UN to send more soldiers to Rawanda.  As well, it was the U.S. that armed Indonesia so that they could attack and occupy East Timor, a clear case of Genocide.  etc. etc. etc 
 buying it, especially online from a major corporation, is totally contrary to the philosophy of the book!  if you dont have the guts to steal it, borrow it, or find it bootleg online.....then you aren't the kind of person who should be reading it.  peac 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 hi, found this while searching for books on organizing  im not a parent, a single 30 something pack rat of which i inhereted from my mother, i work nights and sleep most of the morning, which allows for little daylight to run errands etc........im looking for fast simple ways to organize bit by bit, and clean out the clutter...  if anyone has recommendations on books which can help, please email me direct using AMAZON ORGANIZING as your subject title thanks wendy1tiki@aol.co 
 Terrible.  With so many good, REAL stories out there, how could there ever be a market for a 'fable'?  I should have read the fine print.  This is not a true story, but instead, a made-up mess.  Yuck 
 You want some real metal/tribal sounds stick with Soulfly! This cd is pure garbage.. 
 Wow!  I'm astonished that everyone else liked this so much.  For me, watching Ruth Yancey Fox ruthlessly destroy the lives of everyone in her family was just too depressing.  I probably wouldn't have even finished this if I hadn't been on vacation.  I thought Ruth should have had her comeuppance a lot earlier in the story, and then there would have been a LITTLE more joy and happiness instead of grinding misery for the whole damn book.  I also thought the depiction of the black servants was a bit racist and patronizing.  (The old warmhearted-but-dimwitted stereotype. 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 I love the Firebird imprint and was excited to read this book and "Ecstasia", its predecessor.  Ugh.  I barely made it through this quadmire of perverse sex and terrible poetry.  I find it completely inappropriate for a teen novel (yes, I know, teens have sex) to be so overtly sexual.  Every page, every paragraph practically was full of plain ol' sex, bestiality, masturbation, homosexual and bisexuality.  Sure, it was couched in flowery prose and open-ended verse, but it still boils down to pornography when you take away the fluff.  And, while Primavera's childish songs were marginally better than the ones in "Ecstasia", I'm still hard-pressed to imagine how anyone could sing meterless, beat-less, pointless verse like that.  Never mind that it didn't rhyme, I'd like to see the tune that could follow any one of those arbitrary lines!  Bleah 
 This book has a lot of names.  I'll give it that.  But, there are some relatively common names that are missing.  And so many invented names.  My favorite of the invented names are Schmoopie and Poogie.  As if these names will show up on a birth certificate!!   The definitions/origins of the names are poorly researched and confusing.   For the name "Cowboy" the book tells you it means "country"  for the name "Country" it tells you it means "western".   Not that either of those is a standard name, but, for "words as names" aren't you going to pick it because it has meaning to you?   Also, the lists are totally false, something the author (if you can call her that) made up while sitting around drinking with her buddies.  And some of the names on these lists aren't even found later in the book.  (ex. Lynus on the "Party animals" list) I wish I had held out for a trip to the bookstore instead of just picking up the first book I saw at Walmart.   I figured with so many names I would find one I liked, but I am just so distracted by all the junk that I will never find a good name here.  
 Typical obvious (re-)placement and (recently all too common)  Italian American as disgusting, classless, filthy villain/movie producer makes this book a real disapointment. So boring to make the Italian the new interchangeable bad white guy...tired and boring 
 This is not even a toy.  DO NOT waste your money on this item.  Amazon will charge you to send it back which is what most will do if you expect even the lowest standards in a "quick" machine.  Nothing about this machine functions well.  Never got an even stitch or a complete row of stitches.  Amazon should not carry this item, it has lowered the quality of Amazon's products in my view 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
 I have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery. I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story  (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline). I also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of Destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her. 
 Notes and outtakes from the Mars series that should have been left on the cutting room floor. It appears that Robinson and his publisher wanted to squeeze every cent out of the success of the trilogy. Actually degenerates down to pages and pages of really bad poetry. Does not deserve even one star but that's as low as you can go 
 This volume is not up to the standards set by previous collections in the series.  It contains far too many stories that are mediocre or worse.  If 2003 just wasn't a very good year for S-F, Dozois made a mistake in including "more than 300,000 words of fantastic fiction. 
 I hate it when they release "inspired by" music! Very little of this CD was music actually from the movie! If you look closely at the cover you'll see the words, "Music from and inspired by..." This is not the CD Soundtrack from the movie, or at least only a couple of the songs are really from the movie and the rest in "inspired" by it! I was disappointed when I first bought this CD in a store, because I like the theatrical scores with orchestras. This is not that CD from the cover and sample selection 
 I love to read and listen to books on CD but I have tried to listen to this a couple of times and I am disgusted.  The language and the sexually inferences are so vile and gratuitous that I can't get past the second disc.  Very disappointed 
 This film sucked harder than a boatload of whores during shore leave. I originally saw it for free and afterwards, I still felt screwed. It stank so badly that I checked the soles of my sneakers on my way out of the theatre. Yeah, I know. Call me "Mister Tact".  A "horror-comedy" that's neither slightly funny nor remotely scary, this film is a supposed sequel to the 1981 horror classic "An American Werewolf in London", (which is possibly the best werewolf film ever made). The filmakers had a lot to live up to and, boy, they blew it in every department. The effects were ludicrous, the cast was lost, the script was bathroom tissue with identity issues, and the director should have been shot (with something other than lots of narcotics). This film is a textbook example of the Hollywood machine clanking its way through a total goatscrew.  If you have already been suckered into buying this DVD, I feel your pain. You are undoubtedly now using it as a coaster for a Heineken or as a tool to chisel old dingleberries out of your asscrack 
 after get shorty, e.l. might just wish shamelessly that his next book with those same chili palmer characters might hit the goldmine and pay dirt and being bought up by the dumb hollywood producers and made into another movie again, with this single-minded purpose focused, e.l. wrote this totally unnecessary sequel to get shorty. and he was right again, it was bought and made into a movie again, but pathetically, a horrible one compared to get shorty. the novel itself was also a complete failure with so many obvious evidences that e.l. indeed wrote it in a way for another movie in mind. i simply failed to find there's any interest in reading this going nowhere story. it just like reading a double imaged e.l. personified in chili palmer and lobbying so hard to make this novel into a movie, with all the bore-to-death script, dialogue readymade for hollywood to grap. how could you imagine that those winnos in los angeles, especially those who in the hiphop music biz would watch 'charlie rose' and would have known and recognized chili palmer as the producer of 'get shorty'? you think those people would faithfully turned on their tv and channel surfed to pbs to watch 'charlie rose'? and at every corner of los angeles, every table in any restaurant, almost everyone would recognize 'chili palmer'? and you have to ask yourself: since when people would recognize a behind-the-screen movie producer, even a director in person? even they stand in front of you and claim themselves they are? yeah, maybe elmore leonard would watch 'charlie rose' regularly? and you think that charlie rose would interview a notorious shylock in his show? give me a break! this book, from the 1st page to the last was an absolutely no-brainer, so shallow and so superficious! just a total unnecessary and unwanted cash-in 
 This was the worst movie I have ever seen (and I've seen a few horrible ones!) the acting was terrible, the plot completely absurd and unrealistic, this is definitely NOT a D/s movie. I too am giving the movie away, I refuse to let anyone who is bent on seeing this movie actually pay for such an awful thing! (like *I* did) And I most certainly will never watch it again. 
 This the first of Daninell's books I read.  I learnt that she was the Queen of romance novel since I was a teen.  I'm a little disappointed by the book because it's really boring for most of the part. It's like reading an alternative version of Princess Diana's traffic accident.  I realize that Daniell likes to repeat herself a lot.  There are too many reptitions of descriptions of all kinds.  It's also too predictable.  To me, everything that Bill did is really cheesy and unreal and his stubborness of rejecting and denying Anabelle after he became paralysed makes me wonder what a tyranny psycho he is that he just wants to inflict pain on the woman who loves him and who has nobody there for her at all. It's really hard to believe any man who acts so unreasonably stubborn on his own version of love and happiness that he can actually be an ideal partner for any woman.  Men like that are normally pretty controlling and emotionally abusive. This is the major element in the book that really turns me off.   I have to admit that the last part where Anabelle finally convinced Bill to be with her is quite touching.  I think Ms. Steel does have her crowds of fans.  My boyfriend's mother had been crying all the way thru the book.      
 From the title of this book, I imagined that it would be something which I would read out of each night.  With such an image in my mind, I got this  book, but did not get past the first few pages. There are phrases such as  "horses have no conscience".  This made me thing that the author  had never been near a horse before 
 Micheal Moore made me vomit while watching this movie. America would be a better place if he left here, which he should because he obviously doesn't appreciate everything that his country does for him. His extremely one sided argument has no historical value, and it a piece of brainwashing propaganda that he made in attempt to try to convince more people to hate that country that gives them so much 
 Please don't get sucked in like I did.  All she does is endlessly talk about herself and then give you one tiny suggestion at the end like, start a diary.  It's ridiculous!  I tried her tape set and found it   horrible! It's an absolute abomination of her endlessly saying how she will eventually help you.  And she will tell you to listen to her saying that same thing for two weeks straight, while your time gets sucked up.  It's criminal! 
 There's an old saying: "Never try to teach a pig to sing.  It waists your time and annoys the pig."  Now replace pig with cat and sing with use the toilet.  I spent nearly 2 months follwing the instructions in this book.  First slowly bringing the litter box to the bathroom, raising it up to the toilet, and finally replacing the box on the toilet with kitty litter in plastic wrap.  Now, I have a cat that hangs over the edge of her litter box so I though this would not be a leap.  But kitty was not happy.  The first day sans box she peed on the floor in front of the toilet.  The second day she pooped.  The thrid day she peed ON OUR BED!  This, my friend, was a cat telling us she was not happy with the situation.  So, the kitty box returned and we have had no further straying of toilet duties.  The book is cute and entertaining.  Maybe you have a cat that will use the toilet.  Not me.  Neither of our two cats used the toilet 
 It worked file with Win 2k, but as soon as I switched to Windows Xp, this device was rendered utterly useless to me - it won't shut down or eject, and windows explorer won't see it.  Grrrrrrrr .....   
 I saw this movie many years ago. I still cannot entirely rid myself of its memory.  It was the only time ever that I nearly threw up in the cinema (literally).  
 I read this book, it was okay but the story flashed back to much, and I couldn't folow all of it but I read all of it anyway. I wouldn't recommend it. TOO SLOW MOVING, and BORING because of the flashbacks. The movie was the same way 
 This book adds nothing really new that has not been covered by Poul Jorgensen's classic book "Salmon Flies - their character, style and dressing" and unlike that book will never become a "classic"  book. The only critiscm that I ever had of Jorgensen's book was that the  illustrations were in black & white and lost some of the detail. Why  "Building Classic Salmon Flies" did the same is a little puzzling  in view of the great advances that have been made in colour printing and  the few colour illustrations that there are in the book are of poor  quality. I learnt absolutely nothing new from this book and in view of Ron  Alcott's reputation I was somewhat disapointed. I would rate this book as a  mildly interesting book for a library on Classic Salmon Flies; but  unnecessary 
 I have thick coarse hair and was looking for something to make it softer.  I Used just a little bit and it was really greasy.  I am currently using Lanza Anti Aging Plant Serum.  It works much better 
 Dennis McDougal has not done his homework on this one.  This book came out too soon, and all the facts were not known at that time 
 This book doesn't deserve any recognition as a piece of literature.  So boring I'm sure there would be more useful purposes for the paper it was written on.   [... 
 When I read a book I expect to learn something I don't already know or at least revisit something I already know from a new perspective or explain it in a uniquely articulate way.  This book fails on all three measures.  Walsh shares no secret insights -- he only discusses his introduction of a number of standard business practices to GE.  This include 6-Sigma, downsizing, A-B-C rating of managers, etc.  -- The usual mix of management science, art and business fad typical in pop management books.  And even the discussions of how these management tools were implemented at GE is filled with extrainious details about the meetings at which these policies were introduced and other non-value added story telling. This only leads me to believe that it was added as filler to get the page count up to the size required for a book.  For all of Jack Welsh's insistence that his business units be 1st or 2nd in a market it is pure hypocrisy for him to be publishing this book.  Your time and money is better spent reading Peter Drucker 
 The magazine is supposed to be for girls 8 and up... it is not. An 8 year old girl does not need to have information on contracting herpes, being sexually active and  kissing. I am dissapointed that society thinks 8 year olds are ready for this material and thinks getting this info from a magazine rather than a parent is appropriate 
 Having been fascinated by this subject since my first visit to Dachau in the 60's I thought this book would be a compilation of the "best and the brightest" but I was very wrong. There are a couple decent sections written by some fairly good academics, but some of them, especially the chapter written by Barbara Green, are just plain ridiculous in their analysis and conclusions. Her conclusion that Stalin's murder of millions of Ukrainians was not "genocide" is just silly. Not only that, her reading list is very incomplete in that it did not include eye witness accounts of how systematic the death sentence of starvation was actually carried out. The chapter by Stannard which compares the settlement of the USA over several centuries in an era long gone with Hitler's attempted extermination of the Jews and Gypsies is ludicrous. While he may make some interesting arguments, he ignores the reality of the cultures existing in the "New World" where human sacrifice was rampant, slavery and war-making were the norm, long before the Europeans showed up. Not a word about that in his analysis. He also equates the massive deaths of Indians by infectious diseases brought to the new world with the deaths in the Nazi concentration camps, which would mean that the AIDS epidemic which started in Africa makes all Africans the biggest perpetrators of genocidal death in the history of mankind according to his logic.  While this book is one of hundreds on the topic, it is not one that is worth the investment of time or money if you are interested in the subject. 
 This book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy. Save your cash and get it from the library. Then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman, not a child taking orders or information without question. If you want to go through pregnancy, labor and birth, and have no say at all or learn anything useful, then stick with this book; i.e., go to the hospital, have an epidural, episiotomy, then finally the c-section that 'must' have been necessary, this is it.   Beyond that, read Ina May Gaskins, Henci Goer, the Sears' books, and "Childbirth Without Fear." Read a broader selection - many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore.  I am a mother of 4; have had healthier, more positive birth experiences than anyone I know. This book is misleading and negative.  Make it the joyful event you deserve 
 I was so excited to find this book after reading Richard Preston's other novel, The Hot Zone. I found this book to be written extremely inconsistently. While reading this book it seems as though Preston is changing from writing to a mature, educated audience to writing for an audience of five year-olds. He takes the time out to describe each new character in a bland way. His descriptions of these people consist solely of their hair and eye colors, stature, and way of speaking. WE DON'T CARE! I wish he had spent more time on the actual story instead of digressing. He also added random sections including one accusing Iraq of harboring weapons grade smallpox without proof. I was thoroughly disappointed in this novel! The only reason why I finished it was because I was too far into it to stop when I realized how much I truly hated it! If you liked The Hot Zone, don't read this, it's awful 
 Frankly, I was disappointed in this book about the late Alice Faye.  I was so thrilled to finally see a biography on her and it really let me down.  Check it out of the library but don't buy it 
 The personality of a Nazi brownshirt was one of a heightened need for acceptance.  Fred Leuchter was painted as such by many people, some who knew him(and I'm guessing knew better) and as we may be witnessing others who didn't.  Brownshirts insult, assault, rather than intellectually confront and expose objections to their popular ideas.  Maybe a major lesson of the Holocaust is that the brownshirt mentality can live in any culture so long as a popular movement of idea is available for them to cling to.  So long as the need for acceptance outweighs the need for a competition of ideas.  There must be someone to hate for the brownshirt to exist, so that they may prove their allegiance to the group.  Maybe a great contribution one can give to their group is sincere dissent, as dissent does not equal disloyalty...except in a Nazi state.    There was a great free press in Germany in Nazi times, so long as that free thought was constrained within the preset boundaries.    "Mr. Death" is not representation of Fred Leuchter.  Fred Leuchter is representation of Fred Leuchter.  Might I suggest NOT suggesting a collection of articles by many of the same people in this documentary.  That's not clarification, that's reinforcement of one idea.  Rather go and find Fred and speak to him.  Get his view.  If you don't have a preformed agenda (like Van Pelt or Morris), you may get him to respond like I did.  I found a different Fred(and a much much different story) than I was given by director Morris and others.  The question is not whether German gas chambers were used to murder people, the question is whether someone will be allowed to think contrary to that, or any other idea.  That is, without having his house firebombed, a concerted effort to ruin him financially take place, have his reputation ruined, or any of the other stuff happen.  If Fred's ordeal is any indication, the brownshirts are alive and well, but I don't think Fred is one of them.  The one fact I would alter in my previous post is Rabbi Bauer's support for "no gas chambers".  Bauer supported Fred's methods, not necessarily his conclusion.  I tried in vain to contact Bauer, on where he differs with Fred.  Fred has high regard for Rabbi Bauer.  The Polish forensic investigation(which came soon after Fred's!) did not come to the same conclusion as Fred, but did essentially duplicate Fred's data collection methods and results.    There was testimony at the Nuremburg trials by both inmates and German staff that homocidal gassings took place in those camps in Germany.  In 1960, physical and chemical tests showed that no gassings occured there.  It took 16 years(1976) for Simon Weisenthal to admit that no gassings took place in those German concentration camps.  A former inmate at Auschwitz has said that no homocidal gassings took place there.  But all this isn't to say that the Auschwitz gassings didn't occur, but rather to simply say that some may think they didn't occur and for that they shouldn't be condemned...unless the idea is to create an enemy out of sincere people like Fred 
 I buy these books to read on the beach or on airplanes, so i am not expecting anything other than an entertaining read. Even with these low standards, I found this book derivative and not even a very good copy at that 
 I only give it 2 stars for the shower scene with the Twins. Really bad acting and plot that makes little sense. Trying to be like the original movie but falls way short. Its just bad acting with stupid and mean characters. Not worth it except for the brief shower scene. 
 This "book" is probably the worst written I've ever encountered. It was so flawed as to be considered literature. Alice Walker tries to "One-up" Harriet Beecher Stowe, in writing about brutality. Titles like these are weapons used in the Anti-Black Male agenda this society has long perpetuated. All the men depicted in this book are one-dimensional characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting. The women are portrayed as martyred, forlorn, pseudo-saints who have been set upon by beasts from hell.   The only persons capable of any sort of humanity are exclusively women. I've learned long ago, when absolutes such as these are presented, a greater agenda is at work. There are no "real" men in this book! Only distorted caricatures of Black masculinity. I only found value in this book as a comprehensive example of sexist misandry at its worst. I find this title as dangerous as Hitler's "Mien Kampf", in it's portrayal of Black men as evil and morally destitute.   Presenting such depictions is both dangerous and irresponsible. True, there are criminally abusive men in every culture. But there are also forthright, upstanding  men as well. To present a depiction of such vehement imbalance and disparity, only serves to distort the readers view of the people being written about.   Harriet Beecher Stowe's fictional "Uncle Tom's Cabin", sparked national outrage and eventually a bloody civil war. This title does no less in further distorting the readers perceptions of Black Men.   This book is fiction. However,it is not presented as such. I'm sure the abusive incidents depicted in this book have been based upon actual incidents. I have no qualm about outrage at such abominations. However, I do have a problem when there are absolutely no upstanding male figures who intervene in such aberrations. That is what I find so unbelievable and offensive about this book.   In my opinion, this novel does nothing to laud the strength of women so much as it demeans and distorts the readers/viewers of the people within it. I don't find it a testament to the strength of Black Women at all. I interpret this book as feminist misandry with two purposes...the further distortion of African-American culture and the deliberate depiction and denigration of the Black Male as being hopelessly inhuman.  I'm sure Alice walker made a lot of money with this book. Feminist, racist extremism seems to have found a niche in literature. I wonder if this novel would have had the same accolades, were it a fictional depiction of White American Men brutalizing White Women. Most definitely not!!! I doubt it would have even found a publisher. America is comfortable reinforcing negative depictions of Black Men and African-American culture.  My life as a Black man is difficult enough living as a testament and example against this sort of racial distortion. Whatever Ms. Walker's motivations were in writing this novel, I'm sure mercenary incentives were not discounted.   This is racist, misandrist propaganda masquerading as literature!        
 I setup the filter yesterday, it was very very loud, trust me, you can't sleep that with in your bedroom. The Filter also doesn't not well with a 29 gallons saltwater tank. 
 I was disappointed with this book.  Yes, it does have lots of reward ideas (I tried counting them but only got to around half of the advertised 1001 ideas).  What really disappointed me, however, was that most of them required a fairly large expenditure.  I work for a small company (under 100 employees) and in a tight economic environment, we just don't have the funds to be sending people to Hawaii or some of the other *big* rewards in this book.  I needed something that recommended inexpensive reward options.  This book was not it.  (I did find another one listed on Amazon that advertises it has "101 ways to reward team members for $20 or less" -- I think that might suit me better.  I'm going to buy that one next and see if it suits my situation any better. 
 "The Day the World Went Away" was the leadoff single from "The Fragile" and is of minimal value to all but collectors.  Two of the tracks on this are taken straight from "The Fragile" (with small adjustments, one's slightly shorter, one has some pointless crowd noise dubbed in), with the third (a remix) also being available on part two of the "We're In This Together" singles.  But looking at the songs themselves-- "The Day The World Went Away" is fantastic-- bleak, moody, with a great loud-soft interplay, a superb almost lacadaisical and very matter-of-fact vocal from Reznor, and a fantastic wordless vocal at the end.  The quiet mix is worthwhile, with a chant at the beginning and a delicate intro before moving the majority of the piece to a piano, in many ways it works better than the album mix, but its a bit overlong.  I'm thinking if the intro was trimmed it would work much better, the subtle reprise of the chant works nicely at the end of the piece.  "Starf***ers, Inc" is a rather popular song amongst fans, but I've always found it to be a bit dull-- the verses are nice enough, with a great beat, and there's some interesting guitar work on the piece, but the chorus is pure schlock and the lyrics are borderline embarassing.  Material aside, unless you're a completionist, you can skip this one 
 I would never read a book with a picture of the author on the cover 
 As many books the beginning of this one is excellent. But as you go over and over it gets boring and boring. The book has four stories that at the end will meet and all of them are stark boring. And at the end... just skip it. Better'd be if you skip this book 
 The world is full of bad books written by amateurs. But why settle for the merely regrettable? High Sierra Climbing is a bad book written by experts. Gripping, squeezing, mashing, bashing, this book will give a man cramps and a woman a prostate. It delivers. Don't fail to miss it if you can. This book will draw readers like a magnet draws hungry flies! 
 I was very unimpressed with this movie. "Borat" suffers from the same delusion as Sarah Silverman in thinking that crass or politically incorrect AUTOMATICALLY equals funny. It does not. Of course sometimes it can be hilarious (and Borat does have moments like that), but overall I did not find this movie particularly funny or even amusing. Especially the scene where the naked friend sits on Borat's face was just disgusting and it dragged on and on and on. At some point I just fast forwarded it. You're not missing much if you don't watch this movie 
 Bad, both as history and as analysis, even the neo-Marxist sort that it unabashedly mimics.  It's an embarrassment that the author has managed to turn this screed into an academic career as an expert on "public diplomacy."  That she has done so offers a lesson on ambitious self-promotion in the academic world.  She purports to tell the story about the former USIA, and ends telling no story at all.  She also misses the essential point about the former USIA: that its work was primarily in the field, people-to-people, and had little to do with politicized Washington policy-makers and attitudes of various administrations.  Her litany of pleas for a sense of the real America of working-class people misses completely the large majority of Americans who are religious and socially conservative, exactly the kind of Americans who resonate well with Africans and Latin Americans, to name two important parts of the world. This isn't surprising for someone who freely cites Marxist Howard Zinn and places his photo on her website.   Ultimately, however, this non-book is just sad.  USIA was a failure in many ways, but the story deserves to be told by a real historian, not a sham professor of "communications" who happened to do an internship in the now-dead USIA.  Now that Snow has set the standard for interns, I'm waiting for Monica Lewinsky's analysis of the presidency.               
 The book is ok.  There are certainly good points.  The characters are extremely underdeveloped, however, and seem to be mere characatures. They could have been a lot better.  The book would definitely be better off as a film.    Fitzhugh also has some serious issues with New York City.  Unless there was a joke I missed, he must HATE it.  He spends 15-20% of the book describing how awful, dirty, and crime-filled it is.  All landlords are scummy, all the subway riders are crazy, or dirty, or "suits."  Cabbies carry guns and will use them, and so does everyone one else.  Even if this were still true, it detracts from the book 
 I wish I never bought this phone!   Like some others mentioned; it was a huge waste. The landline connection works but it is very difficult to hear the other person on the line, sometimes it is very loud, sometimes you can't tell what he/she is saying. The volume controls are difficult to balance. The menus are very badly designed makes you feel like the phone is a kids toy or something. When dialing a number you will be faced with the number being pressed twice or sometimes it wont appear on the screen, this is because of the lousy design of the keypad.  I have hooked it up to my pc and at first it worked and the pc recognized it and it was ok, the second time I unhooked it and then retried connecting it and the pc didnt find it, I unloaded the software reloaded but nothing.  Believe me if you like using the yahoo voice features stick with a set of headsets and mic, if you want to get tacky maybe get some bluetooth gear, but this phone is not worth a cent.  
 I'll start with the positive:  The main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  The story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  In short, it was a competent work of fiction.   That's where my praise ends, because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas.  Sure, it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously, yada yada yada.  But that's not true, is it?  So many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers.  Alright, here are my problems with it:  First, politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state.  In Term Limits, Vince Flynn just beats you over the head with the "power corrupts" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the lips of the Marine Combat Veteran Congressman who is our protagonist.  You know what, though?  There are people in politics on BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE who really want to do what's right, who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for this nation and the citizens.  In this book, however, the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions.  Second, murder is a viable answer.  This repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.  Come on, get real.  This book touts a Special Forces Unit as being so committed to the Constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget.  And, they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on.  Murdering our leaders is the answer according to Vince Flynn.  Murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that being elections.  Elections apparently just get in the way.  Third, the balanced budget.  For years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget.  The book makes it the central theme.  Balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible.  It's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel.  A Coup!!!  Yet, when the conservatives did take power, despite Vince Flynn's prescient forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch.  Even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that NOW!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the percentage of GDP and we ought to all forget about it.  This book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later.  It's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.  Fourth, the good guys don't do bad things.  The Special Ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians.  The bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool.  Flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not?  - CV Ric 
 There is so much wrong with this movie that I don't know where to begin, so let's start with the obvious; why is Keanu Reeves in this movie? Who thinks this robot can deliver any credibility in any movie? Winona Ryder is equally horrid and her role is that much more vital. Her gasping doe-eyed schtick is woefully inadequate to convey the power and allure of the woman Vlad pledges unending blood lust in search of. Furthermore, were there no Brits that could play these two roles or were British accents really necessary at all? If so, why in the name of Bumblebee Man did they have to use these wankers who can't keep one going consistently? Gary Oldman - an actor whose work I usually enjoy - is sadly over the top in a role that cries out for subtlety, especially when you consider how much of a cliche this character has become. His garbled accent and the hokey theatrics make me want to giggle more than stay engaged. In fact, my sixteen year old daughter and I cracked up so many times throughout this that you'd have thought we were watching a comedy...and that's not a compliment. There is just so much to laugh at and mock... On the plus side, I thought Coppola's back story of the romance and all was interesting, but in the end, who cares? It is nearly impossible to immerse yourself in the story because Reeves, Ryder, Oldham, and Hopkins are so wretched that you end up wishing it was a comedy - it works better on that level. If you want a good untraditional vampire movie, go rent The Hunger instead. 
 If I could rate this as less than 1 star I would.  This music is TERRIBLE.  It would sound better if I picked up a guitar and started singing.  And let me tell you, I don't know how to play guitar and I can't carry a tune.  Absolutely terrible 
 I'm surprised that no-one has commented on the overly complicated knitting/purling method used in this book.    The book shows only one way to make a knit/purl stitch, and it's slow and torturous.  You insert the right needle into the stitch as you normally would when knitting or purling, but then you hold the point where the needles intersect, pick up the working yarn with your free hand and wind it around the needle.  Then you pick up both needles again and complete the stitch as usual.  This method would frustrate any child, enough to get them to stop knitting altogether 
 I have been subscribing to US Weekly for about a year and a half. In that time, I have never seen an issue without several pages of Jessica Simpson. I have to wonder; does Jessica donate money to this magazine? She seems to dominate the whole magazine, each and every week.   I won't be renewing my subscription. I'm tired of Jessica and the untruths that US Weekly supplies 
 This Workbood back-fired.  The theory appears sound, but when it came to my wife and me working through the Workbook together, we found a serious trap (surely unintended) by diligently following the instructions, exactly.  Session 7 is entitled "Re-Romanticizing your Relationship I:  Caring Behaviors."  It directs each person to list the behaviors he/she has "always wanted but have never asked for."  The instructions then elaborate by saying the wants may be "your vision of a perfect mate...may be private fantasies or secret desires."  They fail to limit the scope.  There are some behaviors over which a person may have no control such as medication side-effects or physiological depression.  Following the instructions blindly and trusting they allow for and deal with such situations. I honestly included some desires that my mate is unable to provide. These lists were then exchanged. She appeared to accept them at the time, but they actually caused her a great deal of anguish.  So my wife now knows my fantasy wants but she cannot fulfill them even though she would very much like to.  This left her feeling inadequate to the point she gave me an "out" of our relationship of many years.  That is the last thing I would ever want.  As a result, I am quite angry and feeling very guilty.  Looking ahead to the next sessions, not only do they not deal with this type of possibility, but they use these lists to intensify the exercises.  I should have known better.  We threw the books in the trash.  We have  spent a good deal of time overcoming those feelings of hurt and regret.  From the beginning, I have had trouble with the title as, to me, "wants" has its roots in selfishness 
 It's a dumb book whose only purpose is to serve micro-managers in the workplace.  I know because my micro-manager boss loved the book and I knew all he wanted was for me to say how wonderful it was.  He also had a bumper sticker that said something to the effect that if you aren't the lead dog the scenery never changes.  The man changed his mind with the wind and he thought this book gave him justification where there wasn't any 
 Bland, bland, and more bland.  It seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance, and fell far short of the mark.  With the except on the main character's mother, nearly every single character was completely unlikeable.  And a little Lea Delaria goes a long, long way.  It does replicate the 80s very well, but it just feels so devoid of humanity 
 Books like this are clearly designed for distracted or stupid people. Every character is as depthless as an acronym, and the "psychic" dimensions are juvenile. If I want true escapism from reality, I cannot be reminded constantly how hokey and brain-dead the entire thing is. If the Communists burned books like this one, I might join the party 
 I haven't read any of the real Robert Ludlum before, but I don't think I will be starting if this is his style. The action scenes, with their falling chandeliers and mexican shootouts, are perhaps better suited to a 90 minute movie instead of a 400 page book. The weapons-catalogue padding is comical at first, later frustrating. The childishly cliched language is little help in distinguishing the myriad of characters and places. We know only the color of their hair before they are mercifully laid to rest. Perhaps most disturbing is the book's overall 1950's style racism  in which the Americans are dashing, multi-skilled warriors for good and the Russians, Ukrainians, even Germans are all ugly, inhuman or quickly dead. Whilst the premise for the story is promising and the plot is simple but water-tight, the reader is always a step-ahead of the characters. As other reviews have said, suspense and mystery are left absent 
 In each chapter and throughout this book, the author writes whatever comes to her mind and therefore, it is hard to understand where she heads and concludes what.  I don't know in which category this book fits but definitely not in technical anaysis. 
 With the caliber of musicians playing on this album, I expected a hard hitting original. Instead we get re-arranged covers and lots of "filler" salsa. No surprises here. The classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious, you'll play this one once 
 I have to qualify this review by saying that I do not own PM 8.0, so I cannot fairly give a rating, despite overwhelmingly negative reviews. I can only relate personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I do own and have used PM 6.0 since '01 when it was still Powerquest instead of Norton/Symantec and it has worked very well, though the GUI is a bit quirky. I have run it with 2 drives, one with 98SE and XP Pro, with PM loaded on 98SE partition and it did everything I needed on both drives. Trouble is, version 5.0 is, AFAIK, not compatible with XP and since M$ no longer supports 98SE, we have a problem, Houston. Currently I am  using a mobile drive bay to switch drives as needed. If I get a drive partitioning software product compatible with XP, it most assuredly WILL NOT BE ANYTHING PRODUCED BY NORTON/SYMANTEC, based on these reviews and personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I first bought a computer in '98 and used Norton Antivirus 5.0. At that time, Norton was probably the best antivirus product out there. It worked flawlessly and I used and recommended it for years. NO MORE. I purchased a copy of Symantec System Works 2005 right after it was released. Long story short, I no longer use Norton products because I got tired of the system crashes and stability issues caused by the unstable bloatware and system resource hog that it has become, and am currently using a competing product that is very highly rated but is not common on the shelves of the big box stores. There is one lone Symantec product I still use---Windoctor, which is not installed on my 'puter but ran from the CD as needed.  Adios, anything else produced by Norton/Symantec. It ain't worth the headaches when there are much better products available for less coin. 
 Found this novel very trite and the lead character too overblown and shrill. Also as another reviewer said - what is with Jerry Mather's being gay???  I am sure that he is NOT.  Loaded with errors and mis-spellings.  I could not understand why the lead character did not want to be around her family.  Her mother did not seem like a bad person so I did not think that this was developed at all.  This novel could have been alot better and I am not going to read any of her other books.  Too many good southern writers to read instead of reading Ms. Smith's. Read Cathy Holton's novel instead - wonderful southern women's novel 
 I purchased this item and was excited to get them, but burning my first DVDs.. they're all coasters! ARG.. pass Memorex and go for a more expensive media, like Verbatim 
 Generally I like Deaver's novels - and the premise of this one sounded interesting. But he's in over his head this time. Anyone who has spent more than a few hours online can see that the writer doesn't really understand what he's talking about. By the end of the book I was just reading it to finish it - and the end wasn't worth doing that.  If you have to read a Deaver novel, do yourself a favor and go re-read "The Coffin Dancer" instead 
 Not much "hidden" stuff in here.  Most of the places they call hidden, is also written in every other tourist guide.  The only things this book has that the others don't in a more comprehensive guide to local  restaurants.  But as for hiking, beaches, etc.  their suggestions won't be  so hidden because every tourist with any guide will know about them 
 Recently I got into a conversation with the guy next to me on the plane about some of the memorable books we had each read in the past few years.  Unfortunately, I had to recall `Confidence'-easily the worst book I've read in years.  To describe it as disappointing is to go easy on Ms. Kanter.  It is far beyond that, and altogether abominable and embarrassing.  That such a prestigious business school like Harvard can tenure a professor who writes such insipid pablum boggles the mind.  Let's start with the central (and only) idea of the book--that winning begets winning and losing begets losing.  This of course strikes most people as fairly straightforward and unworthy of a book's worth of elaboration.  Yet Ms. Kanter tumbles all over herself to spell out the details: why this is the case (as if someone with an ounce of inferential ability couldn't figure it out in a couple of minutes), how it affects team morale, how it self-perpetuates, etc...  And worst of all, endless, endless, endless examples that do nothing or very little to elucidate; rather, they simply restate what has just been said.  And they restate and restate and restate.  Tautological (I think the word was invented in anticipation of this book), boring, tedious, insipid, stupid, unthoughtful, unenergetic, disengaged, disrespectful.  All these adjectives apply forcefully to the book.  Most of all, though, it is utterly uninventive and cliched.  Turn to any page and you'll find such gems of penetrating insight as (forgive me, but these are so funny I have to quote at length):   "Winning feels good, and good moods are contagious.  Success makes it easier to view events in a positive light, to generate optimism.  It produces energy and promotes morale.  It is easier to aim high and expect to reach the target."  (P. 29)  "Overcoming obstacles, leaping over hurdles, and recovering from fumbles can strengthen a team that has the discipline not to panic under pressure." (P. 71)  "Once the 'loser' label gets slapped on, those suffering losses are set up to fail.  They find it harder to get support, harder to get opportunities." (P. 115)  "Various turnaround tasks operate on different clocks.  Bold strokes are fast and can be done by one powerful person; long marches to change culture and behavior take more time and the commitment of many people.  Execution is play by play, game by game, while strategy is season by season..." (P. 178)  "People embodying the pathologies of the past can always be replaced, but eliminating the bad does not automatically produce the good.  It takes a major effort on the part of leaders to foster confidence that a demoralized company or group is capable of working together and succeeding at it.  Restoring people's (sic) confidence in one another requires four kinds of action..." (P. 241)  "Confidence is an expectation of a positive outcome, but what happens when outcomes are negative?  The dividing line between winning streaks and losing streaks is the choice of behavior in response to setbacks...  That decision to build rather than retreat, to rally rather than get discouraged, involves viewing setbacks through an optimistic lens, as an opportunity to learn and move on." (P. 357)  And it just goes on and on, mercilessly and cluelessly.   The wisest, most incisive business people read, study and think about far more than just sports and business.  I would recommend Ms. Kanter first enroll in a decent freshman-level literature or history seminar.  There she can learn to write and, with some effort on her part and perhaps a bit of luck, to formulate some imaginative approaches to problem-solving.  Beyond this bilge, I have had the good fortune to come across many books that have helped address confidence.  These are: selected essays by Montaigne and Emerson, `Hamlet', Whitman's "Song Of Myself", David Herbert Donald's biography `Lincoln', `Emotional Intelligence', `Flow', and Jack Welch's `Winning'.  `Confidence' inspires confidence only in the realization that you (no matter who you are) are at least intelligent enough to be the "Ernest L. Arbuckle Professor" at Harvard Business School 
 i bought this product several weeks ago. they looked nice but they are extremely sheer. they ripped right away which was very disappointing 
 If you saw the original Broadway cast of Fosse perform, you would realize how sad this video really is. If you want to see real Fosse choreography, rent or buy one of his movies. 
 Unfortunatley, Ms. Ornstein's book is not based on actual research, but rather on pre-established suppositions. The gender climate of a school is best evaluated by looking at two factors - student grades and disciplinary actions.  If male students have lower grades than female students, and/or if more male students are disciplined than female students, then it is clear that the school is anti-boy and is simply not trying to teach male students.  Fortunatley, parents are waking up to this fact, and there have been several lawsuits (most notably in Wisconsin) challenging public schools gender bias against male students.  The so called "gender-fair" class menitoned in this book wasn't - since not as many male as female students received "A's".    This book also does not evaluate issues outside of school.  For example, the best measure of the status of a demographic group is to look at mortality rate.  The fact that male students in all demographic groups have a higher mortality rate than female students is not discussed.  This is particularly important since a major contributing factor to this trend is the fact that adolescent males have a higher suicide rate than adolescent females.  Orenstein also does not discuss this gender gap in arrest rate.  Again, the "health" of a demographic group in school is easy to evaluate - simply look at grades and discipline.  
  After reading the book Medicine Woman and the San Francisco Review of Books on the back which says this is an Autobiographical I have to question a few things.     I come from Manitoba and have lived there over 50 years.  I've never heard of a Crowley and the Cree First Nations in Manitoba that I was raised with would not be seeing a Kokopelli or a Kachina.  It's not part of their culture.  The last and final huge mistake is the fact that most of this story could not have taken place outside without huge huge bottles of mosquitoe repellant as anyone who lives in the bush in Manitoba knows especially those who may have a reason to go naked in the woods.  Perhaps Lynn shouldn't be peddling her strange brand of spiritualism as true when it's not.  There are enough charlatans in the world without one stealing someone's culture and calling it her own for the sake of the almight dollar.    Carol 
 (this review is of the Spyware edition) NIS takes 25Megs of ram - ok for an all-in-one (if you have <256Megs your lightweight CPU can't carry enough armor to make Windows really Zero-day Net safe IMHO)  NIS has most of the features I look for in a firewall/spyware/virus scanner/intrusion detector, BUT  half don't work right, and some that do seem to fight every attempt to make them work.  Even after LiveUpdate this week, One buggy automatic firewall rule autoloaded, and port 80 was open listening half 'naked' on the Internet. I replaced it, and at the first passing probe my rule was erased, autoreplaced, naked again. Only after I stumbled onto the secret trick (add a block all rule after the pass rules) did it close it. It took 11 clicks (!) just to add the block all rule - miserable! The log is a nightmare - pages of long sentences explaining "permitted once" 200 times, no actual info 	until I click on one of them. What's worse is, none of them I checked WERE "permitted once" IIRC.  NIS detected 2 trojan/spywares, but could not remove either.  Enabling program component monitoring started an avalanche of popups, all suggesting I block access, but I actually DO want IE to access the internet.  Running Windows update brought a popup asking if 100's more dll's are ok. How would I know? I do want Windows updated.  Great feature in theory, totally useless even if you know the names of every evil dll not yet invented.  If you have more than 1 or 2 programs not in the automatic ruleset, plan to either "permit all" or spend many hours actually writing the same set of 3 rules over and over for every autoupdating program you use - assuming you understand TCP vs UDP etc. Why no "permit all local + DNS + outbound port 80" choice? That would mean 1/10 the work! Jetico lets me pick "web browser" ruleset, so its UI from Hell gets used once per category.  After spending all day and half the night getting it working, I discover that it is not possible to save my precious rules - or to reload them. I would be less furious if I had a fresh install of windows, but not much.  All good, until a program autoupdates, and 3 more rules to write. Too angry for words. Jetico lets me clone the old rules or edit them to update the program sig.  I would not use NIS if you paid me 10 times its price. 
 A friend of mine gave me this book for my birthday after someone else recommended it to her. We decided to read it with a group of friends, so then we could all see what it was about. Having just finished the book, I can say that I really did not enjoy reading it and had to force myself to finish it. The mix of Spanish and English may appeal to some, but to a non-Spanish speaker, it was more of a hindrance. The plot goes way off the deep end, and before there is any real character or plot development, the reader is suddenly overwhelmed with a major event, just a few pages into the book. Various details included in the story seemed rather useless and excessive, being tossed in and never brought up again, at least not in a major way. For example, the interruption of the plot to discuss the lesbian couple from Oakland was not much than that, just an interruption. The effect of these characters was so subtle that a few of my reading group friends didn't quite understand the reason for its inclusion in the book. In this example, the author seemed to lack the ability to tie it into the overall plot, merely hinting at the ramifications. However, actually bringing these minor details into the book may have been even worse, only because the book would have been longer then! If you're considering reading this "novel", I'd suggest you find a better, more well-written book to spend your time with instead 
 This can opener is complete garbage.  Other reviews have told the story about how this thing does not work. I tried it three times, each time with new batteries, and it grunted to a stop after a millisecond.  Had to battle with the thing all three times, twisting and turning the stupid can opener to free it from its grasp on the side of the can. The seam broke and leaked juice all over the counter.  The "handy" screw to back the can opener up, was of very little use.  You are better off with a cheap electric can opener any time, or a hand crank can opener.  With this device, you might as well throw 20-bucks out on the lawn.  This piece of garbage ended up in the garbage.  Completely worthless.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY 
 I was required to read this book for a class, and I can say without a  doubt that it is the worst book I've ever read. The author just keeps  throwing out various names and babbles on and on about stuff that doesn't  make any sense. Everyone in my class complained about how boring and hard  to follow it was. I promise that you would have a better time reading an  encyclopoedia - I only wish I could give it zero stars 
 Book contains many useful lists / charts / comparisons to define giftedness.  Many helpful hints about raising a gifted child.  Main criticism is that the book is more about raising children in general -- and  may push those with "normal" kids into thinking they have gifted  ones and down that track -- when they should not. Gifted kids are the  exception, not the norm as this book makes it seem 
 This book is more a literary piece rather than a technical book on Kendo.  I've read the book of Five Rings and I'd prefer the original work.  I would reccomend this to those interested in the literature on interpretation of the "Five Rings". 
 This book offers nothing new to any sales person who has read a sales book or two. If this is the first book you have considered reading about sales, it might be worth the price. Otherwise, save your money! You work too hard for it 
 IF YOUR A GARY ALLAN FAN I UNDERSTAND WHY.GARY'S VOICE IS GREAT BUT THE SONGS HE SINGS USUALLY [ARE WEAK].OF ALL HIS ALBUMS THIS IS THE WORST... 
 "The kind of martial arts that I am now learning can kill one million people in a flash! But how? You expect me to tell you  the secrets just because you have paid a few bucks buying my book? You idiot! Come to my class!" This is exactly the message the author wants to convey. Besides, we don't need any more fairy tales for internal martial arts. I met many of the masters mentioned in the book, but their skills is far less mysterious than as described in the book. Don't waste your money, get a book that actually tells you how to train yourself and that gives you a more healthy and less myterious understanding of internal martial arts 
 I had a hard time finishing this book. The characters were all created nicely, but the book bored me, the end was just too bland, nothing shocking, and no resolution for the reader. I won't read any more of his books. 
 I think I've seen almost everything Bob's been involved with and this just didn't do it for me. If you have friends and they aren't complete dullards, you've probably had most of the conversations you'll see in this movie 
 this is a novel which is a good example of how not to write one. it is about a dandy tanhauser who visits the goddess venus and and his exploits in her realm 
 i was very disappointed in the book, and amazed that it won a nebula.  the science fiction aspects are minimal and mainly related to near-future waste management methods. the narrative borrows split-time techniques developed and far better utilized by many others. the story line is obsessed with graphic lesbian encounters. perhaps i was spoiled by having read 3 phillip k dick classics and gene wolfe's masterpiece "the fifth head of cereberus" before this, but this seems like a minor work of limited interest and a short shelf-life. spend your money and time elsewhere. be alerted: several aspects of the book are frankly explicit 
 It is interesting to see all of the gushing reviews of this film.  I found nothing socially relevant, compelling, insightful or even remotely interesting in this film.  The pace is like watching a turtle race and creates a film that IS dull.  There is nothing to like or empathize with in any of the characters.  If your going to waste your time with any of the "Three Colors" films, watch White 
 I am 4 months pregnant and got this book as a gift.  I'm not sure if the person who bought it for me realized what it was about.  As an expectant mom reading stories of the troubles people had conceiving and carrying children, it made me depressed and anxious - what if my child has Down's syndrome, what if it's stillborn, etc.  So, if you have had trouble conceiving, by all means, this book is great support.  I believe people need to "bond" with others who share similar trials and tribulations.  But if you are not, and are easily spooked, I'd suggest picking up something more light-hearted and happy 
 The Rise of the Network Society was on my reading list for school -- and I was looking forward to reading it, not only in the context of my class, but because the subject is an important one, especially regarding the  distribution of information and knowledge in our society.  Unfortunately, I  was soon disappointed to find that Castells, with all his remarkable  insight into the arts of communication, has not been able to go beyond the  oh-so cumbersome turns of phrase typical of academic writing. I find myself  turned off by the lingo, where I am truly interested in the subject; I  resent having to plow my way through his phraseology, while I certainly do  appreciate the research and energy he has invested in his work.  There  seems to be an ideal to academic writing that somewhat opposes the general  trend of having knowledge and information made accessible to everyone. Or  is it that Castells really means to restrict his writing (and being read)  to the groves of Academe? If proving himself versed in the field is more  important than getting the information out there, what does he have to  teach us about the implications of a network society? That we should better  cling to our own in-group, to only those who speak our language, whatever  that is? If that is so, what change can we expect from being related  through networks?  If Castells intends to put into practice his belief that  *observing, analyzing, and theorizing is a way of helping to build a  different, better world* (p. 4), then he might as well start with  generously offering his insights to the world he wants to see changed 
 This book is very detailed and has many well points the help rise the level of your game. It is good to read but it didn't help me when I actually went to the table 
 This is an example of a book written on a very important subject that cannot fill the number of pages the publisher required.  Fraser's previous books on Camera RAW were very good.  This one is labored and has way too many chapters that just repeat the same things over and over again.  You keep hoping that he will get to the really important stuff, but he never really does.  Look this subject up on-line, you will find much better information in a more concise presentation 
 I give this film one star for the acting, which is often very good. However, the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness, and debase every aspect of lower income, urban people. In all honesty, I've seen more joy in an African famine. I sat through this film, against my better judgement. Still, if you're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban American misery and frailty, then I recommend "A Streetcar Named Desire", "KIDS", "Last Exit to Brooklyn", and "Traffic". 
 Overall this series is quite good.  As a former Marine, I've found that the authors do a bang-up job of recalling long-forgotten memories of service and sacrifice.  They've managed to combine snappy action and plotting with well-realized characters.  Characters (such as Charlie Bass) who's fate we deeply care about.  That being said, "A World of Hurt," the tenth and latest in the "Starfist"  series is a distinct disappointment.  After the last two books in the series, "Kingdom's Fury" and "Lazarus Rising," we had the chance to really get to know several of the main characters: Charlie Bass, Lew Conorado, Brigadier Sturgeon, Cpl. Doyle, etc.  They really came alive and of course there was the entire subplot with the supposed death and disappearance of Bass on Kingdom.    This was a major story arc, with the Marines grieving terribly at his "loss."  However, his return from the dead is barely mentioned or explored in this novel.  His promotion to officer status was similarly glossed over.  It would have been quite interesting to have seen the reaction of the Marines to his return, rather than the matter of fact acceptance of his miraculous, "Lazarus" like revival.  Or failing that, I would have enjoyed seeing the internal conflicts that Bass experienced as he assumed his new role of officer rather than enlisted man. They were hinted at in some of the throwaway lines in the book but nothing more. The Bass storyline is but one example of many that could have been fleshed out in this book.    Overall, it seems that the authors simply phoned this one in.  Especially telling is the excruciating detail with which everyday activities are described.  For Heaven's sake!  If readers have been with the Marines of the 34th FIST to this point then they don't need to read the line "fast ride on a rough road" one more time.  Ugh.  Here's hoping that the next installment serves to advance the overall story rather than serving as a placeholder 
 Coltman gives his work credibility by freely admitting two important truths: Castro enjoys the warm support of a majority of the Cuban people, and Guevara and Castro were not at daggers drawn, but remained comrades-in-arms to the very end of Guevara's life. But with every political event and turning-point in the revolution that he describes, Coltman systematically distorts or omits the impact of popular mobilization by the Cuban people. He leaves out the milllions who marched in favour of socialism during the Mariel boat lifts in 1980. He says nothing of the hundreds of thousands who poured into voluntary work brigades during the fight against bureaucracy and stagnation in the late 1980s -- under the leadership of the Cuban Communist Party. He insists on seeing the revolution as the work of one talented megalomaniac, leaving out the facts in order to bolster this view. In 1960, for example, the Cuban delegation to the UN in New York was greeted by enthusiastic crowds in Harlem when Malcolm X arranged for the Cubans to stay at Harlem's Hotel Theresa. The delegation had been subject to politically-motivated and racist harrassment in their Manhattan hotel. Coltman portrays the incident as a shameful foray into the realm of prostitutes and shabby digs. Completely missing the point. As does his whole book 
 This book made me want to 'go viking' - in other words take a long trek away from it!  Why are people always so accepting of the 'fact' that men in early history 'must' have been cruel and stubborn, coarse and violent therefore it's ok for hero's in books to behave so.  I don't actually agree with any of that. Historical fact shows that men, then as now, could be caring, sharing beings who actually liked their wives and kids! William the Conqueror adored his wife as did John of Lancaster his Kathryn and Henry his Eleanor of Aquitaine.   So why did the hero here have to be so unsympathetic and the heroine so accepting of her treatment at his hands - human nature is diverse and being a Viking in the 8/9thC didn't make you any more liable to be a thug than living in the 21stC makes every man a saint does it?  I heartily agree with a lot of the other reviewers that for the author to subscribe to the idea that violent times create violent people and therefore 'Viking' must equate with thuggery is short-sighted and trite and boring to read 
 I bought this book primarily for information regarding accounting and general ledger systems. I read all the great reviews here and thought this would be a great book.  I am very disappointed.  The entire section on accounting is only 40 pages and contains only a cursory overview of accounting systems and structures. They include a CD with the book which is supposed to contain actual SQL data structures but you have to pay them $350.00 to unlock the CD.  Given the depth of the book I would be reluctant to risk paying them that much for simple data structures which you can easily find elsewhere on the web for free.  In all honesty I have not studied this book fully but in my opinion it was a waste of money and I will try to return it to Amazon.  
 This insight into TV journalism is about as interesting as a look into my parent's vacation to Florida. O'Reilly was obviously under the mistaken impression that his life in journalism and the places he traveled to were somehow fascinating enough to make into a work of fiction (or a work of anything, for that matter).  And his main character: Tommy O'Malley (wasn't he one of the Aristocats?) About as dull and dumb as a bag of hammers (which someone ought to whack O'Reilly in the groin with). To sum up in a forthright, no-spin manner: this book sucks. I should have seen it coming, when my bid for eight dollars on Ebay was the only bid for five days, and turned out to be the winning bid (though, "winning" is hardly the term I'd use after listening to this piece of garbage). Since O'Reilly's a fan of torture, he ought to donate this audio CD for use in interrogating prisoners, if the Geneva Convention will allow it 
 This album does have one REALLY good song, which is the opening track, "FREE CITY RHYMES".. it's really excellent. and this album does have good lyrics. the song "Side2Side" is kind of interesting, and the title track is okay to listen to once. But mostly it's just a disc full of half-spoken poetry over uninspired music, which is disappointing. Like everyone said, thankfully MURRAY STREET and NURSE were a LOT better. but definitely check out FREE CITY RHYMES, it's actually good, i promise 
    Bryant was a great coach, but Dunnavant is a Bryant fan, plain and simple.  He tells a sweet and sugary account of Bear's storied life, and leaves out the true tales of Bear's excessive drinking and also of his extra marital adventures. A "fan" should never write a "biography" about his or her hero. I think Bryant was an outstanding coach, but you'll have to look elsewhere if you want any REAL enlightenment about the life and times of Bear Bryant.... 
 I had to buy this movie just to see it because it wasn't released for rent at my local video store. Now I think that I deserve a refund because this movie sucked. I've seen the Bukowski documentary and have noticed that he didn't seem pleased with Hollywood's first attempt at adapting his work to film with Barbet Schroeder's Barfly. But really, I could care less what he thinks even if he is the creator of such entertaining fiction. For me, Barfly may not have acurately grasped the concept that is Hank Chinaski, but it certainly didn't try as hard as the obsequious annoyance that is Factotum.  Imagine, if you will, that you are the shunned kid in school who manages to come up with something so original, poetic and just plain awesome that all the other phony wannabe artists attempt to praise you and capitalize on your invention at the same time. That's basically what Factotum is, an excuse for actors (who are probably the worst examples of human beings in modern culture) to pretend to be real artists and show the viewing public how much smarter and more cultured they are than the rest of us (at least that's what they believe). Avoid this movie like the plague, pick up Barfly instead. The only reason this gets two stars is because... nevermind, I'm changing it back to one 
 The author has been actively involved in networking research for a long time. I bought his book hoping to gain some insight. Instead, I found it quite disappointing. The content is too superficial. I am actually not sure what audience this book is targeting. For me, I am looking for in depth analysis, at the least, it should provide good reference for each topic covered so that I have a starting point if I want to go to detail. For a person looking for basic understanding, this book also tries to go to too much detail, for example, on how each protocol works. I think he is just trying to fill the pages. I did not proof read it on purpose, but at least one reference (I happen to be familiar with it) is totally wrong. The paper is talking about routing prefix expansion, but he quoted them totally wrong 
 I watched the first half hour of this and couldn't get through it. I dislike Michael Moore as much as anybody, but the fellow that put this piece together needs to go back to film school. It's an amateurish, whining documentary made more for spite (and those 15 minutes we all want) than anything else. Getting called down by Michael Moore at a public event and then talking to some sympathetic people outside (people who probably just had nothing better to do on campus that night) doesn't prove that Michael Moore followers are all waffling malcontents, dude. Overall, I rate this film FAIL 
    This story was seriously depressing, and was in no way a book that I would call enjoyable. 
 When I first played this game, I got bored in 10 minutes.All you do is shoot and kill people for nothing, have the police chase you and you shoot them, Bring girls into your car and do it with them. I dont recommend this game at all its overrated 
 ANOTHER HYPROCRITICAL NUT. THESE CHRISTIAN FUNDAMENTALISTS LIKE  ARE LITERALLY SCREAMING JESUS,WHILE CUTTING YOUR THROATS, NOT UNLIKE THE JIHADI FUNDAMENTALISTS. THE ONLY THING IS THEY CANT DO THAT NOW  AS  THEY USED TO COUPLE OF HUNDRED YEARS BACK BY ENSLAVING AND LYNCHING BLACKS,KILLING NATIVE AMERICANS,AND SHOWING THEIR CHRISTIAN LOVE FOR THE JEWS- BY EXTERMINATING THEM. HOPE OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS DONT HAVE TO LIVE IN A CHRISTIAN SAUDI ARABIA. THIS IS WHAT THESE WHACKOS ENVISION 
 This book was very, very informative.  However, it was also very dry.  This book was assigned to me, for summer reading, and as a book, it fails.  As a collection of facts, it is very well done.  If i had been writing a paper, or doing a project on the Minutemen, this would definately be one of my sources.  But, like I said, just to read, this book is not my first choice.  I read it, and took notes, and i still have trouble remembering most of the knowledge contained within "Minutemen and their World. 
 Overpriced! Not what I expected! You can't really used it because it's too small for big bellied pregnant women! Uncomfortable! The velcro gets in the way of sleeping comfy. YUCk 
 I'd always heard about Modest Mouse but never bothered to give them a listen.  Then when they blew up with that horrible Float On song I gave them a chance.  Yes, I started with what was probably at the time their most commercial album, but I went from there, worked my way backwards.  "Good news" was so stale and lifeless that it made me, as the listener, feel as if I had been wrapped up in bandages for the past 3,000 years.  But I gave them a fair chance, and I listened to "The Moon..." and that too was absolutely shallow; Isaac Brock is one of the worst song writers in the whole faux-indie semi-Wire/Pixies cover band genre.  So, with the new album it's no shock that they're continuing to raise the level of sucktitude.  The single is, oh my how fantastic, a dance-y rock song; just like Panic at the Disco, and Clap Your Hands, and, well, basically every other trendy band who is a staple in every "hip and intellectual" college girl's music collection; you know the one, she loves the smiths but only has the Greatest Hits Vol. 2 cd 
 I had this book for a college class and it is terrible. I found it to be very, very vague on it's topics and just barely skims the surface. The diagrams are drawings, and they are not very good for the representation. If you want to learn about equine science, this is not the book 
 No wonder Stephen King did not want this to be released. This movie is stupid. The original did not need a sequel at all. We all expected better, considering this was made by Mary Mambert, who made the original Pet Sematary. This is crap, so do not buy it 
 The story of this book sounded really promising and funny: Young woman moves to big city, works in retail, gets a bunch of mail addressed to the prior tenant and lies herself into a whole different identity.  Unfortunately the way it was worked out was nothing else but disappointing.  Without any warning, or any kind of explanation, the main character moved back to her hometown only to return to the big city and getting back with her ex-boyfriend within a few pages. It would have been nice to get some more insights and just some kind of how did she get there explanation. What ever happened to a gradual story development?  All in a sudden she has her own store and lives happily ever after with the guy who thought she was someone else. How exactly did that happen? I feel I could have written this book better than this author.  I like light and breezy novels, but that doesn't mean that they have to do completely dump and unrealistic. 
 Even though the show is on a downfall, hoping to end soon, the cover looks vaguelly familiar. Oh, yes. It looks like Friends. Not only is one of the worst shows trying to look like one of the best shows, it doesn't help to copy artwork from the cover of a friends season DVD set 
 I'm not criticizing the VHS/DVD; I haven't yet seen it.  What bugs me is the fact that I was ready to order an Iron Chef video, but not until Checkout did Amazon.com bother to add the phrase "with William Shatner" to the product description, which gave me sufficient pause to hit the "back" button and read these reviews.  Now I realize it's NOT the original Japanese TV series.  Is this a case of your Marketing Department once again overcoming honesty and forthrightness?  You're really no different from any other snake oil salemen, are you 
 I was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character. This is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book, and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it, said parent would have no clue as it sure isn't mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book.  I usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading, but this time this particular book slipped under my radar.  She told me that it had a reference to a gay character, which I took to mean just a passing reference, but when I read the book, it was treated more seriously than I thought, even going so far as to have the two girls kiss.  It is inexcusable, both on Ms Pierce's part and on Scholastic's.  No matter what the author's personal beliefs, it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents. I believe that as a parent, I'm the one responsible for what my children see and do, but it sure helps to have some type of information so I can make an informed decision.  Anise Hollingshea 
  The thesis of this book is that the 9-11-01 terrorist attacks wouldn't have happened if it weren't for Bill Clinton's mistakes. That is incorrect. The 9-11-01 terrorist attacks wouldn't have happened if it weren't for G.W. Bush's mistakes. 9-11 could have easily been prevented. The CIA and the FBI were giving Bush thorough warnings about how Bin Laden was a potential threat to the U.S. and the White House had documents that plainly stated "Bin Laden determined to attack in the U.S." Bush was on vacation the whole time that he could've been looking into that. Instead, he decided he would rather be out golfing and fishing than preventing an assault on American soil. Condoleeza Rice, the then national security advisor, now Secretary of State, committed perjury at the 9-11 Commission by saying under oath that the documents said that Bin Laden was not determined to attack in the U.S. When in fact the documents said the exact opposite.   I do not recommend this book.    
 If I didn't know any better, I'd swear this was a book written by a Satanist. The author seems to be rejoicing in the prospect of armageddon, including mountains being blown up and the destruction of all the world's cities. I bought a tatty copy for one penny and I was somewhat surprised to see that by 1973 it was on its 27th printing. It seems reasonable then to assume that Mr Lindsey's views are fairly representative of mainstream America.   If that's the case then that suggests that plenty of Americans are keen for armageddon to erupt in the Middle East so that the "good Christians" may be whisked off for a private audience with J. Christ while the rest of the population burns.   I would recommend this book to all Israelis. In his book The Last Days of Israel, Zionist author Barry Chamish declared that Israel's main enemies were European Socialists. Well, I reckon that Hal Lindsey and his fans present a greater threat. It seems likely that if the supposed Temple of Solomon is not rebuilt and Israel isn't annihilated then a lot of committed Christians are going to be most upset. The bit of "good news" in Lindsey's book is that the surviving Israelis will convert to Christianity with such passion that they will be like "144,000 Billy Grahames".   It seems that committed Christians are in charge of both the UK and US governments and that the US government could be described as a theocracy. I wonder if the theocrats share the views of Mr Lindsey, who states in this book that each Arab generation hates Israel more than the one before, which would be good news as it would mean that they would be more likely to attack and initiate armageddon and cause the return of Jesus Christ.  Russia is portrayed as the villain of the book, but "Red China" and the "Red Chinese" get a look-in in a chapter entitled "The Yellow Peril".   The book however does contain one true statement, on page 120: "Religion is a great blinder of the minds of men." and frankly, I hope "the rapture" does happen soon. The sooner that people like Hal Lindsey are whisked off the face of the Earth, the greater the likelihood for peace in the world 
 If you are an expert in XPath then this book might be worth having.  But if you only have a general knowledge of XPath this book is basically useless.  The author clearly has a solid knowledge of his topic.  But the ability to communicate it in a practical way is sorely lacking 
 This book was drudgery to get through. It has got to be the worse thing I ever read. The only thing it stimulated was my gag reflex. If people see this book as some great work of art filled with profound truth then   we are all in trouble. I have never posted a book review here but I felt compelled to warn others to SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME. I only read it because it was chosen by my book club. 
 As much as it looked promising as a family film for the entire family,  I was very disappointed in how this film turned out.  There was hardly a storyline and the storyline that it did have didn't give the information to the audience on what made the "evil" evil.  How do we know that the good guys wheren't actually the bad guys casted in good light.  It was small things like that that made this film a poor excuse of a Disney film.  
 in my 20s don't feel like setting up an account. anyway, i used this as they said, but i guess it spilled out of the tray and onto my lips... it burned so bad that my lip is now blistered and swollen. it looks like i got collogen. and it hurts like hell. i recommend sticking with the strips... and now i'm just hoping that my lips don't fall off cuz white teeth are nice and all, but i'm not trying to show them off THAT much... 
 This one will be brief. The movie is an excuse for young actors to use the "F" word and demonstrate that cannot act. The characters are cheap rip-offs of the original, which is to say one-dimensional. American Pie presents Band Camp certainly does not flesh them out. One final note: Eugene Levy- How much cash had to be thrown at your to take this one on 
 I bought the Japanese 2-Disc edition from Amazon's Japanese site.  The only thing that is in Japanese only are the kiddy games everthing else is in English with removable JPN subtitles.  The JPN edition is NTSC and region 2.  If you only have a region 1 DVD player try to find a copy of the old Tarzan Collectors 2-disc edition release 
 This CD is strictly for ardent admirers of Reba who will buy anything she puts out no matter the quality.  Well be forewarned, this CD as evidenced by the reviews here is one of Reba's worst efforts.  Someone get me some Excedrin Migraine tablets please.  I'm still nauseous after listening to "One Honest Heart".  
 the book starts off great, talking about his child hood and his parents then it gets to his teen age years.i believed everything untill he met courtney,it started getting rediculous,like saying he started her on heroin ... but the worst was the second to last chapter when cross TRIES to depict what it was like when kurt acctually killed himself, he has so many details tht no one but a person who was there would know.... great book to read if u like all the details of kurts childhood but dont believe it all!!!                 WARNING- VERY PROFAINE BOOK, NOT GREAT TO READ WITH YOUR PARENTS AROUN 
 This book is probably a better read in the paper version.  Sandra Burr's male voices are somewhat shrill and detract from the story.  Not my favorite narrator.  Susan Ericsen's reading of Coulter's The Maze was better. 
 I agree with reviewer Carol C. "ccjello" (Kansas City, MO USA) who noted the authors comments re: 'It is filled with simplistic filler -- like lists of types of men & descriptions of each. For example, the "Jock" has "great sexual stamina" and "likes a screamer in bed." The "Nerd" "will go with you to flea markets" and has "kinky Star Trek fantasies", but, the author cautions, "don't bother with a Nerd if sex is vitally important to you". The author advises that take up sailing if you're looking for "Republicans and politically conservative men"; take up rock climbing if you like "high achievers" who are "always reaching for the top." Scuba divers are "deep"; runners "go the distance in relationships." You get the idea -- stereotypes abound'.  which is so odd since I was married close to four decades (am a widow) to a nerd who had more stamina than any 'jock' I dated before I married.  Perhaps dating isn't what the book is about, but more along the lines of how to find a man who will be a pal and sex buddy.  It obviously isn't for the serious man or woman who wants to develop a long relationship or marriage 
 I have always been a loyal and devoted fan of Goldy and her cast of close knit friends and relatives, but "Chopping Spree," was a book I had to stop reading after the first 50 pages. I found it lacking considerably from her other books.  Arch turns into a demon of sorts, while his mother is trying to get hold of her caffeine/chocolate habit and .....where is poor Tom?  I expected him to ask for a divorce in this book, because he always seems there for Goldy, but she is never there for him in any way, except as people who share the same house.  I found Marla ...who I had dearly loved in the other books,....to be an annoying snob,...not in character for her.  Mott-Davidson focuses too much on her ex-husband in her books. I am beginning to think she might do with some psychiatric help that she should have gotten in the beginning. Enough is enough.  The "Jerk" is in jail.  Her relationship with her present husband Tom needs to be more fine tuned.  Sometimes you forget she is even married, but then someone has to nurse her back to health when she gets hit in the head, etc.  Poor Tom.  I don't think I will read anymore of her books until I can see some positive reviews....more 5 stars.  I just looked at the reviews on her latest book and they were worse than this one. Maybe there is a time a writer should stop for a while and step back and re-evaluate her story character.  Diane? 
 Reading this book (until chapter six, where the book picks up somewhat), I thought to myself, "Why does my teacher hate me so? Does he find interest in learning about someone getting a bad headache from lack of coffee (which takes up an entire chapter)?" This book offers a different look at the Civil War. A boring one. Written 100 years after the Civil War ended (1968), this book set the precedent of "don't write about the Civil War if you aren't going to talk about battles, because it's boring." Read something interesting with your ever-disappearing life 
 I read a book by Donald Goines about a raped woman and the whole time I was reading it, I was thinking "Why in the world would someone write a book like this?" As much as I love all of Flake's other books, that's the exact same thing I was thinking about this book. The book started off very interesting about how one brother deals with another brother's death, and it reminded me of a cousin which gave me good and bad memories. But then the book launched off into this twisted relationship between the living brother and his father. This book deeply disturbed me during the camping "results" and after that it just became so off-the-wall.  I started questioning my donations to homeless people and who really needs it.  I can't say the book was bad...it just wasn't for me...and definitely an extreme difference from the other books that I've read by Flake 
 If you want to do the same exercise over and over.. but with better make up and cuter outfit go ahead.  If you want better exercises and articles look to Oxygen or Women's M& 
 Like a previous review said this book was very poorly written for the quality of author Mr. Byers is. I was looking forward to this book for quite some time and I have to say I'm very disappointed. The plot was fine but the tone of the story was so....lackluster I guess... that I couldn't stay interested in it for more than a few sentences. I must say that I am a die hard Forgotten Realms fan and that's the only thing that enabled me to finish this book. The very talented Richard Lee Byers usually does superb work but this one was left wanting. Frankly, the characters sucked, the tone of the story and the way it was told sucked and it really could have been told better.  I put this on par with those horribly written excuses for literature that come from the Eberron line. This is the first Forgotten Realms book that has left me really disappointed in quite a few years (since the Pools of Darkness line). As much as I love the realms I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone and that kind of makes me sad because I've recommended the realms to hundreds of readers who've instantly fallen in love 
 Nothing innovative or exciting. Anyone who does not know this stuff should not be in business or in a leadership positio 
 The real headache began when I attempted to "activate" the program.  I spent hours trying to activate it, to no avail.  I got messages saying that the serial number was invalid and a host of other problems.  Now, I would just like to get my money back.  I have used ScanSoft's stuff in the past and have been pleased with it, but, for whatever reason, OmniPage 15 has become, for me, an expensive nightmare.  After having spent many hours trying to activate it, I still have not succeeded.  Their support leaves a lot to be desired.  For one thing, they keep "bankers hours" so don't expect to get any help on the weekend or after hours 
 Ok, I don't mean to be rude, but if you think this is great writing you are woefully uneducated. It is almost a sad confirmation of the common stereotype of fundamentalist Christians being uneducated yokels that so many of them think this is great writing. Here's my take: I'd enjoy a good "end of times" story - this just isn't it. The Left Behind series is amateurish and poorly written and just plain astonishing to me that it has had such huge success. P.T. Barnum once said that no one ever went broke understimating the intelligence of the American public and this series proves it. Christians should demand better writing from their revered authors. Go read some C.S. Lewis or something - please. 
 	In Heresy, Magic, and Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe, Gary K. Waite attempts to tie together the various persecutions that took place in Early Modern Europe.  Whether persecution was aimed against Christian heretics, witches, or Jews, its purpose was always the same: reinforcing current orthodoxy against growing doubt.  Thus, Waite claims that the more pluralistic the society, the less fringe groups were persecuted. 	This book is flawed.  Waite argues his thesis tendentiously, citing portions of scholarship on Early Modern Europe that support his claims and ignoring scholarship that would question them.  The book is a brief synthesis of other scholars' works, and Waite's contribution consists of mere assertions that lack supporting evidence.  Waite does not engage the sources of Early Modern Europe; instead he trusts others to do the work of research for him.  When he quotes a primary source, his citation is always from some secondary literature.  This form of "researching" may be fine for a survey of the historiography, but Waite is attempting to argue a thesis. 	Not only is his methodology wanting, but also his thesis is much too simplistic.  Waite argues as societies become more pluralistic, persecution of the "Other" lessens.  He cites example after example of how the reigning orthodoxy persecuted the "Other" in order to strengthen its position in society.  Places like the Netherlands and Maria Theresa's Austria, however, did not persecute irrationally because of tolerance for a multiplicity of ideas.  This formulation is inadequate.  Waite fails to grapple with the religious situation in Spain in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  Spain was the most ethnically and religiously diverse region in Europe, and its variegated population managed a high level of cooperation for centuries.  Instead of peaceful toleration, however, this region led to some of the most intense persecution of the "Other." 	Waite's explanation of the Jewish situation in Early Modern Europe also has many problems.  He asserts, "Jews ... were officially tolerated in the Christian west because they proved an extremely useful, if unwitting, ally in the campaign to expel religious doubt from the hearts of Christian believers" (19).  As a causal claim, this statement is ludicrous.  Waite implies a conspiracy by the Church to use Jews to quench Christian doubt.  The evidence does not support this assertion.  (His reasons for the persecution of women during the witch-hunts similarly lack evidentiary substantiation.) 	Not only are Waite's methods and assertions suspect, but he lacks a fundamental understanding of the subject that he is trying to address.  In the book's introduction, Waite writes, "Religion is always nonrational, for its tenets cannot be proven by empirical testing" (3).  This statement belies a misunderstanding of rationalism, religion, or both.  As a system of knowledge, rationalism is not dependent on evidence or empirical testing.  Rationalism relies on human reason.  Just as religion cannot be empirically tested, neither can mathematics.  Rationalism and empiricism are competing systems of knowledge.  Waite's conflation of the two demonstrates a positivist bent, and positivism is self-referentially absurd.  Thus, Waite founds his philosophical approach to this subject upon a defective meta-narrative, and readers should be skeptical of his claims 
 interesting story line but shallow and goes nowhere.  kubrick style drawn out and paced shots are unimaginative, poorly composed, and add little or nothing to the experience.  looks like the ending is just a contrivance to exit a lost story line. i've lived in rural japan and it's the most boring place on earth (perhaps the intent here but hardly something you'd pay money to suffer thru or for masochists only), you dont think the younger generations flee to the cities for no reason at all 
 First, I'd like to tell the authors that after reading this book,  each of you owe me a few hours of my time which disappeared, worthlessly, from my life.  What starts out as a great idea - a gaggle of writers each crafting a chapter of a novel - quickly crashes into a confusing, poorly played game of "telephone."   You know "telephone" - the kids' game where one whispers something to the person next to him or her and the words circle the room, ending in an incomprehensible string of gibberish?  Naked Came the Manatee is a hobo stew of styles, with each writer leading us through silly plot moves and adding their own characters.  While reading each of these authors might be fun, their collective sum only reveals a bookfull of defective parts 
 I'm having a hard time understanding who would pay money for this downgrade?  You'll wish you had the "XP Upgrade" as soon as you do it.  It's just baffling that they would charge this much for such an awful product 
 This movie is not offensive- at least not in the way the producers want it to be.  Most of us have an "anything goes" attitude towards entertainment these days, and accordingly, broadcasting something as "OFFENSIVE!" has just become a tired combination of marketing device and transparent attempt to appear a First Amendment champion.  Continued use of profanity and bathroom humor isn't all that funny if you're older than 13- it's initially kind of amusing, then puerile, then pathetic.  Comics tend to be attention-starved anyway, and therefore take any joke further and longer than you or I would care to see.  Case in point: The Aristocrats.    That aside, I wanted to like this movie.  I loved the premise, that telling a joke is like jazz, in that plenty of artists repeat the same material, but with their own interpretation.  It's the singer (comedian) that resonates, not the song (joke).  However, this film is a one trick pony that long outlives its clever foundation.  I also had a hard time believing that these guys found the joke all that funny themselves; most of the onscreen laughs were due to the chemistry between these old friends, and the audience isn't really a part of the joke a lot of the time.   The film's novelties provide the most entertaining moments: Kevin Pollack's Christopher Walken imitation, Billy the Mime, Taylor Negron's gay rendition, and a magician who tells the joke via a card trick.  George Carlin was really the only comic who made me laugh with his version of a strict telling of the joke.  On top of everything else, I found the jarring, MTV-style editing and quick camera switches made The Aristocrats even tougher to watch.     While we're on the subject, is there anyone worse than Bob Saget?  He can swear as much as he wants, and he's still every bit as annoying and unfunny as when he hosted America's Funniest Videos.  Impossibly, he's even less funny when profane.  
 I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I.  Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship.  And the writing isn't so hot, either.  If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad.  The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort 
 Even a supporter of Bush will see no purpose for it. Non-supporters will see it for what it is - pure propaganda.  Just one of so many books that represent a waste of good trees.       
 This book was recommended to me by a highly respected professional in the field. Though the material in Rogers' book appears provocative, I got "tired and toxic" reading it.  I highly respect alternative approaches toward health, yet a lot of the information in this book is not only dated but can be found on the internet for free!  After reading the 1st and 2nd chapters I  forced myself to read the succeeding pages to the point that I just had to get rid of it.  This book is a waist of time and money and trees and ink to print it.  Don't Bother 
 I wanted to see this film in theaters. I am a Cronen fan. I admit. I wasn't really a huge fan on Viggo Mortensen. I never read the book, but somehow I was drawn to this film, indirectly.  So, I wait for the DVD. Which isn't such a bad DVD as it is a film. Firstly, there are no surprises. Any surprises this movie could possibly have in store for us was revealed in either the trailer, the DVD cover, or the DVD ad. Viggo's performance as a whole, wasn't too shabby. Ed Harris was obviously the one man shining through this dark and boring movie. So in this small, secluded town Tom Stall aka 'Joey, turns out to save some lives and becomes a hero. Although, it turns out Tom Stall wasn't much of a hero as he was a villain. That's about it. The movie drags it ending around like a dogs rear on the carpet.  The sex scenes felt out of place more than anything. I couldn't stress that enough. I'm going to be blunt. They are too random. They are in bad taste. They are uncomfortable. They are very much disliked by me, personally.  And finally, the ending. The ending was probably the most empty finish I've ever witnessed. Tom Stall goes after his brother, takes care of him, drives back, and Sits down for a nice meal with the family. Three words. Fade to black.  I give this movie 2 out of 5 stars. For two reasons. Some of the action scenes were interesting, and Ed Harris. I would not recommend this film 
 Sadly, this thrilling sea-yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today.  Between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the unfathomable dialects, it can take ages to puzzle out a page.  Some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner "We're Here," which has picked up over-privileged Harvey Cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner, I could not grasp the point or moral of.  My husband has read all the Patrick O'Brian series, so I asked him to puzzle out a representative story, that of Counahan the Navigator, and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood, he said, "Honey, I see what you mean."   One can get the general gist, but it's best to read through fast, then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense.    	For example, when educated Harvey says, "Why can't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?" his pal Dan answers, "Allus can, till we begin to dress daown.  Efter thet, the heads and offals, 'u'd scare the fish to Fundy.  Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows.  Guess we'll run aout aour trawl to-night.  Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?"  	I got my B.A. in English, and I would rather tackle Joyce's "Ulysses" than an unannotated version of this book.   	So why did I bother?  A few days ago, a friend showed us the DVD of the 1937 movie, starring Spencer Tracy and Lionel Barrymore, on his big screen home theater, and it was thrilling and very moving.  The movie is quite different from the book, though, but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how Kipling crafted the story, as it did for me.  But dear teachers, PLEASE, do not subject students to this particular title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are willing to turn them off classic literature forever!  (Let them read "Cannery Row" instead!)  
 This book is about Dave's late high school years, while he was in the foster care system.  This book talks about some friends that have helped him through some tough times.  I thought this book would talk more about his experiences and feelings about the foster care system, which we were initially led to believe.  But the book turned out to be more of a "guy" book, talking about his adventures and mishaps with his friends.  This might be interesting to teenage boys, but for a broader audience, this book didn't seem as interesting.  The experiences in foster care didn't really seem to come through as much.  The book seemed to ramble on and on about certain points and seemed to go off in a tangent at times.  As a result, the book became a little boring.  I also didn't care for some of the foul language in the book, which to me, often detracts from the point that the book is trying to get across.  About the review from the lady from New Zealand...it was not necessary to single me out in your review.  The point of these reviews is to review the book, not the reviewers.    Secondly, I did not like the book.  Plain and simple.  That is OK.  Not every book jives with everybody.  I don't feel that people who are grateful for the simple pleasures in life are boring.  I said that the book itself was boring and to me, it seemed to lose focus.  You do not have to agree with me, as I don't agree with you.  I am free to express my opinions on these books.  And yes, I read "Lost Boy", but the book initially led me to believe that it would have more in it about the foster care time period in Dave's life.  You see, I was in 3 foster homes as a kid, and to me, reading about foster care experiences from other people is always interesting to me.  So please, just focus your reviews on the books, not on the reviewers.  I had a legitimate opinion on the book and I expressed it.  I'm sure I'll lose helpful votes on what I've just said to "Gingerwoman", but it's important that we focus on reviewing books and not each other 
 I liked Terry McMillan's "The Interruption of Everything", so I was really looking forward to reading this book- but it was one of the worst, most frustrating books I've ever read. First of all, the writing is on about a sixth-grade level. Example: "...Charles asked me if I wanted to dance. I said yes. So we danced. He danced like a man who was sure of himself. He watched me. I watched him. He smiled at me. I smiled at him." That's when I rolled my eyes and gave up. Unfortunately it was on page 365!! From then on I scanned the rest of the pages, just to satisfy my curiosity about what would happen to the rest of these characters. Secondly, most of the characters are complete morons, except for Gloria, who seemed real to me. (Working mom, single, trying to do the best for her son...) The other three jump into bed with EVERY man they meet, usually within the first three hours of meeting him. Then they whine and moan about how there are no good men out there. Well, DUH!!! Perhaps this is the point of the book, self-fufilling prophecy. I do like the title. It describes that feeling of waiting while what you want (husband, job, baby, etc.) hasn't happened yet. But this book was a disappointing waste of time. 
 When I first heard about this book, I rushed to find it on Amazon and added it to my wish list.  I patiently awaited it's release and was very happy to receive my copy.  After savoring it for a day or so I sat down and began to read it.  My wife, who does not understand, but accepts, my addiction to fantasy sports, thought I would finish the book in a day or two.  After watching me read a few pages and put it down and then read a few more pages and put it down again, she asked why I hadn't finished already.  "To be honest," I said "it's just missing something and I can't seem to get into it."  Maybe it was the exhaustingly long email threads that attempted to hold chapters together or the never ending use of unrelated lists that seemd to do nothing more than fill space, but this book just didn't do it for me.  To be fair, I think I may have been comparing it too heavily to "Committed, Confessions of a Fantasy Football Junkie." by Mark St. Amant.  In my opinion, that book (released in 2004) truly captured the enjoyment, humor and obsession that I've experienced in so many fantasy football leagues.  "Why Fantasy Football Matters..." simply does not compare to that superior effort.  The book did make me laugh from time to time and a few passages did remind me of the leagues in which I participate.  I do not feel, however, that I can recommend it.  If you want to read an extremely well written tale that captures the humor and blinding obsession that surrounds fantasy football, pass by this title and grab a copy of "Committed..."  I've already started to reread it myself.   
 I love reading journals whether fictional or not. The problem with Moore's One Last Look is that it is chock full of terms and phrases, colloquialisms and innuendos from 1838 India.  I wasn't there so I don't know what half the characters are talking about.  What a shame!  Moore would have served her readers well with a glossary and/or better explanation of what the heck she's trying to say.  Indeed, as Anne Tyler quipped "Moore is in possession of her own unique voice."  And in her possession her voice will remain 
 I'll be honest, the last three novels have me thinking that Patricia Cornwell has sold off the franchise of her name- the "voice" the writer uses bears no similarity to her other novels, and its very frustrating. Leaves a dedicated reader feeling like she'd been attacked by the pod people or something!  I hold firm to the idea that she hasn't been writing these novels. There is just no way 
 This book is out of date- just look at some of the pictures- and not a good book for a novice cockatiel owner keeping one bird as a companion.  I suppose it is a good book for breeding, but I only want a pet.  Many of the much thinner books on cockatiels available in pet stores have superior and more up to date material 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 I've had the opportunity to watch the movie Stealth over the past week.  It was on TV here. Otherwise, I don't think I would have watched it.  My instincts would have been correct.  An action technothriller, Stealth has a predictable plot. A new elite team of 3 good-looking pilots gets a new wingman on their first mission in the field: an artificially intelligent stealth aircraft which picks up the bad habits of the 3 pilots, including a disrespect for authority. Mayhem ensues. People die. The leaqd pilot develops a relationship with the artificial intelligence, and they work together to save the female pilot, who's gone down in North Korea.  The plot, direction, and acting combine together to produce performances from the 3 leads (Josh Lucas, Jessica Biel, Jamie Foxx) that are about as wooden as their electronic counterpart.  I'm sure that people went to see this because of the 3 beautiful leads, and came away disappointed. Me? I was expecting little, so I guess my expectations were met.  Though I will say I was amused by the last line 
 1. The author advises the use of templates for process consulting.  This is not a new idea in IT.  Templates are used both in production and process.  Templates of all sizes and shapes are used in writing code, IT project management process, spreadsheet templates for calculations etc.  It is mature to an extent where templates are generated without much hoo-ha and contributed for reuse.  2. The book, in an attempt to be overarching, is stretching itself in early stages where it reviews the economy of the world and the industries in 1 broad stroke.  3. The idea of using templates for consulting is not new and is already being practiced in all nooks and corners 
 This book has some great information but when I read it I felt it was geared towards Protestants.  Most of the materials and books recommended in here are secular or Protestant.  I don't recommend this book at all.  It  will truly confuse you about teaching in a Catholic home and make you feel  as though it's okay to teach with Protestant materials.  Read Mary Kay  Clarks book before buying this one.  You won't be disappointed 
 It's always discouraging when self-professed Christians lie, and Dembski purposefully perpetuates a lie in order to further his ID claims.  The lie is that evolution by natural selection is "random."  Most famous is the analogy of a hurricane sweeping through a junkyard and creating a jumbo jet.  That's so ridiculously impossible that evolution must be impossible, too.  Right?  But only the genetic mutations underlying evolution are random.  And being random, most of them are in fact terrible failures, frequently causing the fetus carrying them to spontaneously abort.    Only those mutations that do not harm the carrier can be passed on to future generations.  That is a non-random selection process.  In general, only those mutations that actively benefit the carrier are likely to spread throughout the population.  That is a non-random selection process, too. (That's a bit simplified, but the general point holds--even harmful mutations that spread do so non-randomly.)  Dembski's claim that all non-randomness is evidence of design fails the simplest test of logic.  So his goal of mathematically proving design by finding complexity is a red herring.  His implicit claim that evolution by natural selection is randomness in action is a flat-out lie.    Don't be fooled by the ID claims of scientific oppression.  Dembski's work is unscientific not because he believes in God (many scientists believe in God and get published), but because it tries to prove the unprovable.  Karl Popper pointed out decades ago that you can't prove a negative.  Evolutionary biologists don't claim they have proven the non-existence of God because they understand Popper's principle.  But Dembski believes he can prove that evolution didn't cause something--he never actually tries to prove God, he only tries to prove something else didn't happen, then sticks God in place as the only explanation.  That is bad logic, bad science, and even bad theology 
 I picked up the 2006 edition and since I always plan parts of my trips abroad by selecting nice accomodations in an area of interest, I turned to the pages at the beginning on "Best Boutique Hotels and Small Lodges," "Best B&Bs" and "Best Luxury Accomodations) on pp. 12-15.  "Luxury" apparently is Bill Gates or Warren Buffet luxury to Frommer, with rates around US $1,500 per night and some up to $7,000.  I had to check to find whether these might be weekly rates, but they are PER NIGHT.  Many of the B&Bs were US $300-$500/night, and none under around $150.  Most of the boutique hotles were US $500-$700/night.  We are fairly affluent travelers, but these prices were so discouraging we wondered whether we even ought to be considering a trip to New Zealand.  We don't pay such prices in the USA.  Fortunately, prices elsewhere are not nearly so high,  I just wish Frommer's could define "best" in a way that is more like "best value 
 Full marks to Mondo Macabro for the DVD presentation: uncut widescreen transfer, director commentary, interviews, stills gallery and more. That said, THE KILLER MUST KILL AGAIN is an uninspired giallo, with a weak script and hamfisted direction. While the premise has possibilities, the execution is fumbled in almost every scene. The characters are neither sympathetic nor interesting, rendering their fates unimportant. The killer is played by Jean-Michel Antoine, who had memorable roles in A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE, MY NAME IS NOBODY, THE WIND AND THE LION and THE BEYOND. Despite his striking appearance, Antoine is disappointing here, even allowing for the mediocre dubbing. Established as a homicidal sex maniac in the first scene, his character is barely developed, becoming less interesting as the film progresses. The 'twist' ending is, frankly, feeble. While director Luigi Cozzi comes across as an interesting guy, with a genuine love of cinema, this is not reflected in THE KILLER MUST KILL AGAIN. Mario Bava and Dario Argento bring both flair and passion to their best giallo films. Cozzi can barely manage technical competence. 
 My boyfriend's son committed suicide this past year. We grieve and look for answers. There are none to be found here.You will grieve for Stephen whose mom did little to help him while he was alive.What's more disturbing is this woman's overarching sense of achievement. Although her son is dead, they  "communicate and have written this book together". This  woman did not attend a single teacher's meeting, nor engage any medical help, but somehow she's has won some kind of "afterlife jackpot". Hard stuff to swallow for those of us who fought more valiantly, lost a battle against clinical depression and miss our loved one dearly. Shame on Simon and Schuster for publishing this drivel 
 Heinlein is a great author.  When he sits back and tells a story, he's one of the best.  Glory Road and Citizen of the Galaxy are wonderful, and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress should be on the shelf of any science fiction fan.  This, however, is an awful book.  It's not merely one of Heinlein's worst.  It's one of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read.  The problem isn't that there's no action, although there isn't.  The problem is that there isn't anything of substance to replace it.  There's lots of sex, but not in enough detail to be titilating.  There isn't a love story either; you can't have romance or sexual tension when your characters will sleep with anyone and everyone for any reason.  The book just rambles aimlessly until it ends.  Maybe Heinlein was trying for an examination of gender roles and sexual identity, but if so he failed miserably.  The characters in this book aren't just from a different culture; they aren't people at all.  They're too flat.  If you want to think about such things, ponder them on your own or read a different book.  I suggest Left Hand Of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin.  I Will Fear No Evil reads like an old man's rambling personal fantasies.  Someone must like it, but I can't recommend it even to the most devoted Heinlein fans.  If you're tempted, do yourself a favor and re-read Stranger In A Strange Land instead 
 It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was "glued to it" or "thought it was a real page-turner" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a "cookie-cutter" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the "horror genre", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama. However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind "Insomnia" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking "oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?" THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable "generic" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very "generic" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product. Some examples of King's finest work would be "The Talisman", "Night Shift"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The "Dark Tower" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few. And if you have not read any of "The Bachman books" (King as Bachman) "Rage", "The Long Walk", Road Work", and "The Running Man", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.  This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.       
 Yes, actually I do. To warn potential readers from reading the most crappy book in the face of the Earth. Gerald betraying his adored Ellen? Mammy betraying her most loved mistress? Ashley being gay? (Since when is dereaming gayness? And didn't he love Melanie?) Melanie killing a slave out of anger? (This offended me the most, because I have always loved Melanie) Rhett prefering this lame loser wannabe to Scarlett?  It's an insult to GWTW.An insult to Margaret Mitchell. An insult to the south.  Just because some plantations had mullattos doesn't mean everyone had to.  If you have read GWTW, don't let this horrible, disgusting object cheat you out of your time, or your love for one of the most beautiful books of American literature 
 Seriously?  When I saw Melvins in Detroit with Tomahawk in 2003, they KILLED.  After a couple of inadvertent headbutts in the pit and losing the shirt I bought at the show, I decided I had to get every Melvins album!  So after reading a few of the reviews of this album I ordered it from Amazon.  I love all the pre-major label Melvins albums, especially Lysol, and they've been one of the few bands to stay interesting and relevant throughout 20+ years.  This album is neither interesting or relevant.  Noise for 80% of the duration before a guitar is picked up or a drum heard!  I love noise records, but this one's just boring.  It's not all crap though.  From the about 35 minute mark on things get mildly interesting, and then we have a nice version of Eye Flys to close the "set".  I can take a joke, but somehow I can't help but feel that I'm the punchline.  One star because they're Melvins, and one star for Eye Flys.  Melvins have so many albums and almost all of them are gold!  Make this the last one you get 
 The case needs to be a little deeper and it could use a handle to make it easier to carry.  Not worth the price I paid 
 Inane, useless information from a speaker so boring I could hardly get through the 3 CD's (but felt like I had to since I had spent the money on them).   Perhaps he is a great salesperson-but I cannot see it.  I bought this on the strength of the reviews and am now convinced they were his friends or family stuffing the ballot box.  I think this information was aimed at someone in grade school, not a professional sales person.  
 I was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood.  Given that the cost is about 10% of the cost of the lens for which it was intended (the 70-300 IS in this case) I expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate.   -Positives- fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare, etc.  The bayonet locking system is excellent, much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods.  that's about it.  -Negatives- The polycarbonate is so thin I half expect it to be translucent.  The hood must be gripped by the base to remove it, as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it; or at least it feels like it may break it.  Its very long.  Especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens, this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long.  That's pretty conspicuous.  It's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ($50 vs. $5-10 for rubber or metal).   I traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood.  2 stars for the great bayonet design, but the rest of it is weak 
 Bought this movie because it rated 4 on average from other amazon customers and because I generally enjoy Will Smith's movies. While there are some funny moments I found the plot unconvincing and the characters (very) two dimensional. Obviously this is meant to be a romantic comedy and I wasn't expecting any depth but this was supremely shallow. Hitch the date doctor supports inept men in finding their dream partner, all the while he himself has not recovered from a traumatic college romance, so guess what, he has commitment issues. Enter attractive journalist, who funnily enough also has commitment issues behaves in a totally neurotic fashion is incapable of adult conversation and because she has issues exposes Hitch as the date doctor in newsprint, using the time honoured phrase, people deserve the truth, come on.........it's not politics. Despite her behaving like a jilted teenager Hitch discovers his deep love for her, and you can't help thinking that you yourself would be running a mile in his place.  I sat there wondering whether it would get better and waiting for it to end, if you want romantic comedy you could do better with something like guess who, meet the fockers, prime, or even the "old classics" you've got mail or return to me. But give this one a miss 
 After reading a couple of other reviews about the "quality" of transfer on this dvd, I decided I wanted this in my collection. What I THOUGHT would be good or atleast a decent enough picture quiality, I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED.THE QUALITY OF TRANSFER OF THE PICTURE IS HORRIBLE!!! A great movie a total real diaster flick in picture quality. Non anamorphic, deffintaly not remastered or digitally transfered. Picture tones are very, very bad, along with what little color that is desplayed. Almost a black & white picture with most of the entire movie too dark to make out what is going on. Even with my brightness turn all the way up on my tv, it still was so dark it almost wasn't worth continue watching.The ONLY things positive on this dvd was the fact it was in widescreen and "suppossedly" in Dolby Digital EX. The beginning Dolby intoduction was deffinatly in Dolby and had good sound but the movie itself didn't distributeand Dolby sounds that I could make out on my theatre sound system. Sounded like mono to me.Thsi dvd reproduction stinks and I suggest those that are into quality dvd and getting you money worth saty away from this "Goodtimes Video" version untill it is put on dvd correctly. Why they botherd is beyond me. Because I wanted to have a copy of this movie in widescreen, I am taping it on to VHS for my collection and going to try and return it for something better tommorrow. I suppsoe I'll have to be content that I got the widscreen version on VHS for now untill they re-release it on dvd with better quality, or they show it on tv in widescreen which I highly doubt. Heck, even TAPING IT OFF TV YOU'D GET A BETTER PICTURE QUALITY THAN THIS DVD 
 As another reviewer states the original had 150 color plates this version has only 8 in mine. The visual phenomena are so complex that without the plates you can't possibly accurately understand what the book is talking about. Sure you could make you own examples, but if you did, you would NOT be sure, given the complex examples, that you understood what the author was talking about. Instead you will have a false understanding or incomplete understanding that will make you look foolish. The publisher is cashing in on the author's previous great work without really republishing it. This is the lowest I've ever rated a book 
 Having worked in the mental health community for sometime, I was already familiar with this technique and have been using it already.  I felt the book was really droll and somewhat condescending in tone.  I wouldn't purchase it again.  His companion book "Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed to Do and What to Do about It" is a more practical read and enjoyable too--I would recommend that one 
 After 40 minutes of objective viewing, and shot after superfluous shot, I sat through another 30 minutes in pain. I've come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either Peter Jackson can ONLY do epics wheather it calls for it or not, or LOTR in all it's incarnations had immense levels of supervision for Jacksons from higher-ups. Kong is not an epic, it is a tragedy. Tell me to watch the whole thing, if you will, but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in, I don't need to. On another note. Jurassic park had better CGI than this. Mr. jackson, no more 'epic fly-by shots please. 
 Well I finally got around to reading this one.  No surprises.  It didn't explain anything new, answer any questions, or really fill in any gaps.  At least not to me.  But, that may be because it has been years since I read the first book in this series.  If the author is going to write, prequels or sequels, that's fine, but finish the story that was started a decade and a half ago.  There are thousands of storylines which can be developed into thousands of books just from the sheer scope of this series.  But, after over 15 years and about 8,000 pages later, I'm beginning to wonder if the Wheel is going to turn, ages pass, and the series come to a conclusion before the author dies.  I also doubt whether there are going to be any readers left to buy any of those off shoots after being burnt out on waiting ad infinitum for an end to this story 
 Do not by this product. It has several issues. Go to the forums on the Linksys website and see for yourself. Most people, myself included, have problems with the cable modem crashing and requiring a reset on a regular basis. This device also has firewall issues that cause problems with the Wii and Xbox360. It's SPI firewall component is at fault and can not be disabled without turning off the entire firewall. Even in the face of the number of users having problems Linksys has never released a firmware update and it doesn't appear that they will 
 ... but that doesn't mean I'm not.  I've gone through two of these, which I purchased in order to make yogurt.  This is kind of a dicey procedure, you have to heat it enough to kill bad bacteria but not scald the milk, then keep it in a fairly narrow temperature rnge for several hours. This thermometer punked out after a few uses, giving wildly inaccurate and delayed reading which resulted in wasted efforts and money.  
 Although these are rated for use in an oven up to 500 degrees, mine cracked the first time I used them in an oven (which was only set to 375 degrees).  They are pretty thin (not much thicker or heavier than dinner plates, really), so don't inspire a lot of confidence when you hold them.  So really they should get zero stars.  But if you don't plan to use them in the oven, but just as serving dishes they would be cute 
 This is a fairly helpful book for those born before the '70s-- a time when "a yarn" wasn't an archaic term. Does it give some helpful hints?  Sure, there's the obvious ones like show don't tell and all characters have free will. But fiction has changed a lot since Henry James (thankfully), and this book might be better left unread. Plus, I don't buy the "only people who aren't well-read don't like it" argument. I've read nearly all the books mentioned and I still wish I never bought this book 
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 Uh, I'm not sure I agree a hundred percent with your detective work, there, Greil.   If he truly wanted to present and comprehensive view of what his subtitle purports, that is, American myths archetypes and how they inform and are presented by Rock and Roll, why is the scope of this book so narrow? The artists he focuses on are a motley crew. Elvis, Robert Johnson sure- but Randy Newman? The Band, but not Dylan? Harmonica Frank, but no Chuck Berry? Berry's oeuvre itself is a perfect microcosm of 20th century American Mythos. Speaking of myth, why is Pilgram's Progress invoked as a metaphor for The Band, but Faust isn't referenced at all in the Robert Johnson chapter. America is nothing if not Faustian. This book is 40 percent Rock-Geek trivia, and 60 percent pure ponderous speculation. Marcus occasionally drifts into a fugue and wanders far away from his (musical) subject, several times in the Elvis section whereupon he suddenly remembers what he was supposed to be writing about and tries vainly to shoehorn all of his speculations together. I think Marcus is a fine writer (we would not entertain his notions for a second if he wasn't), and this book certainly has its moments, but on the whole it does not nearly live up to its hype. He has done better, in The Old, Weird America, dealing with the same themes and sticking to one musical subject (Dylan's Basement Tapes). 
 This is a polished proposal for the invasion of Iraq. It was highly praised in 2002. In retrospect, it was a bit too candid:   "Assembling a coalition would be infinitely easier if the United States could point to a smoking gun with Iraqi fingerprints on it -- some new Iraqi outrage that would serve to galvanize international opinion and create a pretext for invasion. Saddam's pursuit of nuclear weapons is the real reason for invading, but because estimates vary widely on how long it will take for Iraq to do so, and because some countries simply assert Iraq is not doing so and dismiss all of the evidence to the contrary, that may not appear to be an imminent enough threat to justify the march to war, especially for those countries (such as France, Russia, and Turkey) which do not want to see Saddam overthrown."   No doubt Feith and Wumser in the Office of Special Plans took this to heart ("Within a very short period of time, they began to find links that nobody else had previously understood or recorded in a useful way" - Richard Perle, PBS Frontline Oct 2003). Niger yellowcake, Al Qaeda ties, aluminum tubes, unmanned drones, mobile bio-labs, plagiarized studies, and "smoking gun in the form of mushroom cloud" followed. All were needed to create "outrage" to sell invasion.   The lies are now blissfully forgotten, and felonious collaborator Chalibi firmly controls the Oil Ministry. Most countries failed to buy the sales pitch (maybe they didn't want to see international law overthrown: they were right about the threat).   Is this important? Reinhard Heydrich was tasked to provide an incident on the German-Polish border to justify invasion in 1939. His `attack' on a Gleiwitz radio station (`Operation Himmler') murdered KZ prisoners in Polish uniforms to provide a `smoking gun.'   This book, and the invasion it helped engender, became illegal when it's claims (WMD, etc) failed to materialize post invasion. It can not, and should not, so easily be excused as `faulty intelligence.' It was then (and remains) an invitation to aggressive war.   "Any resort to war - to any kind of war - is a resort to means that are inherently criminal. War inevitably is a course of killings, assaults, deprivations of liberty, and destruction of property. An honestly defensive war is, of course, legal, and saves those conducting it from criminality. But inherently criminal acts cannot be defended by showing that those who committed them were engaged in a war, when war itself is illegal." -Justice Robert H. Jackson; Nï¿½remberg 1945.   The author is worth reading (I enjoyed this book in 2002, but wasn't convinced). His proposition was then (given the inspections option), and is now, as illegal as crimes prosecuted at Nï¿½remberg. He has since has moved on to targeting Iran.   Meanwhile, American firms feast on Iraqi oil and no-bid reconstruction. Four years after 9/11, Osama bin Laden, Ayman al Zawahiri, and Mullah Omar remain at large 
 Gets a star for pointing out that writing is scary, but has nothing to offer in terms of advice beyond "do it anyway, risk-taking is good."  So now we need a writer oriented book on risk-taking, I guess 
 I was so disappointed in this book.  The author was so negative that the book was one great big downer.  After the misery of making it through this book, it became clear that it was written by someone who just doesn't get the whole disney thing.  I returned the book and purchased birnbaums and fodors guides which are about 100% better and written in a positive manner.  My husband and I have been to disney world and disneyland many times over the years and are planning our first trip with our children.  No one who feels that the majority of the theme parks are too "hokey" for them, has any business writing a guide for others 
 This book was just ok.  I found it to be a bit boring. Not a very good moral to the story, the children just do the same thing back to their parents so what did they learn 
 Although this book contains 27 house plans, in my opinion only a very small percentage of these are innovative enough to warrant publishing. The most exciting being the design by Earth Rammed Works which could have  easily taken over the whole book and I wished it had.! Some of the designs  used new  energy saving materials such as photovoltaics, but these were not  given explanation space and left the reader feeling quite frustrated 
 This was the most painful work of fiction I have ever had the displeasure to read. 
 These three guys are amazing musicians in their own right but this album just doesn't work. From a theory and technical standpoint it's very good (some would say brillant). If you have a background in music theory you'll probably like it a lot. There is plenty of meat to chew on when it comes to breaking down the music and understanding what they are doing.   But if you have listened to The Police, Phish and Primus and you are just a big music fan then this is probably a very hard listen. It sounds like a car wreak of those three band's music and there really is nothing new. Trey's guitar work sounds like the work he did with Phish; Stewart's drums are just like The Police (more of the old Police stuff); Clay's bass is right from any Primus song. It sounds like what they did was take those aspects of their styles that would sort of fit together and just laid it out on this album. That's fine, but it's just hard not to think of Phish, The Police and Primus while listening to it.   The highlight of the album IMO, is Army's on Ecstasy. It opens up kind of slow and strange then picks up in a really nice jam frenzy for Trey's solo. That sort section of the ablum works really well together. For that section, it sounds like something outside the relm of Phish, Primus and The Police. 
 I've used CAD programs written in the 80's that are better than this.   I'll go back to Drawing Board 1.0 over this thing.  Not user friendly.   I can hardly draw a few walls without it crashing.  JUN 
 This novel relies too much on far fetched ideas and coincidences.  I thought it was boring 
 Complete waste of money!  I bought this for my 5yr old daugther and there is no way possible for her to program it!  After several frustrating attempts we finally get it programed.  Now the darn thing does not respond to her answers.  Even when I clearly repeat the answer in her ear she does not seem to register.  Complete waste of Money!!!!  Would not recommend to anyone!  Save your money and play with a rock, much more fun 
 I consider myself a Diana Krall fan...and I'm a huge Elvis Costello fan - somehow I was hoping that this union would produce some incredible music...a merging of their styles...maybe some terrific covers... I don't know - something exciting, fun, inspired.  Instead I must say I find this cd pretty boring - where was Elvis? Who picked the song selection? I was hoping for so much more! 
 This book was utterly boring. It is a cutesy attempt at satire, only the entire time, I kept thinking, "Edith Wharton did it better." The problem with Lewis's version of what a satire is is that satire is supposed to be subtle; outright criticism of the characters and lifestyles is almost insulting to the reader's intellect.  The other issue I have with Babbitt is its long-winding lead-up, unsatisfying climax, and disappointing denouement. The plot took too long to manifest itself, and this was largely due to Lewis's incisions of "clever" critique into the narrative.   As a short story, this novel would've worked out brilliantly. However, spanning three hundred pages as it is, it's a long, drab waste of time 
 BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK IN ITS CATEGORY 
 They don't look as nice as the photo, they look rather cheesy. Retraction mechanism works reasonably well if you're careful with it. Sound quality is average. I'm keeping mine as a backup set only 
 This book lacks technical details. This book talks too much about planning and management.  I would rather have a book with more step by step instructions on how to accomplish different tasks. This book talks more what Exchange can do and less on how to do it 
 Rubbish. There is no such thing as Zionism as represented in this book. There is no global, centralized political body of any Jewish anything, and there never was. Israel is not run by "Zionists". The original socialist Zionists died out decades ago. It was merely a movement to establish statehood for a few people who were admittedly, communist. It had nothing to do with world power or money and the religious world and vast majority of Jews were against it. There are a few religious "Zionists" but that is completely different. They are a minority and have no real power or desire to do anything other than to live in Israel 
 I couldn't read this book.  I skimmed it, but I couldn't read it.  It was disjointed and disappointing.  I don't think it adequately portrayed the situation.  Also, I don't mind reading religious material, but I like to know it's religious material before I buy it.  
 Better than Bloodlines, but still not that great.  Poor character development, and the fact that Conant has a tendancy to ramble make this book less than what it could have been.  I'm also getting rather irritated with the author's constant free advertising plugs for Eukanuba, Iams, and some other major brand names in the pet industry.  Are we reading an novel, or an informational brochure by Iams?  Is she getting paid to do this, or does she really believe that Eukanuba is the best dog food on the market?  (If she does, she's very ignorant on the subject of dog foods.)  I don't like my novels to tell me how I should be training or what I should be feeding.  I probably will not ever purchase any books written by Conant again 
 This is a piece of garbage. The balls deflate after a couple hours. The rim is so frail it won't hold up to much. My friend came over and yelled slam dunk threateningly at my hoop at which point I got in between them and the hoop and said this hoop was not for slam dunking. They correctly pointed out that it says "Slam Dunk Challenge" right on the back board. Don't do it - it will break. When I turned it on it kept score wrong and gave points for misses. So that function is worthless. The only reason I gave it two stars is that it looks kind of cool but will have to find a nerf ball. 
 If you're looking for a book that was mostly written by someone other than Kendra, has information about housing markets that is outdated, and overall seems like a free seminar at a cheap hotel, then this book is for you.  
 Tim Robbins plays a man who thinks he's discovered his wife having an affair with his boss. He meets up with Martin Lawrence when Lawrence trie to car jack him. They end up working as a team to rob Robbins' boss. Then they find out his wife isn't having an affair after all and he has to try to fix things. This is an amiable enough movie but has no real laugh out loud scenes and Lawrence plays the same mugging boob he always plays and his act gets old fast 
 A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.  It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite 
 I have read Webber's book for a class, and I generally was not impressed. His arguments for returning to the Ancient church (he defines from 100-600AD) I don't think hold up.  He thinks that the Ancient church is the solution to post-modernism, and he seems to naively present that period, as if it did not have any problems. But we know that it was full of debates on theology.  Can we also go back to the Ancient church? Even though some people call this period post-modern, we have not given up all the attributes of modern thinking. We are still highly critical thinkers. I am starting to think that hyper-modern is a better name for this period.   Webber is more interested in the practices after the NT was written, than he is about thinking about the church as it is described in the NT. Yes the church in Acts and the Epistles was in flux trying to find it's way, but wouldn't Paul be more better to read and thought about, than the people and structures after the apostles? What ever happened to confidence in scripture? Surely it is more trustworthy than the Ancient church 
 I've read tons of information and have researched into Jaqueline Kennedy Onassis' life and found Anderson's book to be almost fiction at times.  He starts the book in a dialogue format and continues to use dialogue throughout the BIOGRAPHY.  I found myself asking, "How does he know the exact words that Jack and Jackie said to each other when they were in private".  The book is narrated many times and it just didn't seem to be authentic.  It was a good story, however and it would be nice if the book was 100% accurate.  I just like to know that when I'm reading a biography, I'm reading Non-fiction...not FICTION 
 This book's concept and outline are excellent. Its bibliography shows that it was well researched, so there is no excuse why it was so poorly written. Besides this being a dissertation of the author's personal feelings and political views, there are two words that describe this work: weak and immature 
  I have seen quite a few productions of COMPANY including the original on Broadway. Unfortunately, this one doesn't come close to hitting the mark. In fact, it's way off. If the director were trying, once again, to be innovative by imposing his concept for SWEENY TODD onto COMPANY it doesn't work. ANOTHER HUNDRED PEOPLE is perhaps a good example how this fails. Were the singer and the musicians really together? I heard not. It's a tough song and this singer couldn't keep up. Who could be better than Beth Howland anyway (grin). And unless my CD player is failing, a lot of the times the singers sounded quite flat.  What surprises me the most is that Sondheim would sanction this. And the weird thing for me is that I enjoyed SWEENY TODD, directed by the same John Doyle.   
 These slippers are typical of Daniel Green products, beautiful, comfortable and affordable. Thank 
 my sister got this cd for christmas of '05, and i pray for the day that she stops playing it 24 hrs straight. I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the "boy band" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost 
 I don't know if I got the same book than the other reviewers but our impressions about it are quite different. In my opinion drawings are not very clear and instructions get confusing with all this counterclock, reverse 90?, etc.  It is not that drawings are a bad thing, I have seen other books with illustrations that are actually easier to follow than photos but that is not the case of this book. Could be used in order to remind movements that you already know but forget about learning a new form from this book 
 Hatsumi is right up there with scientology.  Complete fabrication that people can't wait to pay for.  Not one useful piece of information is this book 
 This antiquated textbook is still used at colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The first edition of this book was published in 1955 and, after nine more editions, appears largely unchanged in its mentality.  Specifically, the textbook is written for a time when corporations had legions of industrial engineers who did nothing but detailed and tedious time and motion studies.  Unfortunately, today's dynamic manufacturing environment renders many of the authors' techniques impractical or even financially hazardous.  For example, it emphasizes the need to maximize machine utilization (even if the machine is not considered a bottleneck operation).  Practices like these lead to excessive inventory and sub-optimization of the collective manufacturing process.  In summary, I believe this textbook does a great disservice to those manufacturing firms that have achieved dramatic productivity gains through the application of lean manufacturing techniques 
 I am so disappointed in this cutting board.  The first one I got, looked like it had been gouged and used.  I got a replacement easily enough, but this one cracked all the way down the middle the first time I used it and washed it.  I hand washed with a mild soap and water immediately after I used it and even rubbed it with mineral oil.  When I took it out to use again, I discovered it had a crack in it.  Very disappointing and what a waste of my Christmas gift certificate.  Don't buy this, it is junk 
 A century ago, a man named Grant Allen wrote a book called "The evolution of the idea of God." G.K.Chesterton reviewed it by noting, "It would have been more interesting if God had written about the evolution of the idea of Grant Allen." Armstrong's book is fascinating at times, but two things hindered the story.  First, she limits herself to the history of purely human ideas and ideologies, or from a Christian perspective, a history of idolatry. The book is like looking at the moon under the assumption that the light you see is native to that sphere. Second, Armstrong ignores all evidence that God may be more than merely an idea, may be a person who acts in history. (Such as the universe itself, prophets, and miracles.)  One aspect of that evidence of which most people are unaware, and that relates to the theme of this book, is the fact that monotheism is not solely a "western" concept. One finds an awareness of the Creator even in countries where all institutional and pedagogical institutions have been hostile to Him for hundreds of years, and native religions appear to have no use for him, such as Japan. This is as the Bible predicts: Paul said that in our hearts, we know God is and that we are not Him, but suppress that knowledge. The history of organized religion, east and west, is largely a history of men and women running from God. Armstrong's book is in a sense a well-written and gosippy history of that flight.  I suggest four books which give an aspect of the "history of God" Armstrong and her fellows routinely ignore: how the God of the Bible reveals Himself to non-Christian cultures. The first is Chesterton's Everlasting Man. The second is Eternity in Their Hearts, by Don Richardson, one of the most interesting books on religion published this century. The third is a book I wrote after reading Richardson's theories, and finding out that they ring true: Jesus and the Religions of Man, especially the chapter "The Non History of God," an in-depth response to this book. I also recommend the book God wrote on the evolution of the idea of Karen Armstrong, especially the first chapters of Romans 
 I returned both that I ordered because the playmat was not included in the item as advertised. I am very unhappy with the item's advertising 
 If you like neurotic self-involved women who never know how to gain control of their lives, this book is for you.  If not, just pass this by. I know she won all kinds of awards from her other books, but this is full of whining and self-pitty. In fact it feels so thin it feels like the notes she took for the article she wrote for a magazine. I couldn't even get past the first section and I'm a huge reader 
 Sheila Foster bit of from another book called C by Disection, she cant think for herself. She is too tough, but not though in the way you respect someone but rather insanely tough that makes you wonder what the purpose of all this is anyways. I currently have her in a class which is CECS 174, and she is totaly hard and difficult to understand. When she talks for a while she starts to get lazy and starts to slur her words. Don't be decieved by FALSE reviews, unless your a super school nerd you WONT like it. I hate her class, she should take a chill pill damn hyped up woman 
 This book was smaller than a post-it note.  I was very disappointed when I received this lilliputian sized thing.  I (obviously) could not use this book during reading time for my students.  I recommend that "odd" book sizes be disclosed in the description/condition. This was a waste of my money! 
 I admire Nancy Campbell's attempts to counter the present-day view of children as burdens.  It is a tragedy that people sometimes view pregnancy as an evil, or that children are not treated as central in marriage.  I also admire her for pointing out the potentially abortificient nature of some common methods of birth control, including the Pill. This is information which should be available to all Christians.  However, the means she uses to argue against birth control are not always logical or scripturally sound. She takes individual Bible verses out of context at times. Overall, she has an unfortunate pattern of ignoring the cultural context of the Bible: she tries to map the cultural ways of ancient Hebrew culture onto the Church without seeming to realize that the Church, though it is the People of God, is not the SAME KIND of "people" that the nation of Israel was.  To give one prime example: the Hebrews were a hereditary group, and the nation increased primarily through new births. Christianity is not hereditary, however, at least not in so direct a way. Not only do not all children of believers grow up to be Christians, but Christians may come from other sources (evangelism, conversions). Thus, the Church is not dependant on procreation for its increase to the same degree that the nation of Israel was.  This is only one example: elsewhere she talks about economics and lineage as if these issues played out in the twenty-first century in the same way they did in Israel. They do not, of course: in the past, children were an economic gift to a family, not a burden, because they could earn money.  Would Campbell really argue that we should all put our children to work at an early age so that we reap the same economic benefits?  There are other problems with the books' use of Biblical texts, as well. Some texts get repeated multiple times to bear out different points, thus creating a repetitive effect that becomes annoying. Other texts are dropped into the page without any explanation of how they prove the point they are supposed to prove. Sometimes this is due to only a lack of adequate exposition; other times it may be due to her trying to put too much "weight" on a single verse.   Finally, I have to agree with previous posters that Campbell does not really prove that contraception is immoral. All she manages to prove is that children are supposed to be viewed as one of the primary fruits of marriage.  As I said before, this is a worthy goal and I applaud her for it, but given the kinds of arguments she makes, it might have been better if she had stayed with that point 
 Blood and gore never help a story. They ruin it. Too ba 
 ONCE A BOOK BECOMES A BESTSELLER, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FIND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THAT BOOK. THIS BOOK MAYBE A BESTSELLER BUT I DON'T THINK A NON-PHYSICIST WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE AUTHOR. UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO EXERT ONESELF MENTALLY TO A GREAT EXTENT, ONE SHOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ THIS BOOK. ONE OF MY FRIENDS, WHO IS A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I AM A PHARMACIST AND EVENTHOUGH I LEARNT A FEW SURPRISING THINGS FROM THIS BOOK HERE AND THERE, I WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND UNTIMATELY HAD TO LEAVE IT ONLY HALF-READ. 
 I thought it would be really cool to be part of a society that wore red hats in public.  Being part of a club where one could identify another club member because they are wearing a certain item of clothes while in public, fascinates me.  But then I started reading the book.  I found the characters non-believable.  The rules of the club, do overs and make overs were just too restrictive.  Life is not about squashing dialogue with your friends because you are too uncomfortable or too polite to say what is on your mind.  The scene about catching Harold in the act truly stretched my imagination.  The amounts of money thrown around boggled my mind.  And the ending?  It reminded me of the last episode of Seventh Heaven 
 I'm embarassed that I read this all the way through. The language/expletives passing for literature and dialogue were an early turnoff. I don't live with people who talk like that, and I don't understand the purpose: "sophistication"? To my mind, the characters were not enhanced nor the plot forwarded by the way the book was loaded with @%#&*s.  
 I found myself listening for 30 seconds to each song and then skipping it.  It's nothing new.  It's not that it's a bad CD, it's just not very good.  The songs are a little more fast paced and "pop-ish."  Overall, the CD is a departure from her typical style.  I felt kind of like I had put 50 cents in the soda machine for a Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper came out instead.  
 I know I'll take heat for this, but this albumn is not the Son Volt that many of us fans fell in love with.  I don't want to get into a whole thing about how music has to evolve and constantly change and how Farrar can't just stick to his old sound.  My point is that I loved those first three albumns, and that this one doesn't belong in the same class with them.  If you loved Okemah or Stone, Steel and Bright Lights, than by all means, buy this albumn.  It's good.  There's nothing wrong with it.  It's simply not classic Son Volt, and people should know this before buying it.  Many of the reviews that I read made it sound like this was returning to the purity of the older sound, and I don't see that at all.  To me, the haunting, somber tone of the early albumns has been replaced by an odd, upbeat, celebratory sound that I don't care for.  I think I'll stick to the old ones and leave the rest of Farrar's releases on the shelf 
 This movie is quite possibly the biggest waste of Christian Bale and Colin Farrell to date.  It was boring, overblown and incessantly long.  It's one of those movies where you keep hoping it will get better, but it never does - and then it just ends.  Don't waste the time or the money 
 Middle-aged Gracie is a typical Hollywood wife, right down to her botox injections and designer wardrobe.  When her husband dumps her after almost ten years of marriage, Gracie finds herself without love, without friends, and most importantly, without status.  (But at least she's still got the money!)  Actually, most of what I know is from the dust jacket since this book was too torturous to finish.  The plot is predictable and uninteresting and is littered with so much name-dropping that sometimes it's hard to follow.  The characters are taken straight from Stereotype 101 and are so badly written that they're impossible to relate to.  The writing is ponderous and lumbers along awkwardly, lacking polish, wit, or interest.  Especially irritating is Grazer's insistence on using Gracie's name as much as possible.  For example:  "Gracie thought about it; they'd never been to marriage counseling.  Gracie had gone to counseling in the beginning of their marriage - there were many issues to overcome.  More or less her personality issues - the fact that Gracie had too much personality.  Gracie said and did pretty much what Gracie pleased, in the beginning.  Before Gracie learned The Way of the Wife" (p 38).  I lost interest after about 20 pages, plowed my way through 40 more, then gave up.  It's very obvious that this is a poorly-veiled autobiography (Grazer/Gracie) and that as a Hollywood wife, Grazer DOES have the connections and clout her protagonist lacks or this book would never have been published.  Definitely not worth your time 
 I admire Gary Stevens as a world class jocky, but world class writer he is not. At times he comes across as quite cocky, maybe he has reason to be proud of his success but he sounds conceited more then proud. Often he writes as though he knows more about the horses he rides then the trainers or owners, that he is a better judge of their capabilities then either of the others, and he has been proven wrong on that score. He also seems to be trying to give us a smattering of his philosophy on success and I think he fails. What has worked for him, a God given ability to ride horses well and an incredible tolerance for pain can not be applied to the rest of us. I have to say, I hope Stevens does not follow this book up with any others. He is a much better jocky then writer 
 This is the worst, most depressing piece of fiction I have ever read.  There is no real protoganist and not one singular character worthy of admiration--and after a while, their actions just become inexplicable.  The author's soul must truly be an ugly one to have devoted so much time and energy to using his mind to generate so many casual acts of evil throughout the book.  It starts out promising but by the time you get to about halfway through the book or so you get a nagging sense that your very own soul might be sucked out of you and permanently stolen by the heart of Neil Gaiman's darkness or one of his minions.  Additionally, the characters' motivations change like the shifting sands, nothing they do makes any real sense except some inexplicable movement towards doing greater and more evil en masse like some sort of coagulating bacteria or disease.  What is so creepy about this book is the casualness of it all.  Unlike some of Stephen King's work (ie: The Stand), there is absolutely no redeeming thread here--no rallying or marshalling the troops to combat the emerging evil.  It's evil in evil vs. evil surrounded by evil.  All I can say is that this book is ugly, ugly, ugly.  At least writers like Joyce Carol Oats and Joseph Conrad's intentions when writing about such things is to effectively demonstrate the ill effects of such darkness, but to make heroes of characters one should avoid is unconscionable.  The choices the supposed protoganist makes make no sense--and you do root for  him in the very beginning but you find he is just like one of them after all.  I suspended my doubt and disbelief as long as I could but finally became so incensed by the audacity of both the literary critics and the author to pass this off as excellence, I literally stopped mid-sentence and chose to never read this author's work again.  It's a shame too because he has allied himself in other incarnations with a truly gifted artist, Dave McKean, who maybe hasn't completely gone over to the dark side like Neil has.  His association with Dave McKean is the only reason I even opened-up the book--and maybe a little because the title intrigued me.  But it's unfortunate that the industry rewards "clever" works such as Mr. Gaiman's with undue praise.  I've never so strongly disliked a book.  Have you ever found yourself getting angry because you felt robbed or duped by a book?  Well, don't believe the hype, this is the one to throw in the trash or disintegrate with X-men eyeball laserbeams before all your humanity is sucked out of you 
 I bought this movie on recommendation from other customers here on Amazon.com ... okay, I bought this movie because Viggo Mortensen was in it :O)  And boy, I just shouldn't have bothered.  What a weak script.  The characters are formulaic, the dialogue wooden and cliched.  There are no surprises, no insights - I came away from this movie not caring if the entire camp blew up.    Perhaps this is a difference in cultures, I'm not sure, but as an Australian I found this movie to be sickeningly Disneyesque in its portrayals.  Not worth wasting an hour-and-a-half of your time over - even for Viggo 
 This is humiliating and offensive: Thomson, who was (at least forme) until the publication of this book a respected critic and film historian, has plummeted upon churning this facile and rotten excuse for an act of mental onanism.  Supposition and desire take the place of objectivity and fact. This is not a biography about one of the leading film figures of our time: this is a reeking bouquet of rotting roses.  Don't waste your money. Don't offend the artist by putting cash in the hand of this repellent, sick, delusional (and yes, lecherous -- the "Belle de Jour" flight of fancy is particularly disgusting) man 
 I LOVED this book!  I think my designs are so much better now that I know when to open and close the windows at the right time!  I was always so confused before.  I can also make sure that I get good air flow by drawing those great ribbon arrows. This book is perfect for anyone who has never looked at the sky or felt the wind before or chooses to ignore their own senses!  I think Brown could of done this without DeKay though.  RULES-O-THUMB LUV 
 We were unfortunately dissappointed with our purchase. We loved that it showed rubber stoppers for saftey and for our hard wood floors ~ they didn't come with it. Further, Melissa and Doug puzzles don't fit. 
 I have NOT seen the movie, so this review is only based on the book.  This book was highly regarded by a few family members as a beautiful read.  Sure, the descriptions are lovely and well written, but the whole idea of a memoir is suppose to be interesting--this is not.  I love travel memoirs, reading peoples travel stories, but this was like reading a guide to restore a house--very dry.  Ms. Mayes writing reminds me of David Sedaris mocking a wealthly tourist, "My home, well... ONE of my homes".    I have decided to give the book another try. XM Sonic Theater is playing the book and it is being read by the author.  However, Ms. Mayes monotone voice and lack of live storytelling makes the story even worse.  I understand why authors have voice actors to read the books.    The book is written lovely, but does not exceed the expectation I was excepting. 
 I bought this exact same dish rack from another company ... . I liked this dish rack for the stainless quality and for looks. I was very disappointed that it has no sides, therefore cups and  bowls, etc fall out continually.  Nor does it hold many dishes at one time.   The drained water stands in the bottom tray and has to be emptied with  each use.  The stainless steel will indeed last forever, but not in my  house 
 If you are a complete novice to investing and not a rocket scientist I think you will have trouble with much of this book. If on the other hand you are well schooled in Wall Street ways, then you will most likely be bored by this book.  Technical traders will be put off by the attitude towards them. I agree with the underlying premise, that most people would be best served by Index fund investing over a long time frame. However the majority of those people can't follow his technical academic writing.   A major issue that is hinted at slightly but never really discussed is that Wall Street is basically dishonest and slanted towards INSIDERS. The ones inside always make the lionshare of the money. Been there and done that 
 A book about accounting written by a nonaccountant.  A waste of your time and money.  My copy went into the trash 
 Now, I enjoy Victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person -- in fact, probably more than the next person, since the average "next person" hasn't ever read any. Tales of derring-do, adventures to unexplored distant lands, lost civilizations, great artifacts, etc. -- that's all good stuff. What's not good is this book, which is tedious in the extreme. On the surface of it, Haggard's followup to his hugely successful (and infinitely better) "King Solomon's Mines" has all the elements: a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers (one of whom is descended from pharaohs!), a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man, an expedition to Africa, and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life.  However, despite this promising laundry list, Haggard's execution leaves a great deal to be desired. A friend described it rather aptly as "a book with a lot of story, but not a lot of plot." Which is to say that in my edition, some 320 pages are filled without much happening. There is the initial mysterious set-up, the journey to dark Africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations, the heroes' conveyance to the "lost city", and then... and then things kind of grind to a halt. Lengthy descriptive details, lengthy internal ruminations, lengthy rambling speeches, lengthy everything -- but very little of consequence occurs until the very end, when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life.  I suspect much of the problem stems from the book's origin as a long-running serial in the Gazette. As I understand it, serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment, and thus, it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible -- hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words. Judicious editing could reduce the book to 1/3 of its size without any loss of note. Of course, as another friend pointed out, it's probably best to read the book is small chunks -- just as one would have done with installments. Spreading out one's reading of it over a period of time, he suggests, may serve to conceal the book's rambling nature. In any event, there are some nice scenes here and there, such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches, but those are about all I'm likely to recall from this book in a year.   Of course, as is noted in the introduction to my edition, Haggard lifted the main elements of the plot, and even the the true name of "She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named", from several earlier adventure novels by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, so one can't even give him much credit for imagination. I suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of Victorian Englishmen: racism, anti-Semeticism, misogyny, fear of miscegenation, etc., but as entertainment for the modern reader, it falls woefully short of the mark. 
 Don't waste your time on this book, there are more valuable ones out there. First of all, what has she DONE to the fabulous story of Shahrazad? Practically torn it apart and sewed it back together with very rough stitches. I read this book trying to get away from the stereotype some writers have of typical "weak" women (I am partial to strong heroines with wit) and therefore thought another retelling of Shahrazad would be just the thing.  Well, it turned out I was wrong and this book just had the stereotype I was looking to get away from. If you want a strong heroine, if you've been disappointed by this book and how it portrays Shahrazad, go read Cameron Dokey's version (called "The Storyteller's Daughter). In all, that is a much more satisfying read 
 I bought the sd300 to take with me touring by motorcycle. It is so small, I can just put it in a belt case and always have it. With the appropriate sd card I can take a huge number of pictures at a high quality setting. The pictures turn out great, BUT. Eight months after I bought it, the LCD screen suddenly went all crazed when turned on, tho there was no visible damage. I returned it for repair, no problem, no expense, had it back in two weeks. less than 3 months later, same thing. I know I did not drop or bump it, it went down in the 10 minutes between showing some pictures to one person, then to another, indoors. I called, was told it was still  under warranty from the previous repair, and got a return label. Then I got an e-mail saying that I would have to pay $97 for repairs to the lcd screen caused by impact damage. I replied to the e-mail to protest, and was ignored. I finaly called, and was told that tho the warranty was still in force, this damage was not covered. Checking aroun the web, I found that this is a common problem, not damage. Unfortunately, I had already authorized the repair when I found this out, so I guess I am stuck. I have several canon products, will not buy any more 
 I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't. I did NOT enjoy this, and I ride, so I assumed I would like this. I guess you have to ride AND use drugs to appreciate this... 
 I like Metallica first of all. But this was their worst release along with Kill Em All. All the songs on this album are really horrendous. Metallica only made about a few good albums, want to get one???? Get Master of Puppets, Black, and Ride The Lightning. They all have about 3-7 good songs. This album is a waste!!!! Get those albums insted 
 I found this book highly unenjoyable. It was written well, if you are  taking a doctorate level course, otherwise good luck. If you expect to  learn what a Greek Myth is, Kirk will confuse the hell out of you!!! He  does an excellent job of never giving his own opinions, but would rather  belittle the thoughts of previous authors on the nature and beliefs of  Greek Myths. Sorry Kirk, but I would have to give you two thumbs down for  ease of reading, comprehension, and explanations on the Greek Myths 
 Moore can write -- well enough to keep the pages turning and to show that she has a brain. But I think she's squandered her talents with this book. The purported "eroticism" isn't much more than uninspired pornography, and the "thrill" is pretty much nonexistent, with an ending that is easy and not particularly surprising in the way that a good, intelligent crime/mystery is when it rises above its genre. The narrator is so detached and flat that it's hard to know or feel much about her -- and while that persona may have been Moore's attempt to reflect her ultimate ending (which I won't give away here), the end did not justify the means. I was annoyed that I had to endure a gruesome scene with no payoff, and that I wasted my time reading this book at all when I could have been reading something much more original, complex, and interesting. Not recommended 
 This is not necessarily an indictment of Aimee Mann or holiday music....though I do find such disks as being cheesey. I was a bit surprised when I heard Mann was coming out w/a holiday album.  It seemed a bit above someone who has based a career on not only  original material, but non-mainstream music.    It has also always surprised me that at the plethora of holiday disks that are out there and how many more come out each year.  Is it just me - or are there only 18 holiday songs in existance to begin with?  There is only so many different ways to cover "I'll Be Home for Christmas", "Winter Wonderland" - all of which I believe are covered by James Taylor, Sarah McLachlan and Better Midler, all of which were released this month.  I'm guessing they are cheap to produce and easy to pull in profits.  That being said - I still like Mann's voice and she comes through with 3-4 songs that are above the fray.  "Whatever Happened to Christmas", "Christmastime" and her original "Calling on Mary".  I also liked the fact that she covered "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch".  That seems to suit her more.  Not my cup of tea - but the songs I mentioned are the reason the disk gets 2 stars 
 There is a certain subgenre of literature about the Third World that insists on reminding the reader of the heat, bugs, filth, poverty, and misery on every page, turning the problems of the developing world into a sort of fetish.  Scribbling the Cat epitomizes the style.  In this book full of vivid images, very little actually happens; the protagonist, "K", is a crazed, violent pseudomystical freak on page ten and a crazed, violent pseudomystical freak on page 250.  Two stars not one due to Fuller's strong, vivid prose 
 They say that there is a thin line between genius and madness.   Unfortunately, it does not follow that if someone is on one side of the line that he / she will ever cross over to the other side.  This film is testimony to that.  I do not give this movie 1 star because I think it was poorly done.  For what it is, it's a very well-done film.   Ed Harris is fantastic as Pollock, and one can tell he had a passion for this particular part.   Val Kilmer barely has a cameo and Jennifer Connelly is only in maybe 10% of the movie {sigh}.  The reason I slam this movie is because I'm not impressed by this artist or his work.   I would have found a biographical movie on Ed Harris himself to be much more profound than this guy's story.  In my family there are two artists:  my father and sister.  The artistic gene skipped over me entirely as I can barely draw a stick man.  That said, I remain unconvinced that I can't do anything as well as this guy did.  Or, to put it another way, any kindergartner could have made random shapes like this guy & called it art.   When I think of art I think of Raphael, not this guy.  So, since I had such a low regard for Pollock's work, I could not help but have little interest in this movie.    To me he was nothing but a cop out.  That said, I'll be as fair as I can here:  if you happen to be a fan of Pollock's you're not going to find a better testimony of his life than this movie.   The problem is I'm simply not impressed by that 
 I bought this upgrade because I thought it would let me share my contacts. It says so on the box, but it doesn't. It works just like the old contacts which you can't share with others except if you export it. No live sharing. Why couldn't they make it so I could put the file on my server? Or on a secure site? Then all my office can work off one contact list.  50% or more of the time the business contacts can't be found when you search for a contact. It's like the business contacts is an add in that doesn't work with Outlook. Or you add contacts, save it, email to the saved email address and then go to find the contact later and it is gone.   Also, lots of times when you try to SEND, the email won't SEND, it stays in the outbox. And repeatedly you open and hit the SEND button but it won't change to SEND status. Now, if you leave it in the outbox, sometimes that fools the program into letting you send other email. Or sometimes you can FORWARD and SEND.. Geez, what a waste of money this upgrade was. We won't be using it on any of our other computers and we haven't bought if on the new computers we have ordered. 
 Very general information for the hefty price. Reading a few inexpensive computer magazines on this topic would be more helpful than this expensive book 
 Let me accept the fact that LOTR is my most beloved film and I already own the extended editions of the films in one set! I'm really not surprised to see New Line coming up with another edition of the trilogy. With films like these they will squeeze the collectors as much as they can!! Still, inspite of this new set containing both the theatrical versions and the extended cuts of the films and also the much hyped Costa Botes documentaries, my advise to anyone buying LOTR for the first time is- DO NOT BUY THIS SET! Spend a little more and you get all the movies in full 6.1 DTS EX glory, alongwith hours of endless in-depth bonus features which probably you'll spend rest of your life watching!!  Please be aware, these new editions DO NOT contain DTS tracks, no commentary tracks by the director, Weta workshop or the cast. All you get is both versions crammed into one single disc and just one documentary as a bonus on the second disc...AND NOTHING ELSE. It would have been a better idea had New Line released the documentaries separately without forcing the consumer to buy the films again....And even this is not the end, once the HD format gains a little more acceptance, they'll have another excuse to come up with a new version of the trilogy!  Beware, Extended edition set is the ultimate LOTR experience, in terms of films or bonus features. Go get it...Its worth all the money spent! 
 Mukherjee is one of the lucky few hand picked by the critics in attempting to reform the classic canon.  In trying to provide a voice to an unrecognised minority - the literary critics have foisted this trash upon us - and the public say "pull the other one."    Rather than letting the quality of the writing do the talking Mukherjee infuses her tedious prose with cliched cultural references and overblown reinterpretation.  Leaves the reader feeling quite angry at how an author could be so presumptuous. 
 Having enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can't fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic. I guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values, and while I don't condone those, the film lacks clear characters or any motivation. A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!?  Since the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false.  Romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It's not caring, not real, and not responsible.  But I guess that wouldn't bother the rich, overfunded daughter of a Hollywood genius out to make a name for herself. 
 I have read all the user reviews before buying the book, and I was expecting a scientific research on Atlantis. It turned out to be crap. It is quoting other Atlantis writers, with very doubtfull statements. Especially their sources are not scientific: they rely on pshycics and other new-age gurus. Her own research is not very convincing and is very suggestive. I hope there is somewhere another book about Atlantis that is more scientific.. 
 This book is just a memoir. One should not look beyond that. If you are interested in Azadeh's opinions about Iran, you may get something out of this book. It has no social, political, or historical value based on research. It is just a young woman's struggle to deal with issues of growing up. 
 These bootie/slippers are terrible.  They don't EVER stay on, there's no anti-skid on the bottom and are cheaply made.  I would give these 0 stars if I could, it was a complete waste of money- don't bother getting these regadless of how inexpensive they are 
 Save your money or give it to charity. This is one of the worst films for a long time. The characters are one-dimensional, you don't care who they are and when they die, you're indifferent. The direction and the screenplay are lame and the acting comes right out of a telephone directory. I was so bored with this film that I can't even bring myself to write anything else about it 
 I bought this book expecting to find useful information about nutrition for all sports as well as seeing at least one regimen from an accomplished cyclist.  This book emphasized power sports and was not what I have come to expect from Dr. Burke 
 I love this book and my son loves it too but really- I think they keep selling so many copies because people have to buy multiples when they fall apart!!!!  It would be great if they could make this in a board book without the spiral plastic ring and/or laminated pages to prevent tearing off the spiral ring. The pages easily rip off.  At $10 bucks each- I feel "ripped" off 
 Talk, talk, talk.  So much information about city hallmarks and nothing about purity marks.  No way to really identfy general items that a novice collector would have.  Is it real or not?  Talks about fakes and again nothing about standards of silver and what they are. High brow attitude toward the subject with little or no information on Continental European silver in detail. Too little to late 
 A very broad list of questions with high level answers. I wouldn't buy this book if I were looking for a deep framework to handle this topic 
 This being the first book I read by Danielle Steel I expected more than what I got since I love the moive verisons of her book. The start gives it hope but near the end you can sense the direction that the book is taking and I like alittle unpredicatable stuff 
 I'm not a fan of Stephen King film adaptations.  The only one I like is Carrie bec it was directed by Brian DePalma and featured terrific performances by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie.  Cujo is boring and not all that suspenseful.  I couldn't wait for it to end.  Not worth purchasing.  Okay as a rental 
 I bought this book to do exactly what the title says, to be "introduced to Fortran 95". The book starts by describing what a computer is, and on the next page discusses "implicit initialization of derived type objects". Where is the intermediate material??? In addition, the authors of this book might know the Fortran language, but they certainly don't know the English language. There's at least one typo on each page. Also, as stated in another review, the sample problems have errors. I found it difficult to learn from this book, and i'm going to throw it out and buy another one to use. I couldn't find the answer to any of my questions in this book, instead, I've had to play around with the example programs to find the authors' errors. Carelessly written book 
 nothing new, nothing exciting. Everything can be found in books that are half the price. Save your money 
 in the short story collection night shift, mr.king gave us some of his best short stories and spawned at least 6 movies that i know of(this mess,trucks( twice once by king as "maximam overdrive" and once as a t.v. movie),night surf,the boogyman(not the new one),graveyard shift,the mangler,and maybe more and not one has been done right! this one misses by a mile as it tells of the cult of kids who kill all the adults in a town and serve "he who walks behind the rows"     more like "we steped in something behind the rows" and we steped in this flameing piece of junk!!! skip it!!!!!! 
  At least diector Neal Israel (Mr. Amy Heckerling) keeps this tasteless film moving (unlike some of his stillborn films such as "Americathon," which gets a "BOMB" rating from Maltin & a "WOOF" rating from Videohound).  The characters here are so obnoxious that I wouldn't want to spend more than 30 seconds in the same room with any of them.  But the chaos is acceptably choreographed up to the point when the donkey is brought into the party -- at that stage, I thought that the "creative artists" responsible for this had so lost their bearings that they would have been willing to explicitly depict bestiality on screen if they had thought that they could have gotten away with it.  I nominate the director & writer of this film to be contestants on the disgustingly unwatchable TV show "Fear Factor."  At the very least they should atone by sponsoring a Preston Sturges film festival. 
 I will start off by saying, I loved my Sony Cybershot.  When the Alpha came out I couldn't wait to get one.  It died after 200 pictures on day three of a three week once in a life time trip through South America.  Amazon said it was out of their hands because it must be returned within 30 days.   I've spent 3 hours so far dealing with Sony.  Most people I spoke to or on-line live chat support were unfamiliar with the product and transferred me around to Business Support, Computers, Video.  They also contradicted one another.  When I did get to someone who knew the product I was told firmly that despite the camera being a lemon and malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they the would only 'repair it' not replace it.  Now I am stuck with a lemon, and I fear I have a history of further disappointment and frustration with this camera.  I highly recommend you read all the customer reviews.  Other people have had problems with the camera, I ignored them because I had faith in Sony and thought the other Alpha owners' dud cameras were unusual.  If you decide to purchase anyway, I highly recommend you do not buy through Amazon, but through a real store with a good and fair return policy, that stands behine their products.  Places like Microcenter will exhange, no questions ask.  I am kicking myself because Amazon was $100 cheaper then Microcenter.  Penny wise pound foolish.  I love Amazon, but, I will never buy anything other than books and DVDs from them.  Lesson learned on electronics.  
 I bought this book, thinking that it would offer some insight into Amazon.com in terms of what it was like to work there during its halcyon days.  Touted as a funny memoir, among other things, I was to discover that it was none of what was promised. In fact, the book was painfully difficult to read, as it was very poorly written, decidedly not funny, and offered little insight into what it really was like to work at Amazon. It was totally sophomoric in terms of what it did say.   The author should be thankful that he was not fired by Amazon, as that is what he richly deserved to have happen based upon his own account of what he was like as an employee. He was a total  slacker who treated customers with the contempt that he felt that they deserved. He was totally wasteful of the company's resources. He proudly stole supplies in bulk from the company. When toys were given to him for review purposes, he not only did not bother to review them, he then refused to return the toys to Amazon. He may think that all this is hilarious. Unfortunately, I do not. Reading this drivel felt like it took twenty-one dog years.   Moreover, this book was so poorly written, I am surprised that a reputable publisher went ahead with the expense of actually publishing it. Don't waste your time with this drivel. If you want to read a well-written, interesting book about working at Amazon, read "Amazonia: Five Years at the Epicenter of the Dot. Com Juggernaut" by James Marcus 
 Like everyone of you, I am crazy about my toddler.  I got this book and the book of Wendy S. Masi' Toddlers Play.  The comarison: day and night. Kuffners book might have 365 activities, but it really bad organized.  I am a first time parent, so I need some help/guidance; thsi is why I baught this bbok.    There is nothing to guide me on which activity is for what age group, so I don't know if an activity is for 18 months or 24 or 12 months- ie amI challenging my toddler, am I boring him or amI providing him with the right fun activity for his age??? Some of the activities are too obvious- it seems like the author wrote down anything she could think of just to fill in 365 activities in the bookl and there is you see the author's luck of creativity and/or knowledge of the subject.  Also the descriptiosn are very brief with limited illustrations.  I really don't understand why anyone will give 5 stars to this book.  I don't care about the money I spent for the book.  I care that I ended up with something that I can not really use to provide my toddler with fun.  For that reason I strongly recommend the othe rbook (Wendy S. Masi's book).  Yes it has 100 instea dof 365 activities, but it is colorfull, easy and pleasant to read and each activity is marked by an ege indicator.  Look at the 'look inside' of both these books and you will see what I mean.  Good luck + have lost of fun with your toddler(s)!!    
 Since when is beautiful art presented on crappy, low-grade glossy paper. These artists are incredible and deserve so much better than this stock chinese manure. It's like listening to Beethoven on a 1990's era cell phone.   And sadly, the great Doug Chiang had departed the ranks of Lucasfilm by Episode III 
 I was anticipating this book for a while.  I am a big fan of the DCU and of Green Lantern who is one of my favorite DC superheroes.  I read Green Lantern including the transition to Kyle Rayner as Green Lantern.  With that said, I am very disappointed in this novel and the concepts that it introduced.  Mr. O'Neil is a better writer than this and I am disappointed in him as well.  I was so moved (negatively) by this book that I felt I should write a review.  Like I said, I know the story about Hal Jordan and Coast City and Parallax and the eventual handing of the Power Ring to Kyle Rayner.  I have no problem when a writer massages an origin or two to make the story work.  But this felt like he took what I knew of the Justice League and it's core and Green Lantern and the Oans and put them all into a food processor.  What we got out of it looked like chunky green pea sludge.  I won't pass all the details of the story along but I felt like the author took established events in the DCU and made them into bland, trivial entries to justify the telling of his story.  The origin of the Justice League, the characterization of it's members, the use of Hal Jordan and "Di", the misrepresentation of the Oans and the Green Lantern Corps were a big pile of steaming ____.  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what the author was thinking.  Gross misrepresentation simply doesn't fit into story.  As some of the other reviewers have stated, the Kyle Rayner we see here is a whiner.  If I heard the story he told in this novel, I'd strip him of the ring and give it to someone else.  The idea that only humans have artistic concepts which is why Kyle can do so well ... crap.  And Gandy?  Please.  Ganthet was a pretty key Oan in the scheme of things with the Guardians.  The author reduced him to a cardboard cutout with Ganthet's likeness.  I just find the novel contrived and ill-thought.  If I was the author's editor and knew a quarter of what I know about the Green Lantern and his history, I would have told Mr. O'Neil to go back to the drawing board.  There were a few concepts that I had to agree with.  Some of what Kyle had to do to train.  Yes, good ideas.  The idea that the Oans have lost touch with other sentient beings.  Again, I have to agree with that.  And the portrayal of Batman, was right on.  But Kyle sleepwalking (not literally) through a third of the novel and the misrepresentation of Hal Jordan and the Oans left me ill by the end.  If this was an assignment that was turned in for a grade, I'd give it an 'F' just in the poor manner that the story was told.  Even worse knowing the history of the characters that star in it.  Mr. O'Neil, I'm disappointed in you.  You should never have turned in this story 
 I bought this TV to use during lunch breaks at work and to take to football games.  It couldn't pickup any VHF channels and could only pickup the same 2 UHF channels.  The next day I shipped it back for a refund 
 If you want to converse about argument, debate, shared insight, sophistry, truth, beauty, and the American way, etc., don't bother with this dreck. Just read any Platonic dialogue 
 A generally uninspired album - at times it sounds as if Jewel is simply phoning her performance in. Her voice isn't powerful, and when the orchestra gets loud she simply gets drowned. The better tracks are definately those where the production is kept to a minimum (Rudolph, I Wonder). In a few others (O Little Town, Go Tell it on the Mountain) her voice gets unpleasantly thin, which I found distracting.  Overall this is a forgettable set; personally, I really wasn't moved in a Christmasy sort of way. If you're a Jewel fan it's maybe worthwhile but other folks will find that there are better holiday albums available 
 I'm in Paris right now. And I have to admit, that before I arrived here, I had visions of berets, perfect stockings, cigarettes, and street accordions dancing in my head. But I'm getting this feeling that it is basically the same everywhere, at least in cities. There  will be large department stores, chains of McDonalds, KFC, Starbucks, homeless people, fat people, scruffy people. Which is of course a "duh". The characteristics that Ollivier attribute to French girls can really be seen everywhere; New York, Rome, London,  Chicago etc. Girls honestly look the same everywhere generally; boots with slim jeans or pants tucked in, wearing a short fitted jacket, yada yada. So really. Stop being such a poser. You're only embarrassing yourself by denouncing your origins and who you really are 
 I appreciate the warning about the photographs in this book. Why else would someone buy a book such as this other than to look at the beautiful homes in all of their splendor? I blame the digital age and bad scanning/reproducing/printing and I agree, some things are better off left alone and out of print 
 This is an awful book. It has this happy cover with reviews such as "enchanting" and "coming of age". I don't know how many people would describe their "Coming of Age" with self mutilation, sex with 31 year old alcoholic men while their parents are downstairs, and enjoying being beaten and humiliated. I really wish I hadn't ever read this terrible book. It was pathetic. Now I understand why it was on the "free" pile at a book sale 
 I did not like this audio book.  Out of all of Danielle Steel audio books this one was the worse and most depressing story. In a world of finding a new job and starting to date again. It was a story of a women who was having a problem finding the right man.  It tells you a sad story of the man who used her and the man who was afraid to commit himself to another woman long after his wife died and he tryed to started to date again. 
 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Philippians 4:13  Put your faith in the bible and Gods words NOT THROUGH SHAKTI GAWAIN  Trust Jesu 
 I think I understand what Camp is.  "The Damned" is a film taking upon itself the allegorical rise and fall of Nazi Germany in such an overindulgent manner that one cringes and giggles at the same time.  I guess Gay folks everywhere can blame Luchino Visconti the "great" director for making a laughing stock out of homosexuals in Nazi SS garb.  Mel Brooks realized in his film "The Producers" that Nazi's are damn funny, but not even Brook's vision could foresee the downfall of the Essenbeck family as the currents of early Nazi bloodshed swirls about.  The uniforms are Art Deco at its worst.  The young blonde, Aryan, cross-dressers are a bathhouse dream until they're lined up against the wall.  Rome may have had Caligula, but The Reich had blonde pedophiles. What a thrill to see Helmut Berger swishing about in Marlene Dietrich bodice and stockings.  I watched the whole thing and I'm going to end this review to take a shower 
 I,M PLEASE TO SAY THAT IT IS GOOD ORDERS THIS BOOK I WILL BE ORDER SOME MORE . THANK  
 Steven Pinker lost me as a buyer of his thesis with the very second sentence of his book:   "For you and I belong to a species with a remarkable ability: we can shape events in other's brains with exquisite precision".  It you take that for granted, Pinker's book will seem compelling and not especially controversial. Steven Pinker clearly takes it for granted, perhaps because he can't conceive of how we could possibly communicate effectively and coherently if it were not true.   Consider the following, which I think perfectly encapsulates the world view Pinker can't conceive of, by Ogden Nash:  Caught in a mesh of living veins, In cell of padded bone, He loneliest is when he pretends That he is not alone.  We'd free the incarcerate race of man That such a doom endures Could only you unlock my skull, Or I creep into yours.  To my way of thinking, it is the very fact that we *can't* "shape events in other's brains with exquisite precision" - or with any reliable certainty at all, that describes the human condition. The frisson created by precisely that ambiguity underpins all communication; it is the source of irony, tragedy, comedy, invention and imagination. Any theory of language which denies that fundamental contingency of human communication (as this one does) is going to have to prove it, and displacing that onus is a heavy task indeed.  Pinker's psycho-linguistics makes precisely that denial, by holding that all human communication - every language - shares an inate, evolutionary programmed Universal Grammar, precisely because Pinker can't conceive how else human communication could be possible.  I'm no academic, and certainly I have no background in linguistics. Given that this theory - which is from the same tradition as Noam Chomsky's - has been the ascendancy amongst academic linguistics for the best part of the last thirty years, Steven Pinker being one of the leading "normal scientists" within the paradigm (if I should be so bold as to use that word), and that The Language Instinct is considered fairly widely to be his magnum opus, I was expecting to have my naive relativistic assumptions carefully and systematically dissected, then annihilated, one by one.  So imagine my surprise to find that in the place of carefully drawn arguments and compelling statistical data, one finds a tissue of anecdotal arguments carefully selected to fit the theory, arguments from authority ("Chomsky is one of the ten most cited writers in all of the humanities"), dubious suppositions in place of statistical data (the "it is difficult to imagine the following grammatical construction being used" sort of thing),  begged questions, non sequiturs, and Roger Penrose-style irrelevant scientific waffle - especially as regards evolution - and a decided absence of any consideration of competing theories of linguistics - and straw men versions of those which do rate a mentioned.   In short, Steven Pinker employs just about every illegitimate arguing technique in the book. His theory completely fails to account for metaphor (metaphor is barely mentioned in the book), nor the incremental development of language, the evolution of different languages with different grammars and vocabularies. At times Pinker is forced to argue that the grammar of our language is sometimes different from the words we actually speak and write, containing unspoken "inaudible symbols" representing a word or phrase which has been moved elsewhere in the sentence, so the sentence "The car was put in the garage", according to Pinker's Universal Grammar should technically be rendered as: "was put the car in the garage", and the construction we use can only be explained by movement of "The car" and the insertion in its place of an inaudible "trace":  "[The car] was put [trace] in the garage".  Now, again I am no technical linguist, but this has all the hallmarks of pure bull manure to me.  Finally, Pinker is at pains to point out that Universal Grammar is only ever applicable to oral language: written language didn't arise for centuries after oral grammar "evolved" as a phenotype.  But this hardly helps Pinker, since (as he himself points out, with reference to a transcript of the Watergate Tapes) when people talk in ordinary conversation they almost *never* use complete grammatical sentences: they interrupt themselves, they rely on physical gestures, they break off in mid stream and start a new thought, they don't punctuate (there's no unequivocal punctuation in spoken English), all the time.   As is fashionable amongst the "reductivist" and "evolutionary" set these days (a set I would otherwise, in general terms, consider myself in agreement with), relativist arguments are scorned. But Pinker's paradigm implies that, provided we are competent in constructing our own sentences, we should all understand each other perfectly, all the time: there should be no ambiguity; no room for miscontrual; no possibility for evolution in ideas or language. It is difficult to see how anyone could believe such a thing. But neither the structure of language and grammar nor its practical use needs to be perfect for effective communication *at some level* to be possible, and surely that is all that is needed. The beauty of the contingent view of language, which Pinker seems unable to appreciate, is how it can account for the missed margin of communication which might explain the everyday cultural and interpretative problems we all face, and the figurative and metaphorical power we all find at our disposal. Ogden Nash's dilemma is our dilemma, however much Steven Pinker might wish it were otherwise.  An earlier reviewer has mentioned Geoffrey Sampson's "the Language Instinct Debate" as a compelling antidote to Pinker's world view. Having recently read it (on the strength of that recommendation), I would firmly agree. In perhaps an ill-advisedly grumpy tone, Sampson - whose position at the University of Sussex inevitably means his academic profile is lower than Pinker's or Chomsky's - systematically and convincingly annihilates many of the arguments (such as they are) in Pinker's work.

 My first clue should have been the reviews on the back, which appear to all be quotes from people who owe Froelich a favor for having been mentioned in her column or who expect to get a mention for talking up her book.  If you want some interesting gossip, the inside scoop on some of yesterday's news, read this book.  It's a quick, easy read and has a few amusing and/or eye-popping moments (I don't think I'll ever be able to eat Altoids again).  The trouble is Froelich didn't narrow her focus enough.  Part of her wanted to dish on the NY gossip scene and tell you how to get a foot into the world of the glitterati, and part of her wanted to give practical advice to Joe Midwest who wants to know how to get good PR for his local business.  She slips in a few quick tips and examples for Joe (who, let's face it, is far more likely to be considering this book just by sheer virtue of the fact that we're all more likely to be him than up and coming glitterati), but not enough or in enough detail to make it truly worthwhile.  Meanwhile, the ending drops off like she suddenly got tired of the whole project or had to leave in a rush to cover the Pitt/Aniston divorce.  My advice: do like I did and check this one out of the local library if you're interested; don't spend your hard earned cash 
 after being utterly discusted with this poor excuse of a study guide, i thought i would read some horrible reviews on the guide to make me feel better. to my dismay, people can't read and they only posted reviews for the text book, which is actually good but those reviews should be posted elsewhere.   You know there is something wrong with this guide when you see them call CH3-CH3 methane (pg 3 not to mention they got linoleic and linolenic mixed up) or on the multiple choice on page 19 has ribosomes as one of the right answers for proteins involved in transcription.  i have not done a lot of the questions in the book and all ready i see errors on every second page. i wonder if i will actually recieve lower grades if i study from this poorly written book.   I love study guides and have used them for stewert's calculus, campbell's biology and bruice's organic chemistry in college. were there some occasional mistakes... yes but overall they were good. this study manual however seems to have been written by a tribe of wild monkeys pounding on a keyboard. Save your 23 dollar 
 If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever. What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.  McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore. 
 This is a story that never needed telling.  Stephen King is incredible with words and ideas, but I suppose I could be considered a fair-weather fan.  "Gerald's Game" did nothing to enhance my life, creativity, conversation or writing skill.  And I was not entertained.  It drained me.  If you haven't read any Stephen King, he's great, so don't start with this one.  Skip it if you can 
 The first sentence in the book is "People who aren't autistic always ask me about the moment I realized I could understand the way animals think."  It should have been "People who aren't autistic always ask me about the moment I SOMEHOW GOT THE NOTON THAT I could understand the way animals think." There's no proof in this book, no good evidence, just Ms. Grandin's anecdotes and speculations.   Noticing a lot of detail because you have autism and being able to use this ability to design humane slaughterhouses does not translate into thinking like animals think.  The book does offer many clear, simple descriptions of scientists' research. So if you don't know anything about animal research, these descriptions could be a good place to start. 
 A deeply flawed book written by an incompetent charlatan, Hacking: The Art of Exploitation offers up a bevy of snake oils that fail to make good on the promise of education.  The exploits as Erickson calls him are all extremely rudimentary and are all explained poorly. One sentence, which I quote literally is "Set up the shell thing to do the stuff for you." For this, I paid $20? Bah, you facocta schlubs.  The book manages to be both trite and overly erroneous. 
 This is useless if you know any Spanish.  I thought it would contain idioms but this contains only the kind of information you'd need for simple travel.  Save your money 
 Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed 
 Unfotrunately Shantaram did not grab my imagination at all.  Nor did I find it emotionally satisfying.  I realize Shataram is meant to be a kind of Bollywood story - over the top, flowery, cliched etc. but the Bollywood movies I've seen have been engaging and strangely satisfying, despite their soppyness etc.  Shantaram was not engaging because the poor writing and shallow characters spoil the story.  
 I am an avid Michael Crichton fan and have read pretty much everything he has written aside from his nonfiction books.  Crichton's writings are often full of action, complexity, character development, as well as a deeper underlying theme or message about society, technology, and human nature.  The Great Train Robbery was either lacking or painfully deficient of every one of these elements.  As I expressed in the title, it is written more as a historical documentation of an event rather than a traditional novel and is frequently interrupted by lengthy explanations of historical perspective.  The Victorian criminal slang used (although brilliantly) to tell the story makes it a slow, and at times, unintelligible read.  I give it two stars because it is obvious that Crichton has written a well thought out, well researched book; I only wish it didn't feel like I was reading his history report 
 Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn. No other ballet partnership is as legendary -- the fiery Russian defector and the graceful, aging English ballerina formed a bond on and off the stage that for several years practically defined romantic ballet. Thus, for this very reason, hardcore balletomanes should get this dvd. Many of us (including me) were too young to have seen Nureyev and Fonteyn live, so these videos are the only example to dissect the legendary partnership.  However, caveat emptor: this is NOT a "typical" Swan Lake by any means. You can argue that there is no "typical" Swan Lake -- the original production in 1877 was a failure. Some of the music went missing. After Tchaikovksy's death, the choreographers Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov restaged Swan Lake, and that version more or less is the Swan Lake audiences know today. There's lots of music, so most versions of Swan Lake use the "traditional" pieces.   Nevertheless, there are some different traditions of Swan Lake. In the Russian productions, the outcome is usually "happy" -- Rothbart is killed, and Siegfried and Odette are alive. In the productions used "everywhere else," Odette and Siegfried leap into the lake, and are reunited in the otherworld. I prefer the second ending personally, because I think it better matches both the story (the happy ending was enforced by the Tsar, and seems tacked on), and the music as well.  Rudolf Nureyev's 1966 film, however, is unlike any other Swan Lake I've ever seen. First of all, from the opening closeup (of Siegfried in blue eyeshadow and red lipstick) you realize this film is not going to follow Balanchine (and classical ballet's) creed of "ballet is woman." The first act is redesigned to incorporate a lot of solos and dance opportunities for Siegfried (Nureyev). The first act usually ends with Siegfried picking up his bow and arrow and going hunting with Benno. In this film, there is a long elegiac solo for Siegfried (using music that's usually used in act 2).   Nureyev even dares to tinker with the famous Act II choreography by Lev Ivanov. In the famous Odette/Siegfried Adagio, the melody is not repeated with the cello -- instead, there's another solo for Siegfried. Margot Fonteyn was born in 1919 so it's possible that the emphasis on Nureyev is due to Fonteyn's technical limitations at the time. And one notices that Fonteyn, as graceful and lovely as she is, is at times unable to cope with the famously demanding Odette/Odile role. For instance, Odette's solo in Act II usually ends with a series of turns and then Odette stands on pointe and holds a balance before going into the wings. Fonteyn doesn't attempt the feat, but ends the series of turns in first position -- flat on her feet. Fonteyn by modern standards also lacks the athleticism, bonelessness (her arms always look like arms, not wings), flamboyance, and flexibility, that one usually associates with this role.  Act III's music choreography is pretty standard, but the musical arrangements (and choreography) for the Black Swan Pas de deux are radically different. Fonteyn actually churns out the fouettes, confirming something I've long suspected: that everyone looks at the fouettes, but Odette/Odile's real challenges are the balances, footwork, and leaps, and this is where you can see Fonteyn suffer.   Strangely, Act IV (the act that is usually cut to shreds) is the most intact. And it's the best-danced act: it;s the reconciliation scene between Odette and Siegfried that one can catch glimmers of the genuine bond that existed between these dancers. Elsewhere, the technical limitations of Fonteyn by this time and Nureyev's reworking of Swan Lake as a solo showpiece for Siegfried distracted me from simply enjoying their partnership. I particularly loved when Siegfried runs all over the stage, turning up the head of each swan, to find his Odette, and when he finally finds Margot's head, it's a truly beautiful moment. The ending of Nureyev's version follows the original Swan Lake, and not the "usual" endings of the Swan Boat to heaven.  On a technical level, there are problems. The ballet was filmed on a soundstage, and seems way too small to fit a whole cpmpany corps. As a result, the dancers often look haplessly cramped and as if they'll bump into each other. The close bunching also detracted from the natural geometric shapes that are so much a part of classical ballet. The Vienna State Ballet also looks woefully underreheased. Either that or they're just bad. Their legs are terribly uneven in arabesques, their arms are a mess, and they simply look like a corps that hasnt danced Swan Lake enough. The sets are also deliberately artificial and the costuming, espeically for Nureyev and in the "color" acts, is garish. Rothbart (Redbeard here) is a non-dancing role, unlike in most productions when he's a smooth pimp-type in Act III.   For a traditional Swan Lake with a more modern Odette/Odile, I'd suggest the Makarova/Dowell dvd with the Royal Ballet. Makarova was 41 at the time of filming, but her long extensions, boneless arms, exquisite balances, and still impressive technique make her Odette/Odile much more appealing to modern tastes. This Swan Lake is of great historical value, and Fonteyn is undeniably lovely, but overall I admit I wanted a more traditional Swan Lake, and I certainly wouldnt recommend this dvd as anyone's first Swan Lake. Its just too unorthodox.  
 this thing has big numbers on it, but is not very accurate, at least 10% off in temp and humidity. spend your money on something else, like a cheap scientific therm 
 Gave lower rating because didn't have detailed info on replacing laptop harddrive.  Other info OK. VM 
 This book reads like a period piece, with about as much connection with current reality as a Victorian book of manners--except, of course, it is rude and abraisive.  Even in its heyday, the Manifesto was a measure of wheat in a mountain of techno-pyscho-babble, quasi-Marxian, what-we really-need-is-to-just-sit-around-and-rap chaff.  Now that the Internet is largely a tool to make customer service and contact even more difficult that before (ever try to use the "knowledge base" of most companies?) it look even quainter.  All I could think of was Webvan and the mass of uneconomic ventures that these and like fantasies spawned.  Don't bother.  Read David Ogilvy instead

 I am a student in a technology high school, and when I saw that this bag would fit my laptop, and what looked like room for my books, I was in for a shock.  Initially, it was fine, but after a month or so of use, a small hole began to form, which recently formed into a large hole. Now, the whole handle part of the bag is coming off.  It is a good bag, but it is poorly designed for any student, in my opinion, who needs to carry both a laptop and a large number of text books

 "St. Elmo's Fire" is one of those movies that could have been better, should have been better and yet, it just wasn't. It featured an ensemble cast of THE young and hot stars of the 1980s, the so-called Brat Pack (well, everyone but Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, who were spared this misstep).  Maybe this was supposed to be "The Breakfast Club - - After College", but while "The Breakfast Club" had characters, even stereotypical characters, that you could relate to, there is absolutely no one, with the exception of Emilio Estevez' character, that you care enough about to relate to in this film. The setting is not the John Hughes teen friendly Illinois, but Georgetown, where our bunch of Brat Packers have supposedly graduated from college.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, RIGHT.   Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage - - problem is, Nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that Sheedy, in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that.  Andrew McCarthy is their mutual friend who knows what Nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for Sheedy (or maybe it's just the pearls?)  Emilio Estevez is a future attorney, working as a waiter/server and suffering a serious crush on Andie MacDowell.  Mare Winningham is a dowdy, trust-fund type girl who is still holding on to her virginity, working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her.  She instead fantasizes about Rob Lowe, who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band, who has dropped out of school, married a white trash-y looking groupie, had a child with her and has now separated from her, and taking up with other groupies.  Demi Moore is the wild chick who works in international banking, has a serious coke problem, stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of Billy Idol.   Sounds promising, huh?  Well, in what is an early portend of the "Melrose Place" to come, Sheedy finds out what a dog Nelson is, dumps his ass, immediately jumps into bed with McCarthy, who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job; Estevez, after screwing up a lucrative house-sitting job by hosting a party there, travels to the snowy mountains to track down MacDowell and profess his love to her.  He finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed, he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home.  Lowe, in between faux-playing his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere, takes Winningham's virginity and heads back to his estranged missus.  Moore, after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother, has all her furnishings repossessed, loses her job and freaks out. Not exactly "The Breakfast Club".   The real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves.  With the exception of Estevez' character, they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped.  Their every action, every line of dialogue seems like just that - - they seem very one dimensional.  Their so-called angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that. Winningham's character could have been salvagable - -except that she followed Lowe around like a sick puppy, knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was.  And yet, she still gave her virginity to him.  Maybe if Winningham wasn't so bright, or she was a college freshman, it would be understandable.  But she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent. Lowe really had little to do with his role.  Maybe if he had played the role Nelson had - - as the roving Lothario, with Sheedy waiting at home, it might have gone over better.  With his too-pretty looks, it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him.  Nelson just doesn't seem comfortable and doesn't pull it off - -but maybe Nelson might have been better suited for the sax player. Moore basically plays herself - -an interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems, mirroring her character - - but was later rehired. While the title song later become a minor hit, "St. Elmo's Fire" itself missed the mark.  
 Since God is Infinite Goodness, we must conclude that the appearance of reckless divine cruelty is a delusion.  When we are comfortable, we are too shallow-minded to realize that we need God.  Since God knows that He is the only thing that we really need, He inflicts pain upon us to wake us up to this fact.  So pain is God's megaphone.  If some people, such as the Jews, try to love God without going through Christ, it is not yet God - merely the best approximation their fantasy can attain.  Hence poor God is forced to keep screeching at them through His megaphone.  But even people who try their hardest to love the true God, such as Job, or C. S. Lewis for that matter, cannot adore God as much as He wants to be adored, so He uses pain over and over again to "plant the flag of truth within their rebellious souls."      Where does this notion of an Infinitely Good God come from?  Given mankind's painful existence, "an inference from the course of events in this world to the Goodness and Wisdom of the Creator would be preposterous."  God had to reveal Himself to mankind by Revelation; thus it is in the likes of Abraham and Moses, who identified God as righteous, that all peoples are blessed.  Lewis informs us that God expostulated with His own creatures on the basis of their own ethical conceptions - "What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me?"  One has to wonder if Lewis has ever actually read the Bible.  Can anyone really deny that if a leader of today did exactly the sorts of things that Abraham and Moses did that they would be decried by all of sane mankind as monsters?  I have never understood why, or how, I am supposed to pretend that this is not true.  Of course, God is wiser than me, so if I could only see it from God's viewpoint, I would see that the butchery of whole populations, including babies and animals, was actually an act of love.  In MERE CHRISTIANITY Lewis condemns this line of reasoning in eastern religions as "damn nonsense."  Undoubtedly, we get the impression of a just and loving God through the teachings of Christ, but the conviction that God is Infinite Goodness, Omniscience, and Omnipotence did not come from biblical revelation; it was developed by medieval Christian philosophers by reasoning through extrapolation -- a process that Lewis, rather inexplicably, deems impossible.  Lewis's insistence that people have free will needs to be examined.  Even as he describes it, since we are born in sin, we cannot use free will to avoid sin, and most people are blind to their sin.  Hence, it logically follows that there can be no free will without the ability of self-perception.  The evidence suggests that incessant pain, especially when inflicted upon children, destroys this ability.  Abused children typically grow up to be abusers.  In my own case, I adamantly insist it was the drug, marijuana, which first gave me introspective ability, at the age of 23.  Prior to that moment, God knows that I had no free will.  Free will is not a realized trait that we are born with, but a potential ability that requires a great deal of effort to develop.  In most people it remains largely dormant.  Since free will is dependent on self-knowledge, the role of religion needs to be the development of introspective ability.  Dogmatic adherence can only hinder this.  Lewis is at least honest enough to acknowledge evolution.  Unfortunately, it is hardly possible to reconcile the notion of evolution of man from animals with his fairy-tale notion that animals only exist by destroying each other because they were corrupted by Satan before man's appearance on Earth.  Somehow, the perfectly good "Paradisal Man" descended from animals already corrupted by Satan.  Lewis can be abominably silly sometimes.  Lewis is given to disjunctive, either/or, logic.  Either the common human experience of supernatural awe is a mere twist in the mind with no biological purpose, or it is direct experience of the supernatural - a Revelation.  I would once have scoffed at this, but a Numinous vision of Christ was the major turning point of my life.  The problem is that this Revelation was not at all consistent with Mere Christianity.  According to Lewis, the purpose of pain is to break our will, since it is our tarnished wills that keep us from God.  I had only recently come to realize that I had not had free will until my sense of self was awakened by an illegal drug.  I experienced Christ in the very moment that I was cursing Christ for demanding that I beg forgiveness for that which He was responsible.  Albeit, at the time I was an atheist, and was only cursing at what I had been taught about Christ.  I experienced Christ as the core of my being, not as an entity completely separate from myself, and as an awakening of will, not a surrender.  Lewis assures me that the feeling of being one with God, rather than a creature of God, is Satan's ultimate deception.  But I have also experienced Satan within myself.  If Christ were not the core of my being, I would never have survived Satan.  I know the difference.  I do not acknowledge that Christianity has the authority tell me what my experience of God must be.  I am a scientist by training, not given to superstitious credulity, however much like it what I have written above must sound.  In my attempt to make sense of my experience of Christ and Satan battling within my mind, I have come up with the following myth:  It is, at least, not completely unreasonable to assume that consciousness is an inherent quality of existence.  This consciousness would first be in a primordial state, probably in some way responsible for evolution, though not by anything like intelligent design by direct control.  There could be no distinction between good and evil; in fact the terms could have no meaning, until consciousness evolved to a complexity capable of self-awareness.  As self-awareness developed, so did awareness of pain and terror, and a rebellion against achieving a level of awareness capable of experiencing pain.  The human mind, as the vessel of consciousness experiences these antagonistic trends and, for whatever reason, tends to personify them as God and Satan, or their various cultural equivalents.  What makes the Christian God so detestable is His complete refusal to accept responsibility for anything.  Satan can therefore be described as "God's self-ignorance."  Buddhists are apparently able to put themselves into the conscious state of inanimate matter, hence there insistence that good and evil are identical.  C. S. Lewis tells us that "it is not God's purpose that we should go back into that old identity."  I think I agree with him on this point.  Mankind's goal must be to attain free will be becoming conscious of what we really are.

 OK, I'm a SciFi fan.  I read the SciFi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me, and it really was good right up to the end.  Just one problem, they forgot to write the end.  What happened?  Did they run out of money?  Did the writer write himself into a corner?  There was no climax, conclusion, or resolution.  You can argue till you are blue in the face about "pan & scan."  I prefer movies with an ending.  If you are looking for a great unfinished story, this one is for you 
 I will admit that I too read this book cover-to-cover and was intrigued by its story. The problem is, I became so engaged that I began doing subsequent research into the field of remote viewing and, appropriately enough, began to "see the truth." Psychic Warrior is a highly fictionalized, exxagerated, self-serving vehicle for its disgraced author to exploit his fleeting brush with the RV program for money.  David Morehouse had the shortest tenure of any of the Army's remote viewers who have gone on to make a living as "experts" on the technique. According to those fellow viewers, most of the "exploits" in RV that Morehouse takes credit for in this book were actually accomplished by other people. The best example is his "Mars expedition," which was in fact conducted by Joe McMoneagle. An actual transcript of Joe's session is available as a bonus with purchase of Skip Atwater's book "Captain of My Ship, Master of My Soul" and it more or less proves that Morehouse is trying to take credit for someone else's work. The Psychic Warrior book is full of events and accomplishments that Morehouse tries to take credit for, most of which actually occured when Morehouse wasn't even in the program.  In fact, most of the revered remote viewers (McMoneagle, Ingo Swann, Russell Targ, Paul Smith) seem to consider Morehouse to be the RV community's "odd man out," especially after he was forced out of the Army for having an affair with his enlisted driver's wife among other things. That part of the book is even more suspect; Morehouse continually makes excuses for himself and tries to paint himself as a victim of some sort of government plot as a result of his threat to "expose the truth" about RV, instead of taking accountability for his illegal and immoral actions.  But two facts must be considered here: First, the Army itself declassified the program and released mountains of information about it; it is highly doubtful that they would make attempts on the lives of Morehouse's entire family over something they were already planning to open the lid on. Second, practically every other significant member of both the SRI program and the military's program has gone on to write books, author instructional materials and even teach courses in remote viewing, and not a single other one has been "targeted" by higher powers as Morehouse claims to have been.  If anyone out there is interested in reading about remote viewing and its history within both the civilian science sector and the military/government, I would highly recommend that you read Paul Smith's "Reading the Enemy's Mind" instead of Morehouse's fictionalized waste of time. Smith, who acted as unit historian for the Army's program, provides an infinitely more reliable, intelligent and engaging account of the development and implementation of remote viewing. And if you would then be inclined to study the technique yourself, I would suggest you examine Skip Atwater's course at the Monroe Institute in Virginia before plunking down the $1,000 + to study with Morehouse. After all, Atwater spent years training most of the viewers in a program that Morehouse was kicked out of after only a brief time.  I wouldn't have had such a problem with Psychic Warrior if it had been marketed as a work of fiction. It is a shame that such a perversion of the truth ends up being many people's initial introduction to something as significant to humankind as remote viewing. 
 my daughter would love a trampoline and i would love to buy her one but i don't know which one to get her.  the airzone 8' trampoline seems perfect but i also read the reviews for the airzone 13' trampoline which got terrible reviews.  i don't know what to believe.  can anybody help 
 As a first year law student, I bought this book thinking it would help me and supplement the class. However, I found this book not very useful. In fact, I found it frustrating. I would find it brief in the places I needed the most hope and long and drawn out over issues that were simple. While the book does a nice job of covering basic concepts like mens rea {sorry if spellings wrong its been two years), I felt uncomfortable using it for specific crimes. Too often because either you're working from a model code or your own state's law, this book was only good for a general perspective. In addition, I feel that if you want something to help you and something more than the Emmanuel's, I recommend the "Understanding" Series. I bought that as well for this class, and I felt it was much better written and was focused on helping you to learn the actual issues. This book should probablely be used, if at all by practitioner or individuals who have already studied the material (like for bar review). I would encourage you to go elsewhere for help in learning the material 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 In high school "Stroke You Up" was the jam, so I went downtown and bought the cassette. Let me tell you something: It took me 2 days to listen to it because it was utterly boring. Even "Stroke You Up" became unbearable to listen to. No funk, no groove- just lukewarm soul. That was the first *and* the last time I listened to "Changing Faces." The two chicks who made up "Changing Faces" had airy, monotonous vocals- no edge to their voices at all. Even the album cover looked boring. These chicks had no style or any type of pizzazz at all. Skip this at all costs and get Zhane 
 I am lawyer from Brazil, and wanted to get real information about the green card application process (without having to go through the dry explanation in the INS website) and was completely disapointed and upset when I received this book.  It does not cover anything in depth, and wastes a lot of time talking about temporary visas, fiance visas (I thougt it was supposed to explain about greencards!), special greencards for amerasians (which is not a very common situation)...     As for what I was really interested in, which was the green card application process for work-related reasons, there is a small, incomplete paragraph and a suggestion that I find an attorney!!!! Waste of money, useless -- if you want to get a green card, either find another book, check the INS website, or hire a lawyer, this book will not help at all.  
 Only a professor writing for a university press could get a book this poor published.  Matthews views are on the most extreme fringes of revisionist interpretations of American history, and may be summarized as follows:  Thomas Jefferson was idealistic and good, James Madison was materialistic  and bad.  If you are inclined to think that this is an exaggeration, I will  quote 4 sentences from the very last page of this book (consistent with  Amazon.com's guidelines, I am limited to only 4 sentences of quotations):  "It was Madison, not Jefferson, who designed the system.   Madison's...dream has, as he knew it would, turned into a nightmare for  increasing numbers of marginalized Americans.  Instead of the chance to  pursue happiness, they have neither the opportunity, the hope, nor even the  illusion of either.  America....has metamorphosed into an intriguing  Orwellian-Kafkaesque labyrinth, where a few Ks still search for the reality  behind the ideological myth, while the rich find meaning in each of their  possessions." If you think that this makes sense, if you believe that  this even remotely resembles the vision of James Madison, one of the  fathers of our nation and its greatest expert on the American Constitution  he did so much to create, then this is your kind of book.  If not, I  recommend that you save your money and order other books of real value on  the life and works of Madison 
 A work of fiction is a great thing, but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong.  Why not just make up a story with no historical basis 
 This is probably great for the ABBA fan who wants to learn about the group, but if you are wanting a video of them doing what they do best, you will probably be disappointed. The DVD includes too much stuff that is not ABBA performing. The bits and pieces of their performances that are included are good, but I had hoped for more of a "concert" DVD 
 Don't get me wrong, I love the dobro and JD is one of if not the best, but as far as this album is concerned my wife put it best. "That music is really annoying.&quot 
 I purchased this book on the recommendation of one of my Ph.D. program professors who likes it better than de la Fuente's book. I agree that it's better than Fuente, but that's not saying much.  Simon and Blume wrote the book for people who not only already know mathematical economics, but who also think fluently in mathematics.  It's not for the beginning Ph.D. candidate in economics, but for the accomplished professor.  If you already know the material, I suspect that Simon and Blume will allow you to quickly reference any of the topics it covers.  If you're struggling to learn mathematical economics, however, don't try to use this book because it will reinforce any fears you might have about your ability to learn the subject in the first place 
 I bought the soundtrack right when it came out, being a teenaged Beatles fan (who was also a closet Bee Gees fan).  This movie had the star power to be huge, with Frampton and the BGs, but the film must be viewed as a Beatles Revue, not a serious flick.  As for the soundtrack, it yielded three hits -- Aerosmith's "Come Together", Earth Wind & Fire's "Got To Get You Into My Life", and the solo Robin Gibb, whose rendition of "Oh Darling" was a radio hit.  Billy Preston's prostitution, singing "Get Back", was also good.  For these, as well as the rare Maurice Gibb lead vocal on "Mr. Kite", the album deserves two stars.  It's fair to compare it to All This And World War II, since that was crap.  The music is disco- and synthi-fied, and some of the vocals (without the benefit of the filmed context) were scary.  But it was a big hit with the teenybopper crowd, who were into the BGs and Frampton as pop stars/eye candy.  Therefore, without benefit of the video presentation, this soundtrack no longer stands up 
 I really wanted to like this film.  It hurts not to recommend it, because the subject matter is extraordinary and compelling: a once-in-a-lifetime night in American theater that happened during the Great Depression.  And Tim Robbins' heart is in the right place.  But great intentions don't make a great film, and unfortunately, that's the case here.  Robbins tries to do a multiple-character loose plot that makes one think of Robert Altman.  In fact, watching Cradle Will Rock, you realize just how good Altman is, because he makes this sort of thing look so effortless (so much so that detractors have often accused him of "not really directing" his pictures).  Well, to quote the late senator Lloyd Bentsen: Tim Robbins, you're no Bob Altman.  The film has an impressive cast list.  Unfortunately, almost everyone overacts (or is overdirected by Robbins, since these actors have turned in other fine performances).  Particular violators are Cary Ewles as John Houseman and Angus Macfadyen as Orson Welles.  Both seem to channel Nathan Lane in their over-the-top elocution and both as directed by Robbins turn every showbiz cliche in the book, such as bickering pettily and then, when they reach an agreement over something, jumping up and down and shouting "Eureka!" while hugging.  Other hams include Ruben Blades as painter Diego Rivera and, surprisingly, the normally spot-on Susan Sarandon as Mussolini's art-living mistress.  (With her over-bearing accent she sounds more like Count Dracula's mistress.)  Other cliched characters include doe-eyed Emily Watson as a shy waif who never gets a break in life until, of course, the last scene.  There's also a strange sideplot involving Bill Murray (okay, he does not overact; *can* Bill Murray overact?) as a washed-up ventriloquist.  This started off promising, with him attending secret meetings sponsored by alienated conservatives who see the times changing in ways that make them uncomfortable, but it really went nowhere in my opinion.  Conversly, the third (third!) major plotline, about Nelson Rockefeller commissioning Rivera to paint a mural in his new building, went predictably where we'd expect, and was way too drawn out in the film's ending.  Oddly, for a screenplay that cried out for lots of oddball, nonconformist characters, no lines and little face time are given Corina Katt Ayala as Frida Kahlo--who in real life was quite a character who could have been put to better use here.  Also underused is the always-reliable Bob Balaban.  Hank Azaria is okay as the playwright, but the whole surreal bits that happen whenever he has a scene to write or perform strike me as Robbins trying to be arty and "profound."  The one standout performance is by Cherry Jones, wonderful as Hallie Flanagan.  Her warm and very natural performance just throws into high relief how forced and phony most of the rest of the cast is.  Even here, though, Robbins misses the point.  The high moment comes when Balaban shakes her into reality after the Congressional hearings and tells her "It's over."  That could have been the beginning of a big dramatic scene, but Robbins glosses over it for a phony and smug mock-interrogation in the court chambers--preaching to us like we're third graders who can't be trusted to figure it out ourselves.  Similarly, the walk down the street to the second theater that begins the climax could have been a big dramatic moment--what will be the fate of this controversial play, and the actors who have rehearsed it for months?  Instead Robbins gives us a victory dance before the victory--a parade of jugglers, acrobats and cha-cha dancers set to comical klezmer music that undermines what he's just set up.  We feel a satisfaction and--I hate to keep using this word but it's true--smugness, before the big night even happens.  And I'll leave it to you to decide the effectiveness--and the ultimate meaning--of the very last shot.  I still haven't decided if it works, but it was a bold idea.  Another big part of what sinks this movie is the hammy score.  It may seem piddling to talk about background music, but it really breaks the movie.  The music was done by David Robbins--Tim's brother.  Nepotism rears its ugly head.  Robbins' music is usually inappropriate--slapstick and overly broad like the rest of the film's elements, as though Robbins doesn't trust us to follow him and feels he has to drive home his message with power tools.  Yet despite the constant heavy-handedness, Cradle Will Rock never finds its tone--part history lesson, part "serious drama," part broadsided "comedy," it can't ultimately decide if it wants to hit you in the head with a hammer or in the face with a pie.  It tries both by the end, and neither works.  Ultimately, I felt like Robbins couldn't get a distance from his material.  He lectures us to the point that the word MESSAGE in bright red practically flashes on the screen.  Understatement is not in his bag of tricks.  It's not that I disagree with much of what he has to say, but he fairly hits you over the head with it, and acts as though he's the first one to show you upper-class hypocracy.  The one really interesting plot thread--about how the Hallie Flanagans of the world were called before the House UnAmerican Committee to defend their loyalty while the Hearsts of America appeased dictators by buying art from them (and thereby financing their fascism)--is the highlight of the film.  But even here Robbins stages a garish costume party to drive home the point and again whips out the power tools.  Tim, we get it.  Despite this negative review, the film might be interesting to see just for the fascinating history lesson that it is.  Or you could go online or to a library and find some nonfiction material on the subject matter.  I read somewhere that originally none other than Orson Welles himself was set to make this film, but the deal never got off the ground and then he died.  That's too bad.  I would like to have seen what he could have done with this material.  As it is, Robbins is too close to it--too loud, too preachy, too self-righteous--to pull it off. 
 I promptly emailed the company and told them that I ordered the wrong book. I asked them if there was any way for them to stop my order. They never replied and it still too 2 weeks for me to recieve my book. When I received my book there was not receipt or return address 
 Dull and inane come to mind. Consists mostly of Peabody's artificially "catty" - sometimes racist - first-person remarks about everyone she meets (even the cat), fuzzy descriptions of Egyptian "archaeology" (...). The plot is slow moving, cliché and peopled with characters that come across as cardboard cutouts. I found more of pennance than pleasure in this read. Avoid it 
 ...that they even made it this far and to 11. Seriously now, Kidz Bop has to stop ruining decent songs that a lot of people like. I'm pretty sure that these 20something idiots that give this 4 or 5 song reviews have no taste in music. What even shocks me more is that this sold really well in it's first week. You know the saying, IF IT AIN'T BROKEN, DON'T FIX IT 
 This film is about a female student at Randolph University in Alabama in the early 60's who is a writer for the school newspaper.  She gets caught up in the civil rights movement and gets into trouble for writing in the newspaper articles favorable to the civil rights movement.  It could have been a decent movie, but I found the acting and the dialogue so superficial and uninvolving and unconvincing.  A much, much better movie on this theme is The Long Walk Home and also The Ghosts of Mississippi 
 I dont recoment you to buy this product. I dont under stand why they made i 
 this is really the most boring book i have ever read. i read the whole thing, waiting in vain for something good to happen, and while i was waiting, in vain, the book ended. that was it. the last page. no climax, no excitment. i could say that something good did happen, the book ended, but with a name like "the black album", you might expect something more ingriguing. maybe something having to do with, and this is a stretch....a black album. maybe i missed something, but the title and the fact that it did end were the 2 best things about this book. that, and i bought it either used, or on clearance. 
 Why New Orleans Matters is a short, small format book that attempts to make a case for why the New Orleans that was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath in September 2005, should somehow be restored to author Tom Piazza's vision of the city.  The bulk of the book recounts places, events, customs and people that made Piazza's hometown of 11 years so special for him.  What he describes will be familiar to anyone whose knowledge of New Orleans extends beyond what is covered in a Gray Line tour.  Writing just weeks after Katrina blew away it was too soon to correct, so Piazza repeats, false or overblown media stories that  proved to be false.  Piazza's life, house and possessions were as ruined as the city he loves and he recounts a brief trip to salvage his and a friend's remnant belongings.  He correctly, appropriately and too briefly describes it and grieves for that loss.  That's the book's second theme.  The third theme is Piazza's demand that New Orleans be magically rebuilt to recreate the rare habitat he believes will draw back musicians, street dancers, workers and the underclass whose fragile spirit animates the true (i.e., Piazza's version of) New Orleans.  Unfortunately Piazza does not provide a single specific idea as to how this can be done.  But he clearly tells us it can NOT be done by property development types.  So who does Piazza think is up to the task?  Would it be the same local and state officials who, along with federal agencies failed the city before, during and after Katrina hit?  Piazza better hope so because New Orleans' mayor during the hurricane,  Ray Nagin, was elected to another term in office after this book was written.  In his introduction Piazza asserts that New Orleans "inspires the kind of love very few other cities do.  Paris, maybe Venice, maybe San Francisco, New York... the list is not much longer."  While overlooking Piazza's Western Eurocentric view as to what kinds of cities inspire love among the world's inhabitants, somebody should tell Piazza that dozens of well-loved cities have essentially vanished without a trace throughout history, although their residents' unique spirits didn't necessarily die.  Likewise, New Orleans' spirit will animate other cities just as people who initially came from Africa, Greece, Italy, the Middle East, France, Spain and England, Ireland and elsewhere brought the spirit of those places and combined them to create New Orleans at the particular moment Piazza stumbled into the mix and pronounced it "good".  Already some New Orleans musicians are putting roots down elsewhere - several reportedly decided to stay, of all places, in Portland, OR - and no doubt writers, artists and other creative souls are doing the same.  And many of its disbursed former residents are discovering that the price they paid for New Orleans' colorful folk life was enduring schools, police, government services and economic opportunities that were far inferior to those available to them in other American cities.  Tom Piazza needs to wake up and smell the beignets.  Old New Orleans is forever gone.  New New Orleans will arise.  Le bon temps roulette 
 I am reading the book "The Westing Game" and I say that this book absolutely awful.  The book has very little details, and the plot is oh, so boring, and I never like this before. The characters names are pointlessly appropriate such as "Crow", "Turtle', and "Uncle Sam". The scenery is bad, and I could imagine better places. The ending was also absolutely terrible in all ways ever. I would rather drink tea from a gutter then read this book again.  The book starts as a pointless scenario and progress to a field of writing horror. I think the author had a huge writers block, and wrote down what ever she could think of first. I don't now how, but Newbery Award. I would have slapped a biohazard sticker to the book just to so how I really think of this book. My summary is that this book is extremely terrible, and should be destroyed.  
 Great book, but Amazon have made a serious mistake in the description.  They say it is "Leather Bound".   It is most definitely NOT leather bound.  It is leatherette, which is not leather.  Leatherette is fake leather made from some kind of plastic.  Don't be fooled.  IT IS NOT LEATHER BOUND.  I bought one and was very disappointed.  I told Amazon, but they didn't want to know and I see they are still advertising it as leather when it is not

 Wayne Grudem dedicates his book to his 'prayer partners.'  It would be highly recommended to these 'prayer partners' pray not only for Grudem's productivity (which is efficient) but also his humility.  His patronizing tone throughout the book hurts the information and disinformation in this book.    For example, in criticizing Kevin Giles' view of Trinitarian subordination, Grudem does not take into account the thorough research or the exact quotations from the Creeds that Giles actually uses to make his point.  Giles believes that the Scripture can somtimes be read to support either subordination or insubordiation in the Trinity and thus turns toward church Tradition to see how others close to the time of the early church viewed it.  Grudem takes this investigation of Tradition to be a problem of "liberals."  Instead of dealing with Giles' arguments, he dismisses his approach (looking at how other Christians have viewed controversial passages).  Grudem makes the reader believe that Grudem's way of reading the text and viewing an argument to be the only intelligent way.  Some positive notes in the book is how Grudem reveals how some theologians tinker with Scripture in order to force a certain egalitarian view on the text.  Some of his insights are pointed and worth considering.  For those points, we can be grateful.  Other arguments he makes miss the point altogether.  For much of the book, Grudem makes many straw-man cases that only those unfamiliar with the actual debate would swallow.  Grudem often accuses his opponents of being unaware of history.  Only to add to the frustration of this reader, Grudem then claims that there has only been discrepancy on gender readings of the Biblical texts since the 1970's.  Yet, this point itself is not historically aware.  It does not take into account these discrepancies in the 19th century nor how the Quakers viewed women and their roles as far back as the 1600's.  Grudem quotes Paul's letter to Timothy on multiple occasion asking the reader to see for herself that Paul says an elder must be "a husband of one wife."  It is only in a footnote that Grudem states this can be read to mean different things.  Yet in the text itself, he says it is quite clear that a woman cannot be an elder.  What he fails to mention is that Jesus nor Paul could be elders either on Grudem's demanded reading of the text (since they had no wives).  Grudem's approach, again, is confusing and leads the non-discerning reader to think that anyone opposed to Grudem must be stupid.  Grudem also seems to place an inordinate amount of criticism on Sarah Sumner, who is actually an does not come down on one side or another in the debate.  So why does Grudem give her much attention?  Perhaps because she was a previous student of his and found some of his views wanting.  That itself should make the average reader want to understand Sumner more than Grudem allows her to be heard.  In the second half of the book, he discusses how certain verses are reinterpreted by egalitarians.  One example is the verse is I Cor 14:33-35.  He points out, contrary to egalitarians, that this verse does not deal with a particular circumstances but is an universal claim.  He does this in three ways: 1) he negates the Roman and Jewish culture at the time (both of which were in the churches) as being examples, even though he admits Keener cites 26 examples of Roman and Jewish assemblies and their involvement with eomen.  2) He adds the previous line "as in all the churches" to the verse about women not speaking.  The more traditional translations, such as the KJV and the NASB do not make such a move), yet Grudem is accusing egalitarians of twisting meanings.  3) Pauls use of the "Law" is explained egalitarians to probably mean the customs of the day, in some sense.  Grudem criticizes this view for not having evidence.  Yet as that comes off his pen, he follows it by saying it refers to Old Testament law of which there is also no evidence.  Grudem, in trying to make a stronger case for his own view, will, to the discerning reader, reveal that these interpreations are not as easy as they first seem.  In addition, Grudem does not wrestle with contradictions to this so-called universal statement by explaining how women can prophesy (Acts 2) or teach Apollos (as Precilla and Aquilla did together).  The fatal flaws of the book are the assumptions Grudem brings to reading the text.  He assumes that an ordinary, uncritical, reader can discern most everything the New Testament is saying (a view this reader does not hold without qualification when it comes to ancient texts).  This is Grudem's criticism of William Webb who says we need to have a thorough historical template of the background of the New Testament in order to get at the author's intention.  Grudem not only criticizes Webb for taking some passages out of the hands of the ordinary reader, but Grudem then plays hypocrite by explaining later in the passage that you need a historical understanding of 'slave' in order to understand Grudem's point!  Another assumption Grudem brings to the text is that the text alone is enough to interpret the text.  Solid hermeneutic skills are not encouraged in this book.  Rather the reader is encouraged to see verses out of their historical context placed under Grudem's own lens.  In addition, Grudem's principle of application is that the Bible applies only in those areas that are similar.  On the issue of the 'church,' Grudem makes his readers assume that the current church is run the same as the ancient church.  His grounds:  it is considered similar enough if a church 'exists after the resurrection and before Christ's return.'  He completely avoids the sticky topic of cultural application and how a church in Corinth or Ephesus may have different cultural issues than those of today (and would evoke some of Paul's strong words on gender).  He also wrongly teaches the reader that understanding the Greco-Roman context into which Paul is speaking is irrelevant to the modern church.  This is poor handling of Scripture and can easily lead the reader to think that naïveté is the path toward preserving truth (something the Bible itself never teaches).  Grudem is concerned with "liberalism" which comes from "liberate" or "to set free."  It makes me wonder, after reading Grudem, if his brand of conservatism is the kind of theologizing that disallows Christ to set people free--especially women, their image-bearing qualities of God, and their gifts.  His rules and assumptions for the text is to read them out of historical context and devoid of the spirit in which they were written.  For anyone trying to get at the heart of the debate between patriarchy and egalitarianism, this is difficult to sludge through to get a fair reading and understanding of those Grudem opposes.  At one point Grudem (in the introduction) asserts he is grateful for egalitarian's pointing out inconsistencies with the modern patriarchal view.  Yet he then turns about and says that the modern patriarchal view is the same as the early church (equal in value, unequal in role).  If this was the 'obvious' view of the early church, why did Grudem thank egalitarians for pointing out the inconsistencies?  (Those who know the debate know that this idea and term of 'equal in value, different in roles' was understood only a few decades ago.  Historically, women had different roles because women weren't as fully human as men.).  The staunch attitude of Grudem to put himself as the sole objective arbiter of Scripture makes him difficult to stomach.  Even if I wanted to change my view BACK to patriarchy, I couldn't do it under Grudem's pretenses.  Grudem's book is a good read to understand the tone and approach of the leading spokesman for the patriarchal view.  The way he writes reminds me of one trying to rescue a sinking ship.  One of the disappointing aspects of this book is the endorsements.  It is endorsed by some well-respected evangelical leaders, like Alister Begg.  Yet reading Grudem's text makes me wonder how much these leaders have really delved into both sides of the debate.  I would like to see the patriarchal movement encourage younger, more gracious voices, to the front to be more honest and forthright with a topic as important as this one.  A book challenging the assumptions of both sides of the debate would be far more helpful than this book which feels more like a ship passing another in the night.  For anyone wanting to read the egalitarian view Grudem is set against, try "Discovering Biblical Equality: Complimentarity without Hierarchy."

 My kitchen is all Kitchenaid so of course I had to have this, but as other commenters said - they can do better.  It's a pain to set, it's angle is awkward and you have to be right in front of it to see the display and at the right angle (I'm short).  And the beep isn't that loud.  There's no clock in it either.  The metal band around the outer rim corroded too so it doesn't look nice anymore.  I have a non-Kitchenaid timer that's got the clock, 2 timers, a button to set H/M/S seperately, and shows you how long it's been since you missed the beep that beeps for over a minute.  I use this one more.  (I think it's an older West Bend model 
 This is another of those books for me that was very "middle of the road".  It was not terrible and it was not great.  It was a bit slow for my tastes and the characters were very ordinary.  
 I had always wanted to read something by Eudora Welty, and this book cured me of that.  What a confusing bunch of characters--one didn't know if they were white or black--young or old.  The one bright spot in the book was her very descriptive language 
 I am an avid reader and could not make it through this book. His other books were so good. I could not have predicted what a disapointment this book would turn out to be. In applying some of the recommended techniques, my 11 year old daughter, Emily, thought I lost my mind. Thank goodness things are back to normal. We are both much healthier having now dispensed with the advice 
 This terrible movie has singing!  Bad singing, and lots of it!  Overacted, trite, and BORING!  All those good reviews, I thought it would be campy and cool, but it's NOT!  
 if you don't like hip hop and have such a negative response why do you listen to it why do you care. these artist make more money than your ma and pa will ever make and you too. go listen to the soundtrack to brokeback mountain i'm sure there is a lot you'd like there. numnut 
 I am enraged!!! With all the great bands out there whose music is unavailable on CD, and there are 3 CDs of drek unloaded by this wanna-be variety show loser pile o'poop on this website. There is no justice in the world. While great psych and progressive rarities, highly talented rock bands of the 70's and 80's, and great albums of recent vintage that are sadly out of print languish in dank record company vaults, you can get not one, not two, but three CDs filled with the tackiest, most meaningless, crap ever released by a record label?!?!?!? AAaaaaarrrrrrrgggggghhhhhhhhhh!!!!! I cannot think of one group I'd rather NOT listen to more than these guys. They even LOOK boring. But this music is too bad to be boring, and they have sentenced themselves to endless purgatory by releasing what has to the most tasteless, weirdest and vilest version of Chuck Berry song ever with Hail Hail.....and that one of the "members" calls herself Taffy should tell anyone all they need to know without removing that shiny silver disc from it's plastic tray. To anyone who may find themselves in possession of a Starland Vocal Band disc, do everyone who may be in earshot a favor, leave it wrapped in it's shrink, toss into a garage can and run away. You'll thank yourself in the morning. -10 stars. Truly wretched!!! 
 Oh, dear.I must be missing something here, given the superlative reviews others have written. Where's the plot? Where's the character development? Where's the narrative arc? Where's the dramatic tension? I'm not quite done, but I have found this book almost impossible to follow. I can't get a handle on what's real in the story versus what is a dream or a fantasy. The story switches back between the past and the present, and the narrator's childlike voice leaves me confused as to what is actually happening. Not my cup of tea, though I recognize I'm in the minority here. 
 This book comes across as severely dated and lame.  All the people who love this book are either nerds who think they're in on Pynchon's "joke" or they are nerds who havent read a good book like Catch-22. 
    I bought this book recently after being fed up with cleaning the cat box, stepping on litter that had fallen out, and lugging a ginormous amount of litter up stairs.    The majority (2/3) of this book is about cat behavior, even to what your cat's meows mean. In essence, why cats do what they do and how they have the potential to be toilet trained.    I did more research on the internet before I began Kunkel's method. His method, for me at least, would involve more money being spent than I was inclined to spend (new box that fit the size specifications, undeoderized litter to wean my cats off of the deoderized kind, etc.). Plus, his last few steps involve saran wrap and tape that goes over the bowl of the toilet. In other words, I feel there is a lot of potential for psychological damage for the cat - and maybe the owner, too!    Instead, I purchased a CITIKITTY (www.citikitty.com). My cats used it immediately - 20 minutes out of the box - and I am highly satisfied with the results so far. It is filled with litter and fits over the bowl of the toilet, under the seat. It is durable enough that the cats can stand in it and it is easy enough to take off when I need to use the toilet (no adhesives or other mess). A hole is made in the center that gradually gets larger so that the cat is forced to stand on the seat itself.     Toilet training your cat is an exercise in classical conditioning, whatever methodology you use. Go slow and with the pace of your cat. Good luck 
 When I was first chosen to narrate this book, I knew nothing of the racist past of its author -- I knew only that it was the single worst book I'd ever been assigned.  The negative AudioFile Magazine review of the recording (quoted here on Amazon) is completely fair.  Reading the book to myself in order to prepare to record it, I found it annoying in the extreme -- the so-called prose is precious and poorly written, and the allegedly authentic colloquialisms are grating.  When it came time to say it all aloud, for the first time ever (and I've narrated upwards of 200 audiobooks) I found it impossible to invest this piece of literary flotsam with any emotional content whatsoever.  As declining the job was no longer an option, I merely tried to stay out of the way and give it as simple and logical a performance as I could, but I was unable to compensate for the God awful writing, and unable to disguise my contempt for the entire enterprise.  It remains the worst recording I have ever done, and I was, for a time, quite ashamed of it.  Now that I discover more about its hate mongering author, I'm actually quite pleased that the recording stinks.  I now believe I gave this garbage exactly the reading it deserved.  (I must add that I learned a valuable lesson: never record a book you loathe.  I was subsequently offered the execrable "Left Behind - The Kids" series for young adults, but having suffered through "Little Tree," knew better than to lend my voice to the spewing of "Christian" hate. 
 This book had a very interesting plot; A left-handed boy with a very religous father who believe that the left-side is the side of the devil. As a result Luke has grown up using his right hand. This story isn't really about baseball but of family conflict and acceptance. The basic idea was good but was expressed in way that made it rather boring.   
 This book seems to be more about how to gain a birthmother's trust and confidence in order to get her baby, and how to work the adoption system. In so doing, the book loses sight of the fact that adoption exists in order to provide children with loving homes, not to provide infertile couples with children.  She does, however, help to explode a myth: that children placed for adoption are "unwanted." This is of course far from the truth, as Burns points out that birthmothers today usually aid in picking their child's parents and nearly always want to see, hold, and spend some time with their newborns prior to relinquishment.  Still, some of the advice can get potential adoptive parents into trouble, such as placing ads for a baby. In many states this is illegal.   Some advice in this book is helpful, but I must still urge potential adoptive parents to seek the assistance of a licensed adoption agency 
 "Think Tank" reinvented Blur for me, or my view of their previous material.  I like Blur.  I can't say that they are my favorite band -- but they definitely have a place of their own in my collection, especially albums # 2-4 (Modern Life..., Parklife, and Great Escape).  The unabashed use of pop to convey anti-pop messages.  The sarcastic storytelling.  Blur was a good time party band that could also engage anyone who actually sits down and listens to the words........ more than meets the eye.  That was something to be proud of.    I started to like Blur less the more sophisticated and artistic they got.  I didn't like Blur (self-titled album) much, with the direction of the songwriting..... and I really disliked 13......... but just the same, I oddly respect these albums, as they live and breathe, even if they are over-ambitious and/or less accessible.  If Damon Albarn wants to "grow up" as a songwriter, he has that right........ even at the expense of "alienating" fans like myself.  Whatever it was he was going for, he seemed to hit it right between the eyes.    And then came Think Tank.  Instrumentally and stylistically, this was a natural progression from the increasingly more-serious last two albums.  More computers are used.  More instruments are experimented with.  The songs are less direct, more searching.  All the pieces are in place for a solid, if not as listenable, neo-Blur album.  Which would be admirable, even if non-adaptable people like me do not like it as much.  That's Fine............. the only problem is: it's not solid, and not listenable.     And thus I came upon the revelation of what made Blur "Blur"............. Of course. It was the one palpable thing missing from Think Tank that everything else before it had had.  The only thing that could explain going from good experimentation to aimless experimentation.  The guitar.  The guitar was gone.  The abstract, vernacular lead guitar........ hard to describe but impossible to mistake.  Ladies in gentlemen, what made Blur "Blur" was Graham Coxon, I reckon...   Without Coxon, Think Tank loses focus and musicality both.  Albarn and the rhythm section are left making music that sounds like it were generated by "Garage Band" or a similar computer program.  For most of the songs, there is no distinguishing one part from another.  It literally sounds as though Albarn and the band could have played the hook once and just looped it the rest of the song.  The samples are promising but the songs are basically Gorillaz clones: beat-driven, without melody or variation.  Nothing to even make them worth listening to, unless the lyrics grab you............. and the lyrics are not bad, which makes the ineptitude of the music even more unfortunate.    Think Tank could have been a very good album.  Some of the songs are catchy and border on good. "Out of Time" is very pretty. "Good Song" is a drone's lazy summer hymn. "Sweet Song" is a basic but convincing little ballad. "On My Way to the Club" is a possessed reflection on rock and roll trappings.  Albarn shows that he has grown up into quite the sociopolitical visionary, actually.  He lyrics have an abstract depth that make them worth studying.  But the songs are still skeletons, barely even real songs -- even these borderline-good ones.  And sadly, this drags the poetic prowess down with it.    Not much need be said about the songs I did not mention.  Most drag on like jam sessions to nowhere, as Damon tries to be understated and thus nothing gets stated, since if not words, the music certainly isn't going to say it.  When they finish one almost feels cheated for having listened to them expecting something to happen.  There is one exception. "Battery in Your Leg." This is the one very good song on the album........ it is no coincidence that it also is the only song that features Graham Coxon.  It is almost too ironic that Albarn apparently finished with this song as a message to Coxon that the two could reconcile.  On a musical level, this song says even more: they need to reconcile.    Blur's career may depend on it.  In essence, this song takes the same kind of songwriting from the rest of the album and gives it melody and direction.  What actually makes the song, in fact, is Coxon's eerie descending chord progression after Albarn's sincere "You can be with me"... plummeting right into Alex James' base.  The end result is pretty breathtaking... even for someone who likes recent Blur less than old Brit-pop Blur.  When Albarn's imagination and Coxon's flare come together, good things still happen..........  But while Coxon's vibrant guitar-playing can stand alone, as his solo works prove, Albarn needs Coxon badly.  Likely more than Coxon needs him.  Albarn is a freewheeler without the musical aptitude to make his idea's work......... and Coxon is his structure.  In accommodating Coxon, Albarn actually accommodates himself...... and what he is capable of.  That didn't happen on Think Tank.  
 This tent is alright. Its not very sturdy and they sent me the wrong parts. I bought it in the spring and this fall, with a little bit of wind its in pieces and in the garbage. I don't really think its worth the money. It is very spacious, just wish it was better made.

 Hacking Wireless Networks for Dummies is a terrible book. If you are a regular person with social skills you have likely noticed that computer guys do not know how to communicate. They enjoy being geeky and learning all the techno speak of certain topics so they can try and sound smart. This is exactly what this book is 387 pages of. The authors are classic computer geeks who love their nonsense talk.  Nothing is really explained. This is a "Dummies" book. That would suggest to me that the authors are going to drop the geek babble and talk like humans. They do not. Fortunately I have the computer knowledge to follow techno babble. What is unfortunate is these guys are very inaccurate. They babble on (they repeat sections of the book MANY times, cut and paste style) almost as if they just wanted to fill pages. Many of the tools discussed are known not to work. They recommend Linux and Unix tools knowing full well the "Dummie" audience will not be able to use this info.  The entire book is more of a 387 page advertisement for why wireless is insecure (the first chapter is an advertisement). You will not know how to hack anything after reading this book. The 387 pages could have easily been pared to 150. Take out all the repetition and nonsense (they babble on about garbage throughout the book)  I used to like and recommend Dummies books years ago. However I haven't found many in the last few years that really cover a topic well. It seems like they simply want to put the title on the shelves. The content is not a concern. If you are a regular person this book will put you to sleep. If you do manage to get thru it you will learn very little. If you are a computer expert this book contains absolutely nothing that you cannot find in any forum on the net. There is no useful info in this book. Internet forums are free and up to date. A few Google searches would provide more value then this 387 pages of repetitive nonsense.  If you see it in the bargain bin for $1 ... PASS. 
    Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are acttually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 I opened this book very neutrally--I had never heard anything about Susan Sontag except her name, in a preface to an Annie Leibovitz book.  I still can't believe some of the things I read.  Sontag mentions in the foreword that she has an "obsession" with photography.  I would argue that she has an obsession with resenting photography. She begins by comparing a camera to a gun and the act of taking a picture to rape.  To a certain point, I can understand this--being photographed is a very self-conscious experience.  But somehow, I think rape victims would laugh at this comparision.  Self-consciousness is not exactly rape.  Also, she seems to believe that all photography is taken completely without the consent of the subject(s); they are innocent victims being raped by guns.  The last time I checked, most of the photographers she mentions (Diane Arbus, Richard Avedon, Edward Weston, Julia Margaret Cameron) took pictures only with express permission, and many (Eugene Atget, Ansel Adams, etc.) did not take pictures of people at all.  Almost all good pictures, with the exception of Henri Cartier-Bresson type photography, requires tacit consent between photographer and subject.   Sontag's resentment seems to come mostly from the resentment generated by photography's replacement of writing in description.  Specifically, she says that whereas photograpy "steals" the pain of others, writing uses only one's own pain.  This is funny, since I remember reading about how Jane Austen's neighbors complained because their lives were being stolen for her books.  Ever since the art of storytelling began writers and storytellers have been "stealing" other people's lives, their pain, etc.  Fitzgerald used Zelda's insanity just as David Bailey photographed Marie Helvin.  I believe that the art of writing and the art of photography are incredibly similar, and Sontag sounds very sour grapes.  How is Strand's photographing the famous "Blind Woman" different from Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood?" My biggest objection to Sontag, however, is her lack of either proof or explanation.  She simply states opinions as if they were facts, and then stops.  For example, according to Sontag, Weston is now regarded as antiquated and cliche.  Really?  Somehow I thought, considering the worth of his work, his exhibitions in museums, and the wealth of books devoted to him, as well as his inclusion in every basic photography class, that he was still very highly regarded.  I'm sure that Sontag regards him as antiquated and cliche, but this is very different from the "everyone" she generally to be present and in full agreement with her. Sontag also concentrates exclusively on one genre and attacks photography as a whole through that genre.  Diane Arbus's photos are apparently taking horrible advantage of everyone pictured in them, and are freakish visions of a bleak world--therefore all photographs in the world are taking horrible advantage and are freakish visions of a bleak world.  I can understand why some people find Arbus's photos terribly offensive, but I think only the extremely deluded would use her as representative of all photography. One last aspect of Sontag's book, which I found the most offensive, is her assumption that a picture is stealing the pain of others and, in a sense, profiting from it artistically.  This is despite her inclusion in her "Anthology of Quotations" of Richard Avedon's interview where he stated that the pictures he took of other people were more about him than about them.  Everyone who has ever practiced photography with any passion can testify to the truth of this statement, hence my conclusion that Sontag has probably never really picked up a camera.  Look at Avedon's pictures of a tortured Marilyn Monroe, and then read Arthur Miller's "After the Fall," which describes a tortured and pill-popping Marilyn Monroe.  There is very little difference, except that in Avedon's pictures Monroe still retains some amount of dignity, whereas in Miller's play she becomes a demon of hysteria and cruelty.  In the end, although I am both a photographer and a writer, I would say that writing has ten times the power of misrepresentation and "stealing the pain of others" than does photography 
 After reading the delightful Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, this sequel was an absolute let-down. The novel begins with the great Glass Elevator breaking through the ceiling of Charlie's (formerly Wonka's) chocolate factory and rocketing into orbit around the Earth. While beyond the reaches of Earth's atmosphere, our heroes---Charlie, Grandpa Joe, and Mr. Wonka---must deal with the malleable and voracious Vermicious Knids (pronounced "K'Nids"), aliens which resemble unfrighteningly hostile figs or turds with eyes. Far worse than these beasties, though, are the insufferable old folks whose twenty-year stint in their shared bed has made them less than useless. Charlie, Joe, and Wonka, with no help from Charlie's folks or other grandparents, save themselves and a US spacecraft from the clutches of the Knids and return to the Chocolate Factory, where the old timers stupidly overdose on youth pills, returning them to infancy or beyond. Charlie and Wonka race around trying to help these ancient parasites, who respond to this assistance with the thanklessness the reader comes to expect from these oldsters. At the end of the novel, the geriatric brigade finally leaves the bed when they have a chance to meet the President.  In short, these three are the most tedious, spiteful, unredeemable characters I've come across in children's literature and I hoped that they would be eaten by the Knids or the Gnoolies or even the Oompa-Loompas as I read this book. As it is, they (unlike the awful kids in the Chocolate Factory) learn no lessons and persist in their curmudgeonly parasitism from the first page to the last. Their presence throughout the novel rendered it a chore, rather than a joy, to read.     
 This has always been a favorite film of mine.  The story is old-fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine.  Despite having the VHS, I wanted more and ordered the DVD.  Beware!  This DVD claims on its packaging to have Closed Captioning, but it does NOT!!  No subtitles in any language,  no line 21 captioning.  Nor does it have anything else.  "Interactive Menus" means scene selections.  This plain vanilla release doesn't even have a trailer. This film and cast deserves better and I see no reason Lion's Gate reissued this DVD with nothing added.    Since I bought it online, I can't return it and neither Lion's Gate nor Artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people I bought it from 
 I still got the marks.  iwish it had of helped.  I used it for a while after giving birth but it didn't help. 
 what a crock of ****. the only good thing is that it still has the story with tommy and thats it,,, the kills suck, the plot sucks,acting really sucks, and damnit no jason 
 This is the Jurassic Park mentality of dealing with xenophobia. You just treat the Japanese or any other foreigner with the same awe and fear that you first saw (or even read) the CGI dinosaurs in Spielberg's blockbuster.  Crichton's novel is essentially a pot-boiler of a homicide thriller. To make it sound more exotic, he added a Japanese-cum-American rivalry context with any a healthy dose of "yellow fever" and xenophobia thrown in.  Sean Connery "water walks" through his usual role of the umpteenth time of being a master detective with a younger co-star being tagged along. He has seen better days. (Namely, The Name of the Rose and The Untouchables). Frankly speaking, he could have had just played Sherlock Holmes and get it done and over with.   Connery plays a so-called legendary cop who is trained in the way of the Japanese culture. So, he more or less knows a thing or two about the Japanese. Wesley Snipes, acts as a hot-headed "fool" of a co-star who fumbles and tumbles till Connery rescues him in the Highland way.   The fact that the kung fu action scenes are being inserted sparsely throughout the movie shows that the director, Philip Kaufman is using martial arts as an alarm clock to wake any uninterested audience members who dozed off in his convoluted plot.  Tia Carrera in another thankless role that requires her to draw upon her Asian background to act as a foil for both stars. The ending in regards to her is so lame and in fact ambiguous speaks for the rest of the movie. It remains respectful and xenophobic about the Japanese at the same time, that the movie doesn't know who or what it is, and this turns out to be an identity crisis, in terms of plot and direction 
 This book certainly LOOKED fascinating. It was touted to me as a literary and wonderfully researched thriller focusing upon Vlad Tepes, and as such, I was expecting to enjoy it immensely.  But between five and ten pages in, I realised that reading it was going to be a chore, not a pleasure.  This was NOT because of the mediaeval history included in the book. (I found that one thing Ms Kostova did well was to weave her "history" in with the story.) It WAS, however, at least partly due to the fact that the much-vaunted historical research is... well, let's put it kindly. It's nonsense. Ms Kostova does not seem to realise how real historians work, and she strains credulity at one convenient "discovery" after another. She is utterly incorrect in details that can really annoy, such as saying "dialect of Church Slavonic" when any BASIC historian into this field knows Church Slavonic did not branch into various written dialects. Not only that, but the nonsensical inclusion of a "lost" Shakespearean play supposedly set in a Muslim city - please!  It's worth pointing out that Ms Kostova appears not to realise that the term "vampire" was NEVER applied to a nobleman, was not CURRENT as possibility among nobles, during the period in which Vlad Tepes flourished. Had it been, believe me, his enemies would have accused him of it - he certainly was accused of whatever his enemies could throw at him. The word "vampire" was not used in Greek theatre, although Ms Kostova states that it was. In fact, the word and concept of vampire (not Upir as a proper name) have as their earliest attestation a folk reference in the 15th century - in what's now Yugoslavia (the South Slavic area). The FIRST TIME that the peasant superstition EVER is turned around to refer to nobles is long, long, long after the time of Vlad Tepes. It is in fact a distinctly discernable process occurring in the Romantic period - Germany's Enlightenment in which writers like Goethe were creating erudite and genuinely chilling tales about this newly-"discovered" monster of legend. From there, it did not take long before the English got into the act and the first full-length works were written - both trash and treasure in quality.  So the mere IDEA of suspecting a nobleman to be a vampire is specifically 19th century, not mediaeval.  It seems that Ms Kostova didn't do her vampire research very thoroughly. There's a huge amount of truly fascinating material there waiting to be treated in a novel, but "The Historian" is not that novel.  And in terms of writing... Ms Kostova's style does not take wing. She writes about some gorgeous places in the world, and some fascinating events, but the details often annoy by being wrong, and the gorgeous places are not vividly drawn in front of our eyes. What I mean is this: a great writer does not say, "I was breathless and taken aback. It was magnificent. It was beautiful", and so on. Rather, he/she convinces us by our visualisation that the place is one of dizzying grandeur, astonishing beauty, etc. Don't tell us; show us - that is good advice to keep in mind.  The characters are so unclearly delineated that they all seemed to meld into one. When reading the so-called letters of John, the girl's father, his vocabulary, style, ways of thinking, etc., are all exactly the same as the writing of the girl, and the writing of Rossi.   The character of Dracula himself is the biggest disappointment. To learn that his secret great plan is (yes, believe it) to get hold of scholars so that he can make them his librarians because he wants his library catalogued... well, it's frankly ludicrous.  And what a fizzled-out finale. We never see Dracula's power - he is never frightening. In fact, chills and thrills were virtually entirely absent from this novel, whereas Bram Stoker's Dracula is genuinely psychologicalliy terrifying.  THIS Dracula is killed because he's distracted by someone else? He's killed by a quick shot from a gun with a silver bullet? Oh dear. Originality is not the hallmark here, nor is nail-biting tension.  The epistolary device does not work well here - there's simply no NEED for letters. The notion of letters doesn't even make sense, but Ms Kostova clearly used the device because she intended to draw out the story and use the end of a letter as an excuse to break off the story at one point, presumably to make the reader salivate for more. (Clearly she modelled the device upon its use in Stoker's novel - but there the device made literary and plot sense. Here... it doesn't.)  This novel, then, failed to captivate me. I finished it in a mood of grim resignation, determined to base my increasing uninterest in it upon a full knowledge of it, rather than to stop half-way. The style of writing is a little too prosaic to really merit being called "literary". The thrills that should have been there... weren't. The denouement was frankly silly. The characters did not leap off the page into my mind's eye. And the research was wrong in so many details that I cannot even begin to describe it. And this was annoying because those wrong details did not impact on the STORY - they could have been written with CORRECT information without negatively impacting on the novel. They were wrong, then, because Ms Kostova made assumptions and did not do the research she is vaunted to have done.  In short - disappointing 
 I have only one question about this movie. And that is, Why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book?   If you haven't read the book than you don't know what I'm talking about. But if you have, then you do.  I can't even begin to explain how good of a movie this would've been if it had been adapted correctly. Half the time while watching this, I felt as if I was watching Teletubies or something, the colors were so bright.  If this movie had been placed in the correct time period with correct costumes, locations, characters, and details from the story,then EVERYONE would love it. Not just 5 year olds.   It makes me so angry when I watch this movie. Yes, its funny and charming but it is so embarrassing. Everytime I loan someone the book, I have to explain to them that it is nothing like the movie at all. In fact, it is a hundred times better. More even.   I am really disappointed. I just don't get how Gail Carson Levine would agree to all the changes that were made. If someone ever gets the courage to adapt the book into another movie, than I suggest they do it right. And if they do, then I'll be very thankful.  I just don't get it. The book is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better. You wouldn't believe how much better it is.   I am truely ashamed that this movie is even related in any way to the book. Next time, please, please, do it right 
 I found this book to be a good read at first.  As I read more, I came upon the food pyramid and was referred to a later chapter.  Disappointingly, I found separate food pyramids for Asian-Americans, Mexican-Americans, and African-Americans.  I was shocked to read some of the content of the food pyramids and found it to be extremely offensive and prejudice.  Lumping an entire race into a different "food consumption" category is unbelievable and very untruthful.  For this reason alone, I stopped reading the book halfway through.  The book has a copyright date of 2002, which makes the food separate food pyramids even more appalling.    I have found more helpful information for soon to be pregnant women on Internet searches, especially in terms of nutrition and fitness.  I expected much more from this book in relation to preparing emotionally and actually evaluating if you are really ready to embark on the new journey we call "motherhood."  
 There's a reason the price on this is low ... because it's a worthless piece of merchandise.  I gave mine to good will two days after it came. 
 I recently finished reading Nathaniel Philbrick's excellent book, "The Heart of the Sea, the story of the Whaleship Essex" and realized that Sena Naslund took a major chunk of her story from real-life events.  I suggest that readers of "Ahab's Wife" read Philbrick's book next--it is much more interesting and a truly fantastic read.  Naslund most certainly based the seafaring section of her novel upon this true story: the whaleship Essex  is stove by a white whale in the South Pacific. The men take refuge in whaleboats, and the captain is convinced by his mates to head to South America instead of Tahiti, out of fear of cannibalism, yet they eventually resort to cannibalism themselves.  I had to skim parts of Naslund's book, as it got so tedious in parts.  In contrast, Philbrick's book kept me riveted from start to finish 
 While I cannot say about the real persons this story is about, it certainly protrays the film from an entirely sympathetic ear to the Protestant side; making most of the Catholics in the village to look like criminals which any reasonable person would realize is far than normal nor even true. Rather than give pause to the cycle of hate it only seems to stir up more resentment by catering to one side.  Coming from a mixed marriage myself I can totally relate to the challenges of a Catholic and non-Catholic couple; blame would fall on both sides and I feel this film is quite inaccurate in that sense.  I give this film a 0 in rating since it's producers could not give a balanced perspective. Truly a disgraceful film and only promotes more hatred in my opinion. Definately not something you want your kids to watch so they can start picking and choosing who their friends will be and who they will not. 
 The beginning intro the C# is absolutely POINTLESS. The author should have spent more time on providing better examples and discussions of his design patterns.  Pg 110: "In both cases our events classes contain an instance of the base Events class, which we use to read in the data files."  Ok, the base Events class he is talking about has been declared as an Abstract class... and he is telling us that our derived classes contain instances of the base Events class? What is he trying to do, provide misinformation? You can't instantiate or have instances of Abstract classes!  This is an utter waste of $... 
 After seeing this film, I am pretty amazed they have been able to put what they did on to a dvd. I actually felt sickened by the images I saw and had to turn it off many times. Yes its an interesting documentary but can you imagine how the victims family felt knowing the images of their loved one being violently stabbed were being shown to people? Personally, I think you've got to have a strong stomach to watch it 
 I think I have about every cd John McLaughlin has made but this one is a big dissapointment. It sounds like an uninspired return to the 70s fusion sound that has not aged well. Sounds processed and not very soulful to these ears; but there's lots of other McLaughlin out there to listen to so pick something else 
 Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. ("Crash" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would "change the world".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.  All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...    And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch "Trainspotting", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and "Bubba Ho-Tep", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as "Requiem For A Dream", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.    "Requiem For A Dream" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over.   Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.  Grade: D+   PS This is 500 reviews.  I doubt if I will write 500 more, but who knows 
 I am sorry that this book does not seem very useful to me.  This text is highly recommended by noted authorities in woodworking.  Much of the information seems very dated.  Other areas, such as descriptions of joints and specific types of dovetails seem to be too limited to be of use to a novice like myself.  I feel I wasted money on this purchase and I wish I could see the value that much better craftsman than myself place on it 
 While I like about half of these bands music, it is just another spasm of moronic idiocy. Any college kid can get this palp form their professors. They don't need some know it all musician telling them the way it is! I mean, get a real job and see how it is. If you challenged any one of these guys to a debate I guarentee you would be dissapointed, if not a little emberassed for them. But hey, if you want to follow along like just antoher lemming, be my guest 
 This book is easy to read & sympathetic but it didn't work for me. Staying with my baby while he was supposed to self-soothe (as recommended) did not help him or reassure him in any way. He cried continually, stopping for no more than 2 mins at a time. It worked better for me to leave him, returning every 10 - 15 mins for very brief periods of reassurance. He still cried but less & less each day. I think there are babies for whom the stay-with-them style could work, but not all, and alas, not mine 
 this thing only lasted 3 days!i mean really.i charged it up and it worked fine.but it only lasted about 5 minutes then i had to charge it again.when i looked under it i noticed that stiafom was breaking off!on the 3rd day i charged it up and it never worked again!!!!!!so i went back to toysrus and renturnd the piece of crud.do never buy this toy!!!!!!! 
  A Christian book for Christian police that encourages the police to seek out evil "occultists" and arrest them. Note how the system does not have a guide book on investigating Christian and Jewish groups. The Christian coppers only have a guide book for Pagan religions. The sooner America falls the sooner we will have freedom.  In Odin's name, Wyatt Kaldenberg  
 Schneiderman's "Leonardo's Laptop" is singularly disappointing.  Promising to raise our expectation of what we should get from technology, he instead uses a forced extended metaphor in the form of Leonardo da Vinci.  What would Leonardo do?, we are repeatedly asked.  Schneiderman attempts to answer the question.  Sadly, his answers are neither new nor groundbreaking.  I cannot believe that Leonardo would simply recount solutions that are already available and attempt to make such solutions sound visionary and forward-thinking.  The chapters in the book discuss the issues with usability today, activites and relationships, and attempt to discuss future directions in several fields: government, healthcare, business, and education.  In these chapters, Schneiderman uses feel-good buzzwords like 'empowering' and 'enabling', but never moves beyond the feel-good buzzwords to suggest real solutions.  In most cases, he suggests solutions that are already implemented; in others, he simply waves his hands at the problem and says that there has to be a solution.  Each chapter concludes with a skeptic's corner.  This section could easily be re-labelled the strawman's corner.  In that section, he constructs arguments that skeptics might use, but he must assume that skeptics are uniformly moronic.  The so-called skeptical arguments are drawn with exceptionally rough strokes, which he dispenses of with little regard to very real concerns that can and should be discussed.    I had high hopes for this book.  I wanted something that pushed the boundaries.  I wanted something visionary.  Instead, I got a repetitive book that somehow didn't say anything.  I can only hope that future works give us something better than this.  
 For the love of all that is good, avoid this CD and purchase her Racine or Rats CD 
 It's amazing how idiotic and utterly ignorant of the outside world these socialists are.  First of all, any book that fails to mention the utter greatness of Ronald Reagan (truly the greatest president ever) is propaganda. From start to finish, this book reads like standard communist propaganda. No mention is ever made of left-wing crimes, like Stalin/Mao, etc. Communism has killed more people in the past century than any other ideology EVER. Any book which doesn't mention this or give it proper emphasis is PROPAGANDA. All the whining about "American hegemony", etc, have to be put in perspective. What is your alternative? Russian hegemony? The Russians would be ruling in our place if Chomsky were in charge during the 1970s.  If you read it expecting intellectual stimulation, don't bother 
 The inaccuracies in this film are too numerous to detail.  They consist not only of relatively straightforward errors of fact but more serious errors in the construction of the story, namely wholesale distortion of the chronology and roles of major figures of the period.  This has been done clearly to make the story more dramatic and comprehensible.  The makers of this film were well intentioned but mistaken.  The English Civil War is one of the most interesting episodes in European history and if can't be presented in a straightforward fashion, nothing in human history can be.  Just as bad are the crashing anachronisms in the story, especially the presentation of Cromwell as some version of a 19th century liberal driven to extreme acts by the folly of his opponents.   The production is handsome and the quality of acting quite good, especially the great Alec Guinness as Charles I and Richard Harris in the title role.  The battle scenes are the best part.  Since most of these engagements actually involved only a few thousand combatants, the producers were able to mimic parts of the real actions.  Still, this is basically a silly movie.  
 I totally agree with red hatter ..The intructor says one thing while he's doing another its confusingadn im not even sure which way is the right way now.. 
 I kept waiting for something happy to happen to this family but it was just one miserable event after another.  It didn't even end happy.  I couldn't pass it on to another reader as I usually do --- so depressing 
 Unfortunately, I am beginning to see the results of Miss Liedloff's views on raising children in my grandchildren. I feel sorry for them.  Miss Liedloff was ashamed to admit to the Indians in South America that where she comes from 'women do not feel capable of raising children until they read the instructions written in a book by a strange man.' She does, however, want you to accept the views of a strange woman who has never had children and whose only direct experience comes from 'parenting' an anteater(!) and allowing a small monkey to sleep with her. She assumes that her views derived from analyzing mentally disturbed patients can be applied to all mothers in this country.   Modestly, she lets us know that Dior wanted her to model - but she refused, although Vogue also managed to snag her for a short period. The idea of the 'jungle' fascinated her, and when she arrived in South America she observed a perfect, primitive society not as an anthropologist, but rather as an impressionable tourist. In this perfect society when things go wrong people laugh. The only people who cause problems are those who stupidly have left the tribe and have had contact with civilization. Unfortunately, they even learn a few words of Spanish. Children, even when they are old enough only to crawl, understand danger and do not need supervision.   Miss Liedloff knows why people take drugs, what causes homosexuality, and of course how to raise children.  Please look elsewhere on how to raise children 
 From the description of it, this book falls right within my field of interest. However, it completely failed to even hold my attention. It is  superficial in many respects. Often the author begins to discuss an  interesting subject, only to digress into something else entirely 
 Purchased three of these drives for a special project where we had to have three copies of large amount of data. Cleanly unmounting the drive in Windows would render the data unreadable next time the disk was mounted on ALL THREE DRIVES and on any Mac, Windows or Linux PC. chkdsk repaired one disk once. Thereafter, the only way to get at this data was using OnTrack software to recover it to a different drive. We bought three LaCie 1 TB "Big Disk" triple interface drives and returned the WDs. The LaCie's work flawlessly. AVOID these WD drives at all costs - at least until they figure out whatever is wrong with their chipset firmware 
 You people here that think Ted Nugent is a great guitarist need to get the wax out of your ears.    He had a few hits but mainly he's a crappy guitarist at best!!!   You want to hear some GREAT guitar playing along with GREAT composition?  Pickup any of cd's by these artists - Steve Morse, Allan Holdsworth, Eric Johnson, Scott Henderson, Kevin Gilbert, Dixie Dregs, Tribal Tech, Shawn Lane, Pat Metheny, Toy Matinee, Robben Ford, Frank Gambale, Yes, Genesis, Happy The Man, Chick Corea & The Electric Band, Steve Hackett, Toto, Steely Dan etc...    Good Luck for those of you that want to learn what real music is!!  Not that my list contains the only great music around.  There's been plenty of great music around for hundreds of years.  
 This is the worst movie that was ever made. I'd rather move to Paris and hang out in cafes debating French politics than watch this movie again. It is so bad that it's not worth watching just out of a sense of morbid curiosity-- it is disappointing from every angle. In this case the word bad means world-class egregious waste of otherwise perfectly good blank film. I can't even force myself to describe the movie, it's not worth the effort. I don't like thinking about the movie as I write this. What I'm really concerned about are the people here who somehow found any kind of entertainment value from this movie. Are they nuts, or just the products of our modern, mindless universities? Someone needs to tell them it's time for their medicine and to stay off the Internet 
 medieval lives is quite possibly the worst historical book that I have ever read. In this book, it is hard to connect with the characters and thus makes it less interesting. In addition, the historiacl backround for each chapter is so complex and written as if he was trying to confuse you that it is almost impossible to ever fully grasp what he attempting to say. I had to write a paper on two chapters from this book and I got nothing out of it. If you need a nice book to make you go to sleep, this is the one 
 I feel a bit releived after reading some of the reviews on here.  I thought I was too uncoordinated to get this down, but the left to right on this DVD is REALLY confusing. Once I get messed up, there's no getting it back.  I DO NOT recommend this for anyone who is just starting out.  It's not easy to pick up the flow.  He goes from showing you the name of the movement and how to it, to telling you to mix them all together by name.  I'm sorry, but when I am learning a movement, I can't remember what to do after only being told once.  I am paying more attention to the movements and doing them correctly than I am to the names of them! I'm just left frustrated and wondering which DVD I should start with instead 
 This item did not even work and for the price you pay i feel it was a rip off 
 I have been buying this book since its very first edition. Although  the ilife suite has added significant new features in version's 5 and 6, they are berely covered here. For example, iMovie's addition of styles, a major new development is covered in just 2 pages - a third of which is text explaining the feature! Also, this book is priced as if it had a DVD (it is the same price as the other editions with the DVD), even though the DVD is missing in action. The author's own 5 star rating is especially pathetic. Even worse, Heid promised "new" sections to the companion web site a year ago for Garageband [hello, Garageband has been part of ilife for OVER 2 YEARS !!!] and iWeb, and the pages still say "coming soon!".  This book needs a major overhaul to continue to be effective 
 I read the book since I am building a house soon.  The book gave very little useful information.  I have been doing my homework on building a home and consider myself above average home building knowledge, but nothing I have learned came from this book.  I took the book on vacation this summer to read at the beach and I finished it in a day.  If you have some type of home building knowledge, you do not need this book.  I can NOT think of ANYTHING positive to say.  I wish I had another book to read at the beach.  WASTE OF TIME.  
 Clearly the worse she has ever came out with!  Only one good song on entire CD... 
 I have purchased and read this book. In my opinion the very title was relished!: Why must there always be a reason for something? and on/in what grounds does the principle of reason lie?  Indeed for anything whatsoever? "Why the why?" Cool subject for me! My 4 year old copy is dog-eared and scribbled on. Those who have purchased this book surely will agree when I say that there are a great many gleanings to be had from this digestible and erudite work. A very satisifying book.    
 It's disturbing when a subpar VHS Dub ruins an otherwise decent movie. Why the dreaded "EP" mode is used for recording movies is beyond me. That tells me that quality is of no concern to the vendor, which in this case is Simitar Entertainment. I would be ashamed if I were selling these to unsuspecting customers--apparently they are not. SP should be the industry standard. Let's face it, if you are buying this movie, its because you want to see Jayne Mansfield. A good quality VHS is all anyone can ask for, and this isn't it 
 It reads exactly as you would expect, as an adventure based on a video game designed by Douglas Adams but penned entirely by the Minister of Silly Walks.    For me, it was disappointing.  
 I skimmed John Gray's "Practical Miracles for Mars & Venus," but couldn't stomach the hype.  The first 150 pages are about the power of positive thinking and of belief in miracles.  (Gray claims that the world has matured to the point that miracles are now available to anyone, at any time.  Democracy and religious tolerance are two of the enabling changes.)  Gray then sketches some simple techniques for physical and emotional healing: eat right; breath deeply; use a Chi Gong exercise to "recharge healing energy" and "decharge excess or negative energy" (or stress and negative thoughts); imagine that people have treated you better than they actually did; write yourself a letter expressing your frustrations; cultivate gratitude, confidence, joy, etc.; envision the world you want; believe in yourself and your power to heal.  I gather that the techniques are more completely described in Gray's "How to Get What You Want and Want What You Have."  "Practical Miracles" reads like an ad for Gray's seminars, or like a verbatim trancript of a stage presentation.  (On page 239 he says "Now I have written twelve bestsellers and tend to be a speed writer. ... After many years of developing my thoughts, it takes me only a few months to write them down and create a book.")  Positive thinking is all well and good, but the seminar must be more inspiring than the book 
 The gist of the argument herein is that since Westerners either A) arn't Muslim or B)arn't native speakers therefore all their reporting is biased.  It is an interesting theory, and given it one must conclude that therefore the West should either A) only hire muslims to report on Muslims or B) not report on the Islamic world.  This is not however the conclusion.  Rather the conclusion is that the West becuase it is 'bad' and 'colonial' is projecting a false image of Islam everywhere it reports about it.  Let us take some examples and see what this is talking about.  The argument is that the west is always biased and always giving us the wrong view of wonderful islam.   1)  Saudi Arabia-where women cannot drive, cant vote and can be beheaded for adultery.  All this is a fact but apparently to report these facts would be biased, thus by doing so the western media encourages the unfair analysis that muslim countries discriminate against women, even though they do.  2)  Chechnya, Bosnia and Israel- in both cases the media is strongly pro-musim in the West, however this is overlooked in this case.  In a case where the media is pro-Muslim this book simply ignores the fact.  3) Afghanistan and Pakistan:  to islamist states where blasphemy is illegal, where a woman can be beaten by her husband and where a woman who is raped can be killed by her family.  WOnderful, and if the media reports these things then the media is anti-Islamic, becuase it dared to report something that might make westerners who are used to this 'colonial' idea that women are equal, wonder about Muslim societies where they are not.    The myth is clear and the argument is clear.  90% of Muslim countries have laws that discriminate against women.  For the media to report this would be wrong becuase then westerners might getthe idea 100% of Muslims discriminate against women.  Since this is the basic argument here then probably the conclusion should have been that no culture should ever be allowed to report about another culture since by doing so the one culture might be coompared to the home culture and thus it would be biased reporting.  Total nonsense.  Seth J. Frantzma 
 I've been a fan of Heinlein's SF for just about as long as I've been an SF fan at all (somewhere around thirty-five years). But when I read this collection some twenty-odd years ago, it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether.  The fiction is pretty good (although even that isn't Heinlein's best). But to describe the nonfiction accurately, I'd have to use words that Amazon will remove from the review anyway.  For the most part, the pieces collected here represent a side of Heinlein I strongly dislike. Though I respect _Starship Troopers_, it's never going to be my favorite Heinlein novel no matter how many times we quibble over the precise definition of "fascism" -- and I'm not going to have much respect for the nonfiction in this collection.  And mind you, it's not because I disagree with Heinlein's opinions; it's because he gave bad arguments for them and called other people nasty names when they differed. Some of the stuff collected here is tendentious to the point of being propagandistic. (At least in his fiction, he was able to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically -- in short, to grok them. Not here, boy.)  Heinlein (who bought into the Korzybski/General Semantics fad pretty early on) spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions. But his own attempt at philosophy, as represented here in e.g. "The Pragmatics of Patriotism", is very nearly the worst writing on ethical philosophy I've ever seen.  Then, too, people who knew Heinlein report that despite his overall gentlemanly demeanor, he could be pretty churlish toward people who disagreed with him. Well, he's certainly unpleasant here; anybody who doesn't agree with him on the need for massive nuclear buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a custard-head. Even in the unlikely event that I thought he were _right_, I wouldn't find this a very helpful approach.  Perhaps more surprisingly, his popular writings on _science_ aren't very good. Asimov's reputation as the "great explainer" is in no danger here.  This volume is second only to _Grumbles from the Grave_ in cementing Heinlein's posthumous reputation as a rather mean-spirited fellow whose fictional characters were generally much better company than he was. When I want Heinleinian company, I'll stick to D.B. Davis, Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis, and (maybe) Lazarus Long.  And when I want to read some humane nonfiction by an SF master, I'll still turn to Asimov. I credit Heinlein with three magisterial novels, several imperfect-but-great ones, and a good number of brilliant short stories. But the stuff in this book should have stayed in his drawer 
 I bought two of these machines for my mother and aunt in May 2003.  One never worked, and the other broke down after two weeks of use.  <br /> I have spent hours on the phone with the Haier company, and with so called repair companies trying to get this thing fixed and so far, we have two pieces of junk and nothing else except we are out about 2 grand. <br /> Repair companies won't drive to my house, or they send someone who cannot fix the machine because they are not familiar with it. I have spoken to the head of repair at Haier in NYC perhaps 10 different times.  I have gotten lots of promises but nothing more.  <br /> I am preparing to go through Maryland Consumer Services and perhaps hire a lawyer to get our money back. This is after one and a half years of nonsense.<br /> <br /> This company is nothing but trouble 
 I was on a search to find a great oolong tea.  This set contained one somewhat weak black tea, two green teas, and a VERY strong jasmine. I much prefer black teas so tried one cup of each and then gave these away. Perhaps if you have a more exotic tea taste, this would be a better choice for you than it was for me. So far, the very inexpensive Bigelow oolong has come closest to a true oolong black cup of tea. 
 Before this misguided book was published, DDT was successfully reducing malaria deaths across the globe.  After it, and the subsequent ban on DDT, millions of people have suffered and died needlessly.  For example, in Sri Lanka in 1948, there were 2.8 million malaria cases and 7,300 malaria deaths. With widespread DDT use, malaria cases fell to 17 and no deaths in 1963. After DDT use was discontinued, Sri Lankan malaria cases rose to 2.5 million in the years 1968 and 1969, and the disease remains a killer in Sri Lanka today.  Carson' science is dodgy, her conclusions false and her prescriptions plain wrong.  Do not buy this boo 
 I was stunned when I started reading the Introduction and found a misspelled interjection - an eye-popping `viol' right in the first paragraph of the book! I felt so offended to be presented with such a sloppy mistake in - what is supposed to be - the most critical hook for the reader that the next thing I did was ... voil ... return the book and get my money back 
 While Micheal White's book does serve as an interesting introduction to some of the biographical history of the iconoclastic Leonardo, White includes so much subjective narrative following up the context of each chapter that he turns the "total man" goal of his study into a hyperbolic and titillating read that could very well have been lifted from the "Milanese Inquirer", if such a tabloidic rag existed so  long ago!  Hey, it probably did!  But do we have to pay [money] for a ... Italian rag?  All right, I'm no writer, but I would hate to have read this book as cliff note version for class and then had my semester grade riding on the final exam.  If this is what you're thinking, don't do it!  Leonardo would thank you if he could.. 
 It depends on what you want out of a book. Insubstantial hip?  Shallow characters that never learn a thing about themselves from beginning to end? Name dropping and cool toys? 
 One of the other reviewers gave this two stars and said he was being generous. He was very generous. If I could, I'd give it a negative 5 stars. Unfortunately, Amazon won't let me give it less than 1 star. The saddest part is that the plot itself is pretty good, but the writing is so bad, it completely negates anything else. If the constant comments concerning clothing (or lack thereof), sex, thoughts, of sex, and attempts to get sex or use sex as a weapon had been eliminated, the book would have been about 60 pages. Maybe not even that 
 Kahney is a hack, sadly, and while Mac fanatics may love a world in which Apple can do no wrong, they will be ill-served by this bomb 
 I use the extension cable that came with the adapter to extend the GPS-360 device further down the dashboard. This adapter apparently can't sustain the weight of its own extension cable leaning against the clear plastic cradle. I've only used it twice - first time, it snapped off the back half of the cradle and the second time finished off the front half. The connector sticking out of the adapter still works with the cable, but I'm going to try and super glue the cradle back together before using it again. I don't want the connector to snap off next 
 This book, which was first published 1871 in German, is one of the most important works in the history of economics. In one single book Menger dismissed the labor theory of value to replace it by the theory of marginal utility. Some of his basic concepts had before been expressed by Hermann Heinrich Gossen (1854) and Stanley Jevons (1866), but their views were not widely adopted and Menger did not know their works. Menger's contribution goes far beyond the "Marginal Revolution": In one relatively small volume he developed a complete economic theory, which explains the nature of rent, wages, exchange value and money much more coherently than the classical economics of Smith and Ricardo did. Together with Leon Walras (both of them unaware of each others works) Menger layed the foundations of modern mainstream economics. Menger's work is far more accessible than Walras', also because Menger did nor regard Maths as relevant for economics. Adherents of the Austrian School of economics venerate Menger as the founder of their sect. Like Marx Menger was extremely literate, well versed in Aristotelian logic and able to read German, English, French, Italian, Latin an Old Greek, but his writing style (in German) is by far inferior to that of Marx.  There is one thing, that Marx, Menger and mainstream economics have in common: They mistake their models, which are abstractions of reality, for reality itself. Also Mengers theory, stringent as it otherwise is, has some obvious flaws: Menger can not convincingly explain entrepreneurial profit; he reduces it to a kind of wage, that the entrepreneur receives for organizing production. Menger ardently rejected the method of the contemporaneous German Historical School, but when it comes to explaining the nature of money, he amply uses historical facts in his argument. As he dismisses the notion, that money is based on convention, he gets into difficulty to explain, how worthless little pieces of copper can effectively act as secondary coins. On a close look Menger's whole theory is based on an incomplete axiom: Economy is not driven by people's needs, but by the needs of the people who can afford. Inequality of income distribution is a set fact before people begin to articulate their needs.  Where does this inequality of income distribution stem from? You can not sensibly exclude history from economics, if you want to answer this question. A clear hint to the answer lies in the fact, that serfdom had been abolished in Austria only 24 years before Menger wrote his "Principles". Of cause the former serfs were obliged to make high payments to their former feudal lords to recompense them for their loss - private property is sacred, you know. These recompensation payments were still under way in Menger's times. Though Menger frequently quotes examples of archaic handcraft in Eastern Europe, feudalism is not mentioned with one single word in his "Principles". Was it all by chance that Von Böhm-Bawerk, Von Hayek and Von Mises, the most prominent economists of the Austrian School that followed Menger, were all members of the (former feudal) aristocracy? 
 It was written in the style of Dracula with alot of correspondence. The auther was also very biased towards Houdini. It was not very objective

 The pretentious photo of the author in a flowing ballgown on the back cover should have been the first warning.  I've never read a Danielle Steel before and I won't be speeding to the nearest Barnes & Noble to get another one.  Other reviewers have commented on the annoying amount of repetition;  I picked up on that before reading the reviews.  There have also been suggestions that Steel needs an editor.  For gawd's sake, she writes for one of the biggest publishers in the world!  They must have hundreds of editors but perhaps, just perhaps, they are intimidated by the prolific Ms. Steel.  Then there are some worldclass gaps in credibility.  Nobody could be as eccentric as Stanley and run a powerful (and megarich) conglomerate. There's no way a house as large as The House (in the center of San Francisco, no less) could ever be bought and restored for $750,000.  The oh-so-happy ending is as predictable as the setting's weather.  Ms. Steel has made a lot of money from her readers.  They deserve better than this 
 THE ACTING IS VERY BAD. A 3RD GRADE CHILD AT A SCHOOL PLAY IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE PATHETIC ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE. THE PLOT IS CORNY. PLEASE, RENT IT FIRST IF YOU MUST SEE IT. IT IS JUST STUPID. I DON'T WANT YOU TO WASTE YOUR MONEY 
 If you want to know why a cross section of people in the US knit, this is somewhat interesting.  There are no illustrations, just a few line drawings that do nothing to add to the book.  
 I found this book to be disgusting, and lacking any redeeming qualities or messages.  I agree with the reader who stated the language is shocking, only for other reasons entirely.  If you don't like trash, you won't like this book 
 This book was very disappointing, and quite frankly depressing for a new mother. My least favorite part was when the mother told the son you had better get here quick, and the image of him rocking what may be a dying mother was a little too much. There are sentimental stories, but this is just plain maudlin. 
 i'm a nora roberts fan, so picking up a book of hers to read is something i look forward to. after reading "born in fire", i was eager to find out what kind of romance the cool and collected brianna would find in "born in ice".  brianna is a young woman who is uncomfortable with conflict, and because she grew up in a household where her fiery sister maggie and embittered mom maeve were always battling, she developed the ability to keep a calm facade in the face of a storm. she has done a good job of disciplining her emotions to the point where they can't create further conflict, even if she burns with anger inside. she's very family oriented and longs for a husband and family of her own. after being jilted weeks before her wedding a decade before the timing of the story, she thinks she'll never have what she dreams of.  she owns a bed and breakfast in a small town in ireland where she is the perfect hostess. she's always hospitable to her guests. she's a gifted artist in both the kitchen and garden, two places she loves to be. although she's surrounded by folks who love her, she's still lonely.  and then comes grayson, the american writer who pops in for a couple of months to write a novel as inspired by the scenery and ambience of ireland. he's one who lives in the moment, ignoring his past and unwilling to plan the future because of the commitment and responsibilities such an action would create.  the characters compliment each other well. they're both generous and both suffering from childhoods where they didn't feel loved. she's comfortable with the idea of laying down roots but he's not. that's where the conflict comes to play.   and that's kinda where i've got a problem with the book. this is supposed to be a guy who doesn't want emotional ties, yet early in the book he's already willingly becoming emotionally attached to her. there simply wasn't enough resistance from him for me to believe he was really afraid of settling down. there was very little if any sexual tension here, and not enough situations to warrant sexual tension. a couple of encounters of kissing and then they were in bed. and even then, it seemed like he wasn't really fighting himself for being there. there simply wasn't enough of an inner conflict within him. it all seemed like lukewarm resistance.  and brianna was simply a saint. i would have liked to see her emote a little more. i understand that she was written to be an ice princess of sorts, but i don't think roberts did a good job of depicting her as a character who was a carefully contained boiler. at times i found it difficult to believe brianna could exhibit any kind of real passion with grayson.   there were alot of slow moments in the book that made me wishing i was already near the end. i will say that the ending was sweet. also, it was great seeing how the relationship of maggie and rogan progressed from "born in fire".  i'd recommend this book to anyone who likes reading about the vividness of a writer's imagination, as roberts did a great job with grayson in that respect. however, if you're looking for a "can't put down" romance novel, this ain't it 
 Good socks. , nice material. but on the second day of using them one sock had a tiny hole in it. They are knee high and stay up, provide good warmth in the cold weather 
 What Michael Cunningham does best in this book is the little things.  Similes and metaphors and various details are almost always right on.  The story itself, told in alternating first persons, spends most of its time telling us about the characters, especially toward the end.  It seems we have four psychologists who do very little other than analyze themselves and the others.  First, people don't analyze themselves or others nearly to this degree.  Second, the characters actually do very little when not analyzing.  Two other issues are the improbable three-way love affair and Bobby's indefinable sexual orientation.  The worst problem of all is that this is a character-driven novel and I just didn't care about what happed to any of the characters 
 I chose this book for my book club because I had read Erdrich's other novel, The Master Butcher's Singing Club, which was flawed, but still great reading.  I was so disappointed in this novel.  It did not meet my expectations.  I expected the wise and wonderful writing I encountered in The Master Butcher's Singing Club, but was given plot twists that were just plain silly.  The author ruined her opporunity to say something profound with Sita's death by throwing in dead body humor a la "Weekend at Bernie's."  Although for the most part I found her characters compelling, I felt like this book had very little to say. I am less inclined to try her other novels after reading this one.  
 The most disappointing part of this book is its blatant political slant.  The book is NOT about a theory of leadership, but about an ideological judgement of the performance of leaders.  Heifetz starts by insisting that leadership is necessarily tied to values because if you disagree....then the rest of his book is meaningless.  Heifetz believes that to be a good leader you have to adopt positions that he advocates and if you don't, then you aren't a good leader.  So, in Heifetz's world, Reagan wasn't a good leader, but LBJ was.    Do yourself a favor and keep surfing... 
 The oval Rival crockpots have a design flaw. The lids do not properly fit. This causes condensation to leak out of the pot and onto the counter. I am not able to leave this on if I will be leaving for the day, because I am afraid that all the water will ruin my countertops and flooring (It really creates a large puddle!) I contacted the company but they didn't respond. I highly discourage the purchase of this product! 
 I thought I'd find more logical techniques for sleep from Dr Brazelton since I enjoy all his other books, but this book just follows the old-school cry it out method. I did find many non-crying solutions in a newer book called the No Cry Sleep Solution. 
 I ran the games in this book through Fritz and they are ripe with bad moves.  There is little explanation given.  Most of the information is suppose to be understood already.  This isn't a good book for newcomers.  I'm not new to chess and I have learned more from other books than from this one.  I'm not here to tell you what books to get but there are better ones out there 
 I happened on this book while just browsing in a bookstore and because I have enjoyed Cornwell's writing in the past, bought it without reading any reviews.  I have learned my lesson.  I was totally disappointed and felt that the story had absolutely no depth and was poorly written.  She (Cornwell) would have been better off to trash this one, as I am sure that this book will give many of her fans a real cause to pause before buying another of her books. A real waste of time and money. 
 I brought it as a follow up to the book "The Watsons Go To Birmingham" about a fictional family whose sister was at the church at the time of the bombing but escaped unharm.  The movie was not appropiate for 11 - 13 years old.  It was too graphic and too many details 
 As far as Ice T vehicles go this one is pretty good.  Ice T gives a totally believable performance as a former rap artist desperately trying to parlay his past sucess in the music business into a career as a bad actor.  His acting is probably improving though, but who can tell?  Unfortunately Science cannot yet measure the miniscule improvement in his talent and Amazon does not provide me with the option of anything less than one star... All that aside, Ice T is not totally to blame for this movie's garbage-ness.  The script is pretty weak and the supporting cast is not very supportive.  Maybe I couldn't suspend my disbelief, but in certain scenes, like all the ones where people are being stealthy, they are not stealthy, they are clearly in plain view of the people they sneak up on.  The Stealth Bomber featured in the film spends most of its time parked in a garage.  And when it attacks targets it certainly doesn't "smart bomb" them...nor does it make any effort to go unseen.  It actually attacks in broad daylight.  I guess we are supposed to chalk that up to Ice T's lack of flight experience.  Bottom line: if you name your movie "Stealth Fighter" then by definition it should have some stealth in it.  Maybe its ironic.  Maybe the quality of the movie is "stealthy" making it appear as if it is without quality.  Bearing that in mind I give it no stars but it gets five stars--all in stealth mode 
 I agree with the previous 2-star review; the typography in this edition is beyond atrocious. I can understand the decision to make the text so large--I'm sure a lot of people will want to set the book down somewhere on their desk while they follow along with the tutorials, and microscopic fonts would make that virtually impossible--but this is really sub-par. There are so many ridiculous flourishes and calligraphic captions that everything on the page is competing for your eye's attention, and unfortunately, the wrong element usually ends up winning (those oversized bluish brackets that adorn every single caption, callout and pull-quote for example). What's worse, whoever laid the thing out absolutely insisted upon using up every single millimeter of available space on the page, resulting in tangents a-plenty and margins of less than 1/16th of an inch in many cases. Have fun reading that.  Content-wise, it's OK. The information Mr. Ames provides is not bad by any means, but I wouldn't call it "groundbreaking", either. There should really be a lot more screenshots of the layers palette than there are words in most of the tutorials as it's easy to get lost in the text thanks to all the aforementioned typographical concerns, and his methods of building hair masks will prove difficult to apply to many situations his examples do not cover. I'm not a fan of his method of layer organization, either, but that's one of those deeply personal things everyone evolves on their own.   If you're just getting started in the retouching or fashion business, there are plenty of good pointers in here. If you've been using Photoshop for the last 15 years, don't expect to learn much you didn't already know. Mr. Ames is a fine retouch artist, but he's neither the magician nor the pioneer some would make him out to be. All of his methods predate him and he freely admits as much in the text. I would not recommend this to anyone but an absolute beginner, and even then I would feel guilty about it just because it's so darn horribly put together. 
 Usually a book is redeemable if it has one of two positives: a good plot (even if the writing isn't great) or fantastic writing (even if the plot isn't great). This book had neither. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters, and the so-called hilarity consisted of two jokes (an old woman having sex and spam email) that were dragged out the entire way through the novel. Plus, you can predict everything that's going to happen with every character from page 10.   Usually I pass all of my books along to friends when I'm finished, but this one went straight into the trashcan by the pool. I'm a fan of so-called beach reads but in this case, you'd be better off making a sand castle 
 Kelly Preston and Tcheky Karyo are a New York City couple who come together after Preston leaves Matthew Broderick and Karyo uses Meg Ryan in order to get a Visa. Now Broderick and Ryan are teaming up to get even with their ex's. The problem is, the offenses they've endured (being dumped and being used) don't really warrant the horrible things they do to these two people, especially Karyo. Which is probably why first-time director Griffin Dunne used two such amiable stars in the feature roles. After all, how can we not root for Ferris Bueller and Harry's Sally? Unfortunately, it ends up being pretty easy not to root for them when their revenge is so excessive, the pace of the film is so uneven, and the script isn't particularly funny.   There's a difference between black comedy and just mean-spirited comedy. Despite a handful of amusing moments and a few nice cinematic touches, this film does not walk that line very well 
 This is, by far, the worst vocal selections I've ever bought!  And I've bought a lot of bad ones!  I was in this show two years ago and had a fantastic time(I played Nicely-Nicely)!  So I didn't hesitate to order the music, but when it arrived I found the selections chopped beyond recognition!  And not only are they chopped, but they're also simplified!  This book should be marked "Easy Piano!"  If you're looking for a good rendition of this music, spend the extra $20 and buy the score 
 This book had coffee spilled over it and it smells! I do not believe this was described as I would not have bought it with this aroma. I would use other vendor as I can't really trust this vendor's description of the merchandize 
 Although a lot of people said it is good, this DVD may not attract other people. What I am looking for is a beautiful song. But the title and the cover of this DVD is much more beautiful than the concert. I think I bought the wrong DVD.   I couldn't conclude the music is not good. It is just not my style. It may be amazing for many Incubus fans.  To me, I just feel the DVD is very noisy. When you place the order, please check on the web about the Incubus and make sure you understand you are going to buy.  Enjoy it 
 The first time I tried using this machine to make beef jerky it shut off in the middle of the process.  I had to stay next to it for 8 hours making sure it didn't shut off.   When it shut off I had to take the cover off and let the machine cool down.  And this happened about 15 times.  What a pain!  I called the company and they said that they would send me a new one but I needed to ship the old one to them at my cost - WHAT!  This is a brand new machine used once and I have to pay to ship the machine back.  Buy a different machine 
 This is a great book to read by the fireplace. After about thirty pages you can conveniently toss it IN the fireplace! This is the most boring, disorganized, pointless book I have ever read. I read it because it was recommended by Stephen King. If you want a good book, I would recommend looking elsewhere 
 'The Egypt Game' is one of the best books I've ever read. So naturally, I was anxious to see what was next for the kids. If anyone knows their pop music history, this is like 'Bad' following 'Thriller'. It just isn't in the same class as its predecessor. It took the author about 30 years to release this "book", and the time span is painfully obvious. It's like looking at different people. And this whole deal with Toby running away? And when do they ever play the game? My edition of 'The Egypt Game' gives two sample chapters from the Gypsy game, and it looked good to me. I was sorely disappointed. This book places with 'Gigli', 'Star Wars Attack of the Clones', and 'Bad' as one of the most pointless pieces of garbage on the face of this Earth!!! But judge for yourself. Don't say I didn't warn you 
 Some of the selections here are pretty great songs - standards  like "Canadian Sunset" and "Far Away Places", which was a minor hit nationwide and the only real hit the Embers had outside of their home turf of the southeast.  But any Embers original compositions such as "I Love Beach Music" are examples of  "Carolina Beach Music", music so awful that outside of the the two Carolinas, Georgia, maybe Virginia, no one knows what it is or could stand to listen for long.  While in the majority of the known universe, the term "shag" refers to the sex act, the ironic thing is that "shag" refers to something altogether different in the Bible-Belt extremist conservative southeastern US (and thank God, nowhere else), that being a sped-up swing dance done to mostly really bad local R&B music performed by really talentless groups of the region.  While the word "shag" speaks to the sex act, the shag dance is definitely a mood-killer for any normal human being.  You've got to see it done to see what a total sexual turn-off this dance is - it's about as sexy as a Texas two-step, yet an entire culture of mediocrity that only exists in the south Atlantic has grown up around this effeminate, laughable Lindy done at warp-speed.  It's definitely more embarrassing to witness when performed by a male of the species, but is still pathetic when done by anything with two legs.    Notwithstanding their on-stage outfits of the period, the Beach Boys music of their golden days in the 1960's had much too much class and sophistication to qualify as beach music (plus, you can't shag dance to it), but those unsuspecting people who move to the southeast from other parts of the US or world always assume that is what is meant by "beach music".  Maybe that is true in the universe at large, but not in the southeast.  Although the great songs of the Drifters and many classic Motown songs have been unfortunately labeled as "beach music" by those involved in the culture, "Carolina Beach Music", more specifically, is much more often than not simply  embarrassingly awful music written and performed by bands from the Carolinas, usually aging white men wearing Sansabelt pants and Hawaiian shirts.  Along with the Embers, the Band of Oz, the Breeze Band, the Poor Souls, Billy Scott and the Prophets, the Catalinas, the Fantastic Shakers, are but a few of the local bands that make tons of money in the southeast and that could not get arrested off of their home turf.  The popularity of this garbage being confined to the Carolinas says alot about the taste of the residents of those two states 
 This story went round and round with dialogue on several pages of the same conversation.  It was very frustrating.  I always liked Stephen, but he couldn't possibly shine here 
 Until Lord of the Flies I had NEVER left a book unfinished. Flies was excruciatingly dull, and uses way too much advanced vocabulary making it impossible to understand. The plot was horrible, and the characters under developed. I had trouble keeping the characters straight. They just seemed to blend together and had no distinct personality. I pity anyone sucked into reading this. It was one of the worth things I have ever read and I absolutely despise it. I would just like to know what the heck Golding was thinking when he wrote this! If it was possible I would have given this book a negative ten. A one is much too high for such a poor excuse for literature. 
 This book looks like a thorough biography which might offer some new information, but is actually a sloppy rehash of previously published sources with a nasty, petty overtone.  It is difficult to understand what motivated the author apart from money, which is ironic considering his obsession with labeling Iggy as a sellout at every turn.  The book is not without entertainment value, but I feel sad and even a little guilty at having purchased it 
 I was actually very disappointed with Maxted's most recent chick lit outing. Wit, humor and hilarious happenings are normally the cornerstones of Maxted's writing. Not only did I find the two main characters unsympathetic and difficult to care about, a plot obsessed with having or not having babies made for a dull read to say the least. Here's hoping she'll bring back some of the more spirited characters and occurrences in her next novel 
 I was prepared to warm to this book because of its promised inclusion of other amateur endeavors besides the cello.  But to these he gives barely a nod.  The writing blends self-centered prattle with compulsive journal entries.  Another disappointment--rather, jolt--was his two brief paragraphs about painting on pages 184-185.  Given his sympathy and respect for amateur musicians, I anticipated a reflection on painters who, like myself, struggle to express in our work a hard-won understanding of color, two-dimensional space, depth and authenticity.  Instead, he writes, "Well, there are so many amateur painters around, and their stuff is generally so awful, that they almost tempt me to cancel this book..."  Thus, I could not recommend this book to amateur cooks, painters, photographers, writers, tennis players, gardeners--or anyone other than amateur string players who don't know how they feel and need someone to tell them.  For the rest of us, our time is better spent doing what we love rather than reading about it 
 Weiner's theory that much of our so-called 'irrational' behavior has its roots in the limbic system is interesting.  However, the weakness of his theory, as well as this book, is his insistence on applying it willy-nilly to every example of irrationality he comes across, while failing to acknowledge the countless examples of people who don't display irrational behavior.  One of the 'proofs' he gives is several examples of his valiant efforts to drone on about his theory at parties or on airplanes, only to find that people either leave or stare at him and then change the subject.  Weiner interprets this as proof that people can't comprehend the mind-boggling implications of what he's saying.  A more likely explanation is this: staring and changing the subject is one of the only ways to deal with someone who's trying his darndest to hijack the conversation.  Frankly, this entire book read like a conversation with someone who only has one idea and who can't let go of it or see that there are serious flaws with his theory.  I also agree with the other reviewers who suggest skipping the Freud segments.  Everything else aside, they're tedious, poorly written and illustrate nothing that wasn't repeated several times in the text proper 
 This book has some insights, but overall I think it is lacking in a lot of areas.  The book seemed like the strange child of a Freudian and mainline evangelical.  The book spends a lot of time concentrating on what happened when we were little boys and how that still effects us today.  It makes some sense, but the five-year-old approach to things is very one-dimensional.  Furthermore, it didn't make a terribly convincing case because Eldridge didn't seem to do any research beyond the experiences of him and his peers.  As far as "connecting with a Man's soul" there's quite a bit there that I thought was good and should be considered (such as the need for danger/adventure) but still, it felt like Eldridge was writing off the top of his head.  For all of his pop-psychology, nothing was supported or informed by discipline -as if we should just take his word for it and ignore anyone else who has thought of this subject.  When he quoted the Bible, it was as if he was just proving a pre-conceived point.  His interpretation was very mediocre.  Eldridge's book has some interesting points to look at, but I've read better on the same subject.  It was like being given a cupcake when I wanted steak.  It was like mining for gold with a garden shovel.  For some people, it might be like a band-aid when they really need a tourniquet. 
 I was just listening to this and this album was crap! Every song is pretty bad that sounds the same and the lyrics are quite dumb. The title of the album sucks and sounds more like an album for BABIES! I like Green Day but this sucks. I only liked American Idiot and Warning which those rocked out reallly great. The nineties were the worst years in music after the sixties and only had about a few great albums. This is music for little kids. To listen to real rock get Metallica's 4 classics insted. Punk is very very weak 
 After reading other reviews I couldn't wait to receive this book and try some new techniques.  I was VERY disappointed with the instructions -- there is no way I could complete even an "easy" sample project.  The instructions were sooooo basic that they were incomplete.  This is definitely NOT a book for beginners 
 Reading Reclaiming God's Original Intent for the Church  reminds me of panning for gold in a river; there is allot of useless mud and dirt but every once in awhile you come across a tiny gold nugget.  Overall I was incredibly disappointed with this book. I felt like I was simply reading another polemic against The Purpose Driven Church, or two men whine about what they dislike about the "modern" church, instead of really pinpointing what God's intent is.    Three things really aggravated me about this book.  The first was the tremendously poor church history that is implored.  The authors contrast some magical perfect pre-Nicaea church that never existed, against this tremendously flawed corporate "Christendom" that was birthed by Constantine. Their claim, that if only we can shed modernity and get back to our early-church roots is a complete farce, because it fails to understand that the church throughout the ages, yes even the early-church, was made up of sinners.    Secondly, I was offended by the broad generalizations they made.  As a former youth pastor I was insulted by their claim that many youth ministers leave there ministries because they are looking to climb that corporate ladder (118). I don't think the general statements that the authors make in this book are part of God's intent for the church.    Finally, the chapter entitled "It's About Listening-Not Just Preaching" was awful. The authors are correct to say in counseling and evangelism Christians spend way to much time talking instead of listening.  However, they have gotten good counseling confused with good preaching.  As a matter of fact I would argue that one of the reasons the church has become so irrelevant is that there are very few gifted preachers in this country. Romans 10:17 say "faith comes from hearing the message." I would contend that preaching is central when it comes to reclaiming God's original intent for the church.  I will say that I did appreciate their point: that the role of pastor is about a calling and not a career.  I believe there is something to learn from the church of Antioch; that sent people of proven maturity and effectiveness to new areas. I would claim one of God's original intents for the Church is to send young pastors to our modern day Antioch parishes (large and stable churches). And dispatching our pastors of proven maturity and effectiveness to unchurched areas, instead of vice versa.   This book is a quick and easy read; however it does not come close to effectively reclaiming God's original intent for the church!       
 I'd read Now Discover Your Strengths and taken the earlier version of the StrengthsFinder but I could not get the website to work, even with two support calls and an emails.  Therefore, I felt like I'd wasted my money 
 Karen Rose became an auto-buy for me after I read her latest, You Can't Hide, then bought I'm Watching You. Those two are the most enjoyable romantic suspense books I've read in a long time. Rose made me enjoy a serial killer story - something that had become passe for me over the last few years.   I can't give Have You Seen Her the same accolades. First, Steven Thatcher is a wimp, his whining and hanging on to his baggage made him the most unattractive man I've come across in a romance. That he was the hero truly made this book lose a few stars. Special Agent, Neil, deserved the girl, not Thatcher, and Jenna should have stuck to her conclusion that Thatcher would always be suspicious of any man who so much as spoke to her. I just couldn't see how Jenna could have her HEA with a man like that. Each time Steven went into his childish knee-jerk reaction, I was willing Jenna to forget the guy and look at Neil instead.  I was also disappointed over how dumb the police were not to guess who the real killer was. All I can say is that I'm so glad I didn't read this book first when I decided to try Karen Rose. It would have put me off completely and I'd have missed the not-to-be-missed books of the two Reagan brothers 
 One would think that with the title, THE NARNIAN, you would find some relationship between C.S. and THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, but the author writes few details of that relationship that would make interesting reading.  Instead, Jacobs goes off on tangents that have no relationship to Naria nor THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA.  The book relates mostly about the relationships between other authors and Lewis, main Tolkien.  I wanted to read about C.S. Lewis as the "Narnian."  No new information, unfortuantely! 
 My 2 1/2 yr old grandson is a HUGE monster truck fan. He really only knows the Monter Jam circuit so I thought I'd get this to show him bigfoot. Well, what a flop. He watched it once, about half way through and does not ever want to watch it again.. : 
 This is an amazingly flat piece of propaganda, perhaps government-sponsored, to depict the events in the most flattering way for the French.  As usual, a Jewish question is totally omitted while depicting the horrors of Nazi occupation of Paris, as the issue has never existed.  I doubt one can speak truth about the war time in France ignoring this part of history.  And then, as the movie proceeds, it feels more and more as a farce.  The star-studded cast, acting poorly, only contributes to the overall grotesque impression on this film, which begings to feel as a play at puppet theater or a parody, and the music that is clearly plagiarized from Shostakovich Symphony #5 Leningrad makes the final point - if Shostakovich music is truthful, serious and profound, this one is caricature, vaudeville-like and stupid. I feel it is somewhat an insult to the true events and to those French resistance movement fighters who fought and sacrificed their lives for the liberation of their country.      
 This is my first---and most likely last---Cook book (sorry, couldn't resist). I recall enjoying the movie Coma, so when I saw this title in a pile of freebies at the local laundromat, I grabbed it. Living in Essex County, MA, the Salem witch hysteria was the hook that kept me going. The premise was intriguing, but the actuality did not measure up. There wasn't all that much mystery---it was pretty easy to guess/predict what had/would happen.   I found Cook's writing to be sub-standard, especially the dialog. He said. She said. He said. Nobody exclaimed, cried, yelled, whimpered, shrieked, moaned, responded, chortled, replied, simpered, laughed, cajoled, pleaded . . . they nearly always "said." How boring! Anywho, Cook also has an annoying habit of dropping $5 and $10 words in the middle of humdrum sentences, thereby jarring the reader out of his/her tedium. A medical lay person expects to stumble over the technical jargon, but not over simple dialog. I found this very distracting, cumbersome, and awkwardly done. It also seems that there's way too much telling and not enough showing in Cook's writing. That said, just like Dr. Maxwell from Salt Lake City, "I want my money back" . . . and I didn't even pay for it 
 When I found "Hour Game" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt.  But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as "The Winner" and "Absolute Power" could turn out such a dog.  Long, boring, and confusing.  I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an "aspiring young writer" to "help" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them.  It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin.  What a waste.  What a shame. 
 A friend of mine, who is an avid reader of many types of literature like me, highly recommended this book.  I made it about fifty pages before the confusion, depression, and disinterest forced me to cast it aside.  The book just made me disoriented and tired. 
 I didn't realize when I read that this book was a critique of postmodernism that, in style, it would be so similar to many "postmodernist" works. It seems far too complicated for me.   I am not an academician, but it feels like the author could have made his point briefly:    1) Socialists need to be practical.    2) They need to be empathetic to other people and to animals too.    3) We need a sustainable, much less violent, world.  Sanbonmatsu presents what seems like Jainism meets Marxism, although, for some reason, by way of Norman O. Brown, Herbert Marcuse, Antionio Gramcsci, Michael Foucault, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and others.   I'd suggest you try Rudolf Rocker if you are attracted to liberatarian socialism. He may not answer all the questions that Sanbonmatsu asks, but it doesn't seem for me that Sanbonmatsu does either 
 Since Chris Thile is a member of this band, I got two of their CDs. NICKEL CREEK and THIS SIDE. Music reviews can be so subjective, can't they? They're technically quite accomplished musicians, but somehow they bore me. I can't explain it. They just don't touch me in what the locals would call my deep heart. Same problem I have with Brahms. Sorry, mate.  
 First of all, this manga is NO GOOD, IT'S AWFULL!!! Before I read the book, I thought this book was going to follow the story from the game. Instead, it is rushed, the battle scenes are not detailed, and the plot is no good (Since it seems a lot of the story is missing). Although the art is good, it is MUCH better to play the game than reading this book. 
 I took this on a short trip, it proved useless. It's unstable, has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby's bottom -- I can't understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this... especially a potty-training child?   My daughter was fairly young when we tried it (we did some early PT, and she was about 10 months old). She's now 2, fully pt, but will still not go near it. If it was so flimpsy for a 10 months old, how would it do under the weight of an older child? Beyond me.  I still give it 2 stars, because it's an otherwise neat idea. Impractical execution, though 
 Having enjoyed Kellerman's Delaware stories,I happened on this one and was stunned by his cultural/racial bias.  It is astounding how often the Arabs, Turks, Bedouins, Muslims are described as "sweat stained," "filthy," "lazy" and "shiftless."  The idiot Arab boy and the dishonest shop keepers are typical.  The Israelis are always industrious, clean, eager to do the job. The "good" Arab detective, Mahoud, isn't even Muslim--he's Christian!  The description of the 1947 and 1967 wars are difficult to consume, knowing the complexity of the issues then.  This was an old (1988) book, and one hopes that Kellerman will stick to his detective/psychologist stories 
 As others have pointed out this first person/third person thing is quite hilarious.  After about the second or third time you come across this "Eller" fellow who seems to be always on the scene and always right, you look back and see his name on the cover.  But the funnier one is every now and then you can almost hear Jennifer Edstrom saying "and then mommy saved the day again ..."  However I did give it more than the minimum, because I do think there is value in getting a perspective from what it looked like from the front line.  I did finish the book, and I think I got some insight into Microsoft.    
 THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.  I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life 
 Suzanne Somers apparently has no use for modern medical science. Especially as a survivor of breast cancer (although of a very early stage) she is putting her life in grave danger by taking hormones. Recent studies have shown that women who were taking HRT for protection from heart problems actually had MORE problems than normal menopausal women. This is an unbelievably destructive, horribly dangerous book for people to take seriously. Being skinny is NOT more important than being alive. If you want to get the real scoop on hormones, talk to a doctor at an academic medical center (in other words, one that isn't going to mislead the public for personal financial gain) and see what she or he has to say. Chances are excellent that you'll be told to avoid them at all cost. Look at it this way: are you going to put your very life in the hands of Suzanne Somers? I'm sure she's a very nice person; it's just that she has no medical training whatsoever. *** writing from an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center** 
 My impression was that this tape contained the most basic ideas that author's in this subject matter have ever presented. For eg., "People crossing hands in front of their chest means that they aren't accepting what you are telling them." That is the most typical statement I have ever heard, and this tape is full of them. There is nothing enlightening, nothing that makes you glad that you bought and listened to the tape. I felt it was not good use of time or money.  Fo 
 I read this book years ago when it was first published.  Mr. Sick allowed himself to be taken in by a collection of Iranian liars as well as some phonies claiming to have experience in intelligence.  Some of the people Sick listened to were shown in the Iran-Contra hearings to be con artists who also took in Ollie North and Bill Casey.  These con artists are experts at saying what the listener wants to hear.  One guy claimed to have been in Special Forces and was an eyewitness to one of VP-candidate Bush's flights to meet with Iranians.  It turns out that he was not in Special Forces at all and he had been dishonorably discharged from the US Army.  In addition, he could not have been an eyewitness to the event he claims to have seen because he was in jail at the time.  The phony intelligence specialists have also been proven to be liars with no experience in intelligence or anything resembling national security work.  By the time I finished this book, I actually felt sorry for Sick because he had allowed himself to be taken in by these jokers.  He clearly wanted to believe that what he was being told was true.  This book does not prove anything except that even an experienced researcher can be fooled if he really wants to believe.  Subsequent investigations by a Democratically dominated Congress proved that there was no October surprise 
 Do not read 
 This is an extremely simplistic historical outline that is very poorly organized & written. DO NOT BUY IT 
 I'm a fan of Koontz but this book was a disappointment. First of all it seems that not much happens. Molly, the main character, goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing. It's too cutesy with children and dogs (Koontz, please, the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired). For most of the book it would be a 3 star book, but the ending is too cheesy and religious. What will he write next? A "Left Behind" book 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 Looks nice, protects the i860 very well.  But... I've only had it for 3 months, the release broke off after 2 months which I rarely used.  The swivel spins freely now and no longer rachets.  The cover for the screen housing gets in the way of the camera, it has to be held down away from the lense.  Body Glove needs to send this one back to the engineers 
 This is a very terrible text book. Don't ever look at this book if you are a newbie in OpenGL, trigonometry, calculus, linear algebra and the mathematic's dot product. I think this book is suitable only for the University which the author is lecturing in. My university is using this book as the core text book of the computer graphic course, the end result is that almost 95% of the student cannot code well using OpenGL by following guidance of this book, where everyone is looking for coding and references from Internet just for the assignment, how annoy it is. Further, the lecturer also cannot understand the book's content, they lecture only by using the powerpoint slaid which is from the author himself, which make the situation worst.  If I am not mistaken, the author has claimed that the book is to help the student to program graphics as soon possible using OpenGL. It is absolutely not the true. This book will lead you to hell if you don't prepare yourself well in C/C++ and of course, OpenGL API. And if your lecturer does not know well in OpenGL API or C/C++ as mentioned, may God bless you. Another thing, if you look at the exercises of each chapter, I wonder if anyone who is beginner in computer graphics and by solely depend on the book can solve the problems.  Anyhow, I rate the book one star do not mean that this book is not a good book. To my opinion, this is absolutely a good book for those who have very strong computer graphic background together with mathematic skills or those who are advance learner in this field.   In fourth edition, I really hope that the author will come out something such as 'International Edition' of this book which the content may vary from the original version. This is because the computer science syllabus may vary from country to country. Bear in mind that the Top-down approach is suitable well in author's University or country does not mean that it is suitable to other University or country. This is what I mean the book is suitable only for the university or college that the author is lecturing in.  Remember, buy this book only if you already well-prepared yourself in C/C++, OpenGL API, trigonometry, linear algebra, geometry and some calculus basic 
 This is but a short "add-on" to Timothy Kearney's excellent review of this book.  I found The Writer's Guide to Character Traits merely another textbook formula for creating wooden people.  Stereotypical.  Gives you nothing that would enable you to maximize these traits--qualify them for  inclusive fitness into your story.  At best, this book is good for (occasional) checklist purposes only.  Far and away, in my opinion, the most USEFUL book on characterization is Karen Hood's Creating Character Emotions.  #####  Before buying this book I would recommend reading Timothy Kearney's review. Re-read it. Then read it again.       
 to basic ok for sailboats not much for other riggin 
 I could not put this one down- I finished it in one evening, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, with the family and the court case. However, I was deeply disappointed by the ending. It was lame, it was soap opera-esque, it was so unworthy of this great story. Tacked-on and totally unneeded- it should have ended ten pages sooner, that would have be a fine conclusion 
 I have gone thru 2 of these sets i am returning the 2nd one for repair. I bought it stictly as a monitor for my computer, On the first tv none of the 2 dvi inputs would work. All I got was " No signal". I was sent another set and it has the exact problem again. Seems odd 2 tvs would both have  both DVI inputs not working. I have tried 2 computers and 3 cables in various combinations with no success. All combinations work with another monitor just fine. The only way I get any picture is to hook up the vga input. At that point I can get the 1920 x 1080 resolution, but only at 30mhz. If I select 60 mhz the tv says it's out of range.  Sure I could run the vga input, But I bought a new computer, upgraded graphis card w/ dual dvi output, stand, etc just so I could run this monitor at 1080p and can't. Now I've just read Consumer reports and they report the DVI inputs will not work at 1080p from a dvi source such as a computer. What the hell? Why wasn't this mentioned by westinghouse. This TV is sold as a monitor as there is no built in tuner and can't even work as one. I've had it for about10 months and still haven't been able to use it. This was for work use so the $2000 I spent has been pretty useless. Of course it a lower price now and I wouldn't care as long as I got my usage out of it. Instead I have spent many days with westinghouse tech support telling me conflicting things, telling me my computer was bad, my graphics card was bad, I had the wrong cables, etc. not returning calls, buying and trying everything I could to get it to work as per their advice. obviously there is either a bit of false advertising,or a lot of faulty units floating around. I picked this set for its price and the fact that Best Buy said I would get the best image quality with this set and upgrading my computers to accomdate it's ability to use DVI. I will be buying a 50+ LCD soon and unless westinghouse comes thru, I won't buy another 
 This book is salvagable in a 2nd edition.  Objectives and topics need to be consolidated and highlighted at the beginning of each chapter and not scattered throughout poorly reviewed tutorials.  Many tutorials need rework (significant rework) before they can pass muster.   I have five years professional experience in 3D production and three plus years with Maya.  I do not agree that this book succeeds in its mission, nor do I agree this book fails completely.  Rather, I will say the book needs professional review and until that happens it should not be defended as a worthwhile text.    I lent this book to a co-worker and he complained that he could not get through the tutorials in several chapters.  We sat down, discussed the authors' probable intent, and then went to the steps in the tutorials that my co-worker highlighted.  As we struggled with the tutorials it became clear to me that the authors were not connecting with their audience, that they had failed to preview their intentions in the tutorials, and that the tutiorals were significantly flawed.  I told him to forget it and to stick with the videos we have in-house.   Perhaps the print format is the problem, but if you are going to do a book, then do it right. Wait for the 2nd edition 
 As a fan of Tina McElroy Ansa, I anxiously awaited the arrival of this book for at least 2 1/2 years during which time she changed not only the title of the book (It was originally suppose to be titled "And You Should Know Better") but also changed publishers. When the book was finally released, I had to have been one of first people in line to buy it and I must say that I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I did not feel the depth from these charachters that was so easily detected in her past 3 novels, and the story itself simply was not at all intriguing. Though it took Mrs. Ansa several years to follow up her last release, this novel was written as though it took only a few weeks, perhaps due to the fact that she and her husband were working on a screenplay for one of her earlier novels. If you've never read any of T.M. Ansa's work before, PLEASE don't let this novel be the gauge by which you judge her writing ability. I just hope that she is able to redeem herself after this 
 I felt as though the camera was clamped to a paint mixer. After about 30 minutes it gave me a headache so I turned it off. 
 While this book may give some basic ideas that are useful to keep in mind while you are trying to understand your relationships with others, in the end it is just another attempt to give people answers they want even though such answers don't exist.  I'll admit that being a first or second born might have a general effect on your personality, but just how far can we take this kind of analysis?  The author of this book goes so far to offer that by knowing your own birth order and that of your same-sex parent, he can determine the birth order of your ideal match.  My father was 3rd and I was 2nd, thus I should pair with a 4th born.  Anyone who thinks about that for five seconds should realize that it is totally bogus pseudo-science.  There are too many factors involved to be able to make such predictions.  Not every Nth born is the same, and no relationship between Nth and Mth borns can be analysed this way.  As with astrology, the only thing this book can do is unnecessarily deter you from pursuing relationships with people just because they are the wrong "sign".  Who's to say I won't get along with a 2nd born?  Rather than relying on voodoo like this, we are better off just paying attention to how we actually get along with other individuals 
 I have read a lot of DS books and this is the worst one yet.  It was repetitive; the story was totally mundane, not even a little bit intriguing and the ending predictable.  I read it to the end hoping it was going to get better but it never did.  For a writer of her caliber and reputation she ought to know better.  The only good point - it didn't take long to read.  This is the last DS book I'll ever buy 
 We bought this for our daughter and my wife and I even have problems working it. It is verry un-user friendly.  Hard to turn off when alarm is going and way to many confusing buttons. 
 I am a big fan of the Stephanie Plum series and was really looking forward to this.  This was BAD!  The characters try to be as quirky and funny as those in the Plum novels but miss the mark completely.  I'm surprised Janet wrote this.  I'll stay a fan of the Plum series but will pass on all the Full series.  I have no interest in finding out if the characters live another day.  
 Generally I wouldn't review a book I didn't finish.  I only got about halfway through this snoozer.  Still I tasted the food and it was bland.  Please skip this stinker.  There are no new ideas or theories in this book, not to mention the theories espoused are wrong.  Lack of food is not caused by the Catholic church and "family planning" - it's caused by political systems and lack of freedom.  Period.  And although I totally support helping the malnourished, I do not support making room in our own budget to support other countries.  We already give enough welfare to many countries who don't need it or who just hoard it for themselves and freeze out the truly needy.  The author basically lectures and gives the reader what he feels is the truth, and avoids presenting the facts and letter someone make their own mind up.  My favorite quote is from page 29 (of my text).  "Virtually all populations contain very many different genetic types (for reasons that need not concern us), and some are always outreproducing others."   Pass this book on 
    I originally bought this title when it came out as a four-part mini series in 1997 and it is still one of the favorites in my collection.     Kingdome Come is an Elseworlds (what if) story set approximately ten years after the retirement of Superman and subsequently nearly every other super hero. As the story unfolds, the reason Superman quit is revealed. A rival hero named Magog killed the Joker and was put on trial for murder. When the public cried out for his aquittal and it was granted, Superman quit in disgust. The results of the public choosing a hero that would kill are very apparent in the future.     The children of the super heroes we know are everywhere. They hold society in a state of terror as they enforce justice and fight each other in the way they see fit, destroying property and causing chaos. Wonder Woman approaches Superman in his self-imposed exile in the nuclear wastleland that is Kansas and asks him to return and lead the former heroes in returning order.     When Superman returns to the public eye in issue #2, it sets into motion an Apocalypse as described in the Bible, but with Superheroes being the catalyst. The new Justice League rounds up every violent super human and puts them into a prison designed by Mister Miracle(The world's greatest escape artist) called the Gulag. All this is shown from the viewpoint of Norman McCray, a disillusioned pastor and friend of the Golden Age Sandman. He is led on his journey by the Spectre (DC's Angel of Death)    I absolutely love this story by Mark Waid, the way he wraps comic characters and events into a Biblical epic is brilliant. The painted art by Alex Ross is jaw-dropping in it's realism. The re-imagined characters are god-like in their depiction, especially the Flash- a red blur wrapped in lightning wearing a winged Greek helmet.    Issue #3 ends in a cliff-hanger with all the villains rioting and breaking out of the Gulag. As Superman races to the scene, he is thrown to the ground by the only person that could, Captain Marvel. I still remember waiting for issue #4 to come out.     The fight scene between Captain Marvel and Superman was voted #1 all-time by Wizard magazine and is worth the price of this trade alone. Even  without this fight scene, I would rate this as one of the ten greatest mini-series ever, but with it Kingdom Come is #1.   The only possible negative to this series is that you have to already know something about comics to fully appreciate all the subtleties Waid and Ross weave into this story. Nearly every DC character is pictured at least once.(A geek's paradise I guess) After reading this I actually liked Captain Marvel, who I had always seen as an even cheesier version of Superman. The fear the other heroes have of him and his power level make him hard to laugh at, despite Jerry Ordway's Power of Shazam monthly series to the contrary.   I hope my description of the story has led any undecided mind to pick this up. Fabulous art and incredible writing. (This should be 5 stars, but I can't seem to edit my rating 
 While it might suffice for a bargain matinee where nothing else worthwhile is playing, "Because I Said So" drops the ball on so many levels that they need a checklist.  1) The women either act emotionally vacant, completely stupid or out of control. If you're looking for a film to set women back, this is it.  2) Portrays those who seek therapy as unendingly pathetic. The patient who sees Millie's (Mandy Moore) therapist sister Maggie (Lauren Graham) is so sadly off the deep end that Millie even asks him to jump out a window. That, coupled with his deep despair, is supposed to be a subject of hilarity. Instead it is most offensive, particularly how Maggie is completely unprofessional, telling others about how pathetic he is and skipping out on his appointment. These acts are also intended to be a real riot.  3) Daphne (Keaton) in particular has the mind of a hummingbird. It is not cute or charming, it is cliched and mind-numbingly difficult to keep up with. It also feels like Keaton has done this role many times. She desperately needs a better script than this one.  4) As usual, it is the hot, hunky guy who is portrayed as virtuous, while the less good looking one is the contemptible snob. The hot guy is a guitar player, too. Isn't that a shocker?  5) There is far too much sexual innuendo and actual sex acts. Can't these people get some class? Daphne and Joe (Stephen Collins) even have sex on their oh-so-predictable wedding day, keeping the preacher waiting. Millie also loses all credibility and sympathy when her character begins having sex with both her boyfriends, and lots of it. Daphne also somehow cannot figure out how to turn off a website with tons of porn on it, even returning to her computer to find it still there days later. Her dog finds this so invigorating he starts humping a pillow. Come on now.  6) Daphne sings with her daughters at least 2 times for no apparent reason. Felt like more than 2 times. Can anybody say "First Wives Club?" Collins also played Keaton's hubby in that film, by the way.  7) There's too much food in the film, with way too many accidents that occur with cakes and souffles falling all over the place and on top of people. There is far too much reliance on the clumsiness of Daphne and Millie when carrying food for comic relief.  8) This film is very insensitive to Asians. In an early scene, Daphne is insulted and physically mangled by Asian masseuses. Must we always use such stock characters we only find in movies, and must we always cast minorities to play them?  9) It is far too politically correct and cliched in its trying to involve senior citizens in the emotional climax scene. So many elderly couples all start kissing each other when Moore kisses her man of choice, including a Lesbian couple thrown in for sensation and further political correctness. This scene is overtly affectatious and heartwarming to overzealous, concocted proportions.   10) Even though Daphne and her daughters don't seen tremendously rich or affluent, with Millie's character being a caterer, they all live in gorgeously furnished pads and have mighty decadent parties in their sparkling clean version of LA. It's downright insulting to the common sense of viewers.   Despite this weighty list of pitfalls, Keaton does still have her moments, and Moore is a pretty good actress. One scene in which Keaton stalks her daughter to the point where it puts her (and the dog) in harm's way is particularly laugh-inducing. But most of the laughs are tongue-in-cheek, and there is overall far more to find offensive and even grotesque than entertaining.   
 I was so disappointed in this film. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the heart and soul Terrance Howard put into his acting. I love Terrance, he is an outstanding actor but seeing him playing a pimp was just embarrassing. He did an excellent job with the acting but I would have much rather seen him portraying Marvin Gaye. Call me naive but is pimping still actually going on in Memphis, Tennessee in this day and time? And did Terrance Howard give Ludacris' character a cassette tape to listen to? Not a CD, a tape. I probably would have flushed it down the toilet too. And the hook to that song, "You know it's hard out here for a pimp." Ya think? With prostitution being illegal in the state of Tennessee and all. I found myself cringing and sliding down in my seat in the theatre when she began to sing because I was so embarrassed. Don't get me wrong, I love my black people but sometimes when we get a chance to make a major motion picture we just don't quite bring it, do we? "The Cookout" "How High?" "Girl 6" "Woo" "Kingdom Come" Now we can add "Hustle and Flow" to the list. I'm glad Terrance Howard redeemed himself in "Crash." Do yourself a favor and pass on this one. 
 Suggesting that the author only tacked on UML and C++ to make more money is a little misguided.  I dont think the book delivers what it promises - C++ and UML - but implying the author (a college professor) did something  for money was a little dumb 
 If you have never worked with WORD, have no clue how to cut and paste, and are generally clueless about fundamental editing technicques with MS products, this book might help; others will find it sophomoric in its techniques, useless in its organization, and a waste of money.  Apparently, it was written for classroom student; not for active users trying to solve a particular problem.  For the former, it might be ok; for  the latter, its utility is at negative infinity 
 After I saw the first two "Scary Movies" I decided too see this movie. I thought the Wayans brothers were the two writers, but I can see that I was wrong. This movie is a spoof with no plot and no good jokes. I could hardly understand anything in this movie at all without giving my self a headache! I myself, a teen, which this movie appealed too did not find this funny. I don't know why teens like this movie so much.  -Ben Russell 
 I have never read anything that resembled utter junk than this. I must congratulate the author on his esoteric-convoluted writing style, because it has made understanding the concepts that much more difficult.   This book has absolutely no merit what so ever. In fact, this book is so bad, I will burn my book rather then selling it to fool some other prospecting buyer into thinking this is a good book.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!! 
 Klaus Blasquiz's book is a noble effort, but weak on details, weak on pictures and unbelievably weak on editing and proofreading. One gets the impression that English is not his first language - and the fact that nobody fixed this in editing is unforgiveable in a "professional" reference book. I recently got the Black and Molinaro book, it's WAAAY better with lots of luscious photos 
 Being a fan of such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien, H.G. Wells, and C.S. Lewis, I figured I'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the American West, a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining. I did some research and Cormac McCarthy seemed to be the author to start with.  He got very good reviews (from this site and professional critics).  I find it amazing that he received such great reviews... this book failed to impress me in the slightest bit.  The book seemed to fly away from the plot for a while and suddenly, unexpectedly return to it.  I have never read a book like that before.  After completing this book I had found out more about the life of a prostitute than I ever wanted to know and also I received a free lesson in swearing.  I understand that it was custom in the West to swear, and dealings with prostitutes was common, but I think McCarthy went over the top.  This made it uninteresting and redundant.  Then there was the fact that he rarely used punctuation other than periods, question marks, and exclamation marks.  I did not see a single quotation mark and the word "and" was excessevely overused due to the exclusion of commas.  Dialogue was at times hard to follow and seemingly run-on sentences were monotonous.  After reading this book I also felt ignorant being uneducated in the Spanish language.  Much of the dialogue I could not understand in the least bit.  There were entire conversations written exclusively in Spanish at times when it seemed relevant.  I felt like I missed a lot of important information in the story. I did find that at time McCarthy did use some beautifully crafted language but the formerly mentioned factors left a very bad impression on me.  I don't suppose I'll ever read a book by Cormac McCarthy again 
 This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever wasted my time watching! Don't dispose a precious cent on this movie unless you are a gigantic Drew Barrymore fan and you are merely viewing the movie for the raw sex scenes and constant,random nudity. The storyline could have worked, yet the movie is pathetically low budget, the acting is horrid and the movie falls desperately flat. It is impossible to like this movie unless you are obsessively in love with Drew Barrymore and you want to watch her at her lowest point. It's so bad that I had to come here to  vent about it online. The director was obviously a film school drop-out who offered the actors free cocaine and produces low budget porn. 
 Elizabeth Bowen was a sadist. Read this book if you like torture 
 The only paragraphs worth reading are the once Heller got from other books, I'd suggest you'd read those if you want to know about the Tsangpo's history. Otherwise this book is a story written by a man who has little to no self-knowledge, but seems to know what Lindgren (the expedition leader) thinks and feels. Heller criticizes others but doesn't have the gut to look at his own actions. 
 John Dunning's "Booked to Die" was a New York Times best seller, and also won the prestigious Nero Wolfe Award.  It is one in his series of Denver police procedurals featuring homicide detective Cliff Janeway.  Dunning, who lives in Denver, Colorado,owned the Old Algonquin Bookstore in Denver for many years, and "Booked to Die," (duh!) is set in the world of rare and collectible books.  I really found it an interesting world to enter, and learned quite a bit about it before the book was done.  But do I believe the designated villain, a book dealer, really would have killed?  Not on your life.  And do I believe anyone would kill over some valuable books?  Not on your life.  Of course, I realize that in the current world, it must require great imagination to write a mystery that doesn't feature as villain a ruthless drug dealer with friends in high places; still, one of the first requirements of a mystery, for me at least, is at least temporary believability.  Dunning writes well, he does well by Denver, and, as previously noted, the book trade. He's a thorough-going professional, and the story keeps trucking along, rented U-Haul and all.  As, "I drove south, into the coming snowstorm.  I thought about the U-Haul truck and the mileage that Bobby Westfall had racked up.  I thought about Greenwald and the screwed-up Ballards and the turtle-faced man.  Snow began to crust around the edges of my windshield.  The road was getting slick."  Still, the book has a paint by numbers feel to me, or rather it has no feeling, to me.  Supporting characters are cut from the finest cardboard. I'd say the book didn't touch my emotions, but that wouldn't be entirely true.  It left me with a bad feeling.  Consider: the first love interest deserts Janeway without a word when he leaves the police force.  A woman who's met up with the book's actual designated bad guy in an unpleasant way is a total senseless irrational coward, keeping herself and everybody else in continuous jeopardy.  Suspicion is cast on the book's later love interest, a ploy that's been used untold times by writers better than Dunning.  And a 19-year old female character, introduced only to be killed shortly, is made a Glaswegian Scot, no less, and stuck with the given name of Elspeth Pride, known as"Pinky" by her friends. For heaven's sake, if you're giving a character only 30 pages to live, at least give her a humane name.  My yiddische grandmother, whom I loved, used to say of someone she disliked," he should live and be well."  After that came an unpoken sentence: "But not in my vicinity."  Dunning should write and be well, but not in my vicinity.    
 The 1 star is for the historical aspect of this book. Some very interesting info, especially on the early history of gold many thousands of years ago. But the recent history (late 1800's up to late 1990's) is so skewed that I almost could not finish it. It's ironic that Mr. Bernstein refers to gold on so many occasions as basically a useless piece of metal while extoling the virtues of paper currencies (mainly the Dollar) as the savior of the civilized world. To put it into perspective, that useless yellow metal, in the 6 years since the printing of this book has increased in value (measured by dollars) almost 140% (gold = $620/oz recently) while the greenbacks in my wallet have LOST 15% of their value in the same time. Gold doesn't pay any dividends but it holds its value a whole lot better than the constantly inflated dollar.     It's also interesting how the move to confiscate U.S. citizens gold in 1933 by FDR is glossed over and made to look almost as if it were a good thing. Yet no where is it mentioned that since that day the U.S dollar has decreased in value by 97% !!!! AND that the average income tax rate for the American worker has exploded in order to fund mushrooming government programs, U.S. public debt is well over 10 trillion dollars, the government debt is close to 15 trillion dollars and our trade deficit is approaching a trillion dollars! Meanwhile while China, India and Russia continue to add to their gold holdings, we continue to add to our debt, a debt that our childrens' children will not even be able to pay off. Gold kept us disciplined. Now, we are awash in debt and dollars. The dollar continues to fall while gold continues to hold it's value relative to it.     Remember that no fiat currency has ever lasted. Gold has and always will. I would like to see a follow up book with possibly a new chapter entitled "Got Gold?". 
 This book is simply horrible. Repetitive dialogue and situations. Characters that just make you groan and roll your eyes.   I've read two by this author and she's just awful. Both books used the same lines over and over again. The stories chased their tails in circles half the time. Dull, repetitive and annoying.  
 very disappointing publication-suggest you save your money and check it out of the library before making a decision-the front cover was deceptive in its allure to those looking for a creative nudge in decorating tuscany style. but the most chilling part of this book,for me, was a revealing paragraph at the top of page 106 'quote' Given that the farmers probably will not be returning.I begin to plot new purposes for the hundreds of borghi in the italian hills: music camps,artists' colonies,hospices, religious retreat centers. After all,easily taking the past into the future is part or the italian genius for living.'unquote'... well, there goes he neighborhood! i'm just thankful i got to see Tuscany before the Mayes' makeover of the whole region --some people just can't leave rustic charm alone!!...norm 
 a very good read indeed.      and a lot of truth.     but Luther (and Calvin later) went coo coo for cocoa puffs on many of the points.         Bondage of the Will is a theological invention and a very insiduous heresy.           not known or taught in Scripture.           just drawn recklessly from by certain weak inferences from Scripture.      confusing "man's nature" with "man's will" too much.             "Bondage Of The Will" by Martin Luther (the Bible corrector and slicer.    he didn't like the books of James, Hebrews, and Revelation very much, so he'd rather they be cut out, like Juhadi's pen knife.    and he unlawfully added the word "alone" to Romans "by faith", where "alone" is found in NO Greek New Testament in the book of Romans, in the history of manuscript evidence.  ok.     well Hyper-Calvinists love and swear by Luther's book on supposed "bondage of the will.    in favor of a non-Scriptural heresy.     what about Paul's words "when I WISH OR WILL to do right, what is bad is present"???          obviously there was difference between the "will" and the "inner nature".  and 'vessels of wrath' and Luther's shallow reading of Romans 9.         Pharaoh was made that way AFTER he was showing hardened resistance to God and His people.         not before Genesis 1:1 in some philosophical "eternal decree".           by the way, you're disagreeing with most Methodists and even many Baptists, who reject hyper-Calvinism and "eternal decrees" and "irresistible grace" and "unconditional election".    that's a non-Scriptural heresy taught by Calvin.          based on his misunderstandings of Ephesians 1:4 etc. we may grant that a man is "dead in trespasses and sins" and dead spiritually.     and needs to be "regenerated".      But to say that this is true that therefore man has no free will is non-Scriptural blasphemy contrary to the Word of God, no matter WHO professes to believe it.     the teaching that "depravity" extends to all of the WILL, and therefore is "total" is what is called a Bible-rejecting un-Scriptural Satanic heresy.       ther term "freewill" is a Bible term.        the expression "unconditional election" and "irresistible grace" and "sovereign grace" are nowhere to be found in the Word of God.    nor their precise notions.      the word "freewill" is found in Ezra 7:13.     Ezra 7:16.     we find offerings "willingly offered" too.      by people in the "Old Testament" who were not even "born again"  or "chosen in Christ".     and they were all "dead in trespasses and sins".      yet they were still responsible for pleasing God  and acting of their own free will, and they had a free will.        the doctrine of "total depravity" in the Calvinistic "includes the will" sense is not to be countenanced by the serious student of the Word of God.     John 3:36 says "the wrath of God abideth upon" the one who has not believed on the Son of God.     Meaning that God's wrath is not there ONCE a person truly believes and obeys the Son of God.        so if a person is "pre-elected before Genesis 1:1" then why was God's wrath "residing" on him before that?        that's not a way to treat the "elect."       Do you think that the Lord would pour out His wrath on an unsaved man when the unsaved man could do nothing about his condition?   One question that Calvin and hyper-Calvinists (and even fans of Luther's books) could never really face and discuss and still can't is how an unsaved man can be responsible for something he is unable to do and be held accountable for something he could not have done if he had tried.     Calvin's "god" was not playing with a full deck.         his theological docrinal "god". Calvin confused "foreknowledge" with a hyper-predistination.     God predistines CLASSES of individuals, not necessarily every single peron or every single person's acts.        that would make God the biggest rapist in the universe.    cuz He then created humans to rape and pillage and murder and steal.          as "eternal decrees".       the Lord is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.  (2 Peter 3:9).    Did Peter or the Holy Spirit lie?                Now to Pharaoh and "vessels of destruction".  Romans 9:17,18.     to show my power in the earth.         did you ever read Exodus to see what that was actually about and how it applied and at what point???    John Calvin didn't.       He just took for granted that God hardened the nonelect and saved the elect and that was the end of it.       rather stupid way to do exegesis.        God had foreknowledge that Egypt would not let the Israelites go.        Exodus 3.    read it.          election is based on FOREKNOWLEDGE.          not some arbitrary thing on God's part.     What is the context of Romans 9:21??        Hath not the potter power over the clay?        there is no "clay" before Genesis 1:1.     what is the context?       THE VESSEL IS ALREADY THERE.      God saw that Pharaoh ALREADY hardened his heart, and God allowed it, and thereby continued in that sense "hardening it" for a purpose.             22:   Vessels of wrath fitted to destruction.       what fitted them for destruction???     well the "wrath" of God abides on those who ultimately don't believe in Christ.        it's based on a person's own selfish will and choices.    not some eternal "decree of reprobation."  I am not a Calvinist.      which is the equivalent of saying that I'm not ready for the looney bin.  In Calvin's and even in Luther's system, the ones who are elected to damnation couldn't be saved and couldn't believe even if they wanted to.    and not one drop of Christ's blood was shed for that person.      according to Calvin.      no "straw dummy" is being built.     that's what he taught.      I have his books.  Romans 9:16,  "So then it is not of him that willeth..."     willeth what??    Calvin never found out what  the what was.      "For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy...I will have compassion...."      but that's not referring to an unsaved sinner receiving Christ.      and by free will.       as I said, "freewill" is a Bible term and idea.     (Ezra 7:13;   7:15;   7:16;    Exodus 35:21;   35:5;  and  35:29)  and in the "Old Testament" none of them was born again or "in Christ" and yet they still could choose right or wrong, in that dispensation.  Romans 9:16, "So then it is not of him that willeth...."    THAT WILLETH WHAT??       a man cannot by act of will make God have mercy on him or make God have compassion on him.        that's what that is specifically saying.     that's not saying "well man has no free will in anything."       If you want mercy from the Almighty and compassion you are going to have to come HIS way, not your own way.      that's fairly clear from the text, if a man could read it all carefully.     in other words, you can't make up in your own mind how to be saved or right with God, but it's HIS way.      it can't be like "ok, I am determined by my own act of will that God will have mercy on me."        it can't be done that way.         it is of God.            But Calvin and hyper-Calvinists for some oddball reason believe that that verse denies the free will of man in receiving Christ, when that specific thing was not even under discussion those verses.         someone might say "Well at Calvary the Lord has mercy on a man and a man receives compassion, at Calvary."    Sure, well that's the point isn't it.        The point is that, if you want God to have mercy and compassion upon you, you can't just will His mercy upon you, on a whim;    you have to obey God's will.     And the Scriptures say that God has determined that He will have mercy and compassion on no man but a man who ultimately receives His and Messiah, as his Saviour and King.   anyway, I wrote enough on this topic for now.      Luther's book had some merits, but more errors and distortions than anything truly valid.     though most of the reviewers on this ting rave.      lol.          but I only mentioned "JWs are not Calvinists" before, IN PASSING.            I am not angry with you.       I just disagree with you and your hyper-Calvinism.             and with your mis-application of Scripture, and mis-contextualization of things.          
 It is hard to convey why I found this CD so disappointing...  In concert, Randy Newman sits at the piano and sings one extraordinary song after the next for more than two hours.  He tells funny, trenchant little stories here and there, plays exceptionally good piano, and if his voice is a little flat, well, who gives a damn?  This recording duplicates that stripped down approach -- no backing musicians, no strings, just Randy and his songs.  But without an appreciative audience, without the engaging spoken introductions to his songs, and without giving us nearly enough of his gorgeous playing, the results are disconcerting.  Coming in at less than half the length of one of his concerts, the CD fails to convey the full sweep of his body of work.  And the wonderful instrumental choices are presented as mere snippets -- a minute here, a minute there -- rather than the given the full-length treatment they deserve.    I think Newman's voice is underrated -- nobody else can put his songs over the way he does, and no matter its struggles with the high notes, it usually works.  If it flattens out on certain songs in concert, well, I'll live with that -- for all the reasons outlined above.  But if it comes out flat more often than not in the studio, why not record another take?  If the answer is because they wanted to give the flavor of a live performance, then give us a real live performance.  If the answer is they didn't care enough to get it right, well, that's just lazy 
 It claims to be "the saddest story I have ever heard". Well, it is certainly not the saddest story I have ever read. Usually, sad things happen to good, thinking people. It is beyond my understanding how this tepid book can have so good a reputation. No doubt, adultery and the passions that surround it can be a great subject to write a novel, but the problem here is that characters are at the same time plain and unsympathetic. The trick, in my opinion, is that they pass for profound people, when in fact they are void, useless and jobless persons. The florid language in which the book is written gives the impression of psychological depth, but the truth is these characters have not much to search for within their personalities. Edward Dowell, the narrator, is the typical cuckold, unaware that his hypocritical wife is sleeping with another man -his friend, to make it worse- under his nose. Fool. Florence Dowell is a typical hypocrite (funny, they all seemed to me to be the "typical" something, which may tell you how profound I found them), an emotional blackmailer. Her husband gives his life to her, devotes himself to take care of her illness, and she goes and sleeps with a friend. And she's not even sexy or wicked or nymphomaniac. She's just an unfaithful common woman. Pig. Leonora Ashburnham is at the same time proud, detestable, arrogant and fool. She devotes her life to mend the fences broken by her irresponsible, philandering husband, who spends all his money on other women and gambling. Leonora is always there for him. Dumb. And John, well, John Ashburnham... Lucky guy. Rich, seductive, idle, always generous to easy women, always losing money and depending on his wife to talk to creditors. Always with nothing to do but seduce other women, including friends' wives. Pathetic loser.  The funny thing is, everybody knows what's going on but no one does anything about it, and later they all complain and are perplexed. Boring and despicable lives make, in this case, for a bad novel, representative of the worst traits of XX century literature. The ending is exhilarating by way of trying to be tragic and moving 
 Buyers beware of the hardback version of E. P Thompson's classic work "The Making of the English Working Class". Firstly, note that the hardback is a 1966 edition. This means that is does not have Thompson's 1968 postscript, nor his 1980 preface (it probably also misses the author's 1968 revisions, but I have not checked this). Secondly, this is not an organically produced hardback: the picture on the cover is glued on, and the spine does not have the author's name (instead, it has the name "Peter Smith" - so who the hell is Peter Smith?). All in all, a shocker for purists, or any serious scholar, made all the worse for the magnificence of the original 
 I am so mad at Disney and their movie "Hercules" because they changed the film just because they think they will get away with changing stories. I like Greek Mythology, but the movies have not been good at all. And this weak effort is not going to do anything about it. The plot has been changed completly, Pegasus is never mentioned in the real version, He is not trying to impress people, he had no trainer, the lion and the lion skin is not mentioned, the hydra fight is because of a different reason, ugly characters, Hercules was never in love with a chick, Hades is not a bad guy but he is not good either, and all kinds of things that I won't mention.   Don't buy this movie because it is completly different, why don't you read Greek mythology instead of watching this 
 Unable to see the movie. Received the original shipment, and later a replacement, and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie 
 I was looking forward to using this cookbook as the idea of preparing dinner early in the day and having it ready and waiting for me at six o'clock was extremely appealing.  However, I have been extremely disappointed.  All the entrees I have tried have been, in my opinion, overcooked.  Sadly, I am coming to the conclusion that most foods were not meant to be cooked 6-7 hours.  Most of the recipes I tried were a bland mushy mess and there is not one that I would subject my family to again.  My last and final attempt was the Chicken with Beer which was both dry (due to the required baking for 20 minutes in the oven after 3 to 4 hours in the slow cooker on high) and tasteless.  Much to my amazement, one prior reviewer actually liked this recipe!  So maybe its just me.  In any case I am considering givin the slow cooker to Goodwill, along with this cookbook.  There has got to be a better way to simplify the chaos of dinner time preparation 
 I just got this figure in the mail and I have to say that it is really nice looking. I have it up on my mantle now and it looks a=even better out of it's packaging. It is a must have for Kings, Gretzky, and NHL fans. Id rate the pose a 10 out of 10, it was from when he got the points record in Edmonton. This figure would get 5 stars if it wasn't for the assembly. You have to put Wayne's legs on and normally the leg assembly is easy but thios was just horrific. It is possible, but I had to use tons of soap and water just to get the legs in, and then it wasn't easy. But I think that it is definately worth it. 
 Ok.  Kyle was the GL in the DC Comic book world for a long time.  He took over for Hal Jordan who decided to take a long needed vacation (ok, he went crazy and killed a whole bunch of people but hey, my version sounds more real then what this novel did).  This novel in one word sucked.  It bastardized the entire origin of Kyle Rayner and how he became a Green Lantern.  It destroyed what happened to Coast City and how it tied into Superman.  It made the Atom seem like a pain in the tucas and the only character that was written correcly was Batman.  Hal is in this but not in a good way.  Kyle is in this and it too is not in a good way.  When did Kyle ever call Ganthet "Gandy"?  And why in the heck did the other Oan's want to remake the universe...wasn't that Hal's job when he became Parallax???  In a nut shell if you like Green Lanter, any version of the character, read the comics and put this book down.  There are much better novels out there to read 
 Well i got this toy for chrismas and i open it and tryed it and the coins that come with it i scader it around the house and it dectech 2 out of 10 and it die out so quickliy and over gras and stuff it it jam with digging trough the gras and putting it in it back hell i would never get this toy it sux with a captil S : 
 Having read both _The Revolt of the Elites_ recently and _The Revolt of the Masses_ several times, I am struck by previous reviewers contrasts and apparent misreadings. Ortega y Gasset argues a larger, archetypal predicament, that the supposed elites are plagued with the same lowest common denominator, mass or canned thought as everyone else is.  Ortega y Gasset is writing with a slightly larger scope than Lasch and I would propose that Lasch misreads Ortega y Gasset himself and fails in his analysis. Purported 'Elites' are not an agreed upon monolith, and ostensibly those advancing the thought of Leo Strauss or, antipodally, Louis Althusser can be construed as elites. Therefore, one must respond with the criticism to Lasch of which elites are railroading democracy. I find this a simplistic indictment and far less invigorating than his excellent "The Culture of Narcissism". 
 I was hoping for something that would delve into the mind of a serial killer.  This, however, is kind of a generic re-hash of the chronology of the killings.  I found myself flipping through many of the chapters.  Also, there's way too much emphasis on the church pastor.  He wasn't involved in any way so who cares?    If you're interested in true crime, save your money for a better book--there are many. 
 The bra came well packed, speedily and it is very like the picture and description.  The fit is good 
 never got to see it because shipping company carelessly left it on my porch and someone stole it along with other items. contacted seller and u.p.s. both told me basically I was out $45.00. tryed to report it to amazon but they intentionally have no contact info. on their web site. live and learn won't shop amazon again! thanks 4 nothing amazo 
 After reading this book I felt that I paid some good money for repetition, advertisement and teaching of how to get your company to send you to do some course work.  This is not what I was looking for 
 This is the epitome of lame 80's music!  Everything about this CD is pathetic!!  I hate the '80's just because of the ambigious cheese that Wham represents.  Thank god they are no longer around.  Listen to some Pantera if you would like some real music 
 This book is pure heresy clothed in feel-good, new age sounding terminology. The author blatantly states that he doesn't believe in the basic dogmas of the Christian faith, such as the virgin birth, the physical resurrection, or what he calls the "traditional" redemption and atonement of Jesus Christ. He also does not take the bible at all literally. Granted, there is much spiritual depth to scripture; however, excessive spiritualizing of scripture can lead to this type of "enlightened" Christianity.  His concepts are not Christian, but emphasize the divine nature of mankind while downplaying the role and true divinity of Christ. This is all subtly concealed under the guise of a re-interpretation of the "true" gospel message.  Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of scripture can see the errors in the author's observations and conclusions.   The author has dabbled in mysticism - unfortunately not Christian mysticism as experienced by the myriad of saints of the Roman Catholic Church. This book should in no way serve as a reflection of catholicism for anyone seeking to discover the true Roman Catholic faith. 
 I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$ 
 This book contains very good examples and is easy to follow. It would be even easier to follow if I wasn't having to continuously correct coding errors throughout the book.  If you want to beef up on your debugging skills then this book is great.  I am a little disappointed in the author and his quality control in publishing this book.  It would be a fabulous book otherwise 
 I remember that I thought, at times, that American news shows would do better if they watched BBC or listened to NPR. I simply couldn't find what I wanted to know (i have to confess I skipped a good chunck; i couldn't take it) such as an answer to "Why all the major broadcasting stations chose to use certain words in reporpting the incidents in middle east, war on terror, war o/[i]n iraq, etc? (I still don't know when it actually became a war, in terms of the offical U.S. forein policy). The U.S. disregarding the U.N.'s inspection/judgement was enough at least for some of us to doubt any yet-coming-out proof of existence of WMD's. It is a piece of news, indeed informative one, if we hear a simple truth like it's too risky for reporters to go into certain regions and don't really know what's going on there or the U.S. goverment didn't allow reporters to go to certain areas, etc. Again, some of us figured anyway because we never heard iraqis talk on TV--even now we do rarely on radio (to tell you the truth i haven't had a TV for a long time). I believe that the american media didn't fail to inform the public what they knew, but they failed to inform that they didn't/couldn't know. Chomsky, though i often find myself disagree with him, is better---by far 
 Howard Ingham is an American writer in Tunisia, sent there to write a movie script. Luckily he has received a large advance and is staying in a hotel waiting for the arrival of the actors and director/cameraman. He's also waiting for a letter from his girlfriend Ina. Unfortunately, before he arrives, the director commits suicide after a short affair with Ina, but Howard stays on in Tunisia, unable to get going with his life. He makes various and assorted friends and Ina travels from New York to visit him. He decides he's crazy in love with her, then decides he isn't. He defends himself against a burglar, then is made to feel guilty about it. Howard can't really decide how he feels. I know how I felt: bored. Every meal, every can of beer is described.  There is one good thing: the dog comes back 
 This stinker comes close to equalling that gigantic bomb from 2001 "Pearl Harbour" starring Ben Affleck. The acting is wooden and forgettable, the action sequences are humorous at best, and the direction is...well, let's just say, director Tony Bill has apparently picked up his directing chops while starring in "Barb Wire". The directing style seems to be...throw in as much loud music as possible, add a heaping helping of a lame love story, toss on some of the worst, most embarrassing lines imaginable, and let's not forget those all important CGI effects and what you end up with is the worst/funniest depiction of WW1 flying action since the Three stooges.   If you want to watch REAL WW1 flying action with REAL WW1 biplanes, check out "The Blue Max". That movie used real WW1 vintage aircraft, that actually have weight to them and do NOT perform impossible flying stunts that the Blue Angels do not even attempt using FA-18 jets.   Pacing is terribly frantic, music is insufferable, character development and construction of any dramatic impact is non-existent.  Pass this one by, unless you're willing to spend 2 hours viewing an all too typical expensive, wasteful, useless, hollywood blockbuster bomb 
 I got this book from the library based on the author's name and the recommendation of her writing from some friends who had read "My Sister's Keeper" and some of her other books.  I eagerly read the first 30 pages, then quickly became bored and even started disliking the characters.  A good writer is supposed to give you enough details about the characters to make you feel as though you know them.  I am halfway into this book and not only do I not feel like I know any of the characters, I don't want to.  They are tired stereotypes who are lacking in depth and personality.  You wonder why Eric and Fitz are so in love with this woman who is totally unlikable.  The character of Fitz is so much like every other "male best friend" you've ever seen on a TV sitcom.  The stereotypical descriptions of the "fringe" characters are so boring.  Of course the prosecuting attorney is an overweight Jewish shrew.  (aren't they all?)  Of course the character of Ruthann is a "tough old" Native American who rarely shows emotion.  Of course the carousel operator is an "acne-scarred" teenager.  I just feel that these negative descriptions and characterizations are purposely written that way to somehow make you feel that the main characters are "better" than everyone else.  Poor little victims, even.  The descriptions of Eric's alcoholic mother were just like any other suburban alcoholic woman ever contrived.  I can't even muster any emotion for Sophie.  Fitz and Eric remind me of two overgrown frat boys and Delia (Bethany) is so self-centered, you almost don't care about her at all.  I hope to be able to finish this book, so at least I haven't wasted my time reading the first half 
 I loved the original movie, and I love Johnny Depp so I thought this movie would be awesome.Wrong wrong wrong!! First of all, the child actors were horrible, well the Charlie and Mike characters were ok, but the two girl actors were the worst I've seen in a long time. And what did they do to Johnny Depp? He was so creepy and weird. I took my nine year old to see it in the theater, and even she almost fell asleep. If you really want a treat watch the original with Gene Wilder 
 I am writing as an experienced SWAT operator, firearms instructor, and competitive 3-Gun Match shooter.  This book is great for beginning rifle shooters or members of the Jeff Cooper Fan Club.  However, there is nothing explained or taught in this book that I did not also receive in my very first basic rifle school.  As with most of Mr. Cooper's writing, the text tends to become "preachy" and critical of modern society and technology.  While I usually agree with most of what Mr. Cooper has to say and write, I am not one of his many acolytes.  More to the point, I sincerely wish he would stop writing as if he assumes that the reader is a member of his fan club.  The book was a disappointment. I felt that it was mostly a collection of large photos, stories, Mr. Cooper's opinions on a lot of non-shooting subjects, and a few shooting tips.  Each of the sections could have been expanded a great deal.  At least he didn't push the Scout Rifle concept too hard in this book.  I respect Mr. Cooper and his accomplishments but his claim that "riflecraft is an art that has been completely ignored since WWII" is simply untrue.  There are better books available on this subject 
 Unintentionally hilarious, Giles has now joined the pathetic ranks of those attempting to make conservative christian fundamentalism "hip". His grand strategy? To make forced, unfunny pop-culture references in tandem his gestapo-like "call to arms" against the evil forces of the liberal and the secular, who are intent on turning the USA into another decadent Rome and destroying Christianity, of course. He turns out to be as hip and inviting to the youth of today as the "rapping grandma" in the latest teen comedy, yet this grandma turns out to be a rabid Phyllis Schlafly. Avoid like the plague 
 The author's interpretations of the quatrains are very poor.Some of his interpretations have absolutely nothing to do with the translations.I realize that the interpretations are open to much discussion but he is way off the mark on most of them.This is a very poor book on Nostradamus 
 Williams was right. Eliot has taken poetry twenty years into the past with this poem. While others are experimenting with their poetics, Eliot falls back on an Old World school of writing that would be better obsolete. What's worse is his poems just get worse from here on out (less help from Pound on the editing, maybe?). He should have kept his day job his only job 
 Santa got this castle for my five year old son for christmas. I agree with many of the other reviewers, though it is visually appealing it is very flimsy and was painstaking to put together. Despite all that my son seems to be enjoying. This toy is fun for the child but not for the parents.  
 This book relies entirely too much on clips from previously published sources. In addition, the authors did not interview many tribal members or people who aided this tribe get on the map. It feels like a book the author was simply rushing to finish. Too bad 
 I bought this book to better understand the inner workings of SIP but, instead, was greeted with a superficial introduction to a miriad of SIP applications, services and options. At the end of the day RFC3261 is a much better source of information, as dry as it might be. As such, I cannot recommend this book to anyone trying to learn the intricacies of SIP 
 I was at the airport, getting ready to fly out to Cali and I found this book in the airport gift shop- I thought what a stroke of luck I had getting a Stephen King title at such a juncture... I'm a huge  fan. Despite the fact that I started and finished the book exactly as the plane took off and landed, I was sorely disappointed.  Much ado about nothing would be an overstatement 
 My son has played with it once in a month. His dad is a carpentar so I thought these toys would be great. I was wrong 
 I liked the price of this, but I guess you get what you pay for.  My friends complained that I sounded as though I were underwater.  I returned this product - a real piece of Cr*p.  
 This book is well written but adds nothing to the discussions around Outsourcing and the impact Globalization has had on the U.S. Economy.  Not recommended for serious readers familiar with the issues 
 I've seen ethan hawk's best performance ever in this movie. it was great. Wiona ryder and other actors were great too but it was not even a memorable movie. it has a predictable sipmle story that made no sense at least for me. maybe I'm not right but in my opinion, this movie does not worth to buy. does not even worth to rent. but gh the movie itself does not worth anything but it's soundtrack issome channels may show it occasionally. It's worth to be watch once at TV! By the way, I forgot to mention that this movie has a great CD soundtrack, really great. worth to buy 
 Half the book reads like some kind of ranting reciprocal bigotry. The author jumps all over the linguisists at the RAE while revealing a lack of linguistic awareness on his own part. He actually puts forth the assertion that Basques and Catalunyians prefer to speek Euskera and Catalan over Spanish because they felt alienated by Felipe Gonzalez, the late President of Spain. ---Duuhhh! Why do you think they prefer what they do? Get a clue! Also, not relevant to so called "spanglish" anyway - just a politically motivated chip on the shoulder.  Furthermore, the book doesn't present a plausible analysis of unintelligibility between the dialects of the language. Look, the biggest obstacle to mutual intelligibility is with respect to semantics and syntax, hispanicized english words are a lesser issue. Many american hispanics actually think in english and then speak as if giving literal translations into spanish rather than speaking combinations of words that have meaning in spanish. For example, when the drain got blocked in my bathroom sink in my apartment in Madrid, I reported it to the manager as a direct translation of " the drain is blocked". Well, I got nothing but a blank stare and fumbled an explanation for five minutes until I finally hit on the right combination of words that could be understood --"the bathroom sink is clogged". Now she knew to send the plumber up with the snake. Many american hispanics would make the same error I did - this is why in Spain, they offer courses called "spanish for native spanish speakers" for little or no cost to immigrants. The tendency is to think in english even though they can't really speak english( as a peculiar anecdote, all the mexican restaurants in Madrid have placards in the window that read " mexican spoken here" and believe it or not, the placards are actually written in english -I've met a number of mexicans in Spain and as I said, they don't speak a lick of english). This is a bizzare aspect of american dialects that the author doesn't seem to observe, least of all to analyze. Similar issues exist in terms of syntax, like saying "to have an orgasm" as in english, when in spanish it's properly said "to achieve orgasm".   The second half of the book, is presented as a "spanglish" lexicon although many of the words listed have neither a derivation in english nor spanish, they're simply words that immigrants from different hispanic countries made up when they got to the US. Perfectly legitimate, but perhaps not aptly titled "spanglish", perhaps it should be called "HispanUSA" instead. Lastly, the lexicon section only has so called "spanglish" words and their english translations. If the proper castillian usage was also listed, at least it might help speakers of different spanish dialects understand each other better, making the book considerably more useful. It is, after all, not just about Mexico, Spain and Puerto Rico. There is lots of geography and are hundreds of dialects. Better luck with the revised edition 
  This necklace is like a strong circle of silver. there was almostno bend to it at all and it was not fluid 
 This is a volume in Canongate's series of myths retold, in this case the one of Atlas and Hercules - with a section towards the end about  what happened to Hercules after the episode with Atlas.  It is preceded by what I think is a rather pretentious Introduction, in which the author flags up that we are not in for what she calls `plodding fiction', and it does turn out to be a strange mixture of a book.  Some parts of it are very good:  Winterson conveys what it must feel like to be poor Atlas, condemned for eternity to bear the weight of the cosmos on his shoulders, his brief release as Hercules temporarily took over the  burden, and then being tricked to resume it.  She is also effective in the way she represents Hercules, as a coarse creature who loves violent action but whose brain hurts when anything like reflection occurs to him.  Other parts of the book are less successful, in my view.  At times there is a rather mechanical  retelling of the myth, as, for example, when Hercules tells Atlas of his birth and enumerates all the labours he has performed - rather as a character in a badly written play conveys information to the audience in an opening scene.  Then there are Jeanette Winterson's `poetic' but imprecise ruminations about Fate and Freedom, bringing in small fragments of her own personal life.  She refers frequently to `Boundaries' and `Desires', concepts that are obviously very significant for her but whose meaning in this context rather escapes me (doubtlessly my fault: it is probably too `plodding' of me to look the kind of lucidity I found in Margaret Atwood's Penelopiad in this same series - see my review).  Other parts show Winterson's fascination with the characteristics of planets in the solar system and with 20th century space exploration:  rather whimsically (mythically?)  there is towards the end an encounter between Atlas and Laika, the dog in Sputnik.    
 This book reads a lot like an entry-level psychology textbook where you get a taste of what is about to come, but you never quite get there.  The author has gone to some great pain to provide you a psychological overview of what various signs and symbols mean in regard to Freemasonry.  Instead of taking the symbology at face value, as most people would do, the author has "read between the lines" and interpreted what is "really meant" by the working tools, and so forth, of the craft.  My impression is that much of the interpretation is a bit far fetched.  Case in point, the author states on page 31, "This collection of symbols, and particularly their proximity to the place in the Temple where Divinity is said to reside, indicates that a Master Mason, in the sense that we are defining him, is a person who is conscious at a psychological level which relates to the World of the Spirit in the same way that our ordinary ego is conscious of the body and the physical world."  Overall, this book is a rapid fire snapshot of many works of art regarding Masonry, but the emphasis is more-or-less on a pseudo-psychological impression that one man has attempted to define and apply to the craft.  The message throughout the book seems a bit juvenile for such a strong subject.  The text is well written though and has found a place on my bookshelf, if for no other reason than the pictures that accompany the text.  The photographs throughout the book make it worth buying if no other reason applies 
 this one simply is too mediocre not even qualified being good. i've read all iles' complicated yet fasinating novels, most of them carried the weight as any great book should be except some of the endings felt lame and rushed. but this 24 hours didn't hang on in my hands and lock up my eyes' over 24 minutes, i just returned it to the library the next day and would not think about re-reading it again. the other books such as the quiet game, sleep no more, blood memory, dead sleep are all great reading experiences, his first and second ones were just too jewish focused. concentrating on the south is a trade mark of iles, although after hurricane katrina, the nopd police force seemed to be a totally ridiculous lame duck and incapable of doing anything right, not as good as what iles described in his novels. all said, this time no cigar for you, poncho 
 Based on this, I had high hopes for the iSee 360i and was perhaps one of the first ones to get this item and try it out.  I may be the ONLY one so far, because as of this date I couldn't find a single other mainstream review.  Now I may know why: it's a complete dud.  I could not get it to work in the slightest with my 60GB video iPOD.  Depending on the iPOD you have, there are adapters that must be ordered seperately, because quite  unbelieveably, they are not included.  To add further insult to injury, the instructions are vague and did not make clear (at least to me) which iPOD should be used with this unit without having to order adapters.  Needelessly to say, I returned it almost immediately. I would defintely say that the iSee is not ready for Prime Time! 
 Robert Anton Wilson predicted repeatedly since the 1970's, including in this book, that we would have seen the conquest of aging and death by now. The reality check he experienced in January 2007 suggests that people should deeply discount his value as a visionary "futurist" from now on 
 This book is probably useful for learning what missionaries are up to out there in the non-Christian world.  However, it does not stop to ask whether they SHOULD be out there.  And of course, from a cross-cultural and anthropological point of view, they should not.  It is arrogant, ethnocentric, and culturally destructive to spread a culturally-relative and almost certainly false ideology and belief system where it is not needed or wanted.  Missionaries have been the source of much of the world's trouble, and they still are.  But more essentially, the whole idea of missionazation is judgmental and intolerant. Why do those people need you and your "belief"?  How would you like it if they were missionizing you!  Oh, but you think your religion is true!  Well, so do they!  It seems all missionaries and those they missionize have in common is a lack of cultural understanding.  If we recognized religion as the relative (different in different places, not "true" in any meaningful way) and damaging, irrational thing it is, we would stop supporting it and start supporting real efforts that help people in real ways 
 i got this fryer only yesterday i fryed some chicken wings and french fries the fries came out with so much oil and cooked for 10 min for a small batch i have been frying for about 10 years and know how to cook very well and i have to say this is just as bad as frying on the stove. i put the oil to the max fill line and with cooking the two things the oil went down to the min line do not buy. 
 Simply horrible. The villains used (abused) in this comic all look pahtetic. They are made into jokes and do not serve any plot process. The amount of politics stuffed into the book, especally in the Poision Ivy Chapter is sickening. Ivy came back from the dead, with great new powers and all of a sudden she is knocked out in about two seconds. Thats great. I consider myself a pretty big batman fan but even I was like "WHO THE HECK IS THE GREAT WHITE SHARK?!?" Some big suprise. The badguy has been in jail all a long, batman hummilates him and goes on. Not to mention that Jason Bard, Batman's new partner is disgusting and immoral. A horrible arc all around 
 Iles tries to imitate Michael Crichton with bits of Dan Brown's Digital Fortress in this book.  Unfortunately this book does not make it.  The NSA is backing a project called Trinity which is to develop a super quantum computer that is controlled by a brainscan of a human mind.  Two of the individuals involved with the project want it halted and one dies in an apparent stroke which was actually induced by the NSA bad guys (why does the NSA always have to be portrayed as the bad guys in these books?).  David Tennant is the other individual and he gets away by stopping an unstoppable hitman and then persuades his psychiatrist to run with him, even though she thinks he is mentally unstable.  The plot really gets out of hand with Tennant having visions of being Jesus, being portrayed to the Secret Service as the next Oswald and escaping the entire Washington DC police and SWAT units and ultimately getting out the country with a false passport, going to Israel and then persuading the head of the Moussad to help him.  As crazy as it sounds the end is literally unbelievable that would even make a James Bond fan cringe.  The author has written some great tense books (24 Hours, Sleep No More) so I just chalk this one up to an experiment gone awry. 
 Run, don't walk, away from this book. I regret purchasing it for my daughter, and it is now on it's way back to Amazon. I was shocked to read that Madeline's neighbor uses the gift of a tool set to build a guillotine in his backyard that he uses for chopping the heads off of chickens. Are we really so desensitized to violence in this culture that this is considered acceptable? I can't believe that this book is considered a classic. What a poor choice for any child 
 I have not read this book but for some reason I was listeded as an advocate.  Down with big brother! 
 This is CD is pretty good in everything except that it has explicit lyrics.  Honestly, I hate dirty words so that is why I am giving it 2 stars out of 5 
 This review is for the MP3 audio cd.  Unless I received a faulty cd, this audio book was generated by an automated translation program. It's fraud. You don't pay to listen to a computer voice. I can't comment on the book 'Acres of Diamonds', which I was anxious to read/listen to, as this cd was so pathetic. [...]  
 This reads more like a textbook for an interior design course.  It has little to do with the psychology of your own choice of home/setting.  Like another reviewer said, the idea seemed fascinating, but the book disappoints right away, if not for the setup alone; the author overuses the same phrases and form to setup her next example. It is as though this were her thesis for design school.  It could also pass for a really good new age book, that's how problem-centered it is.  If you have watched "Designing for the Sexes" on HGTV, you have read this book.  This book is only interesting and appropriate for interior designers, not for anyone seeking insight into our needs and choices when it comes to home 
 This is not a very good book. It is simply a reprint of Tesla's early writings with some added comments and packaged to look like a new book. If you are interested in the subject, look for The Lost Journals of Nikola Tesla, which is a much better book with a lot of good info 
 Soft core porn masquerading as art, I didn't even make it through the first half hour of this film. Lola's cute, but it's still not worth the effort 
 The information in this book is worse than incomplete. The practice questions in the book and on the CD are nothing like those on the EXAM. There are many practice questions that are poorly worded, and have WRONG answers. There are also many questions with TYPO's. Example there was a question comparing DIMMS and RIMMS, but all the the answers referenced SIMMS. Stay away from this please!!!!  Jokes are not funny and if this book was written by an 30 year + IT professional... well frankly that is sad. He should have had to knowledge and resources to create a book that is accruately geared toward the exam. Like other for dummy books, this book was probably written by underpaid, barely expierenced kids, with a limited review process as to maximize publisher profits.  If you are taking this exam I suggest that you obtain study materials from Testking or Realexams. Stay away from this book, it will not help you pass. The information it concentrates on such as DMA/IRQ/BIOS settings/codes etc., can be found for free on the internet.   In retrospect, I would buy this book only if they didn't charge me, and shipped it for free. At least I have a coaster for my drinks at work 
 There are some great anecdotes in this book, and some critical points about how doctors are generally ignorant of evidence-based medicine and are pressured by patients, HMOs, and pharma companies to continue their expensive and inappropriate prescribing habits. However, the writing style serves as a cheap Ambien for even the most ambitious reader. Additionally, the "solutions" offered up to fix the US healthcare system are very (as can be expected from a Harvard man) ivory-tower, and disregard the thousands of big and little motivators throughout the healthcare political-industrial-financial complex that virtually ensure the US system will be entrenched until everyone is loaded to the gills with Viagra, Prozac, and unnecessary antibiotics while the great lifesaving classics of pharmaceuticals, such as thiazide diuretics, are virtually ignored 
    when the man sings, he sounds like he is blowing through an off key microphone.  The songs and lyrics are all so terribly written and sung, If you can call that singing at all 
 It was an okay read, but most of the information here was on bad treatment of the animals. Not that this isn't important, but I wanted to know more about the things that we are eating. More about the use of sick and diseased animals.  The animals are going to die and the plants aren't pretty (Just drive around Greely, CO) The smell would make most of us very ill, but that is what they do to get the food to us.    I wanted to know about the hormones, chemicals, diseases. She should have covered more of that. Not really worth 20 buck 
 The game has a nice concept, IF IT WORKED. I've been trying since christmas(over 3 months) to connect this game to the internet to update it for my kids and finally was able to update the firmware today. Something that you will have to do to be able to get to the virtual worlds,BUT THE WEB SITE IS ALWAYS DOWN!!!!! EXPERANCING TECHNICAL PROBLEMS!!!  and the nice window that pop's up on the home page from the Chief, asking for suggestions goes to a bad link!!!   I only gave it 1 star because the review process doesn't have a 0 stars.  DON'T WASTE ANY MONEY ON THIS THING!!!! 
 Perhaps this book would be interesting for children in their early teens. the simplistic storyline, cardboard characters and tacked on ending certainly does not provide much meat for more discerning readers. Would have like to give it no stars at all, but that is not possible it seems 
 I generally like movies that portray people on a search for meaning and bleonging, such as About Schmidt and The Royal Tenenbaums.  This movie followed a young woman on such a journey, and while there was some good humor along the way, it became very dark and depressing in the second half.  Unlike the protagonists in the other movies I mentioned, the main character was very self-centered and thought that a meaningful life would just happen.  She hurts people around her repeatedly and causes herself a lot of pain.  I can see where someone might like this movie who's into the whole life-is-meaningless thing, but I could have passed it up 
 I bought this underwater lighting system with four laser beams and when i installed it one of the beams came defective and didn't lit on; i didn't matter because they look beautiful underwater...    one week later i noticed that another light went off and two days later the other two shutdown too; i replaced the beams but they stop working days later. it's my opinion that this is the worst product you can buy to your aquarium. (unless you only want to use it for one or two weeks) 
 The expectations for this film were high- a good cast and a promise of a remake of an old movie using today's technology.  Alas- the movie was disappointing. The characters were not developed and the were quite flat.  The action starts very soon in the movie (the wave striking the ship) and thus there was no opportunity for them to develop.  The course of the movie did not allow for any significant development. Moreover, the special affects and all the action are not very well tied together or simply not believable. For example all the surviving passangers, including a young kid prove to be record swimmers that can hold their breath for a long period.  It is a pity as if the script was a bit better and more developed the film could have been enjoyable. 
 I can just imagine the writer's thought-process:  "Let's see, we've got massive tornados in L.A., tidal wave engulfing NYC, an almost immediate deep-freeze that kills instantly, and a sick character who needs medication or she will die, what could make this better?  Wolves!  Yes, we need escaped wolves."  Sheesh.  If anyone thinks the CGI effects in this movie are fabulous, they've obviously never seen a real wolf.  Those things weren't even close.    Oh, and let's not forget the zoo that keeps the bears, sheep, and wolves right next to each other in a small building.  Riiight.    I spent most of the movie either laughing at the absurdity of the scenario, and getting nauseated by the "sentimental" scenes.   I'm not even going to go into the horrible plot, cliches galore, and all of the other just plain wrong things about this movie.  I'm not going to touch on the overt environmental and political messages that probably did more damage to real and important climate concerns - since from the reviews it seems some people actually believed this was even remotely plausible, while others used it to deepen their hatred of "greenies".    Don't waste your time with this one.  There are far better movies of this genre.  And there are far better ways to learn about global warming.  
 Jay Conrad Levinson presents his thesis clearly time and time again in his book. In fact, he presents everything again and again. Each thought it reinforced at least 4 times in a dry and uninspired manner. Although Levinson tries to present marketing tactics that only a small business can use, he ends up presenting large-business tactics at a small scale. This book leaves out ground which has been broken by Loyalty Based marketing tactics, and sticks to traditional measures that are hardly relevant (at best) to entrepreneurs. The bottom line: invest your money elsewhere 
 I'm a great fan of all kinds of comedy, but this is incredibly amateurish and boring. Unfunny sketches that go on and on, completely unfunny. If you pay the postage, you can have my VHS copy for no extra charge. Otherwise I'll just throw it away.  Awful 
 I would ask that Willard Gaylin burn his mail-order psychiatric degree and take classes at a real university. How anyone can claim that he is a "leading" theoretician, educator, or anything else in the field, for that matter, astounds this reviewer beyond belief. Such praise should be considered insulting to the rest of psychiatry as a whole.  This book is not "groundbreaking." It presents no new or previously unheard-of information. All that this book accomplishes is the terrible feat of translating old assumptions and excuses about racism/other hatreds, commonly made from an anglo-saxons/Americans first ideology, and the evidence commonly used to support such assumptions into mid-level technical and medical dialogue. Not quite so advanced that the average educated reader can't understand it, but high enough to lower the burden of proof. The author's supposed medical credentials lend him even more undeserved trust.   The result is a book that encourages change, but not in the manner you'd think. Instead of decreasing or raising awareness of hatred, this book demonizes a small portion of that which it claims to fight while justifying and encouraging a great deal more of the same kind of hatred targeted at other groups and individuals.   Who cares about the situation?  Who cares about one's neurological makeup?  Who cares about the fact that violent crime rates in the U.S. are the lowest they've been since the 1960s?  Who cares about any of that?  It was written by a DOCTOR! He must be right!   Nothing's subjective at all! Those filthy arabs are just jealous of America!  It disgusts this reviewer to think that such a pile of 100% grade-A concentrated propaganda can pass as a respectable psychiatric thesis. If this is the "cream of the crop", then psychiatric medicine it might as well be flushed down the toilet.  I would have given this book a lower rating, if I could. Unfortunately, Amazon's user-rating method is incapable of going into negative numbers. 
 I was disappointed with the book. I expected a book that would describe how to succeed in commercial real estate for someone wanting to buy and lease out commerical properties. This book hardly touched on the topics I wanted to learn about, such as what makes a property a good investment, how to do due diligence on a property when considering it for purchase, tips on finding a good investment and why it's so hard, pros and cons of development vs buying an existing building, etc. I would have appreciated if the front cover would have made the target audience clearer. Read the table of contents carefully before making the assumption I did! 
 Waited for this and expected it to be a top class production. But what a waste....I can't understand how musicians can release a DVD that sounds this bad. Seems a rushed production and more of a money spinner than a quality product 
 A rambling book, not very informative, with a marked liberal tone.  Not to mention disjointed-- as far as the editorial content goes, each chapter is a totally separate book with its own thesis.  I would have preferred a more  cohesive work supported by the weight of objective historical evidence  rather than repetitive tales of coffee house chats, anarchic newspapers,  and loud-mouthed ideologues -- written in a soporific stream of  consciousness 
 We read this book for our book club, and the overall feeling was that it was a quick, easy read, but very predictable and a little over the top.  We all agreed that we wouldn't be passing this book on to friends to read as we did not enjoy it that much 
 I bought this device in the hope of eliminating or significantly reducing the noise emanating from my neighbor's mutt.  The offending dog is often left on the neighbor's porch, where it harasses just about every living thing that passes by.  Before ordering, I had read varying accounts of its range in terms of how close the unit must be to the dog in order to attain the desired effect.  In my case, the neighbor's porch is about 35 to 60 feet aware from mine.  Unfortunately, this was not "too close for comfort" as far as the dog was concerned.  Having read a number of very mixed reviews of this and similar devices, I was not overly optimistic about the prospect of it actually working.  Alas, it did not.  Some dogs just don't hear them.  In my case, it was probably due at least in part to the distance.  My suggestion is to go ahead and pick up one of these devices if and only if you are within 20' of the target.  If it doesn't work, go ahead and return it to the manufacturer for a refund (which is exactly what I did).  By the way, you don't need an RA (AKA RMA) number to return the device.  Just send it to the company along with your receipt, and a note saying that you would like a refund (not an exchange).  (...)  I sympathize with anyone having this problem, and wish you all the best of luck.  No one deserves to have their peace and quiet disturbed without good reason, and the argument that "dogs bark" simply does not hold any water 
 This novel is absolute dreck, at the best. I don't think I could ever pick up another Grisham novel without vomiting. Pelican Brief was Okay. But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this.    The reason for this one star rating is this.  First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING!  Second, 496 pages filled with "blah blah blah" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent.    Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things.   Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some.   Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton. 
 Great subject; poor execution. Starr is so determined to prove his point that people have the capacity to determine their historical decisions that he forces the facts of his arugment to fit his theory. There are some perfect moments of pure contradiction here. My favorite is the chapter on radio, where he concedes that maybe the technical limitations of media determines the process of their deployment in society, only to dismiss it with an offhand, "of course that can't be the case." The book is also hobbled by a limp wrist embrace of American exceptionalism, as though the geographic, social and class context of America weren't enough to account for difference between the deployment of technology in America and Europe. No, it HAS to be the genius of our political institutions. There are at least three great stories here: How the aesthetic conventions of media determine historical consicousness (a la McLuhan), the role of media in price revolutions, and how media is used as a tool in class and ethnic competition. But Starr misses all of them either because he has an agenda when he gets to the facts, or because doing political history is easy, and economic history hard. Either way, lame. For bourgeois historians only. If you're a media professional, pass 
 This book is full of nonsense and open doors that get kicked in. Robert is not telling anything new. All he is telling is some common sense knowlegde your 5 year old kid can come up with. And then he repeats that knowledge a couple of times in different wordings. I regret buying this book and waisting my time. If only I had read the negative comments :-( I actually don't believe Robert and his friends. If they made themselves rich it's probably by selling books like this one and recommending eachother on the covers of those books 
 I waited for this book to come out in paperback and pre-ordered.  I am a fan of WHITE TEETH, and, although AUTOGRAPH MAN was boring, I had high hopes for ON BEAUTY.  Sadly, this writer should stick to what she knows -- a visiting professorship doesn't make her an authority on campus life in U.S., New England, or what American kids say and do. The assumptions and voices given to her characters are distracting in their outsiderish author's depiction, and I found this to really get in the way of her stoytelling--especially her stabs at Boston and southern accents.  Her British characters (especially Howard and V) are well drawn and speak naturally--reminiscent of WHITE TEETH.  They are believable.  Her Americans are laughably off-base and seem like charicatures of how an arrogant Brit might imagine them, especially Levi and Carl.  The character Zora (modeled on the precocious author herself?) is not likeable at all.  The story of Jerome and his pursuit of religion is choppy and not well developed. He slides in and out of the story. The  Furthermore, her story line about campus politics is lackluster.  Another reviewer references Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM.  I recommend Richard Russo's excellent STRAIGHT MAN for anyone interested in the liberal arts dept / tenure / backstabbing /cheating plots 
 I'm not going to put anyone down for using a grid because the Old Masters used to use it,but I personally think the grid doesn't work.You still have to know how to draw in the square.If you look at the picture of the little girl with the graph over her you will see her eyes are perfect circles.A graph is not going to help you draw perfect circles,you'll have to use a circle template for that.She made it seem like drawing a line drawing from a photograph was easy.When you draw from a cartoon you just draw the lines you see.In a photograph you can't see the lines because they don't exist in real life.She doesn't show you how to create lines from a photograph.This is something a graph will not show you.As for her blending method,you really don't need to know all those fancy names like cast shadow for instance.When you look at a black and white picture I doubt it if you could determine where all the different names of light are.All you need to know is that if you see a certain shade,  color in the same shade in your drawing.How you do that I have no idea.I'm still looking for a book to explain that to me.Her book has astonishing before and after drawings.This makes me wonder if they really used her teaching to draw better.. 
 My hubby bought this for me for xmas this year & I thought I was doing something wrong, until I read the other review. I am having the same problem. My recordings skip in my player & sometimes LightScribe works but most times not. I love the idea of this but am not happy with the product 
 I recently purchased this book and was charge $65.00 total.  It was not worth nearly that much money.  I am very dissatisfied.  I will never purchase from this seller again 
 The only reason I purchased this book was because I heard this particular author on the radio giving great advice to female callers concerning their relationships. If this book was written as well as he speaks this book WOULD have been a great read. I found nothing thought provoking in this book what so ever. A lot of his thoughts were outdated and he seriously needed a spell check or fire his editor. The typo's in this book are horrendous leaving me to wonder how it got published in the first place. Big boom should stick to public speaking. He's a far better speaker then he'll ever be at writing. 
 This one will be brief. The movie is an excuse for young actors to use the "F" word and demonstrate that cannot act. The characters are cheap rip-offs of the original, which is to say one-dimensional. American Pie presents Band Camp certainly does not flesh them out. One final note: Eugene Levy- How much cash had to be thrown at your to take this one on 
 This is one of the worst horror movie I ever saw. I just hate it.    People dont waste your money renting or buying this crap.  If you want to see it that badly, just watch it on TV, like I did 
 This is one of my favorite Tom Clancy novels.  However, I am going to return these cassette tapes because the 4th and last tape broke.  I will ask for a replacement though and not a refund 
 I'm not surprised to read a lot of kid reviews on this CD.  This reminds me of what I used to listen to when I was 13 and didn't have much expectations for my music. These are 5 girls who a producer to make them a hit single which made them superstars overnight. They make music for the masses and probably will rank high as they already have accomplished a fanbase (consisting mostly of young girls I would assume) as they choose safe songs, but if you're looking for quality music with well-written and meaningful ("good love will always come from me" "we're in fashion don't you know" "summer in the city and the sun is high") lyrics you should be listening to something else. This is also the reason they will not break throgh in the US with this album.  The CD starts off with a cool intro, followed by an up-tempo tune (which will get stuck on your brain after enough listens)about the shallow girls on the street (referred to as MODELS, but the lyrics are amazingly poor. Next is the mid-tempo much-raved-about BIOLOGY (about their act/appearance/biology), but I can't see why; other than the fact that if you listen to a song enough you will end up liking it. Wild horses follow in the same lead.. (a past relationship which was hard to get out of, but now wild horses can't make her go back) it's just OK. SEE THE DAY is a catchy mid-tempo ballad about trying to convince a guy she's worth a try and not like everyone else he's dated before. WATCH ME GO is a naughty up-beat tune about doing her thing and giving it all to her man. The tune reminds a lot of something that could be on a Sugababe album which means you can dance to it; one of the better songs on the album. WAITING is (!) about a girl waiting for the boy she wants and the pain she had to go through. The song is mid-tempo, but there's no catchy tune and is basically just an album filler. WHOLE LOTTA HISTORY is IMO the best track on this CD. It's a catchy, heartbreaking ballad ("is she really that beautiful?") about breaking up and the boy finding a new love. LONG HOT SUMMER is a poor up-tempo track about a (!) long hot summer and that's pretty much it. SWINGING LONDON TOWN is not really a song; it sounds so electronica with loud music and some weird vocals in the background about the queen of england and other london stuff that make no sense. IT'S MAGIC is a (very) boring mid-tempo tune about love that you've heard a dozen times before "you're in my thoughts all the time". NO REGRETS is a safe ballad that you have heard a million times before, this time with a spanish feel to it, but yet again no lyrics to back it up. To finish off the CD they've chosen RACY LACY; a mid-tempo song with lyrics about this girl who makes spreading her legs into a sport. This is 10th grade locker-room chatter, but seems a bit too childish to have on this CD and the melody does not do the lyrics any justice. This would only work as a power song and sadly it isn't.  I will give it two stars for Whole Lotta History and Watch Me Go 
 I am an MBA student and had hoped to gain some insights  before an interview at an investment bank. I bought the book, misled by the author's credentials  and the many 5 star reviews. However, this book is a DUD. It is facile, poorly written and a waste of time and money. Fortunately I  also bought Applied Mergers and Acquisitions by  Robert F. Bruner ( listed under "the buy this book with" button). The later saved the day!  Skip this - get the Bruner book 
 This film is based on a concept that has potential - a mathematical key to the interconnectedness of all things - but it doesn't deliver.  Clearly, the writer wants us to believe that there is one elusive key to the intriguing patterns all around us, but he pretty much drops the ball right there.  Usually with this sort of plot, you are at least given the illusion that *someone* knows the answer and what's more has some clue about what to do with it as well.  There's no such suspension of disbelief in this one, nor even an attempt at such.    Adding injury (if you count eye strain) to insult, the whole thing is shot in grainy B&W with annoying MTV-style jump cuts.  In the awards for Obnoxious Splash Films of the Year, this one takes the cake, but not the Pi 
 I too was suckered into this waste of words by David Sedaris, a man I cherish as my own flesh and blood.  Though I will try not to hold it against him in the future, I could barely get through the first story.  Upon attempting the second and finding yet another pathetic, despondent woman, I closed the book never to be reopened.  Dull, vapid, and melancholy.  Snooze 
 It makes for a wonderful book when your toddler is going through one of those stages of just wanting to read the same book over and over and over and over and over b/c there isn't much for you to read.   I have to admit though that although I find the illustrations charming the whole premise is kind of creepy. I always end the reading with, "And then CPS came and took the mother away and placed baby with a loving, responsible family and Carl went on to star in his own TV show." I don't want my daughter being left with the impression that if we get a dog at some point it will be babysitting. I'm all for catharsis in children's books to show irresponsible behavior, etc. I think this one is disturbing b/c the parent is the one that's so horrible. The kid and dog are doing what one would expect 
 I absolutely love the Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich!  I quickly read all of them and wanted more!  Then I found the "Full" series, including this volume, "Full Bloom".  I was really disappointed to find that this is just an average romance, not very well-written.  The humor, which just flows in the Plum novels, is very strained.  A better choice for Stephanie Plum fans who are waiting for the next installment might be "Bubbles in Trouble" or any of the "Bubbles" books.  
 Blasphemy in Print. Why would anyone read this filth? Why mock God 
 Perhaps my expectations were too high?  Martha produces a beautiful magazine and her new Best of Weddings book is superb so I thought that this book, although older, would be a nice addition.  I was disappointed.  Although the book was published in 1999, it seemed even more outdated than that.  The flowers used seemed repeated over and over again and the book was centered completely around the varieties in Martha's garden. For a more thorough view, I'd like to recommend 2 books in place of this one.  Jane Packer's Fast Flower Arranging is fantastic and shows beautiful arrangements that can be made quickly even by a novice.  For actual, technical "how to" steps and design theory, I'd recommend Judith Blacklock's "Flower Arranging" (might be called Teach Yourself Flower Arranging in some indexes).  Once you know proper floral design techniques, you can use any kind of flowers (NOT just those from Martha's garden) to create beautiful arrangements 
 As for digital technology, monster cable has once again ruined the marketplace by greatly over estimating what their products are worth.  The great difference with the digital output/inpt devices compared to analog is simple.  If the digital signal reaches the device it needs to it can't be any more or less clear.  Because your digital signal is comprised of "0's" and "1's" if you can see your TV or hear the music then what ever cable you use works-  There is no distortation across digital signals, so don't pay the extra money- In fact you shouldn't need to spend more than around $30-50.  
 On this one, the lyrics take a darker, more cynical tone, ("Do you really think/that love is gonna save the world?" from "Do you Believe?" is just one example) and the music adds quite a bit of electronic elements, even dabbling at times in trip-hop. In and of itself, growth and change is what keeps a band from stagnating, and generally I'm in favour of a band shifting from its strengths and struggling to find new ones.  One thing that's non-negotiable in the search for new sounds, though, is strong hooks. The real problem with this album is there aren't enough "Wow!" moments: those songs that grab you and make you sing along.   FIRST BAND ON THE MOON had "Lovefool" and "Been It" along with their cover of "Iron Man" and "Never Recover", all of which became stuck in your head with enough play. That just isn't happening for me with this one for the most part.  HIGHLIGHTS: "My Favourite Game" is the only immediate grabber here and a fairly gritty number for the Cardies. "Erase/Rewind" grafts a drum rhythm reminiscent of Queen's "Another One Bites the Dust" onto a shimmering keyboard part. "Starter" is a midtempo trip-hop number about reinventing yourself. ("Turning the pages/I used to hang on to/I was young and I have changed my mind/and I'm leavin' everything behind")   LOWS: "Nil" is a limp instrumental coda to the CD.   BOTTOM LINE: If you loved the bubbly pop of "First Band on the Moon", you'll be disappointed in this. Even taken on its own trip-hop terms, I can't really say it compares favourably with Portishead and the like. Color me unimpressed 
 I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This is sappy and poorly written.  How does Mitch Albom keep  getting on the best sellers list 
 Ill give it 2 stars instead of 1. because it is not nietzsche i have the prolem with.  I knew i was taking a chance by buying this, I like Hollingdale, and like kaufman, but this translater, takes the fun out of freddie. It hardly even sounds like nietzsche speaking.  For one example a famous line is "we all speak vaugly about poerty because we are all bad poets.".. When i read that line i barely realized i read it as he write "we all speak abrtractly about our poetry because we tend to be indifferent poets."  The whole book reads like that. Nietzsche Bold statements! poetic prose are replaced with boring textbook like translation.  I realized we might have a problem when i read the "ABOUT THE AUTHOR" in the book and he had traslated the title of "THE GAY SCIENCE" to "THE JOYFUL KNOWING" uhm.... I'm re-buying the book today the kaufman version. dont buy this 
 I hated this book.  This family has two girls, Racie and Jaynell.  Rachie is a girly-girl and Jaynell is a tomboy.  It seems like the only person who loves her is her grandpa.  Her parents are just plain crazy.  Mama repedily whipped Racie with a flyswatter because she ate a sugar cookie and the dad threatens to "tear up" their hides each time they do something he does not like.  Once Jaynell said something out of turn and he grabed her shirt collar, nearly strangleing her, and pushed her rougly to her mama and forced her to apologize. Then Jaynell says that she will flench everytime she sees a flyswatter and she gets really scared when mama uses it on Racie.  Her parents are just crazy.  Then grandpa dies.  Dad becomes even angrier and mama just looses it.  I understand that sparking fear in a child's eye is a good thing.  Children should be afraid of their parents-but this is crazy.  Racie just ate one cookie and from that one mistake she recives a thrashing that is talked about in two paragraphs.  Jaynell says that she could hear the repeted blows and it just sounded aweful.  These people were crazy.  This book is crazy 
 I did enjoy reading this book but after a while Bare's stories about his more "famous" friends got a little tiresome. And I always found myself wondering, who is Richard Bare? Is he responsible for any of the greatest films of all time? The answer is no. In fact, Richard Bare's greatest achievement was directing all of the episodes of Green Acres. And that's it, most of credits are for television, not film. Personally, if I were to read a book about film directing, I'd like to read a book by a reknowned director, like David Mamet's "On Directing Film". Mamet was able to get through everything that goes into directing a film in a slim 107 page book. I'd recommend that book over this book any day 
 This is a review of the audio tape edition, not the book.  The audio tape is not an abridgement of the book.  The audio tape is a collection of radio appearances by the authors.  If you read the box, you'd see that.  But the description on-line does not make that clear.  I think giving the radio show transcripts the same title as the book is deceptive.  The presentation is rambling because they just respond to caller questions.  They emphasize the relation between depression and a chemical called ceratonen (seratonen?).   This tape is not worth getting 
 The writing was very disjointed in my opinion.  I had to read and re-read many sentences to figure out what the author was trying to say.  It was a struggle to read. No likeable characters.  I made it to the part where it was introduced that Madeline slept with the ex-husband and current wife.  Give me a break!  I moved on immediately.  Too many good books waiting for me to waste time on this absurd tale 
 One word: boring. This book took 40 pages just to describe people dying everywhere and that the remaining survivors ended up in a hall together. After that, no zombie-killing action for the next 100 pages or so. All of it went something like this: "We were all scared. We didn't know what to do. Michael showed signs of irritation at the group's indecisiveness. How could dead bodies move? Some of us wanted to leave, others wanted to stay here. The whole world was coming to an end." Way too much imagery about their surroundings and emotions but not enough horror element to warrant this as a horror novel. Makes a good read for people who just want to throw away their time at amateur work that offers nothing particularly interesting. The spotlight review written by "citymars" is yet another testimony to the points I'm trying to make.   If you really like this or want to see for yourself what I meant, you can download a free ebook version at David Moody's website. Other titles that ARE actually worth reading are: "The Rising" by Brian Keene and "The Walking Dead" series by Robert Kirkman. 
 This product is very nice when it works.  However, I'm having the same problem as the reviewer below me.  When I attempt to export the image - either by saving, draging or copying, Hemera places a transparency over the object, making the product worthless.    I gave it two stars because, for the two months it worked, it worked well, however, now, it won't work at all.  And as the other reviewer stated, support is nearly non-existant 
 There's certanly been enough written about this story, so I'll keep this review brief. All one really needs to know is that Frank Miller's characterization of Batman does a disservice to fans of the admirable hero with cunning detective skills. That is the Batman that most comic fans know and love. Not the cheesy, 1960's television version, nor the completely unrecognizable brute portrayed here. To boot, the author obviously doesn't understand Superman's appeal either.  Casting those major complaints aside, though, there is some good stuff in DKR..., just not nearly enough to warrant it the spectacular praise it so often recieves. If you really want to pick up an essential Batman book by Frank Miller, Year One is the way to go. The simplicity of that story kept Miller from imposing his warped view of Batman on the reader.  Dark Knight Returns is the total opposite of Year One. It's too complex for its own good, dark to the point of being more depressing than it is thought-provoking, and just downright mean-spirited at times. Rent this from your library if your're a Batman fan who wants to see what all the fuss is about. If you're like me, you'd regret adding this to your personal collection before reading it. Unless, of course, you just like being bummed out by by superhero comics. 
 These are the type of books and garbage that let an actual  abuser get away with harrassing an ex-spouse and using a child as a pawn.  Doesn't anyone realize that this gives guilty people a loophole to pass the blame for the degradation of a parent child- relationship to someone else.  If your child doesn't like you, then you need to look inward at your own shortcomings and fix yourself, not look outward for someone to blame, just because admitting the truth is too difficult.  Maybe your child just doesn't like you...and maybe the child really has been abused. I've had about enough of all these fake syndromes.  I read this book and I am appalled.  No child who truly loves and admires a parent can be manipulated into "revisionist history" and being poisoned.  Society needs to give children more credit than that...and the authors of these "books" need to find something else to do.  Only a lemming would be so stupid as to follow this author's suggestion that parental alienation is possible simply by "telling" a child anything.  Children will continue to love and admire a parent who is worthy regardless of circumstances. If you've lost their love and affection you have only yourself to blame.  My ex tells my son terrible things about me all the time, and my son simply comes home and tells me what is said.  He follows that up with "I love you" and "I know the things that are said aren't nice".  It has not damaged my relationship with my son whatsoever, but my ex has lost the respect of this child.  Think about what is in this book, and then put it down and run...never to follow this kind of bunk again 
 This album had about 35% good songs...tha onez that r good r REALLY good but tha songs that suck are absolutely horrible. I really looked forward 2 thiz album but i wuz disappointed a lot. EVERY single suave house cd they released wuz off tha hook...i listen to each album daily but this one makez meh not wanna listen 2 it az muc 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
   albeit with an attitude. She's stuck in a way too predictible  formula comedy. All that is left is the particulars. A novelist, Alex is under fire, literally  to produce a novel quickly to get the money to pay off loan sharks who want to kill him. He hires steno, Emma & she  moves almost literally into his life as he begins to crank out a novel; with her critical comments along the way. It is soon obvious that the novel is paralleling their going relationship. Yes, of course, they are falling in love. The movie flashes between the present day & the 1920's Gatsby-like setting of the novel. The problem is they are all too aware that this is happening. That they know that this is causes the movie to lose much of the charm it could have had if the two stories proceeded with  Emma & Alex blithely ignorant of what was happening. Art imitates life. Or is it life imitates art? I could squeeze 21/2 stars 
 A quote from page 126:  "A good steak dinner laced with strychnine is farm more dangerous than a clearly marked bottle, especially if you are hungry."  Anyone hoping this book will help them understand homeschooling should know that it is a pro-spanking, fundamentalist Christian tome and not even clearly Biblical.   "Pain does teach!" and "Spanking is not hitting" take it outside the field of homeschooling, and perhaps Amazon should re-categorize it 
 Real parents? A parent is the person who raises you and influences the person you are today. You are not a Real parent b/c you conceived the child...that person has significant value as a birth parent. I was adopted and have also adopted children and the real parent is the one who has been there, invested... 
 Berberian's work is one more example of why writers, especially first-time writers, should write about what they know intimately.  It is painfully obvious from his ponderous and endless recitation of his character's physical training techniques and his love for particular kinds of foods, that Viken has nothing else to talk about.  Existentialism?  Hah!  More like pedanticism.  Berberian's characters are flat, uninteresting, and tell us nothing new about the Mideast.  Where is the conflict in his characters?  Where is the multi-layered (and therefore believable) mileu of the cyclist's world?  Where are the characters that could provide an alternate perspective on, or at least discuss, the objective reality of terror?  Most unforgivingly, where is the drama?  Pass on this author, until he decides to write about something he at least sparingly knows, and doesn't have to research from square one 
 I'm with many of the other reviewers: stick with the Princeton Review's test prep, and the Norton Anthologies. This book is trash. I'm infuriated that it's considered a valid study guide and continues to be published; whoever edits this should be ashamed. Here's a sample practice test question:  Which three elements best define Post-Modernism?  a) Randomness, excess, discontinuity b) Flashback, fragmentation, humor c) Nature, faith, solidity d) Immorality, sense of loss, meaninglessness e) Montage, metaphor, absurdity  I was longing for an answer choice f) that might read "One adjective from each of the above. A pastiche of the pre-existing choices."  The Research and Education Association lists a) as the correct answer. If you buy this book, you'll be answering questions that would never be asked on the GRE in English Literature, and you'll be scouring the answer choices for the incorrect answer that the slip-shod REA would call correct 
 I have a Ph.D., and most of the time I had no idea what Marcus was talking about.  Not because of the academic jargon -- there is little or none.  Because he kept dropping in names of obscure punk rock groups or fan mags or ezines and expecting me to know all about them, he kept starting discussions in the middle, and most infuriating, he assumed that readers positively worshipped Elvis, so if he alluded to what happened in Tupelo in 1957, or Elvis' relationship with his cousins, we would nod and say "oh, sure."  Casual readers, beware -- in order to understand this book, you need to have read at least a dozen biographies of Elvis, watch all of his movies a dozen times, and have every word of every song he ever wrote memorized.  I conclude that it's not a cultural obsession at all, to anyone but the author 
 This must be some sort of joke - to release this mouse for sale.  It looks nice, and the hot-link buttons function well.  As a pointing tool, though, it is utterly useless.  It is so sensitive that the slighest move sends your pointer to the corner of the screen.  At first I thought that maybe I needed to adjust to the new mouse, or better yet, perhaps adjust the sensitivity.    Option 1: You cannot adjust the sensitivity.  On to option 2...  Option 2:  Maybe it's just me?  Unfortunately not.  When the mouse sits, untouched, on my desk, the pointer is slowly drifting across my monitor screen.  Sometimes when I try to use it to select something, it is impossible.  I junked this POS, and went back to my older Dell/Logitech mouse. 
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 This is NOT a book!! It is a fold of about 25 half-size pages stapled in the center with a cover of card stock printed in black.  The information was totally ho-hum.  Common sense and an IQ of more than 20 will give you the same information with a quick look at the front of any book.  Then there's the cost!!!!!  $15.95 plus $3.49 shipping.  The book would have easily fit into a #10 business envelope and shipped for forty cents.  Needless to say I returned it ASAP 
 I was forced to read this book in English class and it is terrible! If you want a book that will put you to sleep at night, this is the one. I dissliked this book because it seems that it is not even supposed to be entertaining! 
 When I found "Hour Game" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt.  But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as "The Winner" and "Absolute Power" could turn out such a dog.  Long, boring, and confusing.  I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an "aspiring young writer" to "help" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them.  It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin.  What a waste.  What a shame. 
 My friend who lives in Rome suggested this book. I generally avoid Dan Brown, and sort of wish I had avoided this book.  His research was great, if you can believe all of his information, and the well described locations all over Rome were marvelous, but ........   Two, not one but TWO, men fall out of a helicopter very high above Rome and land unharmed?  Many other plot devises were quite difficult to digest.  Plus, Brown seems to have a personal vendetta for the Catholic Church.  God certainly knows a lot of evil has been done in the name of religion and the church probsably leads the pack, but Brown's problem seems rather personal.  Maybe he was abused by a priest 
 Page 13. of the book, "when I conceived this book I had a brilliant premise: I would take every excersive in the gym and look at it in terms of possible role in human movemement." Then later goes on on to list the moves they think are important, even debating what should be included. There is no scientific method to this, only apparently two individuals conceiving an idea for a book. I'm sure there strength books are good, but this a "me too" book on core performance 
 this is the typical teenage love story with a twist, it turn out that she actually gets what she asked for and it crashes and burns. well it was intirely too predictable for my liking. by reading the back cover you could basically know all you need to know. it did suck you in, but i dont know it just wastnt juicy enough with not enough unexpected surprises. 
 I am newly preg too. I went out and got this book without reading any reviews. I sum it up this way: a pompous composition of contradiction and condescension. I can't stand the tone and the constant jabs seemingly mocking you and having a GREAT OLD TIME enjoying those pains you will be feeling! IE ..And all those trips to the bathroom to hug the toilet. Ha ha ha...  Last night, I'm reading her stupid book and I get some good advice on what to do with your friends who are smokers. I would just not be near them while they smoke. Period. She says to threaten them with the law that protects non-smokers. Good idea...If that doesn't work, Ask them ALL TO QUIT because YOU are pregnant. And if that doesn't work try being nice. I don't know many smokers but I don't know even one who would smoke in a house or one who would smoke outside and blow the smoke in my face. Another comment that really got me..Take a good look at your slim waistline because won't see it for a LONG TIME! (Implied: OR Ever!) I take pride in keeping myself fit. I am a little freaked about the weight issue. I find that comment insensitive to a point of being twisted. What about the first-timers who are also former eating disorders --like me. Even the woman on the cover of this book looks like a Stepford Wife. 
 I tried this book based off of several of the positive reviews and was disappointed.  The "cute" stories and rock and roll music references was not enough to keep it interesting.  Sure risk is a difficult subject but this book did not come up with anything new or innovative on the subject.  Likewise, the basic premise the author uses of levering and delevering your portfolio based on p/l or perceived opportunities may work fine if the markets are highly liquid and transactions costs are minimal such as in large cap stocks but it is much more complicated for other stratgies and markets.  How does the book address converts, mortgages, options, distressed debt, etc?  I will save you the money and tell you- it doesn't.  Now this may not be an issue if you are a short term oriented active trader of stocks ala SAC or scalping e-minis but for the rest of us that are involved in other strategies it is of zero value.  
 My toddler also got her finger stuck in my one of the latches.  We thought that she had actually broken her finger! Thankfully, it only caused a swollen finger and a big gash.  I would not recommend this product. The latches are too dangerous and the toy is too heavy. 
 My review may be unfair since I quit reading at page 70 when I admitted to myself that I was bored out of my mind and couldn't find any enthusiasm to go further. If anything interesting happens after page 70, it's too late anyway 
 If you believe Britain made what Africa is today than this is the book for you. Pakenham portrays the scramble for Africa as a two-player game between Britain and France, with little attention being paid to the portuguese, german, italian or spanish presence and interests in the continent. As a result, Pakenham's book is really a book about the British scramble for Africa, neglecting some of the most curious cultural and political aspects of the heterogeneous european presence in Africa. Focused in Britain, Pakenham also misses the opportunity to explore the reaction of african cultures to colonial advances and the position of independent african states. It is therefore a rather poor book and one in which prejudice against other european colonial powers is too often evident 
 This was a clever idea for a movie: the trail of lives touched by a wedding dress.  Unfortunately, in the screenwriter's apparent desire to put as many unexpected, even quirky, turns in the story as possible, he forgot that a story is supposed to be appealing.  A few moments were.  Most were either routine daytime soap-opera material or just boring.    Also, the casting was incredible.  It's as though someone tried to win the prize for who could cast the largest number of unappealing actors and actresses in a single movie.  There were one or two exceptions, like Margaret Colin, but the other eight or ten--or however many there were--ranged from off-putting to repulsive.    Apparently, a number of people liked this movie, so maybe you will too.  I don't really understand why.  I like a good human-interest story.  Unfortunately, this was not one.   
 very hard to read, very expensive for what it is. I buy this book for a course of telecommunication, and i dont use it because it is really bad! I sold this book right after i finish the course 
 I admit that I am not qualified to "judge" FW. Not because I am stupid, as many 5-star reviewers would assert, I think. I would consider giving up on THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO "stupid." I cannot judge FW as literature because literature is meant to be read, and comprehended. It is not complexity, depth, or any of the like that make this book incomprehensible to me. It is written in its own language. It is its own realm. To judge it would be like judging the writing of an alien civilization. And that is why I gave FW 1 star: it is nonscoreable.  This book--FW--seems to be Joyce's joke, or private world, or both. I doubt that any one who claims to love this book has "got it" in the sense that Joyce meant it to be understood, either. If one has the perserverance, one will find one's own meaning/pattern in FW, if only because it is human nature to impose order on chaos and...gibberish.   FW is certainly fascinating for its complexity of word games. As for the poetic quality of the words? I couldn't speak for that. When a word is over 20 characters long, a mishmash of randomness, I generally stumble like an idiot over every syllable. Thus: it was not fluid. It was not poetic.  Yet, for all of its puzzle-like quality, I could not call FW great literature. This is unreadable. Even if one knew all of the languages Joyce was acquainted with, it would still be, I think, unreadable. Joyce was the only one who understood it, and he is dead. I agree, the many interpretations FW has spawned are impressive; but also quite pathetic, if one considers how many scholars spent their lives trying to decipher this.  If there is any definite meaning here--any statement Joyce was trying to make--then he failed in conveying it.   I'd recommend that anyone who still has any doubts look up FINNEGANS WAKE online--one can find a free online copy. If still your ego insists on reading this, then purchase as many supplementary books as possible, and good luck 
 I think this book is the worst of both worlds as a text or reference manual in that there are no real-world analogies in the first two chapters, and there aren't any really good tables for reference either. Also, in chapter two the description of capacitors (and their markings) makes no sense and the first page of chapter that ends with "this is why all common household current is AC" also makes no sense because it is preambled by a description of AC and no transformer action. I read chapter two a couple of times but still lack a good understanding because I NEED (as I imagine many do) some connection with the real world. The water pump example is good but it stops there. I dove into this text with an excitement and desire to diagnose and repair some old audio equipment that can see new life. I think I'd better find a better book before i get completely discouraged, or start working without good knowledge 
 I agree with one of the reviewers who pointed out the anti-social nature of the author. I also agree that the author's self "selling points" are simply a modern copy of the "emperor's new clothes".   I noticed that majority of the posters claimed that this "master's text" is incomprehensible. As a matter of fact, I believe that the entire book are just the psychotic rambling. So why bother even to read it!?  
 I don't know why this is, but when I put on the Dale Sr. shell for this car it started to understeer on left turns and would always crash into walls 
 You'd think 50 or Sheridan was smart enough to base the movie on someone other than 50-well, it was supposed to be loosely based on his life, but that's dangerously territory to tread. It was way more funny than it was thuggin'. It wasn't completely a waste. It was good for a few laughs from time to time. If you think this is bad, check out Cam'ron's Killa Season. That movie flat-out sucks, but it sold more on the streets than 50's dud did in theaters! 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 where is the book gone ? will i get replacement ? thank 
 After reading The Kite Runner, a story about friendship, loyalty during the adverse times in Afghanistan during the Taliban, I was looking for another read centered on these harsh times in Afghanistan.  The Swallows of Kabul was endorsed as book for those that enjoyed The Kite Runner however, disappointly, other than being set in Afghanistan the books similarities end there.    I appreciated the descriptions about life during the Taliban rule.  The author painted a vivid image on what it would have been like to walk down the street during these times.  You felt sympathic towards the two couples, eventually their lives intertwined but not how you would have expected them.  I was disappointed in the outcome of the story and was left with a feeling that the book was incomplete. 
 its the second time in a row that this happens... so i don't know, amazon just lost a customer, even thou i don't think it will make a difference. 
 It's hard to be enthusiastic about a book with such an unattractive main character. Having had an affair during her engagement, our 'heroine' decides to tell her new husband all about it on their honeymoon. Unsurprisingly this causes a bit of a rift. The husband doesn't feel inclined to sleep with her after this announcement, so she has another affair.   When the husband eventually files for divorce, our heroine presents herself as a wounded victim. She rejects a divorce settlement which the judge deems perfectly reasonable and we're expected to cheer as she wins a much more generous settlement. We're then treated to stories of some fairly boring new relationships and some mundane sex in the house in France she won in her divorce.   I couldn't work out why the author had written such a banal story with such an uninspiring main character. Then I noticed that the 'herione' has a good deal in common with the author. I'm guessing this 'novel' is actually an autobiographical attempt to wreak still more revenge on her real-life husband, and to seek sympathy and self-justification for some fairly dubious behaviour. Not a very inspiring read, and pretty ineptly written too 
  It's a funny thing to me... that every one of these gurus... has the exact problem with the modern church.  And yet... all of these experts only refer to their own skewed opinions or the opinions of other fallible men and never the pure words of God.  A prime example would be this book.  This man believes that all the ills of the modern church is linked to the one thing that this man thinks he has straight. And what is that? That churches no longer meet in homes.  Book, chapter and verse?  This man cannot give you book, chapter and verse... because he doesn't know the scriptures nor the power of God.  If the fact that churches not meeting in homes is the culprit for the apostasy within the body of Christ... surely God would have warned of such danger in the pages of holy scripture.  Amen?  But the truth of the matter is... HE DIDN'T! So the best this man can do... is point out the fact that the early church met in homes. Which is obviously true. However, where is the New Testament injunction against meeting in a building designated for fellowship?  I'll help you out. There isn't one.  What we have here is a modern day Pharisee who is straining at a gnat while swallowing a camel.  Please save the Lord's money and just read your Bible 
 Although the narrator speaks clearly on the CD and is easy to understand, he has a sing-song voice which tends to put you to sleep.  The audio mix leaves much to be desired; I have to turn the base all the way down and the midrange and treble all the way up on my car radio in order for the voice to sound somewhat natural.  I have listened to many books on CD from Recorded Books, who employ professional actors/actresses as narrators, and that is the standard to which I am comparing this product.  Zondervan could have put a little more money and effort into this product.  After all the scriptures do say: "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart as working for the Lord, not for men, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward.  It is the Lord Christ you are serving." (Colossians 3:23,24 
 I read this book in high school. I'd been told that Wicca was about celebrating the earth and nature. This book has spells for locker gnomes and a whole bunch of crazy stuff about those horrible, evil Christians. This book destroyed any interest I had in Wicca at the time. It wasn't until 5 years later when someone gave me a copy of Scott Cunningham's Wicca: A Guide For The Solitary Practitioner that I started learning about Wicca. Don't waste your money, time, or brain cells on this 
 With each book she writes, Jodi Picoult comes down a level in terms of quality.  Rather than narrowing the scope and developing it well, this novel is a pinball machine of ideas, people and issues that never come together.  I kept holding out for an ending that would redeem the rest of the story but was disappointed till the final word 
 Note: This review is not about the show but about the product A&E is delivering to us Homicide Fans. Season Six is--and always will be--my absolute favorite.  First off, NO SUBTITLES or CAPTIONING for the hearing impaired. Second, the sound quality is less than perfect as is the picture quality which shows its age with muddy colors, faded backgrounds.  To add insult to injury, the selection menus are not user friendly. Once you've completed watching an episode, the menu does not go back to the main but to the menu from which you selected the episode in the first place.  Lastly, THE EPISODES ARE SHOWN OUT OF ORDER!!!! Blood Ties 1, 2, and 3 and Subway are on the first disc when actually three other episodes came after Blood Ties 3.  Boo on A&E for releasing such junk. I foolishly bought Homicide Seasons 1&2 for my collection but have rented the rest from Netflix 
 Don't waste your money on this one.  Very poorly written.  This appears to be a magazine article that was expanded into a book with a bunch of glowing quotes about Unitas and then added 40 pages of stats, some photos without captions, three forwards and an afterword.  As a n alternative, run a google search for Unitas, read the first few hits, and you will know more about Johny U in a few minutes from running the search - than you would learn from wasting your time reading this paperweight. 
 THis book was lent to me by a woman I was dating, interestigly enough until just recently, although I suspect we will remain friends. I read this book in the hopes that it would bring insight on how to meet the woman of my dreams or love of my life. That special someone... I think you know what I am talking about.  I have never written a review about a book before and have never felt as compelled to share how much I did not like this book.  Much of how I felt goes along the lines of what other reviewers wrote (The single Stars that is).   I truly believe that relationships are about negotiation and a mesh of differing styles and approaches to your partner,life and its problems. I also know about the subtle use of manipulation to get what you want(I was an adolescent Drug Treatment counselor for 7 years)--- This book had me feeling very angry and feeling like I don't want to be involved with someone who ascribes to some of the main suggestions in this book. As a man interested in doing "the right thing" finding that special person-- I would absolutely not recommend this book.  The book says things that seem practicle and are commonly accepted types of things but then follows up with a twisted and convoluted approach to relationships.    So in closing Guys-- Stay away.. There is another review that suggest some books and I am going to check them out. To women: I wish you the best in finding that man of your dreams, but there has got to be some better choices for advice on relationships. 
 A professor highly recommended this book to my art history class. I  was disappointed in it. I had hoped it would offer some useful advice but instead it merely outlines the things anyone writing on a college level (and the book seems to be aimed at college students) should already know. Perhaps it would be better suited to high schoolers 
 The reviewer below who said "More Heat Than Light" got it partly right.  This book is SO badly written you have to wonder if the author's other works were written by the same person. Not only is it sophomoric, it is gibberish.  Had its author been unknown, she would surely have had to pay for the book's publication. Incredibly bad, it may at least serve as a source of hope for struggling writers who believe that only the best works are accepted by publishers 
 I expected more from this book. Maybe i was just spoiled by knowing a lot about the subject (it's been a particular interest of mine for a number of years, before the "Memoirs" hype) and having read Liza Dalby's _Geisha_ and other factual books on the subject first, but this one just didn't live up to my standard.  Part of what irritated me about it was that Downer didn't seem to know much about the geisha culture going in. She's corrected for behavior and diction by the women she interviews and just comes across as gauche. I would assume that if you were going to write a book about this exclusive world that you'd do some heavy-duty boning up on the customs and taboos of the culture, especially in a society as structured by respect and politeness as Japan in general and its geisha culture. It doesn't say much for Downer personally, and it just reinforces the Japanese image of Westeners as boorish and not even trying to understand their culture.  (Also, this is an admittedly picky point, but some of the pictures of the author in "geisha mode" seem like she's pushing it too far, especially with the sake flask and an extremely cheesy kimono. You're a spectator, keep it at that, don't embarass yourself, especially in print.)   There is some decent information but nothing that was terribly new to me (though i may have studied more about this culture already than perhaps the average reader), and overall this book just wasn't worth the money, unfortunately. I recommend Liza Dalby's books and John Gallagher's _Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance and Art_ in its place. 
 the plus side of rubber/latex 'skin' type cases is that they stretch to fit the player nice and tight.  DOWNSIDES: dust and dirt can get between the case and the player and dull/scratch the gloss finish front of the player.  regular use of an armband WILL result in the back tearing (it's super thin and not made to take the yanking of player bouncing around while running/working out).  This is priced WAY TOO HIGH, these sell everywhere on ebay for about $5 shipped.  The rubber/latex means the player no longer 'slips' into a pants pocket easily but that also means it won't slide around on a moving/shaking surface as easili 
 I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about investment products OTHER than common stocks. Instead, (in the book on tape), I got 5-10 minutes about the different types of bonds, a little detail about T-bills, and the frank admission that this book "doesn't really discuss corporate bonds". WHAT!? The whole rest of it is spent preparing you to run for cover for the upcoming crash of 2000 - for that, I must say he was prescient (Too bad I didn't read this in 1999!). More time is spent describing the basics of common stocks, and how the major industrial averages are calculated than is spent on bonds! Oh - and that WRONG formula for computing the price/sales ratio erroniously also made it onto the cassette version. I actually had to rewind the tape to see if I had heard correctly 
 First of all, I would like to start off by saying that this movie sucks.  Here are a few of the things that supports my decision. 1. Dacascos does not know Capoeira. He played the berimbau (an insrument used in Capoeira) wrong, he pronouced many of the terms incorrectly, and he had no flow to his movements.  2. The acting was horrible.  While watching this, you kind of get the picture that the director wanted to finish this movie a soon as possible.  Most of the lines were just stupid.  Dacascos character had no real history.  apparently had this mysterious past you really could care less about because the plot was so predictable. 3. The fighting was laughable at best.  Capoeira is the only martial art that was outlawed for being so violent and unstoppable.  You don't need corny fight scenes to show it's usefulness.  Most of the fight scenes where repeated movements that were shot at different angles.  Dacascos was doing meia lua's (a spinning kick in which both hands are on the ground as you strike) that were knocking out three people at once.  In one ridiculous scene, Saverio (the drug lord) pointed to where he wanted Dacascos to stand so that he could miraculously appear behind him and perform and unchallenged jumping kick to the back of his head.  I wish an experinced Capoeirista would have done the fight scenes.  Although this movie was horrible, it is the only movie in which Capoeira is suppose to be the main artform used. While watching this movie, one can only hope that this poor performance dosen't hurt Capoeira's chances at being the cornerstone of another movie.  
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation. 
 I checked out the 1976 edition of this book about a year ago from the library. Ironic that it is coming out now because they are doing another Kong movie.  This doesn't surprize me, though, because the book is terse, slow, damn near impossible to read, and, ultimatiely, boring.  I love the original King Kong, but it seems that from the start, most of its tie-in and re-incarnations have been sup-par at best.   I recommend reading this for its historical interest - it is the ORIGINAL novelization - but the newer paper backs they are coming out with for the movie are probably much better 
 I never had a problem with this radio until today. It has been exactly two years since I bought the delphi boom box. My display unit on the CD part of the boom box has gone kaput. The radio still works, but I cannot see what radio station I have on and I cannot see the song number on the CDs. I called delphi tech support and was told that since I am passed my one-year warranty, I am out of luck. They can do nothing for me. They told me it would be cheaper to buy a new one because to fix it would probably cost me about $80 an hour. I can probably live without the display unit, but I hope this doesn't mean that more things with this radio will start to go wrong. Be prepared to possibly have to upgrade after two years with this one.   
 As a vegan, eco-minded, anti-sexist/anti-homophobic punk, I'm guessing I'm supposed to like this, but I don't. This is not THE philosophy of punk; hell, I'm not sure such a definitive thing even exists. It's one man's badly argued, inarticulate take on punk rock. Which is fine in itself, but when he makes bizarre, wide-ranging assertions about what it is, who punks are, and the history of punk, and then has the guts to make it sound like a punk catechism, he's in way over his head.  Punk rock to Craig O'hara appears to be a perfect and finished system of thought, or rather leftist protest punk does. Any other part of punk culture isn't real; it's all either facists or fasion victims. Whole chapters are devoted to the 'scourges' of the Straight Edge and skinhead scenes, which he basicly writes off by providing bone-headed quotes from Vegan Reich and Agnostic Front, respectively. Since I know skinheads who don't listen to Agnostic Front, LOTS of sXe kids who don't listen to Vegan Reich, and members of both scenes who are peaceful, cool guys, I have to wonder what he's getting at.  Similarly, statements such as "when it comes to choosing a political ideology....punks are primarily anarchists" are beyond puzzling. Where does he get this? It certainly doesn't jive with my observations. Nor do statements like "punks...respect a woman's right to choose" and "punks...regard organized religion...as anti-individual, and just plain dumb". I know pro-life punks, religious punks, plenty of non-anarchist punks. I know racist, meat-eating, sexist, litering, violent, conformist, and homophobic punks, but to read thsi book you'd think these things were all oxymorons.  Music gets a short shrift too; Craig mentions a few gigs and bands purely for political perspective, and gives less than a page to punk rock's (pre-political) origins. How a supposedly definitive book on Punk leaves out PUNK ROCK, I have no idea. Iggy Pop doesn't even get mentioned once, and any pre-CRASS bands will maybe get a sentence in the beginning. Though probably not.  I would claim this should have stayed as a thesis paper, but that would be too generous. Even as a paper, it's deficiencies in coherence, flow, and objectivity would limit it's usefulness. Acedemic types will cringe; old punks will cringe; young impressionable punks will get a lot of slanted misinformation; the occasional leftist punk who doesn't mind a bit of intellectual dishonesty will eat it up.  The extra star is for the collected flyers and gig photos, and for pity. It's basicly a one star deal 
 Cute dog. Obnoxius owners.  OK I am one of the few that did not enjoy the book let alone finish it. My hopes were to pass it on to mother-in-law, nephew, wife.  I did not care for, let alone expect,a description of the couples sex habits & birth control strategy. Mix that in with a smattering of needless cursing and no one gets this book, it is heading back to the used book store where I got it. 
 Does anyone have more than two sentances worth of information on this book, that actually describs it? if i owned this $150.00 dollar book, i would be mentioning the educational value 
 I first read the Dance Hall of the Dead in high school.  Being a member of the Zuni Tribe, and a resident of the town of Zuni, it was quite interesting to see how much of the information concerning Zuni could be changed to fit the "theme" and plot of the book.  While these may seem like little details to most people, it is quite disturbing to see how often Hillermans work is seen as accurate, because of a reputation he has somehow gained as an "expert" on Native Cultures of the American Southwest.  Apparently, he thought that all pueblo people are the same.  This is evident in the use of the last name of Cata, which is not even seen in Zuni, and is actually a last name seen only in the Rio Grande Pueblos.  In addition, his interpretation or portrayal of the Sha'la'k'o ceremony as a "Dance Hall of the Dead" is simplistic at best.  While he may be an "expert" in Navajo culture, it does not qualify him to comment on a COMPLETELY different society, much less its sacred and complex kachina ceremonies.  Finally, many native people, such as the Navajo, the Zuni and the Hopi (who have all been "featured" in Hillerman's books) feel that Hillerman's descriptions of ceremonies and rituals is just plain wrong.  As an outsider, he has no business delving into or exposing the nature of such things as kachinas, which we consider sacred yet dangerous.  Furthermore, by exploiting our cultures for the sake of adding interest to a plot, he seems to show a lack of respect for our cultures, our religions, and our tribes in general.   This in itself is bad enough, but the worst thing is that people actually consider his novels definitive descriptions of Native culture.  There are many ethnological works out there that are available, and they are NOT hard to find.  After all Zuni is one of, if not THE most complex, and most studied society on earth.  While I don't agree with people wanting to know "everything there is to know" about Zuni culture, there are much better places to find out about "us" than a Tony Hillerman book 
 Dialog was unoriginal and juvenile.  Plot looked like many others blood and gore movies.  I hated this movie 
 Having read Clive Cussler adventures for over 10 years, i was totally disgusted with the redneck and narrow minded attitudes expressed in the book. The father, who does not stay with his son, decides to revenge his son fighting a war trying to kill people in someone else's country. That is perfectly justified!  The book mentions Hindu mercenaries who have not been seen anywhere in the world in any century much less this one. This is a direct insult to all Hindus as being one I am astonished at the insensitivity of the author. How come "Hickman" is not a "Christian" mercenary or for that matter the Corporation as they seem to be in this for the money. The justifications are ridiculous. India and Hindus of India have been terrorized, jailed, colonized and robbed by Christian and Muslims alike over the last 1000 plus years. You don't find us calling people by religion and we have all major religions in our secular country. We have grown spiritually to accept everyone, and I would like the authors to read more than a 2 page synopsis on religions before writing books. The book smacks of jingoism and is a pathetic display of the authors minimal knowledge of religions and global affairs 
 I hate to be negative when it comes to Christian fiction.  This is the second book in the genre I've read and this one isn't much better than the first one I read, although this book seems to appear to want to be affiliated with the "chick lit" genre, by the look of the cover and the title.  I didn't feel a real connection between the two 'friends.'  They could have been put together by a travel agency for all the warmth that I felt between the pages.  Like another reviewer here, what I did like were the historical Hawaiian tidbits.  There were also frequent reminders to appreciate God's creation, and it certainly doesn't hurt to be reminded of that.  The secondary characters were about as human as a sack of potatoes.  Midway through the book, I was anxious for it to be over as I didn't feel I was going to like it any better beyond that point.  Again, as another reviewer here mentioned, their little vacation was just too perfect.  I wasn't really transported to another place as the author seems to think she's doing by going into detailed description of the islands, the food and the ambiance.  Reading about two women having fun on a vacation just didn't do it for me.  The little snafus (if you could even call them snafus) barely made a blip on the screen of the plot.  And having pregnant Hope drive like Speed Racer with a truck full of surfers on the Hawaiian highway was innapropriate and irresponsible.  It seemed that the author was trying to show the reader that Hope had a little bit of a "free spirit" within her but it didn't really come off that way.  Just seemed like stupid behavior to me.  Finally, the word "sisterchick" comes off as cornball.  I can't imagine who would actually use that word to describe themselves and their friends in real life 
 I strongly recommend perusing a printed copy of this text before deciding upon purchase. A large body of the text consists of mathematical proofs of mostly elementary properties of Hilbert space. Despite the historic  significance of the book in establishing a rigorous foundation for the math  underlying QM, it is not a good text for developing either a conceptual or  functional understanding of modern mathematical techniques in QM 
 I read Shogun before and it's binding is falling apart as it was an hand me down. I really expected more... I somewhat expected the characters to be engaging and somewhat realistic. I was left unconvinced by his characterizations of British, American and even Japanese. I actually found the Japanese characters more believable than the "Gai-Jins". The novel is in my mind a failure and the history of the era seem also faulty in it's interpretation. I think that even the names of the Japanese characters are totally false in historical terms from what I can find in history books 
 This book is an example of how not to write a fair evaluation of two great thinkers. The authors worship Lewis as if he were the apologist who could think no wrong, while they condemn Schaeffer as an ignorant fundamentalist who was just about always wrong in some shape or form. I enjoy reading the works of both Lewis and Schaeffer. I have never found their views to be mutually exclusive as Burson and Walls lead their readers to believe.    If I could summarize this book in one word it would be "biased." Burson and Walls have obvious Armenian tendencies, which might have led them to cling so firmly to Lewis' backside.  
 Somehow they managed to get beautiful fresh-faced Kate Beckinsdale and lather enough make-up on her to make her a candidate for Madame Tussaud's wax museum. A bit to aggressive with the hair curling thingie didn't help either. No lead had enough "quiet" time in which to establish a character...they had the depth of Playstation 3 people. All the CG monster's just moved too fast. The thing that bothered me the most...1/3 of the film occurs in "dark-o-vision"...it's so dark you can barely discern what is happening. Combine that with the hyper active fight scenes and rapid fire editing...and whole scenes occur that don't involve us simply cause we are confused on what is going on. I would think there could be some frightining scenes, maybe some tension and dread, heck it's got the grand trio of monsters...nope, not here. We've seen enough how movies are made specials that we are bored by CG cartoons. The "face in the sky" ending was embarressing. 
 While I realize it's hard not to be biased about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, I think we all expect the Complete Idiot's Guide series to be more factual & even-handed, rather than grossly opinionated. Mr Bard gives no voice to the Palestinian or humanist sides of things.   If you want to learn more about this subject - along with all of the Middle East, I'd recommend The Middle East for Dummies. This writer gives both sides of the story and reminds me of the diversity and plain sense of "just wanting to get by" that everyone in the world shares.  Also, note that many of the reviewers for this book (as well as the Dummies book) are very biased themselves - just check out their other reviews. It's pretty shocking. Example: Jill Malter - she lists herself as a "zionist" on her profile. How do you think that reflects her opinions here 
 Director of two `Scooby-Doo' films makes another comedy without the eye-popping CGI of the funny talking dog, and now what you get is `Yours, Mine, and Ours,' a remake of 1968 comedy that should have been left untouched. The only good thing about the newer version is the kids (and some of them would be seen in a much better film sooner or later), so if you a fan of, say, Dean Collins, please stop reading this review here, take a look at the film and enjoy yourself.  But I'm talking about the film itself, and Dennis Quaid & Rene Russo, and what I am going to say is not very nice. To their credits, they truly look like two adults Frank and Helen, widowed Coast Guard Admiral and widowed designer, who had been romantically linked to each other when high school students. Their story is sweet, romantic and convincing. Sadly their story ends in five minutes.  The rest of the film is about the predictable culture clash comedy between two sets of values with lots of badly-constructed pratfalls. Frank is an uptight military person while Helen is a free-thinking vegetarian. Frank has 8 children while Helen 10 (including the adopted kids). Frank demands his home should be `shipshape' while Helen wants her kids always `free.' So what would happen if they live in a same place?  One of the two terrible things about `Yours, Mine, and Ours' is its awfully made slapsticks which are just embarrassing to see. If you think it funny to see someone slipping over vomit on a yacht, or Dennis Quaid soaked in green slime, this is your film. And you can also see Mr. Quaid kissing a pig. Rene Russo is not the same sexy woman you have seen in `The Thomas Crown Affair,' but her stand-in who looks very tired.  But the most annoying thing is the characters of the kids (or what they do). These spoiled children are not only allowed to eat a bucketful of sweets, but they plan to break up the relations between Frank and Helen just because they want to live as they want! Of course they relent after getting what they want, and cue to the sappy ending.  This messy and unfunny comedy comes from four big names - MGM, Paramount, Nickelodeon and Columbia. The images are crisp, and shot in widescreen. Despite its beautiful package, however, none of the cast would like to remember the film and its contents that are simply dreadful 
 This is not a badly written book, but there is nothing new here. A US pilot crash-lands his B17 in occupied Belgium, where he is helped by the Resistance, setting off a series of small personal dramas that unfold against the larger and pitiless backdrop of the War. Shreve succeeds in her stated goal of telling "a catastrophic story in an uncatastrophic manner." But all this is familiar territory that needs to be peopled with strongly-imagined characters if it is to seem new. With the exception of one young boy, Shreve's characterization of the villagers is simply not strong enough to propel the plot, and the romantic elements lack the immediacy to be found (oddly enough for a woman author) in her combat sequences.  Two footnotes. 1) The School Library Journal may be right in placing this book in the YA (Young Adult) category; I would certainly give it a higher rating for this audience. 2) The cover illustration of the paperback edition is simply absurd, showing a picture of what looks like Amsterdam and which has no relevance whatever to the setting (at the opposite end of the Low Countries) that is described in the book 
 I am a big fan of Kath Herman's Baxter series which is why I so looked forward to my continuing "relationship" with Ellen in Seaport.  Unfortunately, this book was a disappointment.  I had to really force myself to continue reading it.  The characters were, for the most part, annoying and the logistic set-up a little too much like Baxter (i.e., the seafood/diner locale and "regulars").  It really did not hold my interest and was not nearly as good as any of the Baxter books.  I have the second one in the series but am hesitant to read it.  Maybe someday when I run out of other "first reads".... 
 This was a required text for my accounting class. Let's just say, if you're not familiar with accounting, or not fond of it, this text will make you hate it even more! Be careful because I somehow received the loose leaf edition of it and had to place it in my own binder.. 
 I was disappointed, only because the music doesn't carry over the action of the movie.  The main reason I purchased the CD was for the song that Salma Hayek sang...her voice is every bit as sensual and seductive as in the movie 
 This is yet another book in a long line of books from either the far right or the far left that do nothing but try to divide the country.  There is no issue that is black and white, there are more sides to issues than just the right or left.    This book may be for you if you are a mindless sheep who is to lazy to think for yourself.  And this is only my opinion.  Judge it for yourself.  
 While a wonderful story, this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch.    A bit hard to understand why the child of two English parents would speak like she's from New Jersey!  I couldn't watch the end of this it was so bad.  Recommend you see another version. 
 Get this set if you plan on having a bad time.  Barely will you be in to 'Good evening' when the lessons quickly turn to "Stop thief!" or "He stole my watch"  or better yet, "I want an attorney"  -- all of which are phrases I have NEVER used in France.  Fodor's should have had the good sense to give practical lessons first,  etiquette, directions, service, culture etc. before launching into rude commands and pick-pocket paranoia 
 I just bought the Live In Atlanta DVD and both me and my friend agreed that this was the worse album they have put out.  It's to pop and I agree with All Star,  I like pop but not like this *confused*.   It's pretty safe to say TWOTW was their best album!  Even Destiny's Fullfilled was better than this and that had all slow songs.  I don't know what else to say other than this album just has singles on it.  They are not consistent at all,  and the album is just to damn choppy for me.       So, in other word it's horrible.  Buy their first CD, TWOTW and Destiny's Fullfilled instead.  Even the XMAS CD.  Peace,  Kmec 
 puddle of mud the nirvana of 2000 god these guys try to be tough hiding behind distorted and swearing and wearing their caps backwards OWWWW big men i can't cope with it killing me i think i'm gonna wet my pants at how lame this band sounds after their hit single "she hates me" has drifted away..and it's replaced with more media twoodle which will get the clones with their hoodies and chains in their pockets and baggy trousers going crazy and wetting their pants NOT COOL NOT ROCK AND ROLL AT ALL  are puddle of mudd really trying to re-vive grunge that they have to rip off all the riffs of the great bands i.e pixies, screaming trees etc  another band that nicks stuff just like oasis  hell i had to wind up the oasis fans aswell  i hate puddle of puke  avoided buy anything by the pixies, screaming trees the cult before this  only if your a ten year old hoodie year clone then you will think it's the greatest album ever made  well i'm a 19 year old and i think it sucks!!!!!!!!! 
 My friend and I randomly found this movie at the rental place and were in for a good laugh, so we rented it. We were right when we were looking for a laugh. It was probably the worst acting I've ever seen. Not to mention, completely plotless. The whole idea behind this movie is ridiculous; from the zen-like janitor to the 'popstar's greatest fear: taking a math test. Please buy or rent this movie. Its horrible nature seriously entertains 
 Unable to get a message to Amazon any other way.  The last two cds are bad, can't play them on my cd player.  I have sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure, but no one has contacted me.  Very disappointed in the Customer relations of this cd compan 
 The moral behind most of these plays is really a great attempt to teach a valuable lesson.  However, these short plays offer no true insight into the world of on stage plays.  Many readers will find the plays short and  direct.  These plays offer very little suspense and are a bore to read.   Save time and money; buy Shakespeare 
 MOTORIN'... WHAT'S YOUR PRICE FOR FLIGHT!?!?  Or something.  These guys are as 80's as it gets.  More 80's than Nitro even!  I mean just LOOK at the guy at the bottom right!!!  Me and my roommate like to sit out back of our house and blast this album (on VINYL of course... what would 80's think if we did so on CD?).  Not only that but we also drink 8% beer.  Not only that but we sing along.  LOUD.  In fact every time Sister Christian comes on we crank the stereo to the max... or rather the maxx.  Because in the 80's you had to use additional x's for words of that sort.  We abuse our neighbours too often and the cops get called pretty much every other weekend.  Night Ranger has cost us hundreds of $$$ in fines.  In fact, the neighbours directly adjacent to us have moved out as of November 1st.  True story 
 This book is total crap.It proves one very hard and frightening maxim:those who do not understand history are doomed to repeat it.The world did not, would not act on the Nazi threat, and the second world war was the result of the world's cowardice.It is a cop out to place blame on the Pope Pius XII, or the Catholic Church. In fact, one of the main reasons the world,meaning,most of europe,England,the USA,did not act was the huge amounts of Nazi sympathizers in those countries. Now we are in a similar situation in the war on terror.What will be the result 
 After chapter after chapter of the gal lamenting over her dead-end romance, she finally buys the house.  Aha, I thought, the story begins.  But alas, not much happens.  Then she finds a picture of her grandmother in the house, and I think, OK here's the story, but not to be.  Then there is the architect that enters - a good love story - no.   Danielle Steel had the makings of three great story lines but failed to develop any of them.  The story of the grandmother's life in the house would have been tremendous.  I think maybe she had a Visa bill to pay and had to get a book out quickly, because she did not put any thought into this one.  Where was the editor on this one?  It was a bummer.  Virgini 
 This book is nice in theory but absolutely inadequate in one fundamental aspect. It does not address the fact that in many US states and in Canada in-laws have the legal rights to enter their childrens' house "at anytime", impose any ideas on their grandchildren. Without resolving this fundamental issue, the book does not offer any help to parents who decide to resist abuse from their in-laws. The book should specificaly address the advice as described in Paul Dodge: "Visistation CD" available from http://www.legalimaging.com/wolf/ go to 'Resources'. This site fills the biggest gap in the book. 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 I have two books currently which are much better than this one.  I'm not really interested in spending the next hour of my life typing up a really exhaustive commentary on this book, as this is the first one I've ever done, but I'm just hoping to save you some time and money and I feel very strongly this is a bad book and a waste of your efforts.  It was the required textbook for my Print Production class, and I could've gotten a better understanding of Print Production by sniffing the ink on my local newspaper.  The glossary is substandard, the chapters are, to say the least, hardly informative, and the author is often contradictive of his own statements.  It doesn't seem as though he has an understanding of Print Production at all.  I spent days staring at this book wondering why I didn't understand print, till I realized it wasn't my brain, I had bought a crappy book.  I won't say some of the elements aren't useful, but you'd be better off shopping at the used bookstore by my school, for example, and picking up a used copy for ten bucks.  There will be plenty there.  You can get everything useful in this book from the Graphics Master (a much better book) or any other Print Production book.  Try Kaj Johansen (spelling... sorry) or Adobe's Print Production Guide.  Also, International Paper occassionally prints a guide.  Don't buy this one.  Graphics Master Seven or Eight would be of MUCH more use to you 
 I've got to be honest, I couldn't finish this book.  I couldn't even get through the introduction because I was so angered and offended by two comments: 1) large breasts are an abnormality caused by an overactive pituitary gland and 2) small hands are a malformation.  My reaction to this was to take my overactive pituitary gland and malformed limbs and go find another book to read.  Attacking other women for the genetics that define their body types is NOT what feminism should be about 
 This was a bitter disappointment.  One of the features we expected to get the most use from was the volume control.  However, if we raise the volume much more than a quarter of a setting, we get horrific feedback (screeching).  Nothing seems to help and when I sent a note to the manufacturer for advice, I never received an answer.  Unfortunately I'd already disposed of the packing info when we discovered the problem, so it looks like it'll hit the trash.  Save your money and don't purchase this item 
 If you're thinking of investing in your first Cash concept album, i'd recommend Ride This Train (1960). Try that, see if you like it. I loved Ride This Train, but wasn't as impressed by America, and sort of regretted paying retail for it. Like most of the Cash concept albums, its well under thirty minutes total, and each of the songs are slight two-minute affairs, the rest being made up by the between-song narration. In Ride This Train, the narration is backed by the sound of a train, which works quite well. On America, Cash just narrates in silence, and it doesn't work as well. I think Ride This Train has better songs, too. Preview 'Loading Coal,' opening track of Ride This Train, with its crisp production and assured vocal, and see for yourself 
 I don't know about anyone else, but this book, with it's constant reviewing of past events just made me more sad than inspired to create art.   I am a painter, not a writer...so forcing myself to write all of the time just wasted valuable practice time. ( I also work full time and have a busy spouse that I like to spend time with) so every precious second that i can spend on my art I grab up.   I guess, for pepole who are in emotional distress, this book can teach you how to use art as a thereputic tool for recovery and self esteem. That is fine. For busy, self motivated artists who already enjoy making art...this book isn't going to deliver those fun moments of "get-up-off-your-behind" inspiration. For an energetic, get moving to make art book, read Danny Gregory's "the creative licence" instead.   In conclusion, this book has a lot to offer pepole who have had a troubled past and are working through a lot of anger and sadness, but that wasn't me. I just wanted to make art 
 And I am still awaiting all of the things Cumbey warns us about in this book to come to pass....  I had originally read the first edition of this book shortly after it was released, by advice of my then Baptist pastor.  I was getting hit up by him to read anti-New Age books, as well as from a "secular" friend to follow up on researching things closely related to The Aquarian Conspiracy.  I was also a fledgling 20-something Christian with a head full of ideas on how to save humanity and also heavily into the apocalypitcal scriptures.  To say the least I was young, dumb and full of heady ideas and general anger toward humanity, and I used my faith to buttress that belief.  I can safely say that I feel that I have grown IMMENSELY in my "faith" since then and have a definite Gnostic bent toward my belief in God.  I have basically shunned the Christian dogma and ethos in favor of a more personal view.  "Religion" is something that I refuse to practice.  This book and others like it are definitely kindling for my resistance to the Christian Apocalyptical anti-New Age movement inherent in many religious groups.  Speculative, ill-researched, and almost tabloid-ish, this book can be used as a meter for the brand of Christian paranoiac visions of "The End Times" which can turn a nice person who just wanted to go to church into a zealot.  It also uses the age-old problematic angle of the argumentative fallacies of "Appeal to Authority, Appeal to Belief, Appeal to Consequences of a Belief, Appeal to Fear, Appeal to Tradition, Misleading Vividness, and using a Biased Sample" which are found in many publications of this type.  Any argument that has all of these fallacies stacked against it is pretty unstable.  Cumbey makes all of these errors and more in this book and ignores evidential reasoning in favor of grand speculation.  To be frank, Constance Cumbey comes off as simply paranoid in this book and seems to wish to draw the reader into her world of highly charged conspiracy theories.  Being a practicing psychologist and a teacher of organizational behavior and leadership, I always warn my students that paranoia is self-perpetuating.  All things which look to be born of paranoia should be first scrutinized and tested logically and with good reasoning and also placed under a microscope before any decisions are made regarding its validity, and therefore pursuit.  As I mentioned previously, this book has inherent instabilities which lead one to not believe in the claims written within the pages.  Now, after trashing it, why did I give it 2 stars and not 1?  Well, it is basically because it does have some value.  Tsun Zu said "Know the terrain/know you're adversary."  This is a good way to get a balanced view of the subject of "New Age" watching.  The book does contain several references to claims, things, people, events and the like which can be used as ballast for the facts that actually stand up to scrutiny and reason.  And once again, we are all still waiting for all of these speculations to come to pass, Ms. Cumbey.  People have been predicting "The End Times" to be just around the corner ever since St. Peter walked the earth.  We still wait... 
 I read Bergdorf Blondes earlier this summer and highly recommend it if you'd like to suspend reality for a few hours and get a girly, humorous dose of the high-maintenance lifestyle of a Manhattan socialite.  I certainly can't say the same for Debutante Divorcee - the story is far less engaging; the observations of manners, dress, and other details of society life are shallow and don't add much to the storytelling.  Worse, the characters evolve from boring to saccharine - and their respective stories are tied up at the end in a very unimaginative, deux ex machina sort of way that will leave you rolling your eyes.  Methinks PS could do better.  
 I disagree with the other reviews of this book.  It is even-handed only if you consider damning with faint praise to be even-handedness.  Brock's thesis is that while Bill Clinton is a sleaze bag; Hillary is a sincere committed radical--sort of a Emma Goldman with a law degree.  While he does at times acknowledge that a double standard has been applied to the Clintons, as compared for example to the Bushes, he repeatedly denigrates Hillary by resorting to guilt by association.  He trots out every associate she has ever had who has been involved in any liberal or left-wing cause and gives you their background in lurid detail.  According to Brock, Hillary's intellectual development stopped in college or law school.  I await his new book to see whether he really is ready to write an even-handed appraisal of the current political scene.  In this book, he assumes that the liberals are naive or out to destroy basic American values.  For example, he assumes that there wasn't  merit at all to the Vietnam war protests or that anyone could actually believe that the war was both immoral and not in the interests of the United States of America.--Arthur Amcha 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 It is the WORST compilation of animation ever done, very far of what was produced in the last 10 years Dont buy it you will save your money I hope one day somebody will realese a real animation show as the one we can see at each year at SIGGRAPH which is really what the animation industry is doing AVOID IT  Francoi 
 It's definitely an unusual book.  With some severe editing it could be given a 3 or 4-star rating for fiction.  But non-fiction it isn't.  Even allowing for memory lapses that might have caused factual errors, no infantry soldier in the German army could possibly have had all the experiences, all the luck, and all the fortuitous circumstances that Jung claims.  It would be interesting to know what Jung and Nesbitt were thinking when they collaborated to write this book, but not so interesting that one would take any time to find out.        
 I agree with the reviewer below who asserts that this item is always on back-order.  After waiting for this item for several weeks already, I was today told by Amazon that there would be an additional one-month delay.  I have canceled my order and ordered these videos directly from Infantastic 
 All that I have to say that this book left out A LOT of stuff. Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of Star Wars, but everyone who reads this book deserves to know more than what this book tells them 
 Realize that H. P. Lovecraft came up with the Necronomicon in his fiction.  I don't see how people can believe in this stuff.  Read some background information on the horror/weird fiction writer before diving into nonsense.  There was never a necronomicon made by any Abdul Alhazred.  
 It's not surprising that Brad Gooch, a professional homosexual, writes a book that makes Frank O'Hara appear to be nothing more than another professional homosexual. Actually, Gooch may be right. O'Hara is an incredibly minor figure in American poetry, and this books devotes too much print to a third-rate writer who would probably best be forgotten 
 I know that a lot of books will have a next installment in the series, but at least they will usually try to tie up loose ends in some sort of fashion.  This book just left you hanging.  I thought, "Is that really the end?!?"   I liked it otherwise 
 CThe biggest problem with this movie is "Crowe" he cannot act! The story is a little far fetched and not believable 
 I have used the ME "week by week" planners for the last several years (6).  I too was disappointed when I saw the new format.  I use mine for work and I really liked the space and lines allowed in the old format.  This one I will use because I already have it, had I know the inside week by week space was different, I probably would not have gotten it.  The space is just too limited for scheduling a day 8 thru 5.  Hope you change back for next year 
 this mat gets very slippery and makes even simple moves frustrating.  i would recommend a different mat. cheer 
 The most disappointing part of this book is its blatant political slant.  The book is NOT about a theory of leadership, but about an ideological judgement of the performance of leaders.  Heifetz starts by insisting that leadership is necessarily tied to values because if you disagree....then the rest of his book is meaningless.  Heifetz believes that to be a good leader you have to adopt positions that he advocates and if you don't, then you aren't a good leader.  So, in Heifetz's world, Reagan wasn't a good leader, but LBJ was.    Do yourself a favor and keep surfing... 
 The only people who like this book are the people (1) who agree with everything the author tells them (2) James Randi himself.  Personally I find this book to be useless. There isn't enough information about any one topic to be any use to me. It's more like a dictionary than encyclopedia.  Atlantis: a continent that doesn't exist. Abominable snowman: a creature that doesn't exist. Okay, so Randi gives a few more details than that, but neither are even half a page. Like my title says, why bother?  Okay, maybe you must really have to know about every obscure cult mystic from 1653, but hey, whatever you like. Just don't bore me telling me why I should know this stuff. Because I dont 
 As someone who has read other books by Hailey North, and enjoyed them, I was VERY disappointed with this one. I totally agree with the reviewer who said that if it had been accurately described on the back cover as having a hero with long gray hair (yuck) who had magical powers, it would have gone back on the shelf.  I gladly pass on those paranormal romance novels.  And a 34 y.o. hero with gray hair? Did I say "yuck" already, and long hair at that, give me break.  And the heroine was hideous.  Nothing but looks and immaturity, no substance.  Save your money. 
 I began my study of political philosophy with the best - namely Plato - so I suppose that when I began reading Aristotle's The Politics, I was optimistic.  That optimism didn't last.  I find that Aristotle takes many arguments for granted and ignores entirely others that would call into question some of his premises.  Often while reading The Politics, I found his analysis entirely lackluster, and his criticisms of The Republic, Gorgias and Laws (all by Plato) flawed or at least overly simplistic.  It's not that I'm incapable of appreciating the brand of philosophy Aristotle uses, after all I do consider myself more or less a realist.  But rather I did find it lacking of vision and insight.  Aristotle focuses on such parochial matters such as classifications of constitutions and mastery over slaves in the household versus statesmanship in the nation, that it never moved me or left me in deeply pensive state.  Ultimately, if you want to be truly inspired - read Plato, not Aristotle 
 I looked forward to receiving this book but was sorely disappointed with what it delivered.  I've had the same thoughts on employee recognition forever.  There were no new ideas and very little specifics on improving recognition.  It is set up in a format where you can have a daily reminder that employee recognition is good and that is the best part of the book.  Definitely not a must have but a decent addition for your bookshelf 
 I read the synopsis of this book and thought that it sounded like an engaging read so I bought it expecting a magnificently  poignant novel. However, I was massively disappointed. Simply put, I found the entire book unremarkable. None of the characters seemed real to me nor did I feel any empathy for them. Their situations and dilemmas felt vague and unimportant at best. I believe that this is largely due to the author's continual  time jumping. By the time I became used to one character and her tale the story shifted to that of the character's mother or grandmother. I did not see the connection between the modern day characters life and that of her grandmother.  Why, if the book is mostly focused on the grandmother's life were we told in mind numbing detail about the life of her granddaughter?  How was this supposed to fit into the story? However, I continued to read mostly due to the tantalizing hints of something more exciting and  tragic to come. But this was not to be. The book ended much as it started, pointlessly. The "big" mystery of the novel  that supposedly shrouded the grandmother's marriage was an utter disappointment. The mystery was simply too banal and lifeless to be of any interest. I felt let down by the author after I had invested so much time in the novel to find out that the tragedy was as simple and uninteresting as what it turned out to be.  I did not hate this novel as you might suspect, but I did not like it either. It was one of those novels that is mildly interesting but if you put it down you will probably never pick it up again. If you feel that the novel is still worth reading then I recommend checking it out from the library. If I had done this I would never have checked it out again nor would I have bought it. Overall, this is a waste of time and money. There are too many good books in the world to waste time on this one.  I Recommend : Light on Snow, The Lovely Bones, A Peacock Spring, Not Without My Daughter, I Dreamed of Africa, Flowers in the Attic, Nell's Quilt, the Left Behind Series and the quintessential horror novels the Ravenloft Series. 
 Bell is definitely a lawyer...not a novelist. His characters are stereotypical in every essence and not very well developed. I found myself disliking each of the characters more and more as they stumbled through their own journeys of typical and unimaginative self-discovery. The twist at the end of the book was not very believable nor was the storyline well developed. Overall, I would not recommend. 
 I have to admit that my wife read this book first and said it was slow.  She didn't say how slow though.  But rather than take her word for it (why should I?  After all, she's my wife) I bothered to pick it up and read it.  How I wish I had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale.  I cannot stand Baldacci's juvenile charactor dialog, but finish it I did though most of it I could have read through closed eyes and not missed anything.  I'll stick with my Nelson DeMille from here on if I want literary junk food 
 The text is interesting and informative. The text is short and sweet. There are examples, which is nice. That is as good as it gets.  Much of the text is based on Canned Heat, a test environment which the author claims works of Windows 2000.  This claim appears to be bogus.  I have verified that the software does not work on several perfectly healthy Windows 2000 workstations. The software does appear to work on Windows XP.  The problem is that so much of the text is based on Canned Heat, so if you can't get this to work, much of the text is not that useful.  The text begins to sound like a marketing brochure for Canned Heat.   If you go to the website, you may be dissappointed (as I was) to never receive a response.  Every form I tried returned an error message. I have verified this with other interested parties. Emails to the addresses provided have not been answered.  My best advice is to avoid "How to Break Software" and "How to Break Software Security."  For what little you get, the books are overpriced.  If the author wants his readers to take him seriously as an authority on software testing, then he should spend more time testing his own software before shipping it out. Frankly, I find it hard to take him seriously if this is the best he can do. 
 I love this topic as discovered in What the Bleep. However this book as a follow up is a disappointment. It is basically a documentary of how the scientists did the experiments and does not really expand on the significane of the findings or offer any new eye opening insights. The DVD is especially boring to watch. The book at least has some nice pictures 
 I detest this book. I through it out immediately after I was forced to read it for class. Never read it. The best review that I can give is: Piece of sh*t. Just don't read it 
 The film is great, but I was extremely disappointed because I didn't realize that it is the widescreen version - i.e., it doesn't cover the screen top and bottom. Beware! No wonder it was only $9.99...  
       I hated this book!  Or maybe I was just rooting for C.J. to get his stuff together in the third book and have Joe Pickett ready to fly for another twenty years.  It's what I expected anyhow.  Didn't happen.   	    The first Joe Pickett story seemed a little tall and convoluted, but the yarn was spun tightly and with dexterity and wit.  I couldn't put it down.  You knew that C.J. Box and Joe Pickett would be around for a long while.  The second book had me looking forward to more Joe Pickett yarns in spite of exploding cows.  An audience was building.  Word was getting around that C.J. Box could keep you interested.  It was time for Pickett to settle down a bit, ease off the fantastics, and start a long career.  Then he fell off the mountain.       WINTERKILL opens with a humiliating and extremely unlikely scene of a Forest Supervisor's "nervous breakdown" that contributes nothing substantial to the story.  From there, it traverses a litany of extremes.  Our humble, heroic game warden in remote Wyoming is forced down a gauntlet of sociopathology, psychopathology, political aberrations, weather extremes, bureaucratic obstruction and cover-up, and the killing of a carefully developed sympathetic character.  Then, incredibly, staight-arrow Joe Picket becomes complicit in a felony that will never be discovered.  	    C.J. Box is a clever, compelling writer, but I don't see how Joe Pickett will ever recover from this dark detour.    
 It is difficult to say who came up with the expression that "rules are made to be broken", but it does reflect to a great extent the notion that no set of rules can encapsulate a given collection of human behaviors or decisions in the real world. To act "on the fly" because of the constraints of short time scales is a more accurate picture of human decision-making. To follow rules for the sake of them, or because they were enunciated by people who are deemed "wise" is to shed oneself of responsibility and to engage in an intellectual lobotomy. Think of a red traffic light late at night (with the streets almost devoid of cars): do you sit there in your car waiting for the light to turn green, wasting gasoline in the process, or do you look both ways to make sure the way is clear and then proceed across the intersection? To follow a rule for the sake of it is illustrative of the former, while the latter is to follow a standard. Standards are a guide, not a prescription, and find their basis in past history and empirical facts, but are cognizant of alternatives. Rules are usually arbitrary and find their origin in highly abstract modes of thought, and are totally devoid of empirical content. They make claim to generality but are usually vacuous in application.   One will find many abstractions in this book, but unfortunately these abstractions, called `rule sets' by the author, do not have their origin in the intellectual armchair musings of philosophers. Instead they are meant to guide life and death decisions, to serve as a framework for war and peace. To follow these rule sets will require violence and killing, to be done if needed at a planetary scale, with particular concentration in the areas of the world that the author calls the `Gap.' There are many countries in this gap, such as Venezuela, most if not all of Africa, and of course the entire Middle East. For the United States, these rule sets replace those that the Pentagon followed during the Cold War. The author's grand strategy though is to "shrink the Gap" by using the implements, wealth, and blood of the `Core'. The `Core' is, as expected, the wealthier nations on Earth, with the United States being the major player and organizer.  Kim Jong Il, Castro, Chavez, Mugabe, and Qaddafi are some of the "big men" who "must go" according to the author's grand scheme and arbitrary compartmentalization of the globe.   It is an open question in the book though as to which group of individuals will have to carry out the rule sets. The rule sets are empty, floating abstractions unless there are troops to enforce them.  The author supported the current war in Iraq, arguing that it forced America to take responsibility for security in the `Gap'. He excuses himself from direct participation in the war however. One can only wonder why he thinks he should not be part of the war. Is it because he thinks that he is part of the Washington intellectual jet set, i.e. the small class of individuals whose "brilliance" is needed to map out strategies for the Pentagon? To have these individuals perish in war would deny the country their sorely needed contributions, so the argument goes. It would seem that the people who give the "best" arguments for war are to be excused from its horrors. Their (blue) blood is not to be shed on the battlefield.   One will not find in this book a list of figures that estimate the cost of `shrinking the Gap'. One will not find any arguments that encourage the intellectual bureaucrats in Washington DC to put on a uniform and assist in the `shrinking of the Gap.' One will not find an estimation of the expected number of casualties in the effort to `shrink the Gap.' But one will find ample sets of floating abstractions totally divorced from the real world. The strategy enunciated by the author is frightening because it seems to have so much backing. He wallows in self-congratulation in the book over this acceptance by the Pentagon, considering it a personal intellectual coup. Those who have elected to carry out his strategy, or who are maybe forced to because of some future draft, may find themselves in a permanent horizontal position, unlike the author who delights to be in a vertical one in front of the podiums at the Pentagon, delivering PowerPoint presentations that outline in vague terms the death and destruction that he will never have to face. 
 These last two books by Douglas have been diappointing, indeed. I borrowed Castle Rouge and skimmed through only to keep up on the relationship between Quentin and Nell. I hope the next book in this series is more in keeping with the first three 
 My husband and I buy many Italian CDs so we think we have good judgement after so many purchases. We were somewhat disappointed in this CD. Every song has the same instrumentation and basically sounds the same. We wonder even if the mandolins are "live" or just canned, they sound so tinny and the same each song. This CD could have used more feeling, romance, whatever...possible had there been some sensitive arrangements with solos, etc. Instead, it was the same bunch of mandolin sounds which made for a very boring CD, in our opinion. A few vocals would have helped the monotony, too. Would not recommend. 
 Very slim on actual info.  Only good as a step by step intro to Typepad, and if you have never heard of a blog before. I was highly disappointe 
 I bought this DVD for my husband for Xmas.  We loved Shaolin Soccer so much, I thought it would be a great present.  We sat down to watch it on Christmas night and it would not play, in any of our DVD players.  It was only 4.99, so it's not a huge loss, but we were really looking forward to watching it.  Save your 5 bucks 
 For heavens sakes, how does a sappy book like this get such glowing reviews!  There are certainly some interesting plotlines and characterizations (although none of them exactly "deep"), and Jones is bold in portraying Polly's life with some stark details.  But most of the story takes place while Polly is about 14-16, and it's asking a lot for an adult to put up with the insipid voice of Polly for so long.  There are some humerous moments, and Jone's entertaining style compels the reader to keep turning the pages, but there's no satisfactory ending that makes you glad to have spent the effort reading it through.  The ending is nothing but sloppy.  It's as if the author spent all this time developing the story at a fairly plodding pace and then was told to finish it in a weekend.  Several reviewers seem to be trying to fill the gaps but frankly there's just a bunch of stuff that has no explanation whatsoever.  The ending has all the satisfaction of a Star Trek episode defeating a robot with "This statement is false", and even that is delivered about as crudely as imaginable.  Jones is better with lighter fare where she can make us laugh our way along and not expect too much of the ending, like "Dark Lord of Derkholm" or "Year of the Griffin".  But she completely overreaches in this one.  I'd have given it 3 stars if it weren't for all the overblown reviews - expectations need to be lowered in this case to counteract the hype.  I do wonder what she could have done if she'd focused more on the ending to provide a satisfactory conclusion, instead of leaving me feeling cheated 
 Yes, actually I do. To warn potential readers from reading the most crappy book in the face of the Earth. Gerald betraying his adored Ellen? Mammy betraying her most loved mistress? Ashley being gay? (Since when is dereaming gayness? And didn't he love Melanie?) Melanie killing a slave out of anger? (This offended me the most, because I have always loved Melanie) Rhett prefering this lame loser wannabe to Scarlett?  It's an insult to GWTW.An insult to Margaret Mitchell. An insult to the south.  Just because some plantations had mullattos doesn't mean everyone had to.  If you have read GWTW, don't let this horrible, disgusting object cheat you out of your time, or your love for one of the most beautiful books of American literature 
 This book is so full of lies, half truths, misquotes, out of context quotes and manipulations that it would even make the devil blush. Actually, simple research will find many blatant lies in all of her books. She uses end notes in her books, but calls them footnotes. Endnotes are much harder to research as compared to footnotes and appear at the end of the book, not at the bottom of the page. I could list each lie, but the review would be pages long, especially when typing out the quotes she uses and the real quotes. Do your own research if you'd like, and I challenge Ann Coulter's fans to research her lies. But I digress, I think that most people who read her books, however, just want to reconfirm what they already believe and will not bother to research inaccuracies. Her most famous style of lying however, is using newspaper quotes out of context, or changing what the person said, or simply just making it up. A simple LexisNexis Search will reveal most of her lies. I found that more than 60% of this book was made up, twisted, or taken out of context, the other 40% was name-calling, insulting broad generalisations,and angry ranting which is, ironically, slander itself. Wow, what a great view of the Republican Right. If I were a Republican, I would NOT be proud to have her on my team. She is juevenile, brash, and most of all, a liar. I hope she fazes out of favor with the American public because she is toxic and an example of what is wrong in American Politics today, despite what side of the fence you sit on. I feel that lying to prove your point and name-calling is poisenous, egregious and morally bankrupt, no matter what political party you belong to. Do yourself a favor, and read a book by another author. If you do choose to read this, I challenge you to look further into what she writes. The lies begin in the first few pages.   
 I really tried to enjoy this book but just couldn't manage to like it by the last page. This story tried to explore the different aspects of family and self, all through the magical Lazelle family. I found it to be simple minded and rambling. I'm not even sure the author was 100% where she was going in this book.   The main character, Gypsum, receives her powers later in life than her family. She was previously cast as the "normal" one, alienated for her differences but attached to her family through tradition and magic. Her relationships with her family are forced and just seem wierd at times. Not once does the author explain how this family fits in with society. Most of the story runs like this: "I almost killed my aunt through cursing a computer that took over our minds. I need a cup of coffee" The author gets lost more than once in direction and the middle of the book is just another magical mistake after another where a point is made then skipped over.   Everything is so strained and just plain wierd that I couldn't get into it. There is no personality in any of the characters. If it weren't for the adult situations and language I would have pegged this as a young adult novel. I think it almost was supposed to be until 3/4 of the way through the book where all of a sudden a lot of the characters are swearing and there is a slight homosexual relationship explored.   I gave it two stars for some interesting parts of the book that kept me from throwing it away and the fact that there is some effort to include statements about family ties. Blah.  
 My review on this one is going to be a bit more critical than most. This is probably one of the worst books on Glock pistols that I have read to date. The author is constantly comparing Glocks to 1911's, and other types of pistols. The book is also loaded with plenty of non-Glock images. Mr. Sweeney, I bought this book because I like the Glock, not because I wanted to see plenty of photos of 1911's... ad nauseam. Perhaps Mr. Sweeney should stick to books writing books like his "Gun Digest Book of the 1911", as he has done Glock more than a bit of injustice.    You know, I recently purchased Massad Ayoob's excellent book "The Gun Digest Book of Sig-Sauer". Mr. Sweeney, please take note... Massad's book on the Sig is FILLED with useful information and photos related to his book's title... SIG-SAUER PISTOLS!  Sorry, but I must recommend a pass on Sweeney's "sort of Glock" book!  Han 
 ...wow, I have to read this book for college, what is higher education coming to?  So far I'm a fourth of the way through and have no idea what hir theory is.  Ze says one thing and then completely contradicts hirself.  Hir Gender Identity/Power Pyramid is so biased.  Ze spells pyramid wrong, unless "pryamid" is some play on hir words. One of hir points is that to be at the top of the Gender/Power pryamid you must possess a well-formed, above-average-legnth penis.  According to studies on Penis legnth world wide, the Irish are the most well endowed, followed by african americans. So according to Kate's pryamid the Irish should be the #1 super power in the world, followed by Africa at #2. Therefore any high ranking man in the USA must be of Irish descent.    Her pyramid has a foundation of strippers, Mr. Potato Head, aliens and cone headed midgets just to name a few.  Then at the top is a white man, who has no eyes, holding a son who has no eyes.  Basically Kate is evilizing the white heterosexual male who has children.  It almost seems that she is creating this them vs. hir mentality in hir pyramid.  In hir quizzes ze also gives gender points for being "white" and having blue eyes.  Implying hair and eye color has anything to do with gender seems to be a Nazi like theory to me. Ze hirself has blonde hair and blue eyes.  Sounds a bit hypocritical.  Kate may be confused, that could be why there are contridictions throughout the readings.  The evilizing of white, blonde haired blue eyed males seems to stem from self hatred of her former identity.  She also seems to be fixated on genetalia and reproducing children, perhaps steming from the loss of her own penis, whatever size it may have been.   I beleive the point of this book so far has been to confuse you so much that you too will be at a loss for what your gender is and buy more of Kate's confusing books to try to figure it all out.   
 I could barely make it through this book.  I found a copy downstairs in my apartment building and thought it might be a nice read.  I enjoy knowing what people find meaningful in their lives.  This book is nothing more than a bunch of self-entitled snobs whining about their jobs.  I decided it would be best to throw this book away and top it off with my spoiled yogurt so nobody else would be subjected to this nonsense.  
 I am disappointed in this book.  I have read 10 of the stories so far.  Each story starts off great and builds into something exciting.  Then each one seems to end abruptly.  So my problem is with the endings.  Each one is worst then the one before.  I would not recommend this book to someone who is starting to read fantasy.  It will disappoint the 
 If you want to see Matthew Bourne's choreography, your in for a major disappointment. The constant pseudo-artsy cutting, jarring close-ups, and poor shots of the dancing make this a jarring and extremely disappointing video. Be warned if you have epilepsy. The fast continuous scene switching will probably induce an episode 
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 I say this as honest as I can this is one of the most annoying albums ever released. There's no real originality to it at all just alot of blues music. If you heard one blues artist you've heard them all. The only thing different is they have an annoying organ, or keyboard, but remind me never to buy the brand. It just cuts me to the core, and makes me feel so melancholy. To me this is just another San Francisco band that decided to record music played while stoned out of thier minds. If this is for the mind and body sorry my body's supposed to be a temple. Of course strike 2 is the blasted harmonica playing. Having an annoying organ is bad enough, but now you throw a harmonica into the mix you've gone too far. "Section 43" while annoying is rather creative in a macbre sense. I've pictured the little guitar interlude where I get the sensation of walking into a lovely garden, and following where my heart leads the sun is out, and I keep walking along, and spot a lovely girl, and pursue her, and I go further and further without a fear in the world as the sun's shining, but then I'm deep in the woods, and the dark clouds roll in; I rather not tread there again. Anyway I'll stick with the "Feel Like I'm Fixing To Die Rag". I love kazoos. Country Joe knew what he was talking about when writing that song after all he did do time in the navy. That would be one thing to his credit. Otherwise I'm left with the decision to see which was worse; this album, or his forgettable 1971 movie "Gasssss" 
 I think it's sad how many people put there faith in SRW.  This woman speaks of Christianity more than any other book I've seen.  I've actually met one of her friends who say she gets a lot of grief for this.  It's for a reason!!! I was told this was for Tolerance amongst religions...to I dunno say cover all her basis.  Tolerance is great...I have many Christian friends...but when it comes down to it there is no point in trying to blend it with an already complicated religion.  I myself am not Wiccan....I am Celtic Pagan...but have study both paths for 11 years. I've said my piece the choice is yours 
 When I sit down in the theater to watch a film I start with a neutral rating of zero so that the movie itself can then take me up the star rating, or down.  I rate differently than most.  I do it, for my purposes, in a much better way.  Trust me.  You should try it. Start out neutral then be mutable.  Go up or down with your rating as the movie progresses.  At the end of the day you will come up with what is a personally more accurate composite rather than a final, less step-by-step derived method of judgment.  If only waiting until the end to state your case, much of your case cannot be stated. You will come up with a more accurate impression if the film is evaluated as you go. Very important also, is the type of rating.  Never limit yourself to the typical zero-to-five star confinement.  Always allow yourself a much more realistic range of from a minus ten stars, up to a plus ten stars, or at the very least, a negative five up ten to a plus five stars.  You will like it better, personally.  You know very well you have seen a movie where zero stars is simply not low enough.  This movie:  I generally have a difficult time recovering up into the plus-star level on my movie score card rating, back into the positive rating category, when I consider the overall rating ultimately given, when in the first few minutes I am abused by a movie in the way this one burnt.  It is not a good sign, or indicator of good quality to come, when a deranged, icky creep in his underwear comes out of the bathroom in someone else's house, screeches, shoots the lead actor in the gut then commits suicide after blithering back into the bathroom.  It wasn't scary.  It wasn't a harbinger of great things to come.  It was just crude, offensive and a cheap way to get intellectually challenged viewers to want more. Right off the bat this is a gross, totally classless way to abuse a captive audience paying for, hopefully a well thought out storyline, artfully delivered.  The art of movie making was sacrificed in favor of a blood and guts in your face introduction.  Sitting with my wife I told her, within five minutes of the opening curtain, that B. Willis "was one of them."  She waited until near the end and asked me how I knew that so soon.  "Well, my first clue," I says, "was when he (Willis) was shot dead on his own bed by the underwear-guy with the concave chest during the offensive first scene, just before he splattered his own blood and brains all over the bathroom as far out into the bedroom as possible."  Think about it:  from that opening scene on Willis did not interact with anyone the way normal people interact, even if one stretches reality in order to conceive the acceptance. Subsequent interactions were not right and very obviously so.  Now, don't misunderstand.  I have seen many films that are filled with all kinds of gritty gore and head squashing.  This particular film was so low class in its attempt to shock the viewers that it was simply disgusting.   Believe it or not, the classless opening is not the main reason upon which I rate this movie a minus nine stars.  The reason is this: The single most predominant cause of my disliking this film is philosophical in nature.  That is, I do not like any message that implies that we, ourselves, are not responsible for what affects our lives.  Everyone would love to get off easy for their own actions that have led to poor conditions within which they themselves find. Yielding the responsibility for our behavior, and course of our lives,  blaming our own individual predicaments on other forces, by us uncontrollable and subject to another force, or entity, is the biggest excuse for self produced bad circumstances that mankind has ever used, the most often used, that is.  Uneducated people, those that haven't been around, haven't traveled, are not well-read, do not see or hear or care to understand the world and their place in it, hoping to blame something else for their resultant condition, they eat this up.  It is too frightening for them to face their action's consequences so just love to excuse themselves from their own equation catalyzed by this type of tripe.  The completely erroneous idea that what will be will be or what will happen happens is rooted in certain, "Eastern Philosophies," based on the idea that man is inconsequential in his own environment and might just as well not try to improve his own conditions since what is gong to be will be no matter what.  The "Western Philosophy of Life", where what happens to us depends a great deal upon how hard we work at being and becoming what we want to be, is the main reason those cultures seeing the world and life and our place in it in that way, that are light years ahead of societies which have been around for thousands of years longer.  If water is not delivered by pipes directly into our homes then it was not meant to be, and why fight what is meant to be?  If sewage is not drained from our homes by pipes to be deposited in recycling plants then it is useless for us to change what is into what might be better since it is the way it is since what is, is. What results of this approach, if these views of life are taken as unalterable facts, is that no motivation exists to stop from lazily sitting and watching life go by being what it will be.  This film sends a message that other forces make puppets out of us, so our screw ups are not our blame. That's a bad way to approach life.     Bad.    Even if the premise of this film is accepted, the positive reasons for the sixth sense to exist at all were left on the cutting room floor.  The examples of the workings of the mechanism that might even slightly imply why things were OK to be the way the film portrayed were left out.  Go figure.  One could lie to himself with that assumption, albeit erroneous, if why what was the main theme of the movie had been even somewhat justified. 
 This movie, based on the Thomas Harris book, is a remake of the movie 'Manhunter.' The story leads up to the events of the popular Silence of the Lambs film. Red Dragon was remade because the studio wanted to cash in on the surprising popularity of Hanibal Lecter. Unfortunately the supply of Thomas Harris books was exhausted. So they revisited and retitled this prequel to the Silence of the Lambs. In Thomas Harris's book and the original Manhunter Dr. Lecter was an intriguing support character only. But now Hollywood has discovered that Hannibal's character brings in moviergoers so they take every opportunity in Red Dragon to add or lenghten scenes with Dr. Lecter and put him center stage.   The original Manhunter was a fine film directed by Michael Mann. It featured Brian Cox (Bourne Identity) as Dr. Lecter and William Peterson (CSI) as Special Agent Graham. This movie is lacking in all aspects to the original (and to the book). While Anthony Hopkins's portrayal is as good as Mr. Cox's Edward Norton is clearly out of his depth. He is unable to convey the complex emotional trauma that Agent Graham experiences when he assimilates the mindset of a sadistic killer who wipes out entire families. Performances by Harvey Keitel and Ralph Fiennes are also wasted here. My advice-buy or rent the original.      
 This was outdated and simple before it was pubslished. You can read better info just glancing at some white papers for web analytic firms.  Even the person the author got to write a preface only suggested reading a few chapters - which you could read in no-time-at all.  
 I had to read this book for a class. Overall, it felt like the kind of book a person will enjoy and find interesting if he or she is just out of college and going through the "quarterlife crisis." Otherwise, it seems too intent in demonstrating the existence and the characteristics of such a crisis. The book is composed mostly by excerpts from the interviewees, with few comments from the authors. If I didn't have to read it for the class I wouldn't have finished it, and I love to read almost any book 
 This was my first Deaver book...and my last.  The suspense factor was "ok", but the sections on scuba were ridiculous.  A diver (with only 25 logged Caribbean clear-water dives) goes into a new NY/NJ wreck, alone (no dive buddy), on a single tank.  And the Coast Guard approves this dive...laughable.  Then once in the wreck, the diver goes down a dumbwaiter passageway measuring 2' by 2', without taking off any gear!!!    You might ask why I point this out...The above was 2 chapters, not just some passing reference, a very material piece of the story.  If this one section [which I know something about] is that outlandish, what does that say for the other sections that I'm not as informed about.  Complete Science Fiction!!!  You are better off reading tea leaves than this book. 
 This band's stated agenda was to create good old pop music, the kind you used to hear on the radio in the 1960s and 1970s. Unfortunately, their execution was lacking. Their singer and songwriter had next to no talent. His best work was singing with Liz Phair on a cover of "Turning Japanese." And even that was hollow and soulless. Then he killed himself and nobody cared except maybe close personal friends and relatives, but maybe not even them if they'd heard this record. It's that bad 
 The title of this film is very deceiving & it's pretty clear that it was designed to lure people in.  I actually saw this movie way back in the early 90s.  I forgot all about it and got excited and bought it a few years back.  I thought it was a sure-fire to be wall-to-wall skin.  After all, it features 2 names (Dana Delany and Kim Cattral) who have shown no aversion to shedding their clothes in other movies.  Well, I was way wrong.   There is MAYBE 10 seconds worth of nudity in the whole movie.   It's also supposed to be a comedy, but I didn't find it particularly humorous, either.  For what it is, it's an OK movie.   It details what is basically a slumber party for a group of grown women.   Some of the dialogue about sex is cool - kind of like finding out what goes on in a women's locker room.  There's also some exploration of how being a lesbian might make life more "simple" than being straight.  However, in the end, I found this to be a pretty dull film.   Most importantly, it does not deliver on what the title promises.  I would be far more forgiving if they had named this movie something else, but I do detest false-advertising 
 If you're lookiing for valuable insight into how great businesses were conceived and executed this is not the book for you. Each business is given only a few pages of what essentially amounts to fluff. Most of the information is anecdotal in nature and rarely goes beyond the sort of superficial treatment one might get in People magazine. The articles reminded me of something a high school student might turn in as a short essay assignment. The roster of companies chosen is rather suspect. There is disproportionate representation by the cosmetics and fashion industries. I think that every company that sells makeup is covered here. Many of the other selections are some of the more glamorous and obvious success stories. C'mon, we ALL know the MicroSoft story by now. I was also puzzled by the lack of variety in the writing. Time and time again profit is referred to as "turnover", going public is referred to as "floating", a line of products is called a "range" -- was this book edited? I cannot recommend this book for business persons. It may be appropriate for a young person who has not been exposed to these canned legends before. 
 Tom Robbins writes self-consciously quirky drivel.  I tried to read "Still Life with Woodpecker," for the sole purpose of tallying every time he points out the fact that the two protagonists are redheads (at least once every five pages), but I'm just not enough of a masochist for it.  Don't read Tom Robbins.  Read "Catch-22", "One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest", or "Breakfast of Champions" instead 
 Send in your query or your three chapters to fifty of these guys and then wait.  First, they don't want to read them.  They hire someone to do this task.  They don't want to do it either.  They send you their rejection card and don't even acknowledge the title of your book.  Once they did. Now they're too many of you.  They do get shills to write good things about their own published book because they want the expectant writer to buy it.  That's how they make money.  You must have a contact with a publisher or an agent or they won't touch your stuff.  Even Hemingway was going nowhere until Scott Fitzgarald reccommended him.  Enough though of opinion.  Ask anyone that you know who is an aspiring writer if they ever got a positive response from an agent.  Michael Blake "Dances With Wolves" never got an agent until Costner said he was going to make the movie.  Even then it was like pulling rotting teeth.  The publishers sent regection after rejection until Blake sold it for $5,000 (to be published in paperback)with a $1,000 bonus if the picture was actually released.  He had given up writing after 35 years when "Dances" sold.  But who did he have to know...Kevin Costner of all people.  Another agent, not Blake's, said he had only taken one client on in one year and only because the guy sent him a bottle of French wine.  He liked French wine.  Go to the agent.  (How badly do you want to be published?) Talk to the agent.  Find out if they are even in the neighborhood of what it is that you're writing.  Call publishers.  Talk to their assistants.  They'll talk to you if you keep it short.  Find out what they really want.  Go to the library or the internet but don't encourage these "Write and be published authors."  They are conning you.  None of these agents have the slightest intention of reading your chapters.  Anyway, one way or the other you will find out.  Don't use someone else unless you have an "in;" be your own agent.  Good luck you writers.  Some of you are great and are anguished over nothing.  You will succeed.  Do it yourself and don't forget foreign publishers that publish in English.  They will read your stuff. For heaven's sake's don't just sit there! Good hunting!  
 I rarely stop reading a book in the middle of it, but I couldn't take any more of Look Homeward, Angel after Part I (about 1/3 of the way through).  It was long, rambling, and most of the passages did not add anything to the story, not even in the way of atmosphere.  I do not recommend this book 
 It's great that Dr. Weil recommends that we get fresh air, exercise, eat lots of vegetables, avoid fast food hamburgers,  breathe and think positive healing thoughts.  But that's the extent of his good advice.  He also gives some very bad advice that is effectively shredded in 2 new books that have come out.  "The Whole Soy Story" by Kaayla Daniel and "The Fluoride Deception" by Chris Bryson.  Between soy and fluoride you'll have a wiped out thyroid in 8 weeks (+ or -) and that doesn't bring optimum health.      
 This will be the last "Cat Who" book I read. I initially enjoyed the main character and the location, but whoever's being paid now to produce another money-maker hasn't a clue about a decent mystery series. There's no mystery. Nothing rings true anymore -- the author obviously never's worked at a newspaper or attended an auction. All the people in the book get so thrilled about really stupid things. Qwill is supposed to be  charismatic and talented but he's just gotten plain annoying. Also beyond annoying is the kitten auction. NEVER would a reputable humane society auction animals off to the highest bidder. Come on! This is supposed to be a book for animal lovers. Don't screw up something so basic! I guess I picked up this book hoping for the series' earlier charm. It's lost it and it's lost me 
 I really like Bruce Campbell and his movies like Army of Darkness. But this movie is not in the same league. First of all the plot is slow and boring. Bruce does not have the same rouge character that he is so good at. Instead the movie is filled with frankly depressing scenes of him in bed or limping around barely able to move. This really hampers the action aspects of the movie. The dialogue aspect is not much better.   If you like Bruce, my advise is to get his other movies or try to get a hold of the TV episodes of  "Jack of all trades" episodes. It is a lot more fun and has the "real" Bruce 
 I first read passages from this book in college.  I can now see how liberal professors very much enjoy using this book to influence young minds.  Professor Zinn is a far left author.  He uses the usual lines: America generally bad, communism generally good.  Obviously Mr. Zinn has the right to write whatever he wants, and his writing style is very convincing.  However, if the reader investigates the facts, many holes become visible in his theories.  Those who agree and disagree with his writings should explore opposite viewpoints.  A good example is "Intellectual Morons : How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas by Daniel J. Flynn" which gives the reader a good profile of Mr. Zinn. 
 This is a nice thought but i didn't consider this a tribute to luther it seemed like an idea that went way wrong even though luther did at some point in his career did sing all the songs on this recording but he didn't write them he paid tribute to the songs he liked and if this were a tribute then i think they should have sang all song luther wrote but it didn't happen so think of this as something of them paying tribute to some of luther favorite songs and when you look at that way you have something that is a nice listenable cd 
 Rush Limbaugh - the man most responcible for replacing the biased liberal media with the biased conservative media - giving millions of Americans false hope and dangerous half-truths.  I've had enough of this marketing phenomena known as "conservatism."  They have created a demographic group for the sole purpose of selling books and merchandise.  The anti-Clinton/Moore/Kerry books are the same junk as the anti-Bush/Cheney/Reagan books.  No on is interested in opening their mind  and learning-they simply want to reinforce their own shallow ideas, entertain themselves and feel comfortable in their own little imaginary world.  Forums hosted by so called Conservatives are run in the same close minded ways in which college liberals shout down any guest speaker with whom they disagree.  Meanwhile, the two parties (the only choice the American voter is given) are virtually the same when it comes to the most important issues.  Both parties are taxing and spending, and supporting the illegal invasion of America by Mexicans.  Big business is in bed with big government and they are both getting even richer by selling you books pretending to speak ill of each other.

 i have not read this book...i would look at it if someone tossed it to me, but i will not go out of my way to look at it, nor would i purchase it...for the simple reason that the author, mr. barkun, appeared on c-span, and engaged in a tag-team attack on one of the subjects of his screed, alex jones, along with the host, brian lamb...ANDDDD more importantly, he refused to appear on Jones' show when Jones invited him to discuss what he'd written, and what he'd said...and he apparently did not even interview jones for his book, which is inexcusable negligence from someone who purports to be a scholar - or from any author for that matter.. 
 I ordered these items in mid June, and my credit card was billed on June 22.  However I discovered two weeks later that, despite your having billed my credit card for items being purchased from Andrew Christian, the order had never been sent to them.  I was then assured that the order would be completed promptly (I told them I needed the clothing by July 19, otherwise I would not need the items at all)).  The order was not given to UPS until July 17 with an expected delivery date of July 21. Consequently I directed UPS to return the order unopened.  The handling of the entire mess was slopppy, and the billing of my credit card two weeks before the order was even placed was unethical and shameful.  
 The color and CGI's are excellent in this film. The location shots are great, and the attempt to capture the late 1880's successful.  However, the female character is obnoxious and certainly un- becoming in attitude,  language and appearance. While this might be the 90's, and women should be  able to handle strong lead characters, this woman, who was the financial  backer of the expedition, was disgusting.  There have been several major  cinematic attempts at this story, but this version leaves a lot to be  desired 
 Not only this book is poorly written but in fact its also written in a very confusing manner. Dr. Kreinin does not provide us with adequate examples for the topic he discusses and furthermore there is not glossary in the textbook, which is crucial for the students to get some quick facts without memorizing the entire terminology used in the book. I was surprised to find this book as part of the required readings for classes at Michigan State University and Northern Michigan University. I recommend that this bok may not be used as part of the curriculum for the students. It is not helpful and its over-priced relative to its limited use 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 Ridiculous, convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring.   Did Cornwell even write this one herself? If so, she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread: On page 216 Marino remembers Mrs. Paulsson greeting him at the door "wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater", but later when he tells Scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door.  Perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think Marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened. However, to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct 
 When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it 
 This book is just another 'low fat/high carb is the way to go' and a vegetarian diet is the best for everyone piece of junk. The authors have little nutritional knowledge and, at one point, advise a vegetable fast for diabetics! Very poor quality book and I advise you to avoid it 
 The website describes the inputs for this speaker as including an LFE input, but the speaker I received does not have an LFE input.  The manual I received with the speaker depicts a separate input, labeled "LFE IN (unfiltered)," but there is no such input on the back of the speaker.  Update:  When I complained about this, they sent me another one.  It too does not have an LFE input, so now I have two speakers that do not live up to the description on this website.  I am reluctant to complain again, because these damn things are big and heavy

 To be honest, I almost bought this book. When I have thought considered for about 2 days at home, I decided No. Here comes the comments, I don't really like the hair, I always wish to buy a book that is very comprehensive about hair modelling and perfect body modelling. In contrast, the body part which is being modelled of that character is great and quite appealing.   Bad news is, in this book, the polygonal hair is way too bad and unappealing for a game character. Unlike Kate Walker from Syberia, she has a very beautiful perspective because of the realism of her hair(very detailed) and the textures that suit her body structure. Not to say that the textures of the girl in this book is bad, but it looks like a tattoo clumped to her naked torso and legs. Looks so unreal !  And the other things is that, the functions were mostly based on 3DsMax 3, and the functions are slightly different from 3DsMax 4. Just beware of that. 
 This book speculates about both the advance of computer technology in the 21st century and the socio-political response to it.  Although it is peppered with a few interesting notions worth skimming, much of the speculation is unreasonable and philosophically naive.  In the first chapter, Kurzweil attempts to lay a sort of theoretical framework for his speculations, which boils down to his belief that Moore's Law is just one instance of a cosmic principle of exponential advance which explains everything from the first second of the universe after the Big Bang to the evolution of life on Earth and now the evolution of technology.  The second chapter argues that it is possible for an intelligence to create something more intelligent than itself:  just as evolution "intelligently" created us, we will (soon!) create computers which will build machines of far greater cognitive ability than us.  It is indeed intriguing to consider that someday machines will outperform humans in many ways, but the book to this point is best skimmed, because there's actually very little substance and a lot of dry, pseudo-intellectual filler.  Chapter 3 examines the philosophical problem that is going to be brought to the forefront by super-advanced computers:  what is consciousness, and can machines possess it?  Kurzweil unimpressively touches on a handful of schools of thought here (his sentences on Descartes made me wonder if he has read anything on the subject besides pop philosophy), though he does not try to decide between them.  Instead, his prediction is social:  eventually machines will be accepted as real people -- just as real people will physically merge with technology -- even if that sounds bizarre to us now.  This theme comes up again and again, and it proves to be one of the only thought-provoking issues of the book.  Chapters 4 and 5 talk about the field of artificial intelligence, where it has been, and where it needs to go.  In a section entitled "The Formula for Intelligence", Kurzweil provides his recipe for the strong AI of the future:  recursion, neural nets, and genetic algorithms -- all taking hints from the reverse engineering of the human brain.  This wishful thinking is one of the Achilles' heels of this book.  For a software entrepreneuer, Kurzweil is strangely blind to the evidence:  software is hardly becoming more complex or "intelligent" at all, let alone exponentially.  Today's software systems are perhaps bigger but not significantly "smarter" than systems of past decades, and software quality continues to barely meet the lowest of expectations.  Despite Moore's Law and the faith that it will continue to provide more and more cycles in the hardware world, progress in the world of software seems, to this software engineer of 15 years, to be nearly a flat line, not an exponential curve.  Just compare how many hundreds of man-years have gone into the lastest version of Windows, versus what it would take to design and implement Kurzweil's ideal of software that is able to write more powerful software.  Part of the problem may be that Kurzweil simply ignores the fields of cognitive psychology and epistemology, which are in their infancy.  He does not seem to even be aware of the issues in these fields which would have to be solved (probably by geniuses) in order to create "strong AI."  Instead, the solutions he predicts are purely materialistic:  brain deciphering, massively parallel hardware, and genetic algorithms.  Part 2 of the book focuses on potential technologies.  The most powerful computers he speculates about are quantum computers, and he doesn't waste any time before asserting that someday we will be able to download the entirety of a brain into a quantum computer, so that the computer will in effect have a clone of that person's mind.  Kurzweil, in his materialism, does not seem to even be aware that there is a philosophical argument that this is impossible.  He also speculates about nanotechnologies and how they will eventually give us a unprecented ability to manipulate physical reality.  Part 3 of the book is comprised of specific predictions for 2009, 2019, 2029, and 2099.  This book was written in 1999, and we can already see that some of his 2009 predictions are either just simple extensions of things we were starting to see in 1999, while others wildly miss the mark, such as:  "the majority of reading is done on displays", "the majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition", and "intelligent roads are in use, primarily for long-distance travel."  That Kurzweil could be so far off in his 10 year predictions does not bode well for his 20-, 30-, and 100-year predictions.  Indeed, his predictions for 2019 sound like a science fiction novel, and of the ones that sound plausible I think he must be off by at least 30 years.  His speculations for 2029 are just fantastic.  In general he seems to "predict" based on the assumption that new technologies will be deployed as soon as they are available, underestimating a myriad of resisting factors:  legal, political, social, market, scientific, etc.  Ultimately this book can be fun for skimming and raises a couple of thought-provoking issues, but as speculating about technology more than 10 years in the future is necessarily a foolish activity, there's plenty of foolishness to be found in here

 Let's make this quick -   Several of these shorts are sourced from other vendor's dvds, specifically the "One Week" short, which only comes from one source. This may not be illegal, but it sure is a crummy thing to do to those good guys who actually source and restore silent films. Buy the Kino set of Keaton to support that kind of work.  Several of these shorts are from inferior copies. They are also poorly encoded, so the quality suffers even more.   And then there is a watermark in the corner, because, even though these are just copies of other people's productions, heaven forbid somebody copies these versions!! So you get to see a watermark during the entire set. Annoying. It's amazing that companies that have everything to lose when it comes to being copied won't put a watermark on THEIR dvds because they know that quality comes first, but some tinpot garbage vendor is willing to slap his logo all over the place.   Don't bother. There is nothing worthy here. Get a different set from Image or Kino, who actually have done something worthwhile. And get me something to control my blood pressure while you are at it. Remember, I bought this so that you don't have to!! 
 If you've read anything already about these techniques - writing it down, visualizing it, tithing - this book offers no additional insights. And despite his "Official Religious Disclaimer" at the beginning of the book, it is packed to the rafters with the author's own religious dogma. If you share the author's religious outlook you may like this book, but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading 
 This book for the lack of a better word was cheesy. I read my first Danielle Steel book a few weeks ago (Malice) and was really impressed. I decided to grab another thinking it would be good as well. This book was slow and the brokenhearted story line dragged on forever. On top of that the main character was such a whiney complainer and that I couldn't stand even reading about him. This book was bad and extremely predictable. BIG DISSAPOINTMENT 
 I don't get the politics of Tony Bennett saying "yes, dear" to KD Lang at the end of the 1st number, but sad to say, the whole album seems an overproduced mistake, including sappy saxophone interludes and treacly high-pitched violin countermelodies.  I love sax.  I mean, I love saxophones and saxophone players as if they were part of my family.  But someone has got to stop this easy listenin' moony-waily lushly lackadaisical sinuous syrupy "smooth jazz" exploitation of just one tiny, embarrassing aspect of the saxophone's otherwise terrific character.  But I doubt the small-minded no-talents who produced this album would ever get the drift.  Note to Word Lovers:  "Treacle" originally meant "a medicinal compound formerly in wide use as a remedy against poison."  However, Tony and KD got suckered into singing on an album that's practically poisonous itself 
 Just do a search on the internet for underground railroad quilts and you will find many web sites that debunk the myths set forth in this book. Although the concept is appealing, there is absolutely no evidence other than one woman's story to back it up. Almost all underground railroad historians and quilt historians label this book as FICTION, not fact! There is so much factual material to learn about the Underground Railroad - it is an insult to the history of black Americans to perpetuate a myth 
 Most would say that battleships is a game of luck, yet someone known to me proved that there are some very sneaky tactics (without cheating) that you can employ to see that you win. Kind of ruins the fun, but a classic game nonetheles 
 If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever. What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.  McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore. 
 It's about the years just before he became Prime Minister of England.  It's half love story and half about how he was trying to warn how dangerous Hitler was to England. The story about his relationship with his wife was more entertaining than the historical part due to Finney and Vanessa Redgrave as his wife. He fought depression and was bankrupt at that time. He had a huge ego when it came to his political life but deep inside felt he didn't deserve his wife. Both in his personal and professional life he was a difficult person to deal with.   The Gathering Storm won an Emmy for writing so maybe this movie just wasn't my cup of tea. Still, this movie wasn't quite a love story so I can't recommend this to fans of romance movies. It also wasn't centered around the events in England leading up to World War ll. So I can't recommend it to people who enjoy movies about history.  If you want to learn more about Churchill, read a book about him. If you want a love story, there are better ones to watch.   
 Who the **ck are GNR?? Plus they make awful music! I can't stand this annyoing album. The music is awful, so as the lyrics. There is not ONE good song on this piece of s**t. It is a album that contains 12 crappy songs. AXL ROSE is a very annoying lead singer just screams and sings horribly, and SLASH is terrible too. In THE WAY STAY AWAY FROM THIS AS WELL AS GNRS OTHER ALBUMS. LEAVE GNR ALONE....GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS.

 The first several books were great, but about half way through, it just turned into porn. I have never minded a little sex in books, but this one is nothing but sex. There's supposed to be a big important vampire meeting/party after the ballet, but Hamilton doesn't even bother to write it, having Anita passed out from too much sex and magic. I lost count of the new people introduced in this book so that Anita could have sex with them. and not just sex, but multiple partner, kinky sex with an audience. This book finally crossed the line where I can't stand it anymore and will be selling the entire series as soon as I go back to selling books.  Anita has collected a harem of who know how many men that only have sex with her, and do whatever she tells them to.   She has created a triumvirate of her, Nathaniel and Damien, but she doesn't take care of them and Damien is forever on the edge of dying because Anita doesn't have enough sex to keep him alive, even though she needs a waiting room and a take-a-number machine for the people she is having sex with.  The preview of the next book features Edward, who's been missing for a long time with a personality transplant. As I read the preview, I just could not see this new Edward. I'm not about to read a new book and see Edward as a different person. Stick a fork in her she's done.   This book should not be sold to minors. The review should come with a warning. I gave it one star, because they won't let you not give it any 
 Before you buy this book copy/paste the following phrase into a Google Search.   "Hank Hanegraaff" financial    After your Google Search, come back for the rest of my review.  Now, as you have seen, Hank has had real problems with financial accountability.  That disturbs me!  How can a person represent himself as "THE BIBLE ANSWER MAN" who claims to be standing for truth and righteousness and yet behind the scenes has had real problems with financial accountability in his ministry? Even Christianity Today has reported on this.  My advice? If you just cannot live without reading this book, buy a USED copy so the money goes to someone other than Hank. 
 In the ten minutes since I've had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off.  More importantly, It can't handle large manuals as advertised.  (The reason I purchased this particular book holder)  My 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter.  Based on that I estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages.  If you don't anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on, keep an eye on the page retainers (these are the parts that fell off) and you should be ok.  As for me, I'm off to read Amazon's return policy and see if I can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic 
 Needless to say, it wasn't. While Irving's literary style always has merit, he does a poor job at characterization- which is especially disappointing, considering the title of the book is "The World According To Garp." With a name like that, you'd expect the title character to be perceiving and insightful, but instead Garp is boring and egocentric, thinking of little but his own cheap desires. If that was the point, then I feel duped.  And while his mother is certainly more interesting- she's even more self-absorbed, and so it hardly makes up for anything. There's an almost sociopathic quality to his main characters, and while Irving probably didn't intend to portray them that way- it's still an enormous flaw I was unable to overlook 
 Mr. Morris did wonderful research on technical trading and clearly knows what the charts are about.  Morris goes on to clearly discuss that the difference between using technical analysis and using it well is understanding the philosophy of the market, the specific pattern and the interpretation of that, not simply by saying yes this is a buy signal because of the specific pattern but rather because of the physicology behind it and feeling that went with it.  He fails to execute what he claims he will do in his introduction.  I would save your money and not waste trying to struggle to unearth whatever little advice Morris gives 
 I wish I could give this stroller 0 stars because it doesn't even deserve the one I gave it. It's a light stroller..there...the only plus. Where do I start...how about how after using it for one week the wheel fell off and they wanted to charge me shipping to replace it because I didn't have a reciept ( it was shower gift) After arguing with their lack- luster service team and proving with a birth ceritficate that my daughter was only a week old and that is as long as I had been using it, they shipped a new wheel free of charge...Fast forward to our vacation in Hawaii. The sun shade is non existent and I had to use a light blanket draped over the hood to protect my baby from the sun. The steering stinks, I have spilled drinks all over me and my baby because the cup holder moves AND doesn't hold anything but a small water bottle. The basket is hard to get to and holds nothing easily because it is so awkward. My husband and I went on a hike and came to the end of the path that wasn't paved. He asked me, "Are you worried about leaving the stroller so we can continue on the sand?" I replied "PLEASE....I hope someone takes this piece of @8!!8#!!!" End of story...I wouldn't invest in the Pliko P3 either. Don't get me started in the Peg Perego car seat either...JUNK!! 
 The writer has such talent for making everything truly convincing, that I was very disappointed to realise, as I read, that this was really fiction. Too many inconsistencies and oddities. Kokopelli in Manitoba? boy, he's a long way from home! I've travelled in the South-West and known Navajo people, and Lakotas in South Dakota, and I've lived in Canada, though not Manitoba, and the points made by those who describe that western province are very convincing. No way do Andrews' descriptions ring true.   The clincher was where at the end Andrews is strictly enjoined not to tell anyone of her experiences: she asks "what should I do" and is told "Write a book!" I think Andrews is almost slapping the more gullible readers upside the head!   And it's sad, because on its own terms, it does in some ways convey a quite meaningful view of the world, and encourages us to be open to the deeper meanings and the spiritual connections and resonances of the natural world.  So I wish it were a real account, but as it isn't, I have to feel that such transformations of reality must do more harm than good. What happened to a medieval Christian when it was proved that the famous saint's relic everyone had revered was the bone of a dog's hind leg? Didn't it hurt the faith that had sustained him, and damage the good that was in that faith? Other reviewers have mentioned more accurate, reality-based reports of the shaman's world: I'll have to follow some of those up. 
 "Othello" is a play that will show you how unredeemable human beings can be.  It'll make you question everyone, along with his or her motives and beliefs.  It also shows you how men lusted after women in the late 16th century, but how women could not lust after men.  The double standard was put to the test, and, as always, women lose this battle.  Women may sell themselves as whores, and are ridiculed for it, but the men who use their services are overlooked.  This is a foul play and I think Shakespeare held women without regard. Othello was a despicable man who had little self-esteem I do not recommend 
 This is the first review I've written for anything.  I am inspired to write about the Krupps Burr grinder because it is the most frustrating piece of equipment I have ever owned.  You have to whack it on the counter three or four times per grind to get it to complete the job.  We got it as a wedding gift and have since gone back to our blade grinder that saves time and aggravation 
 This was another Pinker book I couldn't finish. If he was a taxi-driver he would take you from Brooklyn to New York via San Francisco. Sometimes even his asides have asides! Perhaps like pulp fiction writers he gets paid by the word 
 Professor Cohen makes the mistake of many social scientists; he determines his conclusion, then searches for examples which will support his case.  For every Lincoln in history, there is a Hitler, who wrests command of his armies from the professional military and leads them to utter annihilation.  Lyndon Johnson, with the barest of military credentials, attempting to decide tactical air targets in Vietnam from the White House, is another example of poor civilian leadership over riding men with actual combat expertise.  There are several more examples I could list.  A better method for this book would have been to examine all cases where civilian leaders forced their military commanders to deviate from one path and follow another, and to then draw conclusions.  Instead, Cohen, with his pre-conceived notions, attempts to "prove" his thesis by drawing on only a few of the best examples which support his point of view.  This is another case of an author pushing a political agenda by disguising it as scholarly research.  Cohen's examples and history are entertaining, but his methodology will only fool the ill-informed 
 The text is dreadful, but what can you expect from a book that  was written some 200 years ago!  There have been a lot of advances in Celtic archaeology since then.  But the illustrations which are old steel  engravings of the megalithic sites are absolutely worth the price 
 This book flows along nicely but never actually goes anywhere. The book simply ends with no action, and no questions answered. It left me very very annoyed 
 i was really looking foward to watching this one as i have seen the box and looked at the reviews here,so i was upset when i watched this sad movie. gary graham(t.v.'s alien nation) is a robot jox,which means he pilots a large voltron like machine which are used as fighting weapons in a future where war is no longer fought! the f/x are not very good and the story is paper thin,only the acting is good,but it can't save this one from being just a let down. skip it 
 She does sound like a goat bleating. Yodeling. It's a shame, really. 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 Even though a set looked exactly like on a picture bare in mind that the box is about the size of a paperback, and it weighs about the same. All the bottles are realy tiny, they look like a one time use products, the once you receive for free with your purchase, and the brush quality is not what I expected from this company. If you are looking for a present you will feel rather embarassed to give it 
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 I really liked the movie "the Hours", loosely based on this book, so I thought I'd read it... I couldn't get through it.  I love many classic books, but I'll not try another by Virginia Woolf 
 This is just a warning not to buy the censored version of this album. Make sure you get the proper version.  Tracks 4 and 8 of disc 3 have some horrible noise put on to mask the lyrics, which makes the songs unlistenable. It would have been better not to have put the tracks on the album than to release them in this format.  I would refuse to buy censored music on principle and it is a mystery to me why Prince, who spent years in a dispute with his record company over artistic freedom, should release censored music.   By the way, the music is wonderful and I recommend the album 100%. But make sure you don't buy censored music 
 When I read a review of this book, I was interested and checked it out of the library. It was a quick and easy read, and, unfortunately, also a disappointment.  In author Shellenbarger's favor, it must be said that the book is literate, well-organized and based on a reasonable methodology of data collection. It even has footnotes. It categorizes female midlife crisis into specific types, and gives defining examples of each.  However, _The Breaking Point_ is also quite superficial, despite a few offhand references to Jungian psychology. After awhile, the collected personal stories which are used as examples start to sound like a litany of airheaded people who made bad decisions (dropped out of college to get married, married emotionally remote men, tried to mold themselves according to other people's expectations) and eventually wound up paying the price. The book also has virtually no perspectives that are not rooted in the last 50 years of human experience, which makes it difficult to take seriously.  I am a 52-year-old woman, recently retired, and I find it impossible to identify with these people. I also find it absolutely astonishing that anyone should find the notion of continued personal growth a radical solution to any problem.  This book may possibly be of assistance to women who are like those the author interviewed. There is at least one piece of sensible advice herein: throwing yourself into a series of sexual or romantic affairs may be dangerous to your mental health and your marriage.  Sorry, Sue, nice concept, weak execution.   
 I found this a difficult book to read.The author uses long meandering sentences frequently enough to distract attention;and her thesis is unclear.The author also tends to make generalising statements,with no evidence to back the statements up.The book does not say anything new;I was disappointed overall 
 I have to read this text book for one of my 3rd year Computer Science course.  My professor picked the worst book there is for us to learn.  The exam is open book but I can't use any of the stuff that's written in this piece of sh*t.  Whever wrote this book should jump off the building and die.  It tried to include too many topic at once and fail to explain how to used each of them.  All it does is throw you examples of the stuff they wrote.  Firstly, their examples don't work. Secondly, that is not now most programmer will approach it.  It tries to teach connection with a database but did not provide any PreparedStatement or Statement and did not provide text on DriverManger.getConnection.  How the hell do we connect then??  Bottom line is this book sucks!!  EJB, Servlets, Jsp, JMS, JNDI, XML, JDBC, JavaMail my A**!! 
 I was very gung ho when I found out that Disney was finally releasing the Davy Crockett TV show on DVD.  I grew up watching the two Davy Crockett movies.  HOwever upon actually seeing these DVDs I was very disappointed.  It is exactly the same as those two movies it is just split into five seperate episodes.  The Episodes: Davy Crockett, Indian Fighter; Davy Crockett Goes to Congress; and Davy Crockett at the Alamo are all the parts included in the movie Davy Crockett King of the Wild Frontier.  The episodes Davy Crockett's Keelboat Race; Davy Crockett and the River Pirates; were what made up the movie Davy Crockett and the River Pirates.  I for one am planning on buying the newer version that came out in 2004 that is just the two movies on one disc.  The only difference between this set and the new set is that there are couple of features on this set and that there are introductions to the episodes buy Leonard Maltin and it has two discs in a tin collector's box.  The biggest difference of all is that this set runs from between $37-$100 whereas you can buy the two movies on DVD for $14-$16.  I myself will go for the cheaper movie set rather than have to watch each episode sperately.   
 I Never received this book.  It was mailed to my old address and then returned to Amazon.  
 This book was recommended to me by an accupuncturist who did a great job on my back.  I found it contradictory and ultimately confusing to the point of being useless.  Readers are encouraged to diagnose themselves as being damp or dry, warm or cold, with an interior or exterior issue, and with an excess or a deficiency.  (There may be more categories, that's all I can remember now.)  The main problem with the book is that if one is, say, both damp and cold (which Pitchford states is a common combination) then the dietary advice is contradictory.  One chapter says to eat raw vegetables, the next says no.  One says eat meat, the next says no.  One says fruit, the next says no.  One stresses brown rice, the next says very little brown rice.  In addition, being too far along one axis is the same as being the opposite condition.  If you just said "Huh??" then get used to it if you order this book.    Lastly, the big puzzle to me in reading all these 5 star reviews is that not one person (unless there is a review I missed) discusses how their health was improved, how they lost weight, anything!  Isn't that really the proof of a book on dietary recommendations?    Bottom line:  eat whole foods, not processed, organic if possible, and a variety of produce, whole grains, and small portions of lean meat.  I just saved you 700+ pages of reading and $30-something.  And you're welcome. 
 With the hotplate and microwave on the cover, you might think that this is a book of recipes that are prepared using those two items.  This is not the case.  Yes, there is a hotplate chapter and a microwave chapter, but a large number of recipes in the other 11 chapters require an oven. And even the microwave and hotplate recipes tend to require counter space, extensive preparation, and a large number and variety of ingredients.  If you really do live in a dorm where you will have very little room, and only a mini-fridge and microwave, I suggest either finding another book, or just making it up as you go.  Or if, like me, you live in a tiny studio with no counter space and only a fridge, microwave, and hotplate, it offers a few more options, but not much.  Most of the recipes require too much preparation.  And, if you are concerned about energy use and safety, many of the recipes also have fairly long cooking times.   Overall, I'd say this would be a good book aimed at the beginning cook.  Perhaps for someone who just moved into their first real apartment with a full kitchen.  This is not a good book for anyone with limited space and resources 
 I expected to find more practical information in the book. There wasn't much.. 
 Queen stands as one of the most important acts in rock and metal, not only deserving of praise an adoration, but also their music is, in its original form, should continue to remain unchanged. Believe me, I have heard my fair share of Queen covers, some great (Asterisk), some good (Morning) and some awful (Guns N' Roses), but never in my life have I heard such an aural atrocity as 'Killer Queen: A Tribute to Queen'. With the exception of the Flaming Lips lovely interpretation of 'Bohemian Rhapsody' there is nothing, I mean NOTHING, of any worth on this compilation. This collection of fantastic songs is obliterated due to the complete and utter lack of talent that Hollywood Records decided would look good on a tribute album. You can't replace Freddie Mercury, and I'm sure he is rolling over in his grave with so many horrid bands destroying the songs that he perfected. So congradulations Jason Mraz, Shinedown, Joss Stone, etc., you have not only discredited a classic band, you have also released what may be the worst album of the new millenium 
 It is sad to say, loving the first part, that Starship Troopers 2 isn't the movie the fans wanted to see. It is a bad acted, dark, nothing near the original sequel. The charm that the first part had is totally gone.  The story takes place on one of the bug's planet, where a group of troopers of the federation get stuck on an abondon outpost, where nasty things happen. The entire movie is very dark. It starts out cool I must say, but that is all because in the first minute of the movie, the "would you like to know more?" part is shown, with footage of the first movie. But very soon after that, when the movie continues with a battle against the bugs, it goes downhill very fast. From those first few minutes into that battlesequence you can feel that there is totally no emotion in the acting. The fights could have been way cooler using certain cameramoves and giving the idea that they are having a hard fight: this is just a lot of screaming at each other in a bad acting way while you see a lot computer made bugs running around in some shots. Also, the film has a kind of video look that gives away that it went straight to video. That is sad, screenquality can do a lot for a film you know. A mist oppertunity.  Also, like I said, the movie is very dark. Not just dark as in story, but dark as in lighting. Of course it gives a moody and dangerous atmosphere, but a light here and there could have been just fine. Now it just feels like a wanne-be "Aliens" where the darkness actually worked, but here it just doesn't feel right at all.  So you may wonder: is there anything good about Starship Troopers 2? Yes, there actually is: The music is okay. It is music that saves some scenes here and there with nice heroic tunes and melodies. If that music wouldn't have been there, it would have been even more terrible than it already is. So good job on that part. Also some sets are well made and look professional, but sometimes it feels a bit like it has been filmed in a local gymhall.   To the fans of the original I must say this: You can watch this, but don't buy it, rent it some place. It is very dissapointing.  It has, like I said before, a kind of videolook, also none of the original characters return in this one. No cool Casper van Dien, no sexy Denise Richards: they are not in this movie in any way. The only actress that does return is Brenda Strong. The weird thing is that her character died in the first one, but she's back as a new character. But she doesn't save the movie in any way unfortunatly.  So all in all: The movie misses the direction of Paul Verhoeven, a bigger budget, good acting and the original characters from the original one.  Too bad, so sad, it really could have been something more than this.   Let's all hope that Starship Troopers 3, which is coming in some time will be a big step back in the direction of the fantastic original.  
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 This movie is one of those "just for entertainment" category films. The plot is simple and the story is sort of interesting. Well, it was interesting to me. I'm sure that lots of folks will think it's goofy. Watch it if you have nothing better to do. 
 I'm not impressed.  Don't get me wrong, there are some cute ideas in the book but no detailed instructions.  Their idea of instructions are:  1 - Draw outline.  2 - Create Whiskers.  3 - Fill in.  I would have liked it to say 1 - Begin drawing the outline by starting 3 inches above the cheekbone and make a curved line....and so on.  Since I'm not a creative person by nature I really wanted more instructions.  This is simply a book of ideas and heck, you can get that without the book!  I'm disappointed. 
 To say it is poorly written would be too much of a compliment. You don't have to get even halfway through before you can figure out exactly what happened here. Some publishing house obviously offered him a large advance to write a book, and he threw together whatever he could think of off the top of his head, very little of which is probably true, threw in some "woe is me" for cohesion, and tossed it onto the editor's desk. Whether or not anyone even tried to edit this thing, I don't know, but if they did, they should be fired. This is slop, worse than those celebrities who try to "write" books. To think of all the talented people out there who receive small advances and modest printings, while this thing has done better than it ever should have can make you sick to your stomach 
 Dreyfus' understanding of distance learning is quite limited. On page 39 of this book he defines distance learning as "the correspondence-course model of anonymous information consumers." Distance learning has a lot more going for it than that, I have found that there is a lot of interactivity in online courses and a high level of communication with the professors. I took one of Dreyfus' classes at Berkeley as an undergraduate and I never got to talk to him, there was no face to face learning. If you feel that the lecture method is the only way to learn, then the internet is not for you. If you want to feel like a "disembodied presence" go take a class at Berkeley as an undergrad 
 I started reading this book with the expectation that I would learn about women in a culture totally different than mine. Instead, I read the story of a lusty, rich, worldly woman with no sense of morality. Then it gets  incredibly dry as the author launches into a historical story from the  middle ages. Very boring, and I heartily do NOT recommend this book 
 This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed. 
 I seem to have only gotten the cliff notes on my dvd and not the story.  Innocent Eugenie is take to an island by a rich couple who do business with her father.  He knows they are interested in exploiting her for sexual purposes but they promise nothing too strong.  Well, they constantly drug Eugenie through her drinks and the wife starts the "journey into perversion" by having them bath and wash together.  There are a few steps but very few indeed and soon Eugenie is happily involved in Satanic rituals and removing body parts from participants.  What kind of story is this?  Eugenie doesn't take much to be corrupted.  We don't see much conflict or the psychology of any transformation.   It all just happens.  I don't see any convincing story of a seduction into this huge personality change at all.  I really don't know what people see in this film and how it gets such great reviews.  I guess when the "erotic" scenes are red and blurred, this causes people to feel it is sophisticated camera work and film style and are impressed by it.  Instead of being a journey into perversion, innocent Eugenie jumps right into Satanic rituals with no explanation.  I don't see anything compelling about this at all 
 Our hero,amoral in his love life, refusing to kick his unfaithful ex-wife to the curb, and making mystery solving boring, why continue? Parker can write like no one else, but his recent plots suggest the well may be dry 
 I read this book a while back and decided that I finally had the time to write about it now. This was one of the slowest moving books i have ever read. T he plot was decent but te author spent a good 10 pages elaborating on every detail of Bobby's life and his rise to fame. After a while it just became unbearable and I had to stop. If you have a hig patience novel and like reading roundabout novels then this one is made jst for you 
 For anyone who is truly interested in lycanthropy or shapeshifting, this book is not for you.  It covers movies, serial killers, the Yeti, and bunch of crap that is mostly irrelevent to the subject.  The very few facts in this book were things I figured out before I graduated high school.  That should give you an indication of how well-thought out Steiger's book is.  The goal of the book was a good one, however, it was a feeble attempt.  Just spend a day at the library and look through real encyclopedias on the subject, and you will likely find at least twice the information that is available in this piece of trash 
 For those of you looking for more Eva action after seeing the original series take heed. DON'T BUY THIS DVD! The Death part of the DVD, part 1, is nothing but a terrible rehashing of scenes from the regular season, and the second half, Rebirth, part 2, is new stuff, very good, BUT! If you buy 'The End of Evangelion' you get Rebirth AND a much better and easier to understand ending to the whole series in completely new material. So, don't buy 'Death&Rebirth'. Buy 'The End of Evangelion' instead 
 After reading Angela's Ashes and Tis by Frank McCourt, I was looking forward to reading more about the McCourt family's lives from the perspective of another member of the family but Malachy McCourt definitely does not have the talent of his brother, Frank. He focuses too much on himself and I could sense his ego becoming more and more inflated as the story progressed.  I'm sure he is charming and witty but an entire book by the author telling us just how charming and witty he is does get to be tiresome.  And the fact that he is so proud to be such a total scoundrel is not admirable.  I also read Malachy's book, A Monk Swimming: A Memoir, and in both books I was hoping to read more about the entire family instead 95% about Malachy himself and how pleased he is of his escapades.      The book became tiresome to read and I had to force myself to finish it 
 Were I a teenager, I would most certainly have pitched a fit upon encountering the condescension and fatalism portrayed by this author.  His verbal irony is ironic only in the fact that he is completely serious (though this is hard to tell for some time into the book because its verisimilitude to satire is so great). The teenagers he invents may or may not be crude fascimiles of his own children, but  his personal vendetta against the teenage demographic is wholy undeserved and rather slimy (to use his own poor impression of teenage terminology).   Were I a parent who followed this man's treacherous advice, I would find myself deservedly dangling from a ceiling fan after a so-called peaceful night of sleep - with my poor, maligned child standing at the switch.   Were I a teenager, I would also be inclined to pen a scathing review in protest of this...man's insidious infamy.   As well, I would feel the necessity to speculate about his mental health/age/existance/connection to various government agencies that are in fact out to end the human species as we know it by eradicating through spontaneous combustion the demographic that is at its healthiest 
 im moving over from vb to c#, so naturally I would like to see examples written in c# so I can get the semantics down.  This book does not do that.  Half in c#, half in vb, fully useless.  Next time release 2 versions of the book.  Or better yet, write some of it in vb, some in c#, some in python, some in perl... 
 by the yummy colors used to draw the cover or by the title or the gist written on the cover...this is definitely not for chick lit addicts, more like for kids who dont know what they want yet and are more forgiving with grave mistakes, namely, this book... it was more disappointing for me cos i've been in search for this book for a very long time and when i finally read it, it was such a letdown! i cant even begin to explain why...it's so misleading cos it's trying to sell itself as a sort of light read about 2 sisters and possibly their life trying to deal with rivalry and their apparent differences but nooooo...a little halfway through a crime was committed (huh!?!) and a stupid wild goosechase to solve the mystery ensues..oh please..stop me now..ok let me explain how bad it is...i dont have very high standards in books, i mean im up for anything as long as it makes sense or at least the author KNOWS what she wants to write about and this book cant even begin to deliver to that!...i signed up with amazon just so i can write a review to send the message to everyone that this book is BLAH. it is that bad 
 I bought this book out of curiosity about the "movers and shakers" of the real estate industry. I know there have been obscene amounts of money made there, and I was interested in getting an insider's look, as I know Tom Wolfe spent a significant amount of time with some real estate industry magnates. However, as a novel, the book doesn't really work - it's hard to sustain any interest in or sympathy for the main characters as they fall further and further into untenable situations caused by their own greed and lack of self-awareness. Frankly, I couldn't even finish it 
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 Racist commentary presented in backhanded journo-speak that is unfortunately typical of english language books on Iran.  Example of tactics employed - if you want to say something particularly offensive/outrageous/demeaning, deflect blame by attributing the comment to a "source" or a "reader".  Hopefully actual readers with the gumption to travel to the Middle East are intelligent enough to sift through Yale's antipathetic commentary and put the book to its best use - a compact set of maps, place names and telephone numbers 
 The book is very Mac-centric. While a few charts include windows key commands all screen shots are Mac screens and look VERY diferent from Finale98 for Windows. Only in guitar chord creation does this book venture  past the online and in-the-box documentation of the program itself 
 I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what "Insomnia" is. This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.  The other King books I've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  "Insomnia's" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn't come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph's numerous confidantes.  Then there's the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.    I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal. The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, 'How is King going to get through this?' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.  One last thing, the villians just don't work. They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. Then there's the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  I rest my case.               
 I expected more from a book titled "Professional Microphone Techiques". This book would be usefull for someone just starting to record music, but if you have even a modest level of experience with mics and mic techniques don't look here for any insights. Topics include basic mic types, 3:1 rule, prox effect, freq. response, an almost too expansive list of suggested mic positions of various insturments, eq suggestions, basic compression uses. CD included with the book is a nice touch 
 I bought this toy for my 6-month old son to grow into over the next year because it seemed to offer a variety of ways to learn and play. When putting it together Christmas morning the pieces did not snap together securely and kept falling off. Also, one light does not work. The poor construction of this toy is disappointing coming from Fischer-Price. I will be returning (not exchanging) this toy. Luckily my son is young enough that he will not miss it 
 This movie does not even lead up to the game. The plot isn't good at all. Terrible acting performances by most of the actors/actresses. I was surprise to know that Kylie Mingoue was Cammy. The fight scenes were fake. My favorites in the game were Ken and Ryu, and they made them unreal. And for the rest of the other fighters, their background stories are also fake and very hard to believe. Basically, the whole movie from start to end was very boring. In my own opinion...they SHOULD MAKE A REMAKE OF STREET FIGHTER!!!! SAVE UR MONEY!! 
 This book wasn't what I expected. It is small (4x6 maybe) and doesn't contain anything I didn't already know. A better book is "Great Braids" by Thomas Hardy, also available on Amazon 
 This book is not only inaccurate but it contains virtually some of the same text originally published in "Alfa Romeo Spiders" by David Owen in 1982. The similarity of certain passages is just too similar to be coincidence 
 I'm a long time fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and have read all the others. Unfortunately, "Hard Truth" does not live up to the quality of Ms. Barr's earlier works. It feels very contrived. It also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups. This book just does not meet the expectations I've come to expect from the series. 
 I cant find any place in the book where the author teaches you how to think. If the book were about, say...sex...Maxwell never gets around to teaching any practical techniques for better sex. The book is all about attitude and setting....which might make sex or thinking or whatever more enjoyable, but still fails to deliver the goods about how to do "it." The book is an infomercial about thinking. Like the one's that promise to teach you how to make a fortune playing the stock market but never quite get to the part where you learn how to do "it." The infomercial is all anecdotes and quotes, like this book. And that's okay because Maxwell uses good material.   Much of what Maxwell asserts I agree with. Amen! Candy and dinner and flowers and liquor are terrific for the right mood. Plus proximity...you need to be there! But no where does Maxwell instruct you how to score. How to get from the right friends and the right place and the right time etc, etc., etc. to "Eureka!"  But in fairness to Maxwell, I dont believe you can teach anyone to think any more than you can command a feeling or mood or orgasm to materialize. I dont believe thinking and emotions etc. are THAT auto-manipulative. I mean, some very creative people swear by drugs and booze 
 They look nice, but they're badly put together; I had to re-sew all of the fingers within the first month 
 I am a professional pet stylist, and when I saw this book advertised in one of the Groomer magazines, I immediately went to Amazon to purchase it.  I was excited to see that someone had actually written a book addressing the issues of grooming "mixed" breeds, a.k.a. Mutts.  Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed.  This book provides no real information.  The author uses drawings of dogs she has groomed in the past.  These drawings are only a 'side' view, and no drawing of the all important head is included.  I am giving this book 2 stars instead of 1 only because the author, at least, attempted to write a book about mutts.  The author simply suggests that you, as a groomer, determine what pure breeds the mutt resembles, and then groom accordingly.  I can tell you that in my shop, I see many mutts that are impossible to determine their lineage.  I was hoping this book detailed the different requirements of grooming a mutt, such as providing details of creating a "Teddy Bear" head on a Shih Tzu, or how to set up a "mane" when doing a strip on an Alaskan Husky.  The book is short on details, and actually gave me NO new information or tips that are not readily available in any one of dozens of pure bred grooming books.  I cannot recommend this book to professional groomers as there is no detail and the drawings are sadly lacking.  I certainly would not recommend this book to the grooming "do-it-yourselfer" as there is no information concerning the basics of grooming such as proper bathing and brushing, etc.  Don't experience the buyers remorse I am experiencing.  I absolutely do NOT RECOMMEND buying this book 
 The time starts ticking when the item is purchased, not when it ships!  The GPS that I bought will not ship for another couple of months, and I agreed to purchase it a month ago.  So with the one year manufacturer's warranty (or whatever), and the three months (or more?)one is actually being delivered less than expected 
 The litmus test for any book on selling is, will it help me make my numbers?  Any book that doesn't do that doesn't deserve to be on the shelf in my book.  Boy, was I sucked in by this one.  I read this book based upon the glowing reviews it received.  All I can say it that they must be friends of the author or paid reviews because this book is one of the least effective books on selling I've ever read.  If you want to base your career on things like "Create good guilt"  (wow, nothing like a little manipulation, huh?), or "Create Differentiation" (now, there's a brand new concept) (both of these are from page 87 which I pulled at random).  Save your money.  If you want to CLOSE BUSINESS then get Strategic Selling or Conceptual Selling, both classics that will help you make your numbers.  Good selling,  Bo 
 It's difficult to fathom that anyone would make such a bad movie.  I agree that the young lead actor is very cute, but that's the only redeeming quality this movie has.  The storyline had potential, but it failed miserably because of poor acting and dialogue.  My friends and I just shook our heads in dismay when we watched this 
 ...unless it is rock and roll played by ac/dc. i f***ing HATE them. they are overplayed so much on the radio, and that is the most annoying voice i have ever heard in my life. don't waste your money on this cd, just turn on the radio...then turn it off 
 After reading this book, I would like to make three points about it:  1.) First of all, DON'T MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST DEAN KOONTZ BOOK.  This is the second book of the so-called Christopher Snow trilogy.  Read the first book in the trilogy first -- FEAR NOTHING.  The first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.  2.) Second, please be aware that Koontz has yet to write the third book in the Christopher Snow trilogy.  This is a real shame, because SEIZE THE NIGHT ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title RIDE THE STORM.  But since it's been over eight years since Koontz has written a Snow novel, I wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.    3.) Third, I must admit I didn't really care for this book at all, and I say that as a Koontz fan.  Lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  Koontz wastes a LOT of space repeating things he originally wrote in FEAR NOTHING.   I found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.  The plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  All the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  I was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  It was just too silly for my tastes.  Koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  Instead of this book, I would therefore recommend WATCHERS, INTENSITY, ODD THOMAS or VELOCITY.  
 I bought 3 books on this subject this week, and this is the one I wish I hadn't bought. I am so disappointed in this book. I was expecting a true workbook, and there is no real plan in this book. There is a lot of interesting information, some of which is useful, but if I hadn't also bought The Seven Secrets of Slim People, I wouldn't have gotten a plan to actually do the work I need to do to be able to find out when I'm hungry and when I need to stop eating 
 then a lot of people died fighting in the wrong cause for this country.  No one went to war for this country to defend a socialist nation; they fought to keep it from becoming a socialist nation.  Most of what the far left stands for is the exact opposite of what this country has fought, bled, and died for 
 A very outdated book. Not very good even when it was relevant. There's just no substance and the ideas that are touched on are not followed through.  Just enough material to be really dangerous for a novice. Please don't even read the chapter on trading thinly-traded, non-liquid issues. Don't even go there and get that idea out of your head permanently. "The art of going broke."  I really, really doubt that this guy is still trading, or if he is, that his lifetime trades show a net profit. I'd make a substantial bet against that.  If you are a newbie, get Toni Turner's daytrading book instead.  [... 
 I don't suppose you can expect anything else from a book by an art critic, but the prose in "Italian Painters" was at times childish and sneering and at others the most insufferable fustian.  Here's an example of BB getting off before one of Raphael's paintings: "In presence of young Sanzio's picture you feel a poignant thrill of transfiguring sensation, as if, on a morning early, the air cool and dustless, you suddenly found yourself in presence of a fairer world, where lovely people were taking part in a gracious ceremony, while beyond them stretched harmonious distances line on line to the horizon's edge."  The scary thing is I simply had to open the book at random to find such a quote.  This alone makes it not worth reading, but the most frustratingly awful part is that the book is NOT AT ALL INFORMATIVE.  It is simply too short to give adequate treatment to the painters involved.  Leonardo and Michelangelo get about 3 pages each, less than half of which devoted to their actual works, while lesser artists like Fra Bartolomeo and Domenico Venziano get about a paragraph.  He also frequently interrupts his sometimes singing praise, sometimes shrill disdain to hastily expound fragments of an at times crack-philosophy.  His reasoning for why "Space-Composition" inspires the highest religious sentiments is truly laughable.  But even still: instead of getting a feel and grasp for each painter we are more familiarized with BB's unarticulated judgements.  We know that Luca Signorelli's colors are "sometimes not what they should be" but we are provided no example even in the paltry appendix.  It is clear that BB feels and looks very deeply into his paintings, but this is about the only clarification this book provides 
 The physics in this book belong in biblical times, all of it's claims are unsupported by any reliable data. Booklist shows that they are as Ignorant of science as they are of good writing 
 Expecting a moderate to good book, I was stunned by the low level of the literature. this may have been better not written, except for three serious and good tales and one funny ang good tale. Beginning with traditional poetry in "The Word And The Silence" is not what i like. i usually dislike these poems, but this one was appaling. It made no sense and you couldnt understand one bit of it, even whtever it was trying to tell you. The continuation "Mark Of The Flame, Mark Of The Word", was slightly better, but still bad with no point. "The Bargain Driver", was OK but rather boring and, yet again, had no real connection to the cataclysm and no point. "Seekers" was very good but ruined by its pessmistic atitdude. Though the boy believed in Paladine at the end, the man didn't, and we never found out what happened to his quest. "No Gods, No Heroes", was just a funny tale that wasn't even well written. The only good point was Tarli from "Kender Stew" showing up. "Into Shadow Into Light", was almost the best, carrying in it a very deep moral. "Ogre Unaware" was funny but, again, boring. "The Cobblers Son" was very good and funny, one of the only good stories. "The Voyage Of The Sunchaser", was boring and not even funny, only very dull. "The High Priest Of Halycon", was very good, if a trifle dull. Last and best "True Knight" continues "The Silken Threads" from "The Reign Of Istar" in a beautiful manner, with many hidden messages which they did not understand but we did. The ending is beautiful and fitting 
 I thought "Silver Pigs" was wonderful. By this one, Falco is tiresome, trite and boring. The humourous cynicism present in the earlier novels seems to be both studied and begrudging in the later ones. And the family is NOT that cute. Still, there are a few flashes of humour. If Falco would ditch the extended family, Davis would tighten up the writing and not be quite so coy, this series could be salvaged. Davis should take a few lessons from John Maddox Roberts and Decius 
 I own this set, as does my roomate, and we both hate it. It highlights bands like 'red lorry, yellow lorry' that no one likes or listens to, and  uses great classic bands like Bauhaus' worst song as the first track. It is  the hollow, tin-y, embarrassingly hokey side of goth, and i am ashamed to  even have it in my house 
 One of the blurbs I read on the book jacket compared this book to Into Thin Air and The Perfect Storm. No way!. Those two books were edge-of-your-seat reading experiences. This account of a kayaking expedition is just plain boring. The action doesn't start until about halfway or more into the book and even then, the cliched writing and deification of Balf's subjects make this book very hard to get through. Unless you are a serious kayaking fan, I would not recommend this book 
 These books all seem to be the same -- give a few basic ideas, then repeat them for 200 or 300 pages. By the time I got to the end of this, I was half expecting him to finish with a pitch for one of his seminars. I am interested in the renting aspects, and there were a few helpful nuggets in here, but I suspect it could have all been boiled down to a much shorter book 
 I found Christopher Lee's 1603 to be a somewhat of an interesting if not misguided effort to present what life and events were like back in 1603. There's a lot of information in this book which proves to be interesting but they are poorly organized and presented. The author appears to throw them in without much explanations as if he wishes to showed off his primary sources.   As the previous reviewer mentioned, there were also many childish errors in this book. Errors that a book published in 2003 should not be making because of new information that came out during the past 40 years. But what strike me the most was Chapter 17 when the author - who for some strange reason, switched over to Japanese history of 1603 and started to write about the struggles there. I don't see the relationship but what I read were host of errors and misunderstanding of Japanese history that was almost insulting to read. (For example: "Shogun Hideyoshi"?? What Japanese child of 10 would make such an error? That is like some one writing "President Elizabeth I"!!) Its pretty clear that neither the author or the editor of this book knows little about Japanese history. But that chapter alone proves to be the reflection of the book itself, sloppy, ill-written and poorly researched.  I would recommended the book After Elizabeth by Leanda de Lisle which covers the same period and does it with a more professional flair 
 If I could give this book zero stars, I would do so. There's barely a plot: the protagonist, Janie, marries three men and kills the last one because he gets rabies. The end. Janie is the ultimate antiheroin. She comes off as this oppressed little wife who takes forever to speak out against her husbands. It would have been better if Alice Walker had not "found" Zora Hurston and brought this awful book back into the public. 
 This book contains very little information on benchmarking and even less on best practice. I have also read "developing performance indicators for managing maintenance" by the same author - equally poor. In summary, if you want a VERY broad overview and currently have NO experience then this book may represent some value - otherwise look elsewhere 
 Skip this one.  It's horrible.  I bought it just before a long flight and didn't have anything else to read.  "I chose poorly."  What kind of author involves his political views and disdain for Christianity in a book called Big Weather?  Well, Mark Svenvold does.  For your money, you get a big dose of Svenvold's personal philosophies packaged with a backdrop of high brow cultural references.  Who is this guy?  And, why should we listen to his rambling pontifications?  I thought I was buying a book about Big Weather!!  Svenvold is also extremely insulting.  He describes one fellow he met as having a receding hairline comparing it to a glacier retreating.  Come now!  Was that necessary?  Oklahomans in particular get an extra helping of insults.  Svenvold lets loose with unflattering comments about a number of individuals.  Most of them were just answering his questions about weather.  Here is a small dose.  Svenvold describes a college student storm chaser: "She had an oval face, a smallish mouth, and large, wide cheekbones that made her look as if she were peering shyly and a little fiercely out from behind a tribal mask, if such a mask wore mascara."  It gets worse.  That is just one I turned to quickly.  Save your money.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.  I have no idea how it managed the ratings is has received.  Still tempted?  Pick it up in a bookstore and read pages 232-237 (soft cover).  If that strikes you as an exciting read about "big weather" then go for it.  This book is for you 
 I must admit to being an obsessed Delerium fan.  When the first Conjure One album was released, I was reasonable pleased with the direction I felt the artist was headed. Bought the second and was totally disappointed - nothing "magic" in this one!  Didn't even live up to being just another Delerium theme work, fell far short of that AND offered nothing in the line of growth 
 Please, your reviews are going to be read by adults who want to buy gifts for their little girls, nieces, and granddaughters. Anyways, this doll is nuts! I already reviewed her, but I had to again when I realized how trashy that one girl was talking! No curse words, puh-lease!  Parents, please DO NOT buy this awful doll. 
 The Quiet Earth is overrated for a variety of reasons that will be discussed below. This movie is not the epic, thought-provoking, intelligent sci fi I was led to believe it was. It's actually very overrated, and fans of intelligent sci fi such as 2001 or Primer will likely be very disappointed. The first 30 minutes or so are jaw-dropping. I was really getting geared up for what I was sure was going to become one of my all-time favorites. The scenes of Bruno standing above the wrecked passenger jet, driving around a mall, the sun rising to the haunting score--all unforgettable. The scenes where Bruno starts to lose it, running around in a slip brandishing a shotgun, setting up cardboard figures of celebrities and pretending he's their ruler, giving them speeches (That's why I deserve to be President...of the quiet earth...I've been condemned to live) are all great. After this point the movie starts to disintegrate, and quickly. The female character is highly irritating, so much so that I think I would have ditched her and looked for other survivors. Api is also highly irritating, and when the film veers away from its central mystery and starts devolving into yet another film about a petty love triangle--my thumbs were pointing down, way down.   Something needs to be said about the ending of this film. So many people have said that it's "deep." How is it "deep?" How is it deep when it's just a gimmicky way to quickly wrap a rather dodgy film that really doesn't have anything to say? Let's examine this. Many people argue the following (and if they were correct the film would've been much better than it was): The main character is a scientist who convinces himself that Project Flashlight resulted in "the effect" (even though others here insist on calling it "the event") which made everyone else disappear. The main characters come to believe that "the effect" didn't snatch them up too because they were died right when it happened. But what if there isn't any "effect" at all? What if these are just three people who died and then went to another earth where there aren't any people? The scientist then convinces himself that "the effect" is going to happen again, and, understandably fed up with the fact that the only other two people on earth are a bonkers, daffy, annoying woman and a nutty, homicidal maniac, decides to basically kill himself while blowing up the satellite for Project Flashlight. He dies again and ends up on another world, one which this time doesn't even resemble earth. The end. It would have been very clever if this was what was going on, if there really wasn't an "effect" at all and if the three protagonists had just happened to go to the same place when they died. Unfortunately, all the critics saying "they went to another earth where everyone else was gone" are forgetting something: the dead bodies! I know there aren't a lot, but remember, there's the radiation burn guy in the science station, and there's the dead guy on the hood of his car, and the dead woman holding a CB radio, etc. If they went to another earth where life was absent, why are there dead people? The real answer is that this movie was not very well thought out, that it doesn't make sense, and that the ending is just a cheap and easy way to try and appear impressive. According to the people who worked on the film, "the effect" obviously did occur, and what happens at the end is that when the scientist tries to kill himself a second time he dies, again, at the exact moment that "the effect" occurs a second time. So at the end, "the effect" does occur a second time, which means the girl and Api are history, and the scientist, as he again dies when "the effect" occurs, moves on one more time. Another point that is made in the DVD commentary is that the film was made by a Catholic, so the obvious purgatory then heaven tripe comes to mind.    Also highly irritating is that for a scientist, the main character is not very smart. He laments that he's the last person on earth and then he runs into a nutty woman. They find a nutty guy named Api and then the three of them conclude they're the last three people on earth! What?! Are they totally daft? A scientist would quickly reason that if there were three people within such a small region of the same city then there are probably other people in the city, more people than that throughout the rest of New Zealand, and even more people in bigger places such as America, Europe, and Asia. That his first conclusion is always that "they're the only ones" only demonstrates his stupidity. They come to believe that they all died at the same time, right when "the effect" occurred, and that that's why they remained on earth. Well, if three people died at the exact same time in the same city in tiny New Zealand, then many, many other people must've died at that time throughout the rest of the massive world. 
 I ordered this book on 6/30/2006, and here we are 1 month later, and still nothing.  I have been notified twice to "update my order".  which basically meant to approve yet another delay for my package.  I love Taschen books, I would love it even more if i could get the darn thing.  
 As the title says, but one corner of the product was broken during shipping or ??? We did not want to wast time and postage returning it, so we patched it up the best we could with tape. Otherwise, a great toy and lots of fun - my son is in 3rd grade and every kid now wants one for themselves 
 J. L. Carr's A Month In The Country (1980), which is set in the 1920s, is the story of Tom Birkin, a budding restorer who accepts a job uncovering a church mural in a small Yorkshire village, a village predictably populated by greenhorns, cranks, and eccentrics of all stripes and colors. What is immediately apparent is that the novel is not a product of the earlier era in which it is set, nor is it an attempt to recreate the style of the period.   Though Carr attempts high British humor in the grand 20th century tradition of P. G. Wodehouse, Evelyn Waugh, Ivy Compton-Burnett, Stevie Smith, Denton Welch, and Muriel Spark, much of what is supposed to be funny throughout the novel is in fact only obvious, smug, and not nearly as intelligent or crisp as Carr apparently believes it to be. Thus, when Birkin's employer warns him about a scythe that hangs in the outdoor privy, Birkin speculates whether "it was the loss of life or only manhood he was concerned about," and most of the attempted humor continues at about this level.   A Month In The Country might have been saved by a compelling plot or theme, or simply a collection of perceptive insights uniquely expressed, but none of these elements are present, and so what little story there is merely plods cutely along. Whether is it is Carr himself, or merely Tom Birkin, who is so self-satisfied is difficult to say; either way, the combination of the anemic first person narrative and the idiosyncratic attempts at humor, in which the author indulges himself at every turn, sink the book quickly.  
 I love Delerium... but I can't stand the new Delerium. The older stuff is so much better. This CD is lame and boring. Go with Semantic Spaces or Spheres instead 
 I purchased my version of El Hazard from a zShop for 19 bucks and I am SO glad that I did. That said, the first series is worth watching for two main reasons: overt lesbianism and Jinnai. The former is self-explanatory while the latter (Jinnai) is without a doubt the best character in the series (despite the fact that he is the antagonist). You can't say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed, but throughout the first series Jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed-out character, as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature. This superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story's main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging. And this is what makes the second series (all four dismal episodes) so tragic: they nerfed Jinnai. He could never have been called a genius in the first series, but he was decidedly intelligent, cool, pragmatic, supremely self-confident and an effective leader (even though he was also manic and delusional). In El Hazard II, as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain, they have turned Jinnai into a slapstick-idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon. I suggest purchasing El Hazard through...alternate means,... watching the first series and discarding the second. Let's face it: even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty 
 Despite trying very hard to deny that this is just another fad management book - there is nothing new in this title.  Clueless managers will recite the core principals of this book and treat them as gospel as they try to improve their bottom line.  It is also worth noting that at least one of the "great" organizations in the book, Fannie May, has imploded in an accounting scandal.  Not the worst fad management book ever written, but that isn't saying much 
 I was very disappointed in this translation. Bringing the language into  modern form distorted the meanings and lost the beauty and simplicity of  the original. I recommend Gitanjali if you want to experience real Tagore 
 I got my hands on this 'pocket-'book by chance about 14 years ago and what a disappointment it was then! There is no Sanskrit, yoga is translated as !discipline!.. Did Ms. Miller have a clue about what she was doing other than make some money? Now that I have read translations by Sri Yogananda and Prabhupada, I have the ability to comment on it further. The Bhagavad Gita is not a simple set of words to be translated, this is a philosophy of life in sutra form-absolutely condensed so it could be passed down by guru to disciple by word of mouth. The guru transfers the knowledge not only by recitation but by showing actual practise.  So, Ms. Miller has no qualification to translate other than knowledge of a language which can be picked up by a 10 year old. Even a 10 year old would do a better job at translating 'yoga' 
 All of these books on so-called Bible codes that all just happen to "predict" events after they happen, or just "happen" to find words that support the fallacies of the bumper crop of megaselling would-be Bible interpreters, are laughable.  There is a code in the prophecies of the Bible, and the prophecies do have an ultimate aim and an ulitimate conclusion, but the code has nothing to do with nuclear bombs or international conspiracies.  The real code in the prophets is about the One truth, the Two decisions, the Three in balance, the Four traits, the Five disciplines, and the Seven plus One Spirits, and ever part of the code relates back to the teachings of Jesus Christ.  To read a book about the real Bible Code, try my book, "The Character Map: An Introduction to the Introductions in Revelation." This is the one about living and preserving your life.  Ik 
 I was going to write a review of this book but the review by "MJS Book Addict" ("Pop history with a few bizarre detours")said it all extremely well. Don't waste your time with this volume. Read Will Durant for a much more satisfying and less "preachy" and quirky discourse. I was going to pass this volume on to our library but threw it away instead 
 This book attempts to do the impossible by guiding non-technical people  through the process of building an NT intranet.  It starts with "what  is a network" and transitions quickly to installing IP and installing  IIS.  The book lacks any technical depth and I found it mostly useless.   Windows NT Server 4 Unleashed worked better for me 
 THIS WAS GIVEN TO MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER BY HER SISTER FOR CHRISTMAS. THE MICROPHONE BROKE PUTTING IT TOGETHER. I COULDN'T FIND RECIEPT SO CUSTOMER SERVICE MADE ME PAY 5.00 TO SEND A NEW ONE WHICH TOOK ABOUT 8 WEEKS!! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NOT THROUGH LITTLE TIKES WHICH EXPLAINS THE POOR SERVICE WE GOT, NOT TO MENTION THAT THE CUSTOMER SERV. REP.  ACCUSSED ME OF HAVING IT FOR MONTHS AND JUST WANTING TO GET A NEW MICROPHONE. THE STAND IS USELESS IF YOU MOVE IT THE BOTTOM COMES APART OVER AND OVER AND OVER!!!HOWEVER, MY LITTLE GIRL DOES LOVE THE KEYBOARD WITH ALL THE DIFFERRENT MELODIES AND THE FLASHING LIGHTS ETC..  SHE LOVES SINGING AND I LIKE THAT IT MAKES HER HAPPY UNTIL THE BASE COMES APART AT THE BOTTOM. IT HAS A CARRY HANDLE (TO BE USED WITH OUT BASE)  BUT IT IS A BIT BULKY FOR LITTLE HANDS TO CARRY AROUND. I SAY THE COMPANY NEEDS TO IMPROVE THE STAND/BASE ON THIS PRODUCT. 
 While I think some of the recipes are good wholesome recipes. I am a little alarmed to see salt as an ingredient in many of the recipes. Also bouillon cubes are used frequently, and those have a lot of salt. Some of the recipes use premade dough as well. If you do that, you don't know what kinds of preservatives or other ingredients are in them that may not bee good for our 4 legged friends. 
 they said it would ship in 48 hours and when i ordered it, a couple of days later they said it was on backorder.  when i asked them what day they would get them in, they said they didnt know. so i cancelled my order, and it took at least 2 weeks for me to get my money back in my account and i had to call amazon to get it all straightened ou 
 The premise of this book is to reveal the 8 secrets of how ordinary people became successful investors.  Yet there really are no secrets revealed.  The whole book is basically one big, thinly disguised advertisement for the author's financial advisory services.  One of the secrets in the book is to devote less than three hours per month to personal finances, and that includes paying bills.  I fail to see how that is "secret" that will ever help anyone get a handle on their finances. While the author encourages readers not to spend any time reading up on personal finances, the book is filled with comments about how the smartest thing many of the author's clients ever did was getting a financial advisor.  So evidently the path to financial success, according to the author, is to not read anything about personal finances on your own and instead pay someone else to do all of the financial thinking and planning for you.  I don't think anyone with any basic logic skills would believe this is really true. If you want a good book on how ordinary people really became wealthy, I'd recommend reading the Millionaire Next Door instead.       
 This would be the LAST place I would send someone to get a taste of Al Franken. The first half of the book makes the same jokes over and over and over and over again, and throughout, you really need to know a lot of Washington inside stuff to get the jokes. In some ways a sharp expose of our political and media system, and in other ways far, far, far too long with the general feel of a train wreck 
 I fail to understand all of the hoopla about Susan Sontag. While I have only read a limited selection of her work, in these essays, "Against Interpretation" being the ultimate example, Sontag emerges as a simple-minded, arrogant ignoramus. In her utterly unreasoned invective,  Sontag ignores (or is just unable to understand) two critical facts. First,  some works of art and theory are difficult to understand (in varying  degrees) without the help of interpretation. Sontag's flawed analysis of  the supposed ruination of the works of Kafka by interpretation demonstrates  that not only is she among this crowd, she has clearly reached new and  unheard of misguided heights. Second, Sontag ignores the fact that works of  art in other languages cannot be understood in translation without the help  of interpretation and criticism that demonstrates the extent to which  aspects of a certain culture are imbedded in the original language. This  couldn't possibly be clearer than in poetry. Weinberger's excellent  "Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang Wei", which adroitly considers  the subject, hadn't been released when Sontag published this essay but it  probably wouldn't have made a difference. What was she thinking? The only  good aspect of the essay (and why I give it 2 stars instead of 1 or zero)  is the fact that it has given me ample opportunity to win arguments against  individuals who are flawed in their thinking enough to enjoy Sontag's  writing 
 The background and recipes are quite good but the paper back book is a disgrace. My copy is less than a year old but nearly every page has separated from the "perfect" binding. The publisher should give a[...]to anyone who has bought this. Five stars for the author, [...], so a two overall

 After enjoying "Cowboy Bebop" and "Samurai Champloo", someone recommended checking out "FLCL" aka "Fooly Cooly." If you enjoyed those previous titles, I would suggest steering clear of this particular anime. The art is interesting enough but the story is simply lacking, the characters are completely and utterly undeveloped. It almost seems like they are making fun of you for watching their anime. This the second dvd of three and has 40 minutes of programming. I read somewhere that this was not even a real show and that they threw it together to test out new animation techniques-- if you've seen all 6 episodes and are still wondering "what the heck was that" this does not seem to be untrue. Please I strongly suggest you skip watching this program because it is, simply put, garbage.  
 Don't buy this compass if you need to know any direction. If you know about where the sun sets, you will be more accurate than this "compass." It is impossible to use in the field. A waste of money: inaccurate to the max, impossible to maintain it level, etc. Just junk. They should give them away 
 The spirit of the great Duke Ellington must be listening to this self indulgent tripe and wondering three things: 1. Who told Wynton he could liberally borrow huge portions of my work and put his name on it? 2. Who told Wynton he could rearrange my notes like that? 3. Who said he could have MY Pulizer 
 Do yourself a favor and read the book and dont even look at this movie 
 After souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums (a feat achieved by only a handful of bands) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc. The Bunnymen built their reputation on moody, psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in Ocean Rain. For this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory, eschewing album-wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach. Unfortunately these lightweight songs don't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned. If you're new to the Bunnymen you're probably better served by checking out their first four albums (Crocodiles, Heaven Up Here, Porcupine and Ocean Rain) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts Evergreen and Flowers 
 A friend from Sesser, Gene Moore's hometown, loaned me Playing With the Enemy, and I really wanted to like this book.  But I was left wondering what might have been if the author had approached the book differently, chosen a different genre, and taken more time and care in researching the subject matter.  It's a book whose liner notes state was "inspired by true events"; Gary Moore, the author, writes in the preface, "I tried my very best to write the most accurate story I could about Gene Moore's life in baseball and war."  But Playing With the Enemy isn't a true biography, though some reviewers may see it as such; it can't honestly be called non-fiction or even creative non-fiction.  And it really isn't a novel.  I think the book, the story, and message suffer from the author's unwillingness to commit to a single genre.  The author issues a disclaimer in the preface that "names have been changed" and that characters are sometimes "composites of several people"; he admits that it's difficult to verify every account in this book."  The author's research seems to have been limited to talks with family and friends, as well as a single conversation with his father in 1983.  Avenues of research that could have lent this work a greater degree of accuracy and honesty apparently went unexplored.  What details can be checked aren't always accurate; for example, compare the Brooklyn Dodgers lineup Gene imagines playing with on July 21, 1940 with that listed in Total Baseball.  How true something is doesn't always coincide with how historically accurate it is.  Gene Moore's story is a moving one, and there were parts of it I really enjoyed.  But for me, the heartwarming human-interest story Gary Moore tells of his father loses something when it's unclear just where the boundaries lie that separate fact, educated conjecture, and pure fiction.   Gary Moore's editors evidently felt otherwise, but I think this book would have been much powerful if it had been researched more thoroughly and written as straight non-fiction.  I don't doubt that it would have been much more difficult to write, but it would have been a far stronger book.  Some stories can speak for themselves with little embellishment, and I think this is one.  For those who'd like to read a really fine book about another young baseball prospect who winds up "playing with the enemy" during WWII, I'd recommend Fielder's Choice, by Rick Norman.  It's a novel through and through, but it rings true from cover to cover. 
 .      Written before the nomination of Justices Roberts and Alito, Seeking Justices is an unabashed apologetic for the Schumer-Kennedy etc approach of confirmation based on political grounds.  As the author points out, one may judge a nominee by legal skill and qualifications or by political leanings.  From Comiskey's standpoint, only the latter is legitimate, a view he says is shared by political scientists across the country, I infer those on campuses.  The other school--the legalists--are in his view unsupported by history or good sense. Because many nominees in the past have been evalauted on raw politics, means they should be in the future.  From this standpoint, he evaluates nominees according to where they land on the political spectrum-based on newspapers' evaluations (!)-from liberal (good) to conservative (very, very bad).   His attitude toward Judge Bork is all but apoplectic; Bork did not agree with the legal underpinnings of several 1960s-70s decisions, which to Comiskey is anathema.  This is not the place to evaluate Judge Bork, other than to say even if you disagree with him legally-as do I-no one can dismiss his analysis as anything other than serious. But for Comiskey, Bork's opinions do not match the liberal political agenda, and that is both necessary and sufficient for Bork's rejection.  I gave up on Comiskey when he termed Justice Black as a consensus Great Justice.  I suppose that is the case if you ask the left wing of the Democratic party and if you evaluate judges on the basis of how ends-above-means politicians they are.  Give me dispassionate legal scholars any day for unelected positions.  Give me politicians for elected positions.   But, in his view, I'm an unredeemable legalist. .        Because the book was written before Justices Roberts and Alito's nominations, it would be safe to say that Comiskey would applaud the approach taken by Sens. Schumer and Kennedy, and even the frankly embarrassing performances by Sens. Biden and Feinstein (ones who made me feel ashamed to be a Democrat).  .         All in all, the book is politically biased, and not all that scholarly.  But at least Comiskey makes no bones about it 
 If you have any interest in learning how to use a trend following methodology - or even how trend following really works - you should look elsewhere.  Nothing in this book is applicable beyond a brief chart in the last third that explains support and resistance.  While I do not agree with the position that trend following is dead, overrated, or otherwise worth ignoring, this book most assuredly is worth ignoring.  What little it offers in practical advice can be found in many better, less expensive books on basic technical trading 
 After a while you'll never get those "rugged concentric grooves" clean and you will be grossed out by your own cookwear.  I'd never recommend Circulon cookware because of this, especially since there are so many high-quality, smooth-bottomed pans on the market 
 Ugh. I've read virtually all of Simmons books. But... Whatever happened to a good editor. Maybe Simmons has reached a level of success similar to when King began suffering from Worditis. There's probably a good story in here somewhere. But it's drowned in repetition and boredom. I made it half way through this book then skimmed the rest. Just because Simmons read dozens of books about this expedition didn't mean he had to use _all_ of that information. Bleah. Excruciating detail about people, non-events, and daily life that mean little and illuminate less. Scene after agonizing scene telling us -- again and again and again -- that, yup, sure is cold in the Arctic! Whoohoo! Cold. Boring ship life. A "mysterious" supernatural monster, unkillable and invulnerable to human action! (Meaningless: a critter so powerful as to be beyond harm. Simmons should have left the Thing alone. [See his dedication.]) Stupid people out of a bad horror movie who don't bother to tell anyone about the uncanny things they see. The monster mysteriously arises from the ether. Kills again. Disappears. Oh, no. We're all starving. We're cold. Brr. The monster inexplicably appears and vanishes as it kills again. A mystical Eskimo woman, luring men with her sexual allure. More cold. More boring ship routine. More hunger. More inane decisions by people who should know better. Pretensions at literary significance.   God. Put me on an ice flow now and spare me any more 
 My mother bought this for me for Christmas. She used the "available new and used" section to get it a little cheaper. She ended up paying $160 or so. When I put this on my wish list I thought that this hardcover version would be the Arabic-English/English-Arabic, considering that it was $175 and the paperback of the Arabic-English only was available for $45. As it turns out, this is only the hardcover of the Arabic-English only. So for one, my mother paid an additional $115 for only the hardcover version of a book that I could have gotten in the paperback for $45. I still do not have the English-Arabic of the Hans Wehr edition 
 This was one of the boringest books i've ever read.... Unless you want to kill serious time, and you love all types of science-fiction... then this is the book for you. If not, then don't try reading this book. I don't like books that don't get you hooked in, and this DEFINITELY doesn't get you hooked. That's all i have to say about it. 
 This book has the potential to be good but I've already uncovered about 20 mistakes during 2 weeks of extremely light use.  There are numerous problems that are set up so that the answers are insane (Z > 9 problem 7-42).  I think the publisher should fire whoever proofed this book.  Don't waste your money, get Walpole and Myers instead for an introductory text 
 Not as good as Velvet Elvis by far, but an ok read in Rob Bell's Style.  The book focues mainly on relationships touching somewhat on sex and Bell's thoughts on the subject but I found very little exploration into connections between sexuality and spirituality.  Highly disapointed 
 Can't add much to the discussion about the movie, but wanted to say that this DVD listed does not contain a widescreen presentation of School Daze. It says it has both full screen and widescreen, but it doesnt 
 This book can be savaged by the very critical thinking skills it proposes to teach.  The authors insist that a proposition be accurately defined.  But rarely attempt to accurately define the concepts they use as examples.  They devote a great deal of space to explaining the weakness of individual perception and memory, then insist that reality can only be that which one percieves.  One of my greatest criticisms is regular reference to the work of Hyman.  Any good skeptic is skeptical of the work of a professional debunker.  Hyman is well known for debunking any scientific effort for one might wish to discredit.  Thus their regular dependence on Hyman damages their already questionable veracity.  I forced myself to the last chapter, a chapter the authors claim to be example applications of their proposals.  I felt they did a poor job of debunking homeopathic medicine, but when they abrubtly dismissed "water witching" because the working hypothesis they defined was faulty, without any discussion of scientific studies or in fact any discussion of the past success or lack thereof, of "witching", I just closed the book and set it on the shelf.  It will be in the next batch I trade at the used bookstore.  In conclusion, the authors are sloppy, prejudiced, deceitful, and not particularly good writers.  Their position damages science by furthering the cause of those who would call science a "religion" and even worse, but promoting the ideology of the closed, bolted, and sealed mind.  Science has come a long way since Newton first published.  The authors seem unaware of this fact 
 Although the authors are clearly very well versed in forensic anthropology, I was disappointed in the way they presented their material. The chapters weren't difficult to follow, but they read like memoirs of the authors' cases and I got the sense the authors were more interested in showing off than sharing knowledge with nonscientists. That  made it tricky to isolate details, and frankly I've learned more from general crime scene books that devoted just one chapter to forensic anthropology. Bottom line: If you're looking for a solid reference book that you can turn to again and again, you'll probably find satisfaction only in the glossary at the end 
 I totally share the same view as Mr/Ms Birds of Paradise. Clicking several time the Net will surely let you find out that this book belongs to "Fiction," not "Non-Fiction." A movie based upon this book may come out in a year; yet we had better NOT watch it as a documentary film. Having said that, I highly recommend this book to those who would like to know how our history has been built up: Whatever the facts are and wherever the truth lies, history is what winners say and what people believe to be so 
 I don't know why people are attracted to Bell's playing. I think part of it is due to his public image as the young sexy violinist that all the girls like....  Stay away from this recording! Honestly, the Mendelssohn is overly sentimental, and the Beethoven was not serious as all! I preferred the way Menuhin played it, with grace and style and elegance. Sorry, I hate it when people like Bell butcher up two most famous violin pieces. Get the Menuhin/Furtwangler recording. Even the audio is bad, Menuhin's interpretations are SUPREME!  I'm done now 
 I was searching for a book regarding high-rise concrete construction and settled on this one.  As I suspected, the information in this book does not represent how things are done in the US market. (NOTE: Bamboo scaffolding on page 305 and shirtless/shoeless workers on page 213). The portion of the 417 page book related to concrete frame construction is only 20 pages.  The book is not entirely useless but covers all topics only very briefly 
 Yup, not to marginalize the other people who made the show great, but that's basically what it boils down to.  When I saw none of these people in the opening credits, I was concerned.  The people who did make this movie, however, confirmed my fears by making an extremely mediocre film, if not just plain sucky.  I mean seriously, this wouldn't even have passed as an interesting episode of the tv show, let a lone a film.    In one of the extras, the director or someone says that he just wanted to make a "fun" film and that they finished the script in no time at all.  Guess what, it shows.  That is except for the fun part, but the lack of thought and vision part is definitely apparent.  The plot is extremely cliched and stupid.  Maybe if any of the 3 girls were interesting at all, it would've been passable.  However, we ended up with an extremely annoying, rebeling daddy's girl who looks like a Hale Berry clone, a Renee Montoya clone, and some girl tied down to a jailed boyfriend.  Yeah, why should I give a crap about any of these chicks?  In the extras they said they didn't want to do something definitive with Batwoman, but I call it laziness and lack of effort.  If Batwoman's secret identity was one good character it might have worked, but instead we get three worthless ones.    I was at least expecting some lesbian subtext to make things somewhat interesting after I heard the idea to bring Batwoman back as a character in the comic was sparked by this movie.  However, any subtext in this film was extremely minimal if even existent.  I did like the fact that they continued the Barbara/Bruce text, but it was only in one short scene.  I guess having Batgirl and Batwoman in the same movie would be too much for some reason I can't comprehend.  The music to this movie isn't that great as everyone else said, especially compared to Shirley Walker's beyond amazing score.  However, I disagree with everyone who said that the animation was good.  It looked like low-budget, digitally colored, corny crap to me.  Definitely no where even close to the amazing, noir-influced film making from the tv show.  I was also a fan of Penguin's voice in the show, but here he's played by the Mad Hatter's voice actor instead.  I don't know if Penguin's voice acotr died or that he was just busy, but Penguin just wasn't the same this way.    Oever all, I can't find much to like in this film.  I did find the inclusion of fan-service including Batwoman's costume a nice gesture, but definitely not enough to save this film.  So yeah, only get this if you're a completest.  If you're just starting to buy Batman for all means get the tv box-sets instead.  Every episode is much more enjoyable than this half-baked movie 
 Okay, I'll allow this book one star for its photos. Factually, though, major errors abound throughout this poorly researched book and it's so unreliable that any information it contains is completely untrustworthy. Don't bother 
 "A Medieval Feast" is a children's book on a feast held during the Middle Ages.  Since I was looking for a book on Medieval Cookery, and this title came up, I purchased it.  I shouldn't have.  It's a picture book  for young children, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with Medieval  recipes or cookery.  If It wouldn't cost me the price of the book in  shipping, I'd send it back.  However, for children who would like a story  with a Medieval flare, this book is perfect for them, with lovely  illustrations by ALIKI 
 Perhaps it's unfair of me to rate this book, since I didn't make it to the end.  It was disappointing, since I've liked others of Coover's books.  This one is written in a stream of consciousness style reminiscent of James Joyce/"Ulysses" (which I liked a lot).  Similarly, it also is incredibly literate and erudite, lots of language play which still somehow was mostly just hard and not fun the way language should and can be.  I could appreciate the humor intellectually, but it wasn't really funny.  The subject matter is a cynical take on a dark subject, the Rosenberg executions.  I can certainly understand why its release was so contoversial.  It might help to know more about the period but as someone who came of political age (later) during the Watergate years I know little about Nixon as VP and many of the social references were lost on me 
 Becker, who is known for the book Jacob the Liar, starts out with a fascinating premise: a son of a Holocaust survivor, residing in E. Germany, finds that his father and some friends are holding a former concentration  camp guard a prisoner in a cabin. It is the 1970's, and the son wrestles  with this information. What, if anything, should he do? Unfortunately, the  premise is the only worthwhile thing about his book. It just does not  deliver. The characters, especially the son, is superficial, not drawn with  much, if any, depth. I couldn't figure out why the son even cared about  what his father was doing; he didn't seem to care about much else. This  book was a real disappointment 
 This is an album that you will either love with a passion or HATE. I chose the latter. I could just drive around D.C. with Bone Thugz Greatest Hits in my deck all day. So of course, when I heard the strong single,"What's Friends" on Music Choice I made the decision to get the album that same day. Unfortunately, that's the only song I bump on the CD. It's is one of my favs, but the rest of the album is SAUCE!!! I didn't understand the pop-hip-hop feel of most of the album, and a good part of it was skits. What the hell happened? Any album that has a Bone-Thugz member should be classic, but... Please, please don't spend yo money on this album, just download "What's Friends" and make a mix with that track on it. Enough said, I'm out 
 An awful yawner.  It shows all the reasons chivalry made for tiresome tales, and why the world needed Don Quixote so badly.  The Chretien de Troyes version of Lancelot is repetitious, has many loose ends, and is full of plot holes.  Lancelot jumps into a cart to shame himself in pursuit of Guenivere.  Before Lancelot jumps into the cart, the narrator states that "reason is the enemy of love."  In the scope of the book, and the code of chivalry, reason is the enemy of this genre.  Take with Nyquil. 
 I washed this pillowcase 4 times and dried it with a fabric softener sheet in the dryer and it's still too rough for my son to sleep on.  Nice print and size, but useless if you can't sleep on it.  Don't bother 
 I thought this would help soften our very firm mattress, it worked for maybe 5 minutes then I was sleeping in a hole... Your body just sinks down into this and all the padding goes out to the side.  Just a waste of money.  
 Well, it's not surprising that the author of this book chose to belittle the work of on of America's Great Afro/Latino artists.  It seems as if the author, with no real recourse, took it upon himself to speak of someone so  lowly whom he never had a chance to meet.  This author has no real  understanding of Basquiat's work and it is plainly obvious in the words  used to describe Basquiat as "the Little Black Rimbaud of American  painting..."   I would not recommend this book to anyone of  Afro/Latino Descent interested in a serious study of Black art.. 
 We were forced to read this book in philosophy class some years back and everyone was appauled by her hatred of men and  inability of see the beauty and wonder of intercourse.Her view of women isn't much better in that they are supposedly the poor helpless vessels men prey upon to oh my have such a  distasteful act as intercourse.The male in her book is the  aggressor and the female is the passive unwilling but willing  victim to only get children and love in return.If she can't see the pleasure of the sex act then it's no one's fault but hers. Every page of the book was hard to read.I don't know why some people bother to read such books because it's a waste of  trees,paper and time! Another problem is she makes it sound as though women who  like intercourse aren't up to her intellectual level,as though she has some perfect world where women hate men and intercourse. She tries to make very subjective material sound like it's  supposed to be the objective norm for every woman.Not!!! Very dangerous book 
 Hans Urs von Balthasar put it better than I ever could:  "About Hans Kung I merely wish to say that he is absolutely entitled to take the stance of a liberal Protestant with its correspondingly pronounced anti-Roman mentality. What is questionable, however, is his insistence on still calling himself a Catholic."--(Test Everything, Hold Fast to What is Good, An Interview with Hans Urs von Balthasar, by Angelo Scola. Ignatius Press: 1989, pg. 29. Originally published in German, 1986 
 The claim of this book is that the liberals are responsible for the decline of American society from the "good old days" and that to fix all of society's problems we should return to the glory days of the nuclear family.  Nothing new there; that idea has been in circulation since the days of Confucius.  What makes Kyle Williams' book unique is its complete lack of supporting evidence for its claim.  Take the very first paragraph (available in the Amazon exercept).  Williams says that NBC's Thursday after-work programming is unfit for a five-year-old, much less a teenager.  Leaving aside the odd grammar (transposing "five-year-old" and "teenager" would make more sense in context), we see absolutely no reason for why NBC's programming is unfit for children.  Is Sex and the City scheduled for 6 PM?  No, indeed: a quick glance at NBC's website shows that programming from 5-8 consists of the news, Wheel of Fortune, and Jeopardy.  Granted, lots of news stories are not appropriate for 5 year olds, but should the news be banned or filtered because of that? I hope not!  The book goes on in that vein, with its nostalgic "memories" of barn-raisings and vehement attacks on a school system that the author, being home-schooled, knows nothing about. (This latter would be ok if he had provided some valid study or other evidence to support his point, rather than merely "My mommy thinks public schools are bad for children," which is essentially what his argument comes down to.)  The only extenuating circumstance of this book (1 star instead of 0) is that the author is so young.  This level of writing is what I'd expect from an 8th or 9th grader, but he shouldn't be touted as a "political pundit" until he learns to back up his claims with actual facts 
 I want to concur with the other reviewer. Ever since I gave my email address to Allen's organization, I have been inundated with spam for pharmaceuticals, stock tips, and genital enhancements - the same areas he teaches his students to sell. This is the first major spam I have ever received. I think he is farming out my email to his other students as some kind of incentive to them. Be careful - do not give your primary email to his organization!  The book has some decent facts, but I would be careful about using email techniques that alienate your readers 
 It was simply to frustrating a read, bear in mind that I've read all the 8 other books. Now I didn't mind Mr. Goodkind dabbling with philosophy in Faith of the Fallen, as long as it supported the plot.   Sadly this book is philosophical propaganda disguised as a fantasy book. The universe being used as a vehicle to prove Mr. Goodkind's pseudo intellectual philosophies.   A character like Richard simply disgusts me now. From being a boy with strong beliefs, he has been molded into a righteous tyrant, who enforces his beliefs upon everybody and everything. Its sad to see.   No. I really recommend anyone to stay clear of this book, its not worth the read. Its an insult to the reader, with endless monotonies and weak philosophy 
 Just finished Emily Griffin's Something Borrowed then picked this one up right after...What a difference! Love at First Site is extremely boring right off the bat and the writing style is so painfully unnatural I couldn't make it past the first 40 pages. Griffin's debut, by comparison, is one of the best chick lit novels out there--very engaging with strong characters and lots of romantic suspense. Even if you like British chick lit authors as I do, don't bother with this one by Jane Moore 
 The redeeming feature of this music is the writing of Michael Gibbs which does show some originality and the title track is a work worth hearing. Otherwise, the music is very much part of the fashionable funk of its day  and just does not stand up to repeated listenings. OK as background music  at a party but really pretty boring rhythmically, few interesting solos,  and clunky melodies.  Try Burton's Duster instead 
  I first heard about this book in a graduate level Latin American survey course.  I kept it in the back of my mind and finally got around to reading it years later.  The professor had described it glowingly and subsequent references to it that I came across were all very positive.  Consequently I really looked forward to reading this book.  I was extremely disappointed.  Published in 1938 I would say that overall the book has aged badly.  It is overly dramatic, even emotionally silly in parts. The plot is insipid.  The Mexican characters are not Mexican but European with a little Mexican airbrushing.  The indigenous people are portrayed as one-dimensional simians.    I read that prior to writing the book Graham Greene spent a total of eight weeks in Mexico.  It sadly shows.   He has little understanding of Mexico.  I can't understand the continuing hoopla surrounding this work.  If you want to read some decent fiction about early twentieth century Mexico try something by B. Traven. 
 This book was ok . Its sad because Gebu beats Ranofer but the ending stunk 
 I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.     Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.     In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.  This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.  For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr. 
 If you really like J.D. Salinger, please don't read this book. It's just depressing. Frankly I don't doubt the truth of it, but do I really want to know what a nasty self centered oaf he can be? No I don't 
 I like to find movies in which current "stars" were not yet household names.  I enjoyed Kate Beckinsale in such recent films as 'Underworld' and 'Van Helsing' and this plot line of one of her earlier films, sounded humorously entertaining.    Kate plays an orphan, Flora Poste, who goes to live with your long lost cousins at Cold Comfort Farm.  Flora likes organization and finds very interesting ways of making her cousins see their true paths in life (often leaving the farm to do so), while simplifying and keeping her life organized.  She's a very charming control freak.  The film has a true, understated British humor and charm with many great one-liners, but I can't say that I found the film to be "hysterically" funny, nor worth the repeat view.  I strongly suggest Greenfingers (Clive Owens) and Saving Grace (Craig Ferguson and Brenda Blethyn) as alternatives in the category of "not yet a household name". 
 I also was a owner of the original big wheel and bought two of these for my grandchildren.  They are of poor quality--nothing like the original and they do not hold up for little rough boys.  I had two sons and they did everything possible to the original and it just kept rolling---NOT so with this on 
 I listened to this thing after checking CD set out from the local library - luckily I did not plunk down my own money for it (and only wasted one hour)!   The first CD is an extended sales-pitch for other E-myth "books", website, worksheets, and consulting services (as obviously are some of the reviews posted here that "plug" the author's coaching practice). Even as a sales pitch, the book fails, being very crude and heavy-handed in the used-car-salesman, creepy kind of way. I gave up after listening to one CD, during which I heard about the website, the "coaching" service, the newsletter, and numerous god's blessings for the author, and then about the website, the coaching service, the newsletter, god's mysterious ways and blessings for the author, and so on, ad nauseam.   All this, interspersed with a few sentimental, dull, and annoyingly protracted personal anecdotes with little or no relevance to business issues. What I have not heard during this first part, however, was a SINGLE useful piece of advice or constructive insight regarding running a small business, or good business practices in general. As another reviewer before me, I too felt particularly put-off by the tone, and additionally by the frequent mentions of god, blessings, "miracles", and "mysterious ways" all abused as part of the sales pitch.   I am sorry to have wasted my time on this. If you think you have to read it, check it out from the local library where, I am quite sure, it's gathering dust on the bookshelves. If you need sound business advice, I'll agree with another reviewer who recommended the book Winning by Jack Welch instead 
 Even if you're a "conservative," you gotta admit that this is one of the worst magazines around. If you like good writing, don't even try this one. A "one star" is still too generous in my opinion. 
 This truly was the most disappointing Ed McBain book I have read!  By the time I had read 150 pages I decided I'd had enough...the plot is too easy to figure out, no suspense, the cops are a farce and put a bad name on Florida law enforcemente, etc., etc.  I sure hope McBain goes back to the 87th Precinct and "finds himself" once again 
 I like almost all of Lifetime's movies and love tuning in to watch but this was certainly not one of the best. The name bring "obsessed" was not what it should have been called, the lady was dreaming and had an illness. This movie had a horrible twist which made the ending bad and hard to follow and understand the whole way through, this movie was not what I had expected. As I said I like almost all of Lifetime Original Movies but I definitely wan't be watching this one again.  
 the bra cup itself is too big for my chest. and although interesting to look at because it looks like a bra women may have worn daily in the 30's and 40's it is not at all comfortable.  blah!  and i love vanity fair so its disappointing for sure 
 Well it very pleasant that a fresh wave of music comes from Barcelona streets to our homes all over the world. I don't where know these band is coming from but it is clear that Ojos De Brujos opened the way for them. So thinking of that i have to say that they can't reach Ojos De Brujos emotional "breaks" at all .They seem to put this record in market just to win benefits from Ojos succes till now . 
 I wanted to see this film in theaters. I am a Cronen fan. I admit. I wasn't really a huge fan on Viggo Mortensen. I never read the book, but somehow I was drawn to this film, indirectly.  So, I wait for the DVD. Which isn't such a bad DVD as it is a film. Firstly, there are no surprises. Any surprises this movie could possibly have in store for us was revealed in either the trailer, the DVD cover, or the DVD ad. Viggo's performance as a whole, wasn't too shabby. Ed Harris was obviously the one man shining through this dark and boring movie. So in this small, secluded town Tom Stall aka 'Joey, turns out to save some lives and becomes a hero. Although, it turns out Tom Stall wasn't much of a hero as he was a villain. That's about it. The movie drags it ending around like a dogs rear on the carpet.  The sex scenes felt out of place more than anything. I couldn't stress that enough. I'm going to be blunt. They are too random. They are in bad taste. They are uncomfortable. They are very much disliked by me, personally.  And finally, the ending. The ending was probably the most empty finish I've ever witnessed. Tom Stall goes after his brother, takes care of him, drives back, and Sits down for a nice meal with the family. Three words. Fade to black.  I give this movie 2 out of 5 stars. For two reasons. Some of the action scenes were interesting, and Ed Harris. I would not recommend this film 
 The whole book just meandered from the get-go, never going anywhere.  One could surmise early who would be killed and who the killer would be, but the murder was certainly an afterthought.  I'm also tired of Qwill's relationship with the boring Polly.  And the great number of times he mentions his mustache.  A great disappointment!  -- Pa 
 I can't really add anything to what is said in the other reviews.  This is a terrible product.  It sticks to everything - hands, tables, rugs, dogs, everything.  Disgusting.  I only wish I had read these reviews before I let my kids put it on their Christmas lists 
 The book starts fantasticly, but then as I went along I grow tired by the long jurney, no humor at all, and especialy by exageration with the fact that Thomas is a leper - in every other line you can find something like "... he knew that feeling all to well for he was a LEPER...", and another thing - every little thing and action is to important and grand. I just lost interest and excitement from the first 200 pages. I don't know, maybe I wasn't in the right mood, or I had too great expectations, but I'll take Feist, Guy Gavriel Kay, Eddings, especialy Eddings over Donaldson any day 
 I found The Dragon Queen at my local library and enjoyed reading it very much.  I then picked up The Raven Warrior and although I made it through the book, I was disappointed in the modern dialogue that permeated the book.  I will probably read the third book when it comes out, but hope she focuses on the action rather than the attempts to be witty, which are totally inappropriate for this genre of book 
 Racism is not the problem with this book - sure...5 Chinese brothers look alike -maybe they look alike because they are brothers, not because they are Chinese.  I bought this book because generally I love the books written in earlier times - they have a quaintness about their stories and illustrations that can transport you and your child to another time.  This book does have engaging illustrations.  What I find disturbing is the fact that this is a book for children yet:  (1)	a little boy drowns, never to be seen again (2)	one brother is tried, arrested and sentenced to have his head cut off (3)	the people of the village assemble in the village to witness the execution where the "executioner took his sword and struck a mighty blow" (4)	the next brother was sentenced to be drowned and was thrown overboard from a boat (5)	the next brother is sentenced to be burned alive - he was tied up to a stake and set fire  (6)	the next brother is sentenced to be suffocated - he's shovelled into an oven  This is no more appropriate for a child (or adult for that matter) in 1936 than it is in 2005.  Now, a lot of you are probably thinking I'm one of those mothers who just needs to get a sense of humour and lighten up.  I'm not...I love the Giving Tree, and can put naughty Eloise (and the smoking nanny) in context, as I can many other books that polarise readers.  I really wanted to like this book but trust me....if you buy it, you will have lots of uncomfortable explaining to do to a young child.  An eight year old may be able to put it in context, but there is no way you should read this to a four year old.   If you want a great book written in the 1930s, buy Ferdinand the Bull instead.  It's a fantastic book.   
 Theres just too much unecessary material in this book about ways to read in data etc. Its all unecessary cos like myself most professional  analysts and statisticians have access to SAS enterprise guide, which is incredibly powerful and so much less time consuming. The programming language is only useful for algorithms these days, as most professionals havent got the time to be debugging code all day. The text covers nothing about cluster analysis either which is central to a lot of multi variate analysis.  The mathematics and statistical detail is of far more interest and importance to us in the working environment than reading in of files. 
 I have enjoyed many of Anne Tyler's books, particularly, "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant," "Breathing Lessons" and "Back When We Were Grownups".  "Saint Maybe" was a huge disappointment.  The plot and characters were mediocre at best, and a bizarre religion, The Church of the Second Chance, played a major part in the story. By the end of the book, it had completely taken over.  The Church of the Second Chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult.  Yes, Ian Bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life, but why the book was named, "Saint Maybe" is still a mystery to me.  One of the children in Ian's care made reference to Ian as perhaps being "Saint Maybe," but who the heck is Saint Maybe??  The closest I could come up with is "MAYBE you will finish the book... and MAYBE you won't! 
 Gardner's book is full of banal and often incorrect observations. It's hard to believe he has received over 20 honorary degrees from universities around the world if his ideas are this unoriginal. He chooses the staggeringly bad examples of Margaret Thatcher, George Bush and BP CEO John Browne as people who have successfully changed minds. He doesn't mention that Thatcher and Bush antagonized large sections of their countries' populations, completely failing to change their minds, in fact hardening their positions of opposition; in large part due to these leaders' own refusal to ever change their minds or consider alternative policies. Gardner lavishes praise on Bush for switching from isolationism to an interventionist foreign policy after 9/11, without any mention of the PNAC team that had already planned to invade Iraq even before 9/11.   As for John Browne, his claim to have repositioned BP as an environmentally and socially concerned company has been discredited in the past year with the explosion at a Texas refinery and the oil spill on the North Slope that led to the admission that BP hadn't done any of the anti-corrosion work it was supposed to do on its pipelines.   Another poor example is Lawrence Summers of Harvard. For some reason Gardner doesn't mention the biggest controversy Summers was involved with, when he said that women could never be as good at science as men. Gardner's use of case studies from academia is another bad choice because most readers won't have heard of these professors and won't care much about their internal disputes. It's a shame Gardner didn't tackle any real-life problems, such as how to change the minds of Creationists.   Gardner insists on using "she" and "her" instead of "he" and "his" as the neutral pronoun for political correctness, and another irritating habit he has is to invent jargon that will obviously never catch on, such as "wetware" and "dryware" for the internal workings of the brain and "GoodWork" for being ethical at work, yet another painfully banal concept.   In one section Gardner describes how a psychologist uses a patient's dream to understand how the patient sees himself (or should I say herself even if he was male?) in relation to others, which sounds to me like total cod psychology, but that's just my own reaction to dream interpretations.   Regarding computers, Gardner believes that people are starting to prefer interaction with computers over interaction with other people. This again is utterly mistaken and it's clear that Gardner has next to no experience with the internet. Thanks to the internet there has been an explosion in human interaction and far more people talk with other people than with computers. Gardner says people can get emotional solace from interaction with computers that are programmed to communicate and cites a book written in 1995, but gives no further justification of this claim.   Anyone writing about changing minds ought to have a full understanding of how people use the internet and communicate on all kinds of levels that weren't possible before this technology existed, for example role-playing or participating in a political discussion forum, as well as absorbing surreptitious marketing on the internet.   Gardner's specific advice on how to change minds consists of using a variety of words that all begin with "re" for convenience, eg resonance and resistance. I had hoped to learn how to communicate my ideas better from this book, but all I learnt was that it was a bad book. 
 I found the writer, Crane, dying to interpose his bad poetry, bad jokes and whining, obnoxious self into what could have been a thoughtful story about a monk and his religious beliefs.  Too bad 
 Try The Little Book of Yoga Breathing: Pranayama Made Easy instead of B.K.S. Iyengar's book and see for yourself.  Scott Shaw's book is an answer to any introductory pranayama and worths it's weight in gold.   Following are two techniques: Alternate Nostril Breathing (Anulom Vilom Pranayama with no breath retention) This pranayama (control breathing) is done with alternate breathing from the left and right nostrils for cleansing of Nadis. (energy meridians). Seated in a convenient posture, start off with slow inhalation from the left nostril first by closing the right nostril with the middle of right hand thumb ,and after fully filling the lungs, (not the belly breathing) breathe out slowly from the right nostril by closing the left nostril with the two ( left hand middle and ring) fingers. Now breathe in from the right nostril by closing the left nostril in the above manner and exhale from the left nostril by closing the right nostril with the right thumb. It completes one cycle.  Do this for three minutes for two months then gradually increase to 5 minutes.		  Do it two hour after eating  or drinking. (Do it on empty-stomach) Do not eat for 15 minute after you are done. Better to lie down for five minutes after you are done.  If you limit practice to maximum of five minutes, it will be the best.  The very first sign you will experience is lightness in the body and clearer thinking.  The practice of this breathing for a period of three to four months can open up thirty to forty percent of the heart arteries' blockages. This pranayama alleviates all the diseases of the body, leads to the state of joy, enthusiasm for living , fearlessness, peace of mind and deep meditation.  Benefits:		 -Hair will regrow within two months of practice.   -Body will go to it's ideal weight by itself. -Face becomes bright and luminous. -Lost vision will return. -Removes fear/anxiety of any kind. - Aligns both hemisphere of the brain for full brain functionality - Creates a deeper sense of well-being and harmony - Helps alleviate migraines and headaches and frazzled states of being - Works great in situations where you find yourself anxious, board and need grounding -Blockages in the arteries of the heart are removed and the arteries become clean, making circulation unimpeded.  Ujjayi Pranayama  1. You can do this sitting, standing or walking anywhere anytime.  2. Inhale slowly through both nostrils, keeping the throat slightly constricted so as to make a gentle sound that will help you to feel the breath in the throat. The sound will remind you of ocean waves washing up the beach. Concentrate on the feeling of the breath moving in and out through the throat.  3. During inhalation do not allow abdomen to bulge out, let the chest expand.  4. After completing inhalation slowly exhale. (Either by both nostrils or by left nostril) During exhalation chest should go inside and abdomen should remain steady.  Remember :-  1. While doing Ujjiayi air should touch the throat.  2. Breath must be mentally locked in chest area. (Do not do belly breathing)  3. After practicing it for few days, knowing your limitations, keep the ratio between inhalation and exhalation 1 : 2.  4. In easy Ujjiayi Pranayama, inhalation and exhalation can be practiced by both the nostrils.   Benefits: This simple practice has a subtle influence on the whole body. It calms the mind and has a soothing effect on the nervous system. Ujjayi is very useful for people with high blood pressure as it slows down the heartbeat. It has subtle effects on the flow of life force in the astral (energy) body and helps you to be aware of its movement within the sushumna (astral spine) 
 This guide is racist against the PS2 version! Not only that, but I have played and beaten the XBOX version at a friends house, and uncovered that there are various picture faults and the text wording is somewhat poor. Not only that, but some directions for the XBOX version are wrong, several wrong for PS2 (DON'T tell me to look in the ps2 sidebar, because thats what I meant.)  This may be the last prima guide I buy 
 These outdoor window thermometers SEEMED like a good idea,  however, they're worthless!  The LCD display is NOT bright like shown in the picture.  The numbers are so light they are totally unreadable.  Also, the suction cups will NOT stay stuck to a cold window.  I'm returning them 
 Terrible book, poorly researched,and conveluted. I waste of a person's time and money 
 I'm not certain the review below is totally impartial since it's a husband writing a review of his's wife's book as if he were just any old reader.  I found the book to be not as helpful or informative as described.  A slow read 
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 Boring and irritating. Not one character is likable, and not one character is 3D 
 Very dramatic music - felt like a battle.  Not an easy listening type of music by any stretch of the imagination 
 After a brief email correspondence with Bryant, it's easy to see why this was such a boring, poorly written book. I'm glad I was given the book and didn't actually waste any money on it. The book jumps from one newspaper article to another, and never really tells me, an avid baseball fan anything I didn't already suspect about players taking steroids and other performance enhancers. I mean really, it's been going on for ages in all sports. Bryant's obsessive fascination with race and racism really comes through when he spends an entire chapter on Barry and Bobby Bonds and race relations between writers and players. His never really backs up any of his racial assertions with any more then anecdotes and opinions. He blames Bobby's alcoholism on the way he was treated by the baseball world and blames Barry's problems on everyone but Barry. He claims that white writers make life troublesome for difficult black players but treat difficult white players with kit gloves. Tell that one to Steve Carlton, Howard. Please do yourself a favor and don't waste even five bucks on a used copy of this. Your time would be wasted to even get a copy from the library. Mine went in my recycle bin 
 steph believes her husband leaves her after thirteen years of marriage because of her boring flannel night gowns and unshaved legs. in the meantime, she meets peter and quickly falls in love.  peter is into bionics and while he goes away on business trips, he leaves behind his clone, paul to keep his girlfriend company.  steph is torn because she finds herself in love with both peter and paul.  when she's not having sex with peter, she's doing sexual acrobatics with paul.  the whole story line is utterly ridiculous.  the only reason i finished the book was because i was hoping it would get better.  i kept thinking this would make some kind of comedy.  unfortunately, i don't think danielle steel had comedy in mind when she wrote it.  i do believe the reader was supposed to get sucked into a romantic love triangle.  that didn't happen!  instead, i continued to dislike steph's insecure, sex crazed character less and less.  
 movie about 2 women trying to con a pro at seduction. Mediocre dialogue with same acting and plot. The eroticism is wooden and tepid. Shabby treatment even for a French movie. Yuck 
 Very dissappointed.  My son (I bought this for them) hooked it up and there is so much interference it cannot be used.  Audio just static and noise.  I did find it interesting that the instructions tell you it might NOT work.  Try telling this to me before I purchase thank you.  This is the last I purchase equipment on-line.  I will stick to books thank you very much 
 I was pleased to see this book at our local bookstore, but decided to check it out of our library first. Boy, am I glad I did! Many of the recipes include Worcestershire sauce. Students, especially those who are new to vegetarianism, may simply trust this book and may not know that Worcestershire sauce contains anchovies -- meat! Also, some canned mushroom soups have a beef base, which the author also neglects to mention. Just a note at the start -- or even just a concerted effort to specify *vegetarian*  Worcestershire sauce would have made all the difference. However, these flaws are so big as to keep me from purchasing this book -- for myself, for any friends, or for the collection of the library in which I work 
 Interesting premise, but the plot is like swiss cheese.  This review will just be a point by point of all the major things that I found so implausable that I couldn't just suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. Spoilers alert.  I wasn't able to make the leap to believing Sarah's sudden turn towards malicious opportunism as soon as she saw the cash. When questioned about what she would do if she found some hypothetical millions, she insists with chirpy disinterest that she would certainly turn it in. Just one scene of her looking longingly at a brochure for a holiday she couldn't afford would have established some repressed dissatisfation with her life situation, but her general demeanor seemed to suggest not only comfort, but satisfaction.  Why did Hank decide he would burn the money instead of return it if it turned out someone legitimately owned it? Surely it wouldn't be too difficult to anonymously return it without being implicated in it's disappearance. The first murder, after the old guy regained consciousness, why did Hank not try to negotiate with or threaten the old guy to keep quiet about his brother assaulting him? For Hank, finishing the job his brother started didn't seem like an absolute last resort, it seemed like he took the murder lightly.  When Hank got home apparently he volunteered information to his wife about what he'd just done. What? Like he knew she'd be understanding about it or something? Hi honey, I'm home, by the way I just killed a man to protect the money. Wtf? When Jacob shot Lou to protect Hank, why didn't Hank just give the tape back before it got to that point?  The shotgun impact on Lou's wife was cartoonishly ridiculous, sending her flying three feet into the air when the blast didn't even hit her at an upward trajectory.  And the final ridiculous flaw. Jacob taking the fake FBI agent's gun, and instead of just shooting himself before his brother had time to react, he hands it to his brother, and charges him with the responsibility of killing him, setting up the final emotional crescendo of the film. Supposedly the explanation was that it wouldn't look like the fake FBI agent shot Jacob if the shot was fired at point blank range, but why not? Why couldn't forensic investigators at the scene believe an altercation could have transpired where Jacob charged at the gunman from behind when he was about to shoot the sheriff, wrestled with him, and wound up taking a point blank shot to the head? It really makes no sense.  One inspiredly believable moment I will give them film credit for is Hank's difficulty in finding the bullets in the sheriff's office and loading the gun. A lazier writer would have just had him find the gun loaded. If the major plot developments were fleshed out in more detail to be made believable this could have been a great film. As it is, it's a frustratingly flaw-ridden glimpse of what could have been and a waste of time to watch.  
 This book only gets 2 stars from me because 3 or so chapters are actaully worthy of reading. The remainder compells the reader to gouge out their own eyeballs to avoid reading another sentence of the poorly written chapters. You'd think with having 3 authors they could do better than this but alas...no. Most likely you don't have a choice of whether or not to read this book however I am a better man for not having to read this book again. I'll be getting my MBA in 8 days and look forward to NOT reading books like this for the rest of my natural life. Best of luck, you'll need it 
 I bought this book since it seemed like a good overview of social movements. It turns out that it is a collection of a bunch of articles that are in all honesty not very interesting. I feel that the editor tried to do so much that he failed at doing anything with the book 
 this book could have been so much more, I am sorry the leading lady was a bore and she fell in love with a jerk for no other reason than she couldn't read him.  the hooky pooky reading of the palms made the book to far fetched to every really get into and the plot was no plot at al 
 Product doesn't really do anything more than blow air.  It doesn't appear to do anything with the ultraviolet light 
 I was expecting more and got less. Pretty slow and boring. Not a keeper 
 BB is a great blues performer, but his jump blues doesn't jump.  Buy some actual Louis Jordan recordings, and really go for it 
 The is a review of a pharmacy student. Unfortunately, this is a required text for my medchem/pharmacology class. You can ask any student in my class and majority of us would have the same complaint. This book is extremely difficult to follow. For example they give you a table for alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. While the table is more or less OK describing different beta receptor types, it doesn't tell much about alpha receptors. The authors of this omit a lot of important details.  They don't write much about medications' side effects. In general this book makes it difficult to distinguish medications of each group from each other. On the better side, the book provides a lot of chemical structures, which make medchem part easier 
 I wish there was a rating under one star.  I'm supposed to read this for a class, but, in rare fashion, I doubt that I will finish the novel.  I realize this is supposed to be surreal, but must I sacrifice plot and character to immerse myself in "literature"? Maybe I'm a product of the times, but a plot which is at least interesting would be nice, even if I don't care about the characters.  Please: Barth, Barthleme, and Pynchon write complex, surrealistic fiction, but also give us characters we can care about and plots which fascinate 
 Nothing innovative or exciting. Anyone who does not know this stuff should not be in business or in a leadership positio 
 We were excited to order this book after reading the other reviews.  We have two adopted children - the oldest is now 4 and the youngest is 1 1/2.  We were VERY disappointed.  In its 33 pages, the book provided some nice art and a couple of nice sentiments in its 150 words - but nothing more.  While less may be more, there wasn't much value in this book for us.  We would recommend finding another book that would be more useful.  We're certainly still looking.. 
 Here is another self-help book that didn't need to be written. The useful information could be summerized in a phamplet, if so much - the cover would be sufficient. Why this writing style is so popular is beyond my comprehension (maybe because people like me keep picking them up...AHHH!!!). The use of filler "stories" are quite uneccessary if the author has something unique or interesting to say, but in most of these books it is just a rehash of the same basic information. If this is the first of this type of book you are reading you may find some of it interesting and useful, but that is being generous, but, if you have read any other self-help book remotely similar, don't even waste your time 
 Poor video quality, extra thrill section lame, it like one big advertisement rather then detailed clips of passes and crashes. I have 2004 dvd which is much better. Don't buy 2006 
 This author has about as much literary talent as a pile of mud.  There's not much else to say 
 This is my first review for Amazon.  I write this so that some reader can avoid the pain I suffered.  The book was the worst mystery I have ever read.  Wild plot twists have been mentioned by others, nonsensical plot twists are a better description. I found none of the book to be believable and must admit the the only reason I finished to the book was to see if the final half was worse than the first half.  This book was factually wrong in so many ways. Here are a few; 1) The prices listed were off. 2)College professors held office hours late on Friday afternoons. 3) Someone was paid with $1000 dollar bills.    I will give away one plot twist.  Someone has been stealing rare books for months.  Someone is given a contract to kill a girl two weeks before the first attempt is made to kill the girl who happens to be reading the rare book.  The brillant detectives assume the book thefts are to a smart way to cover up the murder.  I would have found the book less offensive if the plot twist was that young aliens were playing with their parents' time machine and that the aliens had given the murder contract in order to prevent their parents' from discovering the youthful indecretion 
 This book starts with a description of objects and OMT and UML stuff. It explains the benefits of object oriented techniques and of the capabilities of simulation. It takes some pages to explain how simulation languages work  and what needs to be included. So far no problem. Untill it starts  explaining about a barber shop and PSIM (the simulation language developed  in C++ by the author of the book). All kinds of process flows are modelled,  not only in the basics of the library elements of the language, but also in  the example itself. Unfortunately the whole object oriented technique is  neglected. For the object oriented expert a good laughter, for the novice  in either OO or simulation, watch out for this book and duck.

 I have just finished reading Styron's book Darkness Visible and I have to say that I was quite under whelmed. The reader is left with little insight into Styron's battle with severe depression. Maybe this is just me, but I find that writers seem capable of expressing their feelings of despair and suicide in only in the loftiest of literary terms. Their writing screams, "I'm famous, well respected and admired, therefore I cannot express myself the way that an ordinary person would. That would be too plebeian." That and the frequent name dropping made me feel alienated from the author. For this reason the reader gets no clear understanding of the nature of his depression. We get glimpses but don't feel privy to his deepest thoughts. In fact, I cannot fathom why he even wrote the book. It certainly doesn't speak to the common people - especially those of us who have spend our lives trying to get the mental health system to advocate for us. Many of us are treated more like criminals than someone with a disease that needs adequate treatment - something that is not going to be found in the state mental health institutions in which the ordinary person is held.  Styron's recovery is almost an afterthought. After spending weeks in a psychiatric hospital (I would guess McLean), he is cured. How is he cured - time. Give the illness enough time and the patient will get better. Actually, in my own experience as someone with severe depression with multiple suicide attempts, the passage of time does place a barrier between my suicidal thoughts and my recovery. But time alone does not cure - it postpones. On page 75 (soft cover) Styron states, "Save for the awfulness of certain memories, acute depression inflicts few permanent wounds." Well, bully for him. But I think that he would find most depressives in disagreement with this statement. At least for myself, my depression has left deep wounds for the past 30 years or so.  Apparently, this was Styron's only episode of depression and thoughts of suicide (unless he has relapsed since this book was published). He attributes the causes of his depression to the loss of his mother, his father's illness, abstaining from alcohol (alcohol and mental illness are not a good mix and only worsen a person's symptoms), and turning 60. It's great that he can pinpoint so precisely the origins of his illness. For many people depressed and suicidal we just can't point to the causes of our illness. As research on the brain advances, we know that chemical imbalances in the brain have a lot to do with many mental illnesses. But ask someone who attempts suicide why they wanted to hurt themselves and many times your answer will be, "I don't know - I just don't know."  On page 76 he states, "Most people in the grip of depression at its ghastliest ..... may require on the part of friends, lovers, family, admirers [!], an almost religious devotion to persuade the sufferers of life's worth, which is so often in conflict with a sense of their own worthlessness, but such a devotion has prevented countless suicides." In my experience and that of others, family and friends have no clue as to how to help a person in so much pain. They want to help and be supportive but they don't know how. And who can expect them to? Yes, having support is gratifying but in the end not as helpful as one would hope. For myself, "such devotion" has never stopped me from hurting myself or attempting suicide. When the despair is so great and the spiral down into the abyss is impossible to climb out of, thoughts of family, friends, loved ones are completely absent from my mind. They're gone - insignificant. The only hope is that someone or something can grab my hand and pull me out of that bottomless hole.  Also lacking insight is Styron's statement on 77. He writes about a camaraderie with a celebrated [what else would we expect from Mr. Styron's coterie of friends and admirers] newspaper columnist and good friend who was manic depressive. Because of the commonality of their illnesses, they have "engender[ed] lasting fellowship." So hey, one of the perks of those feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, despair, anguish and pain is that you might be lucky enough to find yourself a good friend.  This is the first time that I have read an account of a man's experience with mental illness. It is not my intention to sound sexist, but my experience in reading women authors writing about their battles with mental illness is that they are much more candid and forthright. I suppose that Styron's stilted and abbreviated account of his recovery from depression could just be the difference in which the opposite genders express their innermost thoughts. 
 Ms Schlafly's world-view would be laughable if it were not so intolerant. 
 To think someone actually wrote this book. Worse yet is that the reviews with 5 stars are bunched together to create the real picture of what evil lurks out there.  Fathers AND mothers ARE important to our children.  To even think otherwise is to deny our humanity.  What does this author think should happen to these boys that are being raised without dads should do when they become dads and the mother decides their being a dad is not important.  what a web and circle of evil this author weaves.  If you love our children, both male and female, don't even waste a dime on this book.  Take your child out for an ice cream.  At least ice cream has value.  My copy of this book found its home in the rightful place: "The Trash" 
 This book is printed on lightweight Oak Tag.  So heavy and stiff are the pages that they broke from the binding within two minutes of trying to pry open the book. Dow's own work should have been included, not the tedious introduction.  Someone needs to do this book over properly. 
 Essentially the book is a rehash of the old creative financing techniques touted by the real estate gurus of the 1980's. And where are they now?    With the exception of some updated techniques for the Internet, the approach is the same: 1. Find people with money. 2. Find sellers who want to dump their trashy properties, then put the two together.    Since it always takes money to make money the whole scheme is dependant on your being able to find "money people".     If there is any value in the book it is that it is a much cheaper way to get this type of info than having to buy the high priced infomerical stuff.    True, there will be a few who will make their fortunes by buying fixer uppers at a discount but most copies of this book will end up with all the other "real estate riches" type books - selling for a buck or two at the used book stores 
 The addresses and phone numbers in this book are handy, but this is not the way to find an agent or publisher. Instead, visit the largest bookstore in your area and take a look at the books they sell that are in your genre. Look in the "Acknowledgments" section of each book and you are almost certain to find the names of the author's agent and the book's editor. Those are the agents and editors who are most likely to know about your subject and its chances of being published. Find those people using an online white pages or yellow pages site (anywho.com, dogpile.com, etc.) and give them a call. If they are receptive to your idea, send them a formal proposal.  I have to agree with those who have suggested that publication of a book like this by someone in the business smacks of exploitation. As one other reviewer noted, the author is an agent - call him up and see how receptive he is to you. You might as well try looking for Elvis in the supermarket. 
 Sorry, but I can still smell the odor. Plastics absorb odor. After a couple of weeks the smell permeated the whole contraption. Also, the tube/bag thing doesn't last as long as they say. I dump baking soda in with the poop every time, which seems to help. Otherwise, it's not worth the money 
 I really thought I would be able to learn about the Philadelphia Project from this book, considering the title. However, the actual project doesn't make an appearence until the last chapter. The entire book focuses on ideas that may or may not have contributed to a project that may or may not have taken place.  This book was disappoiting to an extreme. 
 It worked great the first time, but the second time it was absolutely no good. The cap seized after the second use and the whole unit turned when I tried to get the cap off. It's garbage now. I wrote to them and the answer I got was a totally different answer for the question I asked. 
 Just received this trimmer DO NOT BUY !! weak cutters and it constantly pulls at your beard what do you expect for 9 bucks!

 I bought this router and since day one I had problems in accessing the configurations through the web utility. Linksys support's suggestions didn't work. I researched the problem and noticed that a lot of other people were having issues in accessing the router configurations through the web utilitiy. I problably had a faulty router to begin with. Anyhow I send it back for a refund 
 Listen man, I have jammed to desol LIVE I'm sure MANY MORE times than the next person and I was a huge supporter of Spanish Radio too, but lets be serious...this new version is TERRIBLE!  The cover is awful and the music sounds WAY TOO COMMERCIAL!!!  Everything they went against they became...karma 
 This is a great book to read by the fireplace. After about thirty pages you can conveniently toss it IN the fireplace! This is the most boring, disorganized, pointless book I have ever read. I read it because it was recommended by Stephen King. If you want a good book, I would recommend looking elsewhere 
 I like to find an author and read all their books, not necessarily in order. I find that I get a great liking/disliking for them and decide if I will continue. I found CC's books to be good with the first FBI book I read with Dane Carver. It was good. Damsel in distress and FBI agent friend falls in love with her and they marry all live happily ever after. Then there is the one with the detective, Ben. Guess what,  he falls in love with the damsel in distress and they get married. Then there is Mac and Quinlan, both FBI agent friends of Savich/Sherlock - they too fall madly in love with the women they are protecting/investigating and get married and live happily ever after. Now I am all for a nice romantic twist in a book but it happens in EVERY one. Don't forget the MAZE where Savich and Sherlock fall in love. I did not dislike any of those books but it did get a bit mundane when I started seeing the same outline for the plot there. A lot of the same use of dialogue and words starting popping off the page at me. Just not a lot of new material to hold the interest.   HEMLOCK BAY was just too much to take. I like the characters Savich and Sherlock - they are certainly written as superagents and superparents. I even liked Lily and Simon in this one. BUT and here the big BUT, the plot! It was just too winding, too unrealistic (not even counting the unexplained supernatural things) and just too far fetched. I was disappointed with this read. Will I read more? Well I have one more of the FBI series here to finish the whole set so yes I will. I will not recommend many of them to friends. I think CC had a great thing going and just went off on a tangent as many of the best selling authors do such as Cornwell (was my favorite until the last few books become recipe plots as well), Grafton (who I had to read five to confirm they were as bad as I had thought on the first one) and Patterson (yes even the great one has some that were actual groaners).  I read a lot - a book every day and a half is what it works out to so I buy several at one time. I just found this to be a waste of my time and very depressing that a best selling author would consider this to be up to par. The recipe is now old and needs perked up. Time to change the ingredients and spice it up 
 I thought I was buying a recently written book, and was very disappointed to see this is a 1985 book I had read years ago, with a new cover and a new introduction. For this reason, I have given it only one star.  That being said, the 1985 book was a fascinating travelogue for its era. Simon Winchester visited all of the remaining territories of Great Britain, many of them obscure places such as Tristan da Cunha in the Atlantic and Boddam in the Indian Ocean, populated by people who have been more-or-less forgotten by the British government. The best chapter is on the Falklands, where the author arrived a few days before the Argentine invasion. The author's description of pre-invasion Falklands was particularly evocative, as he describes a society stuck in a 1950s time-warp where the work ethic had been lost.  Winchester makes a number of cogent points about the governance of these places. He points out that the people in France's territories directly elect members to the French legislature, yet the people of Britain's territories have no representation whatsoever, even though they are generally staunch monarchists. Also, the author emphasizes how unfair it is that people in predominantly white territories have the right to move to Britain, but those in non-white territories such as St. Helena are not permitted to move to Britain. (Apparently some reforms have occurred since the book was written in 1985.)  It would be fascinating if Simon Winchester retraced his 1985 itinerary and described how these places have changed in the last 20 years. That is the book that should have been written 
 I'll keep this short. Who ever made this film had a good idea and turned  it into something that would've never happend. Tyrants don't think their  bad and question themselves in the mirror. Who ever played Hitler played  him like an american schoolboy mimicking him during the war. Stay away from  this film 
 I have put this film off for years for no particular reason,just didn't get around to watching it until recently. I had heard plenty of good things about it & had definitely planned on buying it at some point because of all the positive reviews I'd read. I am so glad I got to catch it the other night on the IFC channel because it is truly one of the most overrated horror films ever made! Not the worst ever made but nowhere near as good as people have made it out to be. There are some good effective scenes,I do particularly think Dee Snyder did a pretty decent job as a twisted lost soul addicted to pain,torture & his love affair with death,ranting & raving about society while he plays with his victims but there still wasn't enough of that good creepy stuff to cover up how illogical the whole story was. It seemed very rushed & unfinished wich intern provides a ridiculous amount of plot holes. Most of the acting was alright but the lead Detective & his annoying partner were aweful(no grip what so ever on ther character's). In the end "STRANGELAND" felt like it was a bad rushed sequel to a better movie. This film is made out to be so much better than it is,a perfect example of how low the standards were for what passed as a good horror film in the 1990's compared to now! 
 You gotta be kidding.  This is just warp-speed flamenco music.  This Di Meola guy obviously never got anywhere in the music world, or he'd be on MTV right now.  I mean, he doesn't have the licks of Dimebag Darryl or the rhythm of Ludacriss or the astonishing musical creativity of Britney Spears.  And he wears his collars too wide.  It's just too sad when a guy who clearly needs to take some music lessons manages to clutter up the CD landscape with his untalented, unskilled diddling.  Rock on!  
 According to the description, I was expecting a lot more out of the book.  Very disappointed.  I would have returned it but I waited to long 
  There is something about "Fountainhead" that irritated and disappointed  me, so I would stop reading and come back to it again. At some point, I just gave up thinking about the philosophical aspect of the novel  and tried to enjoy it as a piece of literature. What can I say? I  understand with my mind the ideas about the purpose of human  beings to be free and follow their own unique way in pursuit of happiness  and full realization of their talents and abilities. I also find very attractive the idea of always being true to yourself and  to your trade no matter what and to never compromise your principles and never betray yourself. Yes, I  understand that completely but the main character, Howard Roark, who supposed to be a hero  and an ideal Man left me indifferent. Well, he is not a human being, really,  more like Titan (Prometheus would come to mind), but he is cold as ice. He  does not care about anybody or at least he is doing a very good job in  hiding the human emotions. The love story in the novel is repulsive and sickening. The female character, Dominique, looks like a cold frigid doll that is not able to feel love unless it goes together  with hate and domination. Why do they have to be so unhappy and make me, the reader so miserable?    The only character who I think is  very interesting, Gail Waynad - the  man who was able to learn everything he knew by himself with no help from  outside whatsoever, the man who named his beloved yacht "I Do" because he  does rule places and has a right to say so.   2.5/5  
 At least if you only watch the movie you will save yourself a lot of time, I on the other hand was not so lucky. It is often said that the book is much better than the movie but not in this case. I often found myself saying "Why am I still reading this!" I thought the book would never end. Don't waste your time if you really need to read a novel by the author then pick "A day late a Dollar Short."  
 The Corrs are good at what they do..Trad-orientated pop, but on this album, I feel that they have lost their way a little. Always difficult to follow a 'Talk On Corners', but this album is just average,at best. There are some nice tracks here like 'All the Love in the World', 'Radio' and 'Breathless' but apart from these, nothing else really rises to the challenge. Lyrical content is amatuerish with this collection and it sounds like an album that was not as lovingly nourished as the others 
 I grew up thinking Cheech and Chong movies were funny.  In retrospect they were fresh and original even if highly morally questionable.  This on the otherhand was trash.  1/3 of the words in all of the songs were F*&K or its various incarnations so the songs were kind of repetitive after awhile.  The storyline was lame.  Where was the nudity that you need.  Why didn't they achieve greatness in the end?   I am guessing the answer to all this was that they were too busy smoking from the devils horn bong.   Jack, you are so cocky you are a joy to watch but next time get someone else to write the movie.  The script was one long bong hit and that aint good 
 Simon Winchester's journey up the Yangtze river is often poetic and overruns with historical detail every eddie of the way up the river. If anything, this is an incredible historical text of China. The author's research is impeccable and undeniable. However, every word of the way through this book I couldn't help but feel a profound disappointment in what could have been, but clearly is not, one of the the most epic journeys of our time. Mr. Winchester's timing was perfect, a trip up the Yangtze before the Three Gorges dam would change it forever and as the country is experiencing a rebirth that will soon make it the largest economic superpower in the world where it is destined to stay for the next century.  Yet with all his research, all the planning, and all the help he received along the way, we're left with only a few hundred pages of text. Where are the thousands of pictures? Where are the video clips of his journey? Where is the interactive website? He mentions in the opening pages that he packed a Leica M6 camera but, at least in the paperback edition, there is not a single picture in the book. From a man who successfully sued the Defense Department over the Freedom of Information Action in order to get the Pentagon's most detailed maps of the river, I expected more. Instead, we are left with a very long-winded account of the author's journey, but not a deserving account of China's journey 
 I wouldn't recommend this book at all for one your better off going to see the movie because the book tells a whole bunch of different stories which leads you in different storis instead of just talking about the same thing the whole movie. I would just recommed seeing the movie over the book 
 It worked file with Win 2k, but as soon as I switched to Windows Xp, this device was rendered utterly useless to me - it won't shut down or eject, and windows explorer won't see it.  Grrrrrrrr .....   
 If you're the type of person who likes to read about people merely going here, there, and everywhere--without any impending danger or redeeming suspense--then this book is for you! At page 120, I got so bored, weary, and impatient for something to HAPPEN--something that would make me sit up, take notice, get interested, that I tossed my paperback into my trash can.   Nor did I find anything unique about the characters that might keep me reading--they were just typical people who went to Lourdes to get cured of their seemingly incurable diseases. They lacked animation, verve, intensity--the kind of people that make one's eyes open up wide and keep looking.  If there was at least one character whose buttocks were chronically itching and he had gone to Lourdes to palliate or erradicate the itch, that would have both amused and riveted me. But don't expect such novelty, or anything near it.   What a disappointment! In today's book market, I doubt if Mr. Wallace's books would get near the best seller lists. This book was so dull, matter of fact, encyclopedic (about Lourdes--without mixing in some suspenseful action), that I doubt if I will ever read another Irving Wallace book again.  Oh yes, the book does have one value: if you've got insomnia and you need a catalyst to drowse you off into zzzzzzz land, look no further. You've found it. Just read two to three pages and you'll be off and sleeping. 
 I bought this book based on the recommendations here; unfortunately I have to say it's been a disappointment, and I feel compelled to write my own review too. While the book is obviously well researched and rich in details, the author interferes too much in the narrative -- I am frankly not very interested in Nicholas Thomas' personal relationship with Cook and Australian history. He claims in the introduction that he wants to stay away from the hero and anti-hero biases, but the whole book is very judgmental of Cook and his crew. In trying to be politically correct in 21st-century terms, the author fails to capture the 18th-century spirit of the voyages. Indeed, he paints a dark, boring picture of Cook that doesn't coincide with the exciting contemporary reception the navigator had in the second half of the 18th century. The style is poor, with long, convoluted sentences that take re-reading to decypher. Most annoyingly, there are several typos of foreign words, which I find unacceptable for a book published by a major publisher -- it shows a lack of attention to detail. I wish I could recommend another Cook biography, but I simply don't know. I can, however, highly praise Diana Preston's newly published biography of William Dampier, _A Pirate of Exquisite Mind_ for those interested in European navigators 
 I purchased this at Target.  I only needed a light duty shredder for our home to shred credit card offers and misc. things like that. The first one I brought home was broken, the removable can was cracked and the shredder would run continuously. After returning the defective/broken one, I came home to shred.  For the first few days it was ok. It didn't shred anywhere near the purported number of sheets, even 3-4 was a bit much. I didn't worry though, I just fed it a piece at a time.  After a few weeks, the motor began to get louder. I should back up an include that I had to frequently remove the can and remove the wedged little bits of paper from the teeth.  It wouldn't quit running because of this, I just didn't like the idea of it jamming.  Anyway, the motor progressively gets louder. Then a whole new grinding metal sound appears. And a clunking. Who knew that shredders could clunk?  After calling Royal a few times (and being accused of putting foreign objects into it), I found I was going to have to drive it to the nearest service center or pay to ship it.  There was no mention of a RA or anything. Although, the last person I spoke to seemed to know exactly what the problem was and even described the sound without me doing it.  As I'll never have time to make a special run to take this in for service, it will be tossed out.  It has been replaced with a Fellowes shredde 
 I have three qualms with this book:   1. The characters become so painfully annoying over the course of it's 175 pages that, by the time the story has completely unfolded, we just don't care about what happens or might happen to them.   2. The book takes the moral highground. This is perhaps it's greatest flaw; the narrator, David, is painfully opinionated on all that surrounds him. I know this is something that can never be completely avoided in a first-person narrative, but it could have been handled with a lot more grace than what Larry Watson has done here.   3. The story is uninteresting. Not meaning to belittle Larry Watson's talent as a writer, because he certainly has a knack for descriptions of people and place, but we simply don't care about the majority of the events that unfold.   Read something else; save yourself from boredom and disconnection. 
 Do you hate the world? Do you see the glass as 1/10 empty? Do you want to commit suicide? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then read this book. It is dark, depressing, utterly awful. I have never heard so much whining in a single book in my entire life. I give it 2 thumbs down 
 Purchased this product to improve my cable signal quality. When I hooked it up the signal quality was worse than using an antenna. You will be wasting your money buying this product 
 This is an extremely weird book. At first I didn't like it. The whole novel discusses something that Burt did to Jessica. I wanted to discover what that was, so I kept reading. It's discovered that Burt and Jessica had sex, but they're only eight. Which is weird. It's not "dark" or "twisted" like it has been described to be many times. Most of the time I just skipped to the end of the paragraph because Buten goes on and on about some uninteresting, pointless perspectives that Burt has. This book should be YA. It was such an incredible waste of time 
 Increasingly, examination of our past reveals that there once was a Golden Age of mankind. Did its origins lay in some fantastic acount of ancient spaceports and alien intervention, or did man, by himself, achieve great things in his remote past? Sitchin opts for the fantastic, and reviewer Paul Stets writes, "It is not important whether Sitchin's writings are true...  (Sitchin) creates an illusion of scientific research." Is illusion or entertainment enough? To many of us truth matters. 
 Nicely drawn characters; good writing; different and compelling story. Why don't I like it, then? Because of what the author did with these things. It ends in disaster and proves nothing. Afterwards, I find that this novel lingers in the mind like a bad taste in the mouth. I wish to God I'd never read it 
 I am a hairdresser and used to better products.I would not recommend them.They don't cut the hair right,hardly at all actually.I sent mine back 
 This book was so poorly written that it was hard to follow.  In addition, the story which could have been interesting instead was turned into a big circle which went nowhere.  The characters were meaningless.The author tried so hard to pile layer upon layer of deceit that he ended up piling layer upon layer of schlock instead.  There is a reason why you've never heard of this book. Basically, I think this book was an attempt by the author to show that he had been to Poland. I'm sure the Poles were happy to see him leave 
 This book just dosent make the reader excited and thus makes reading this book a chore.  At this time all that has been said int this book has been said elsewhere in a much more interesting format 
 I had to quit reading half-way through. The man uses many  Biblical references, but most out of context and with his own personal interpretations. He claims the Bible does not teach of the Holy Trinity, yet--though the actual word "trinity" is not used in the Bible (to my knowledge)--there are many references to God being three-in-one and a mystery to us all. The author claims to answer all the questions of the universe, but seems to go round-and-round in circles and never get to the point. If you need something good to smirk at, read this Mystery of the Ages. But if you want real answers, stick to the Bible 
 I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE CAST OF THIS MOVIE DRESSED UP AS HOT DOGS AND THROWN INTO A CAGE WITH STAR JONES AND MARV ALBERT. (... 
 Its not light as advertised.  Its actually a very cumbersome broom.  I'd rather use a regular broom than this huge thing.  I would not recommend for every day use.  The bristles get bent due to the weight of it, and they don't sweep as well after a month or so 
 Unfortunately, I just finished "Wild Fire" and am sad to report that DeMille's quality is continuing the slide downward that began with "Night Fall".  Through his magnus opus "Up Country", Nelson DeMille was my favorite fiction author. But in his last two books, he's decided to weave his stories in and out of catastrophic real-life events. I frankly don't care about John Corey's posiiton on George W. Bush or when to invade Iraq...I appreciate an author who creates an entirely new universe and populates it USING HIS IMAGINATION. Just like DeMille used to do in his other novels. Shoehorning real life events into his recent books has taken priority over a strong narrative and the storytelling suffers under this neglect. It's a blatant attempt at broadening his appeal that does so at the detriment of his longtime fans' intellect.  It's also worth noting he's writing books now that run about half the number of pages his past work offered. It's been pointed out he has contractual deadlines to deliver a book every November...I personally don't feel like this is a valid justification for the startling decrease in pages and by extension, story.  Overall, it's sad to realize that the author whose work I fell in love with is no longer committed to the same level of quality he used to consistantly provide 
 THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS MOVIE IS VERY INTERESTING....DONT FALL FOR IT. THE ACTIONS DESCRIBED HAPPEN- DONT GET ME WRONG; BUT IN A PLODDING AND TALENTLESS WAY. THE SUBTITLES MOVE VERY FAST AND INTERFERES WITH YOUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY " SEE " THE MOVIE. ACTING VERY SUB PAR AND STORY NOT DISTINCTIVE ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTH RECOMMENDING TO A FRIEND OR WATCHING AGAIN 
 Big Boom said everything he had to say in the title of the book. The rest of the book looks good on the outside, but is very empty on new revelation. Poor editing, repeating statements, rambling on from tangent to tangent. Take your $23.00 and carry a little old lady to Starbucks, and get the same information, plus, you will be doing a good deed 
 Please save your money! The so called "Heroine" was so annoying I sided with the bad guy. Enough said. 
 Save your hard earned money and buy the Masterpiece Theatre version by the BBC.  It's faithful to the spirit of Balzac's novel and is extremely well done.  This version is an incoherent mess.  Someone snorted a few lines of coke before making this Eurotrash version ... 
 The author, although well intentioned and somewhat informative , produced a rather dull repetition pattern , going over each supplement in identical fashion.Important topics such as ingestion procedures/schedules and  ortomolecular deficiency exams are overlooked.Struggled to get to the  end...... 
 reviews are off the top of head throwaways...and you'll be disgusted to find that METALLICA and NINE INCH NAILS have no entries. go look! unbelievable 
 This novel is neither a love story nor a story about Titanic. Don't be misled if that's why you want to read this story. What it is, is the tale of a 12 year old boy struggling with the confusing and conflicting feelings which the onset of puberty brings. Unfortunately, this is a poor choice of narrator for a tale of the tragic ship. Sumner Jordan, is so wrapped up in his own feelings and fantasy love story, the object of his affection is a 21 year-old suffragist, that he is neither observant about his surroundings, nor perceptive about the feelings of the famous and fictional characters he meets. Worse, he complains about everything. So much so that when he is going through his crises, instead of feeling sympathy, you just wish he'd deal with it and keep quiet. Sumner is also hard to believe as a 12 year-old boy. Especially at the beginning of the book, the voice is more that of a girl.  A major problem with the story is the lack of character development. You never get to know enough about any of the characters to really care about their fates. During the sinking, the life and death decisions are made so quickly, little suspense is generated. If you collect Titanic literature, by all means, add this to your collection. If you are looking for greater insight into the disaster, look somewhere else 
 I have cracked heals and a bit of a callous problem.  They aren't dragon feet, but they do have to be softened pretty often.  I have used the little blade scraper tool for a few years and that works well but when I saw the Artemis Heel Smoother advertised, I decided I had to try it.  It's a waste of money.  The appliance is no more than a low-tech dreml.  In fact, I have a Dreml type tool that was marketed as a dog nail trimmer that works better.  The Artemis appliance does NOT scrape any dried skin away..it merely sands your foot a bit..that is when you can get the darn thing to stay on the spot you put it on.  It comes with a small container of foot conditioning balm that is probably just straight cocoa butter except it has a really offensive aroma.  I would just as soon use a piece of sand paper than this thing.  Save your money.  
 Just to be nice im going to give it 2 stars but the only song i really liked off the album was Show Stopper 
 I like Susana Palazuelos, I enjoyed her meal at Izote in Mexico City...and have used her recipes, but I have no idea what she was doing for this book.  In my opinion, this was done when her vision was still quite immature.  My main complaint about her recipes is that they are completely Creole Revisionist... in other words they are done from a very Spanish / Euro perspective... the Herb, Chile & Spice combinations have been extremely simplified & you really do not get to understand & appreciate the true genius of Mexican Cuisine.  Its like a Spaniard revised all the recipes.  Truly dissappointing.... it should be embarrassing to here that Rick Bayless's books are a bit closer than this one 
 It was ok.  I strongly dislike the character that has an empathy for machines.  Just ridiculous.  And he was one of the cruxes of the story!  Brian Lumley's other works (Fruiting Bodies) is far superior 
 Let me start by saying that I would have given this book zero stars if I could.  The reviews I've read are all true.  This book is boring, extremely repetitive and a waste of time.  The only reason I finished it was because I paid for it.  I truly believe that Danielle Steel has lost her gift of writing.  She has not published a good book in a long time.  I also think that she's lost her editor, because to me, a good editor wouldn't let books like this be printed.  This story pretty much follows stories she's done before except it's told from the guy's point of view.  There's the rich guy, Charlie, who can't seem to find the "perfect" girl to marry.  He finds a flaw with every one he dates.  He lost his parents at a young age, his sister left school to raise him, and just before he graduated college, she died of a brain tumor.  So of course he's afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him.  Then there's rich Adam, whose wife left him and took their two children with her.  It was a bitter divorce, so he has no desire to ever marry again.  He dates girls half his age and never stays with one long.  His parents blame him for the divorce.  Every time he visits them, his mother let's him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family.  The last of the trio is Gary, a struggling artist.  He has no desire to ever marry or date.  The three men spend the month of August each year on Charlie's yacht, partying and going on and on about how they don't want commitments.  Well of course, each one meets someone, they start to date, they argue, they break up, they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after.  Same old story.  Danielle Steel should stop writing.  You can't tell me she doesn't have enough money to live on.  I for one will not read any more of her books, even a paperback, and I won't even bother renting them from the library.  I won't waste my time having to check the book out and worrying about getting it back on time.  There are better authors available and I'm going to read them 
 After book 4 the series begins to meander around.  Characters are constantly side-tracked into meaningless, boring tasks.  The first 200-300 pages of this book are basically a re-hash of the previous books only excitement (Rand's capture and escape from the "bad witches") seen from different characters perspectives.  This is an example of what writing becomes when the author obviously has no idea of where the story is going, and there obviously is little or no editing.  The author must being paid by the word count and not the content.  The story seems to get written into little boxes, and has to be written back on track again and again.  I no longer have the patience to actually read each page.  I find myself skimming through to find some useful information or a single point of action.  The characters have also stalled out with Rand spending most of his time talking to him-self while the world goes to hell.  His big secret plan to quickly deal with one of the forsaken (started in the previous book) continues to drag on and on and on.....  This series had a good basic story.  Unfortunately you have to wade through crap to try and find it.  I'm beginning to wonder if the series will ever end 
 Let me just start by saying this gun is terrible. The images are misleading; the gun looks to be of a shiny more durable plastic, but it is a dull black. And it smells really badly at first. Not once did the gun shoot over 100 fps, and is sold at 300. My friends didn't even notice being shot. I have a 300 fps pistol, it leaves welts through jeans. This ISNT 300 fps. It's a rifle fit for an infant who's been dropped on their head and thinks it's good. never even shot farther than 80+ feet. bad buy 
 His imagination of progress exceeds the reality of need.Does he want humans to become immortal without considering overpopulation? Does he truely believe evolution has momentum-as he states? Why doesn't he cite any biological philosophers(i.e.Dennet) rather than 17th century truism of Kant? His knowledge of comtemporary genetics and evolution is remarkably naive.This is a classic case of a writer caught up in the exciting world of computer,nanos and "superintelligence" without sufficient knowledge comtemporary genetic and living neurulogical systems.Men such as Feyman and Hofstadter admit they do not know the meaning of "superintelligence". As a scientist, I realize that concepts of future possilities and progress of knowledge is essential.However, such concepts must be accurately based on comtemporary knowledge or the writing,such as this book, becomes science fiction. 
 This was my first time to ever attempt using a software program to file my taxes. TurboTax sounded easy enough. And it was pretty easy at first. The software interviewed me in an efficent manner and saved all of my information. But the final tax forms I needed to file with were not included on the CD-ROM package. TurboTax instructed me to get them by using "one-click update." Well after I update and attempt to restart the software, TurboTax refuses to come up at all. I can't speak for this software on Windows machines. But if you are using Mac OS X, I suggest you explore other options first 
 A friend of mine told me that this was a great cd. Now i do like they might be giants but this is crude compaired to Flood or Lincon. Which were much better     Only about 3 song are any good. Skip this one and get Floo 
 Other reviewers who detail the silly political-correctness and faux-politics are right... This is Clancy-for-dummies.  Ford's Jack Ryan was sometimes a step behind, but in a believable way.  The audience was right beside Ryan, and when he put 2 and 2 together and took action, boy, did he take action.  Ben Affleck's Jack Ryan is terminally lost, pouting and confused while the audience waits for him to figure things out and do something productive (or at least interesting?).  This is going to go down as the "Star Wars Prequel" of Clancy movies--the one you try to forget exists as part of the saga you love. 
 This book is the worst sort of tripe. I have have no problem with true historical fiction, where one takes the *known facts* and expands upon them by imagining what else the main characters might have felt or said. I also love to get additional context and perspective to help illuminate and amplify key points of a story.  But that's a far cry changing facts entirely. It's particularly annoying when it comes to rewriting scripture. For example, in the story of the about-to-be-stoned-adultress, where Jesus says, "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone." the author of this book starts with a long introduction suggesting that the woman was single, was tricked by a married man who told her he loved her, that the man was paid by the Pharisees to convince her of his love and to seduce her, and that she didn't even know he was married.  Good grief! To what end? That's ridiculous. If you want to emphasize the gross unfairness toward women (vs. men) in a given situation in that culture, speculate away on what an adultress and the other characters would say and think. No need to change the facts to try and make the woman a more sympathetic figure.  And, please, please, please, do not write every story in the voice and style of a second-rate romance novelist. Ugh. To the recycle bin with this book 
 This book is a mediocre source for preparing for the PMP. It contains too many errors, inaccurate information and it is loaded with irrelevant information for the pmp test. if you do not want to pass the pmp test then read this book 
 Robins' whole presentation is distressing, and in a word, untenable.  No  one has yet written the definitive text on phase noise, although most  aspects have been documented in the professional literature over the years.   As a veteran with over 40 years of experience in the subject, I found  Robins' mathematical development ineffective, the style exhausting, and the  conclusions generally obscure.  He overworks drawing general inferences  from specific or oversimplified examples.  Many important topics concerning  phase noise theory and practice are either missing or shallow in substance.   My suggestion is, if you want to understand phase noise, first consult a  good text on modulation theory (there are many of them), and then search  the Web for articles on phase noise (and allied subjects).

 Although the script was written in the mid-1980s, "Bob Roberts" doesn't feel dated. Instead it feels like it was written today about the current state of American politics. The title character, Bob, is a conservative folk singer who runs for the U.S. Senate, but the cynical political machinations easily belong to politicians of any stripe. What struck me after watching this movie was how easily lead and deluded we are as citizens. While I thought that the message of the movie was right on target, I didn't care as much for the mock documentary style of the film. It kept me at a distance from the characters and, as a result, I didn't care as much about them as I might have done 
 I was asked if Umberto Eco was as much a pompous windbag in Foucault's Pendulum as he was in his other novels and responded:  I would say his novels are aimed squarely at the purveyors of pretension. When I was reading Foucault's Pendulum I got the same "pompous windbag" impression and concluded that I could have photocopied vast sections of the the Necronomican of Abdul Al-Hazred and the Yog-Sothoth just as easily and pasted together my own book by following the Dungeons and Dragons Rule Book. But don't listen to me -- I have never been that impressed with Eco, especially as a novelist -- Hamlet said it best: "Words, Words, Words" or was it "very like a whale"? I suspect Eco was just trying to sound as erudite as Joyce (or at least Professor Irwin Corey). However, Foucault's Pendulum might well be his greatest work since no novel he has written since has been as well received.  I did peek at the sales figures for this novel but they have been suspiciously hidden away in a monastery in the Apennines and the only hint I got was the mention of the bump Eco's sales received with the popularity of The Da Vinci Code. Interestingly, someone asked why Eco didn't sue Brown for plagiarism; a better question might be why the authors of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail didn't sue Eco ... And the answer of course is, follow the money.  But rest assured, despite having attempted to read this pile and given up in disgust, I will give it a generous rating -- 2 stars. Suffice it to say, however, that Foucault's Pendulum had more in common with The Da Vinci Code than just the arcane historical mystery.  I'll be traveling back to New Jersey next week and will be able to visit the large dent in the wall of my office where the parabolic arc of this novel met with the obstinacy of lath and plaster.  But let's be a little fair about this and realize the Foucault's Pendulum, when compared to the other airport gift-shop thrillers, is certainly adequate to cover the time taken for a trans-oceanic flight, whether it keeps you awake or not. Although if they are showing Raiders of the Lost Ark .. 
 I have had to un-install and reinstall three times and it still won't update on a very current Windows XP version. I hate how hard it is to download from my bank and it never recognizes the stuff anyway so I have to go through line by line and create aliases. I like Quicken better but the accountant can't figure out how to import Quicken into his Quickbooks Pro so here it is. Hate it, hard as ever not easier, the whole thing takes way too long to work with. Reports are a bit easier which is good or I would have tossed it out the window and bought Microsoft Money 
 Caroline Sinavaiana-Gabbard, Alchemies of Distance (Subpress, 2001)  I am sure there are readers out there who squeal with delight every time they pick up a book, open it, and find "America" spelled with a k. Well, folks, flock to this book, because you'll find it in abundance here. Keep the question in the back of your mind, though, why a poet-- someone who understands and communicates primarily through the written word, would feel that willful misspellings are both warranted to get across the message, and more important than communicating in such a way as to reach the greatest number of readers with the greatest understanding possible.  Ms. Sinavaiana-Gabbard's critiques of modern American culture are more than apparent without the willful misspelling. In fact, you'll be hard-pressed to find someone who reads this book and doesn't get the point. That, ultimately, is its biggest problem-- as with so many below-average books of so-called poetry, the message so often overrides the medium that the book becomes not poetry, but political screed broken up into short lines to make it look artistic. This is nothing new, and it's not overly shocking. What makes it all the more depressing in this case is twofold. First, Ms. Sinavaiana-Gabbard's introduction to the poems makes it obvious that she is exceptionally well-read in many different schools of poetry, and the lines she has chosen to quote from others to reflect different settings and feelings that drove her to write these poems makes it equally clear that her ear for poetry is far better than the voice she displays here; she knows how to recognize a great poem when someone else writes one, but falls very short in her own efforts time after time after time. The second thing is that when the hammer does hit the nail on the head, it drives it through the two by four and out the other side. Caroline Sinavaiana-Gabbard has written some astounding material here. For the most part, the images are washed away, quickly to be forgotten, by the political ranting, falling here and there in the screed like gold nuggets in the Colorado River. But the book's very last poem, "Pilgrimage," a haiku cycle, is like panning for those nuggets and suddenly discovering a solid-gold cast of Shelley's famous statue of Ozymandias. It's as close to perfect as some poets will ever get, closer than most. It is precise, observant, and profound, and it is a shining example of what this poet can do when she sets her mind to writing poetry. Worse, there's obviously a political message to be had from the poem, and like all great poems, "Pilgrimage" allows the images to speak, and lets the reader glean what's between the lines for himself.  Given "Pilgrimage," the rest of the book looks that much shabbier. Better to have left it out altogether and present a less-than-mediocre collection than to put it in and show what could have been. *  
 Terrible ergonomics ... thumb button that's too far forward, and a "pinky" button (or thumb for a leftie) that is unusable. NO tilt-scrolling! That's right, no 4-way scroll wheel. It has the same shape as the Comfort Mouse 3000, which I like ... so for $20 or more less, get the Comfort Mouse 3000.   Trust me ... search for the Wireless Laser Mouse 5000. Nice shape, also for left- and right-handed users, 4-way scrolling, same high resolution laser technology, same sleek black look, and larger, better placed side buttons.   Microsoft missed the mark with this loser. Don't even bother with it. If I could give it ZERO stars, I would - simply because Microsoft offers better wired mouses for less, and better wireless mouses for the same price. 
      This book is definetly not for begginers. It has a lot of technical information that is virtually useless to to the begginer and average pet owner. I'm sure I would give it a 5 star rating if I were a breeder, but I'm not. Save your money and look for another book if you are a begginer to keeping Bettas 
 These cords were not produced by Apple.  The packaging states they are SF Planet.  The cord will not work on an older computer it totally blanks it out everytime we plug it in.  It does work on the new laptop, but it seems to slow it down a bit.  
 The foundation of success in a horror story is a strong, original beginning.  The author must grab your attention and earn your suspension of disbelief.  Dean Koontz failed to make this upfront investment in The Taking.  The story caroms off of a long series of hackneyed horror elements - stormy night, body snatchers, magic mirrors, ghouls, and (Koontz's favorite) Delphic dogs - before settling down with a very modest storyline about a non-denominational rapture.    Koontz can usually be counted on to deliver some pleasant thrills or humor if not the chills of real horror.  But The Taking provides no such return 
 My son received "The Mummy's Gold" as a present for his 6th birthday, and he played with it exclusively for around 24 hours before even looking at his other presents.  For a solid week, he visited with the mummy every day when he came home from kindergarten.  As completely, unapologetically uneducational as it is, I can see the charm of a toy that shouts "Who dares wake the Mummy?" and "I've got you now!" and "You've been mummified!" when a car rolls over an activating switch.  If I had had a toy like this when I was a kid, I would probably still be telling my friends, "You've been mummified."  Trouble is, there really is no game to play, no challenge, and the activator switch on the mummy's head broke a week after we got it.  One month later, my son doesn't even look at the toy.  So I give it an overall rating of three stars 
 This is a load of crap, don't even bother reading this one. Obviously he was one of the intelligence community that was listened to and relied upon heavily by this Administration. And I'm assuming Hussein is connected to all of his B.S. too! I bet the war hawks and war mongers loved this one!  At least the intelligence community let him print this one. I'll give him that much.. 
 An admirable trait of our challenged species is that we suffer in silence a lot. And it's sad when a person once devoted to ameliorating this suffering concludes not that they've done their best and the job was too big, but that all along they were wrong. Possibly, it was Ronald Radosh's being brought up in bourgeois "red diapers" by loving parents that instilled a softer commitment to communist ideals than others' fiercer commitments, instilled differently.   If such a thing can be, Radosh's book "Commies" is kind of a (Whittaker Chambers') "Witness" lite. And thank god for that, because books of ex-newleft communists' expiations run to the superficial, egomaniacal and infantile stinky. The lite-er the better, I say. American flag-wavers will love this book. Many if not most others will find it superficial, egomaniacal and infantile stinky, as I did. But I give it one star for the lite.  Consider. Radosh writes on p151 of the "Commies" paperback edition I read, that since he was "a historian" when the government released the FBI's Rosenberg files, he figured he was "the perfect person to undertake a serious effort to examine them and write a book." But just two pages later he demonstrates an inattention to his own factual narrative that would embarrass an undergraduate history major. In the second paragraph on p153, Radosh writes that what "stunned" him reading the FBI files was that the bureau's prison informant (who presumably had talked only to Julius Rosenberg) confirmed a story previously told to Radosh by Jim Weinstein about how he (Weinstein) "had (driven) Julius...from Ithaca to New York." Further on in that very paragraph, however, Radosh elaborates on what the informant told the FBI and comments on it, "(the informant)...told the FBI (that a communist party recruit, Max Finestone) had borrowed (Jim Weinstein's car) to drive Julius to Ithaca.....This of course is precisely what Jim Weinstein had related to me." No, not even close to "precisely," Ronald Radosh. The drivers and the destinations differed in the two versions of the story.   The explanation for these inconsistencies is probably trivial especially if one believes the Rosenberg case itself was fairly trivial, beyond the personal tragedies involved. But in his book, Radosh makes a lot out of his Rosenberg case research as disenchanting him with the left in general. And his failure to even notice two glaring inconsistencies in one short paragraph in "Commies" - about what he says had stunned him in his Rosenberg case research -- reduces his claim to be "a historian" to plain silliness.   On the next-to-last page of the book, Radosh muses: "Our history should have been a cautionary tale, but as the causes of yesteryear collapsed, my old friends found it hard to reevaluate their experiences or acknowledge that they were wrong." Not true again, Ronald Radosh. And especially not true of the cause you say finally convinced you that left politics were wrong - the New Left's opposition to Ronald Reagan's promotion of the Nicaragua-San Salvador war of unprecedented murderousness and devastation, ultimately funded illegally and in secret by him with Iranian arms money.  The New Left's opposition to Reagan's funding and furthering murder and torture in the war, you write, was wrong because Daniel Ortega was insensitive to personal freedoms in Nicaragua. How grotesque.   No, your old lefty friends were not wrong, Ronald Radosh. On the contrary, although as prone to overzealousness and impatience as to long and debilitating periods of quiescence, lefties have never been wrong. We've just always had trouble with the timing 
 Never seen a worse, less intuitive, inconvenient to use and worsely documented software that iTunes. Apples is up to it's usual standard. That's precisely why I prefer not to mess with it 
 It's pretty rich for Pat to write a book about the ten commandments when he doesn't even follow them himself. Last time I checked, "Thou shall not murder" was one of the big ten. 
 Readers interested in Benny Morris should read Israeli historian Yehoshua Porath's "War and Remembrance" in the summer 2002 issue of Azure. Porath adds to the Oct. 1995 and April 1990 discussions by Robert Satloff and Shabtai Teveth in Middle Eastern Studies and to Efraim Karsh's  excellent book, Fabricating Israeli History. Don't read this book without looking at these critiques.   Why? Morris et al tell readers they have written "new" history of Israel, considering the entire previous historical record as if it were solely propaganda for the Zionist cause. Here, Morris considers Jewish conduct in the 1947 and 1948, and why the Arabs fled.   Morris claims to be the first person to have looked at Israeli archives on the Dalet Plan, a plan to move populations in certain areas. Nevertheless, other scholars show that Morris and his peers in this book misrepresent themselves and the facts.   Firstly, Yigael Alon and Israel Galili, in The Book of the Palmah, gave Walid Khalidi material to argue in 1959 that the Dalet Plan was "the master plan of the Zionists" to expell Palestinians wholesale. Furthermore, the 1973 History of the Hagana (by Uri Millstein) included the entire Dalet Plan text. Official or not, these 1959 and 1973 Israeli Jewish histories, very shortly after the the 1948 war, did not hide what happened, as Morris claims here.  Morris also writes that Arab government archives were closed to his research and and to other historians writing on the Israeli-Arab conflict before him. He writes that he relied on Israeli and Western archives. But Porath, Karsh, Satloff and Teveth all show that this is not the case.   Furthermore, Morris did no research at the Hagannah archives or those of the IDF, a fact underlined by Efraim Karsh in 2002, and one which he admits in a more recent book (The War for Palestine). Morris now writes that in the mid 1980s both those archives were closed to all researchers after all. He writes, he was limited to few first-hand military materials, indicating that there is no "new" research here at all.   Morris' charge that Israel carried out a deliberate and systematic expulsion of the Palestinian Arabs isn't even remotely substantiated by extensive research done since the mid 1980s. On the contrary, Morris takes material very selectively, from Israeli archive fringes and makes what Porath terms "outrageoulsy false claims"-- that Israel's victory resulted from "an imperialist conspiracy or an overwhelming advantage in manpower and arms."   Indeed, Morris writes here that Arabs left Israel because of many factors, their departure was not the fault of the Jewish people alone. Then, he contradicts himself, giving those who hate Israel grounds to blame Israel for the exodus, without considering the other circumstances.   This book also details a so-called "massacre" in 1948 of Arabs at the village of Deir Yassin, but not enough to mention that the incident was actually a battle--in which most Arabs killed (like those in Jenin in March and April 2002) were armed.   Finally, Morris does not note (by comparison) other massacres in 1948--of Jews, by Arabs. On December 30, 1947, for example, Arabs murdered some 50 Jewish co-workers at the Haifa refinery. On April 13, 1948, they massacred over 80 Jewish doctors, nurses and Hebrew University workers on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem.   Additionally, nearly all of the 131 people who surrendered at the Etzion Bloc were also murdered by Palestinian Arabs. Only two survived.  These latter Arab massacres of Jews do not fit the blame that Morris seeks to lay at Jewish feet. Nor does the fact that Jews did not afterwards flee, as occurred on the Arab side following the battle at Deir Yassin. So Morris omits them.   I also find it disturbing that the book nowhere mentions the equal refugee claim of 1 million Jewish refugees from 22 Arab nations, who were expelled with nothing but the shirts on their backs, and rebuilt their lives in Israel, the U.S., and Europe.   The number of Jewish refugees was actually larger than that of Arab refugees (counting only those who fled, not their descendants). Honest history would have noted these parallels as well as the entire context of the war.   --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 Hugh Farnham is a blue-collar survivalist who likes to play Bridge.  His college-age daughter Karen, her friend Barbara, his lawyer son Duke, his alcoholic wife Grace, and house servant Joe are playing cards at his house the night the bombs hit.  Everyone scrambles to safety inside Hugh's modern bomb shelter.  As the bombs fall and his wife is passed out, Hugh starts up an affair with his daughter's friend Barbara, right in the shelter.  As if Hugh's shallowness and arrogance wasn't enough to turn you against the protagonist, this nauseating little scene will.  When the shakes and quakes finally end, the family pours from the shelter to find themselves in an impossible, pristine, clean world.  At first glance, it looks like utopia, but then as they settle into a rustic lifestyle they are suddenly set upon by an advanced race, imprisoned, and brought into a vastly different culture as slaves.  Somehow, Hugh needs to find a way to break free of the civilization they are trapped in, so that he can be free with Barbara.  Of all the Apocalypse Fiction, this book is the worst.  The protagonist is so lowbrow, so arrogant, so unlikable, so self-centered, so shallow, so immoral that he simply cannot capture any interest.  He's not even a "love to hate" person.  The dialogue is flatly emotionless and yet irritatingly flippant, and Barbara and Hugh's constant prattlings of "Darling, Dear, and Beloved" do not fit the characters.  Neither does Hugh's occasional spouting of words like "shall" and "shan't" along with racial diatribes that include heavy use of the "N" word.  There is little emotion from these one-dimensional characters even though they face the death of Hugh's daughter and Barbara's friend Karen, cannibalism, castration (Hugh cared more about his "boys" than he did his real children), pedophilia, racism, and $exual slavery, they show no more feeling than they would biting into a doughnut.  The entire plot-over-plot had a contrived and vapid feeling to it, as if the author himself didn't quite believe his story.  And if he doesn't believe, how can he expect the reader to?  Overall, there is no depth or flavor in this story at all, other than the ugly aftertaste of a musty trailer park visit in the dusty twilight, as old men drink cheap stinking whiskey and the wind blows over the city dump next door.  I recommend avoiding this book. 
 the dvd came in a timely manner, packaged well and I have had no problems with the item. It seems to be in great condition 
 It took a few hours to learn how to download the latest firm ware for the router and n-draft adapter (both from d-link).  The wired connections worked great.    The wireless conections worked fine for the B (add-on D-link notebook adapter) and G (built-in adapter) laptops, but the other 2 laptops that had the N-draft adapters would not work.  One n-draft adapter was from dell in a brand-new 1505, the other n-draft adapter was from DLINK.   Scary that the dlink adapter would not connect to the dlink router.  Even with all of the security disabled, the N-draft adapters would not connect to the router.  With security enabled, and taking all of the right steps to set it up, nothing would connect to the router.  It refused to recognize the security key.  After being on hold for an hour, Dlink tried to help me.  They gave me about 20 minutes of support before dropping the call.  Basically, they gave up and said that I should return it.   Three weeks ago, I mailed the items to Amazon.  It was well within the 30 day window from the date of purchase.  I am still waiting for a refund.  Why does it take so long?    Obviously, I can not give this product a good review.  Between the headache of dlink, and the slow response for my refund, this has been a miserable experience.  Dell tech support recommends the Netgear N-draft router.  Once Amazon refunds me my money, that's what I'll buy 
 These CliC glasses are a great idea... I first saw them on CSI-NY, and sought them out, but they are not made big enough... they worked fine as long as I was looking down, but as soon as I turned my head level, or looking up, the glasses would "pop" apart.  I had purchased two pair, and returned them both 
 "Ready for Anything" is a pointless book full of information and ideas that anyone who went through school should already know. I learned a long time ago to write things down instead of keeping them in my head and I also know that being organized gives me more flexibility and less stress so why would I want to read a book in which Allen writes about basic concepts in a philosophical way. Yeah this book might be good for someone who didn't pick up on these basic skills in Middle school but for me it was a waste of my time which I'm sure Allen would agree is not a good use of my skills.  Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this book because maybe then you will open yourself up to more time for "creativity" which is the point of the book in the first place 
 This is the sixth book in the Left Behind series. It is also the first one in the series I did not finish in one sitting. It did not flow as well as the others, so as to lend itself to a complete reading in one evening. The book also spends a lot of time re-telling what we read in previous books. I felt this time like I read half a novel.  The book starts in the thirty-eighth month into the tribulation. But most of the characters seem a little too self serving in this book. Allowing their own desires to guide their actions. Whether that desire be derived from rage, revenge, self pity, or even guilt. Rayford spends most of his time focusing on Hattie or his desire to kill the Anti-Christ. Though I do like the description of the handgun that Rayford procures. And when the time comes for the assassination, there are a few characters to chose from.   The book ends in an old time cliff hanger where you are left guessing who it is that assassinated the Anti-Christ. Stay tuned for the next volume. I have read this far, so I will finish the series. Though most people my find this book suspensful, I did not 
 I read this book in '03 and it was one of the early PB editions. So perhaps some of the glaring mistakes have been corrected.  First off ALL through the book the word "lose" is misspelled "loose". A glaring oversight and highly annoying. There are a lot other typos as well. Sentences that do not make any coherent sense such as on page 83...the bracketed blurb says "Making unhealthy acts the enemy"...what?! And the CONSTANT and repetive use of excalmation points is almost hysterical. Didn't ANYONE edit this book? Tell her that repetive use of !!!'s is horrible writing and immature? God I would say that every other sentence ended in an ! and sometimes a !!. Silly. Perhaps with the newer editon these glaring errors have been edited out by someone competent.  But really even with corrections the book is of not much use. She rambles way to much on her "tragic" life. Really, it's called a divorce...it's not tragedy...lose the drama. I believe she thinks since she lost so much weight that in some way this qualifies her to give motivation and diet advice. Not in any way. She obviously thinks she's a great motivator but her ideas, thoughts and such on that matter are lackluster and nothing anyone who hasn't read at least 3 diet books hasn't heard ad nauseum.  This book reads like someone down the street wrote it and then printed it out..and handed it out. She can't write nor express herself in any commanding, articulate or interesting way. She really doesn't "say" a whole lot. The cover seems to promise some great motivation and or story and it just doesn't deliver.  And one part I found just a tad hard to believe is where she talks about when she was a newborn. She doubled her weight in the FIRST week? Get real. So she was 14 or so pounds at a week old. Yea I buy that one. Also she said her dad didn't know you have to dilute the formula? What? Since when? Perhaps things were different in the 60's but now no way do you dilute it. That's what they do in 3rd world countries and it causes major malutrition and growth stunting.   The whole book just was horrible and if you have any reading sensibilty or intelligence you will look elsewhere. It's another case of someone losing weight and then thinking they have some mindblowing advice to impart 
 I love Ray Charles when Ray's doing Ray.  This was terrible.  Ray was out of tune, out of touch and the song selection was ridiculous.  I'm sorry Ray, I love you.  It's a shame this had to be one of your last CD's 
 I was expecting much more from Martha!! I wonder if she evens knows what this planner has (or actually, doesnt have) in it! I would not recommend purchasing this. Definitely go to a book store and preview the planner before purchasing. The only things I like about it are that its full sized with a lot of places to store misc. papers and the advice that comes with it. But, I subsrube to MS weddings, put the advice in there. I like the Simple Stunning wedding planner much better. I felt the MS Planner was a whole lot of nothing. 
 "To Rescue a Rogue", Jo Beverly's Rogue finale, has a promising beginning, with Lady Mara St. Bride showing her spunk in extricating herself from a potentially ruinious situation and enlisting Lord Darius "Dare" Debenham's help.   He discretely cleans her up, and suddenly, she determines that she loves Dare  and always has.  Alas, he sees her in a sisterly way ... though her cleavage impresses him.  But wait! he loves her, too!  Melodramatic conflict arises in Dare's attempts to conquer his opium addiction and be worthy of her love, and how she pines for him.  Rather than her own strength of character, Mara attributes her legendary Black Ademar St. Bride hair as the explanation for her grit.  Meanwhile all the Rogues swirl around and Mara is suitably impressed.  Can they rescue Dare from Society's censure?  Will Mara and Dare ever marry?  Will Mara ever stop whining?  And what about her tonnish stalker who attempts to rescue Mara from Dare's overly public kiss?  Sadly, I found myself rooting for the stalker.  Beverly is an otherwise excellent writer, but with this one she fell short.  
 This book attempts to call the reader to a compassion that Campolo feels is lacking in the 20th centurty church.  What it does is call Christians to a liberal legalism.  While there are a few issues he gets right, the vast  majority he does not.  For example he advocates for "celebate  homosexuals" to live together in a sort of plutonic harmony.   Campolo  doesn't seem to feel this would give occasion to sin (he does comdemn the  homosexual lifestyle -- yet not as much as say, a Christian owning a BMW).   Or if he does he simply ignores the issue altogether 
  Island of the blue dolphin written by Scott O'dell,was a great book. I recomend this book to 5th grade and up, dew to the books hard vocabulary. I like this book because of the exitement, adventures, and drama of karanas life on the island alone.Island of the blue dolphin is for people who like to read about survivle and adventure.I dont think people who only like to read about comedys mysteries shouldent read the book.   Island of the blue dolphinis about a girl who gets stuck on an island by herselfand learns how to survie and has a big adventure on the way. The main charcter of this story is karana. Karanas village was fleeing the island, but her brother forgot his spear and ran back.the ship left ,and karana threw her self out the boat to be with her brother. Shortly after,Karanas brother was killed by wiled dogs.Karana is now on the island alone.   
  In the bokk Space Station Seventh grade by Jerry Spinelli a kid named jason wants to build a space station.Ididnt really like this book because the author made the main idea hard to present.I thought that the author jumped around from one subject to another.For example one chapter was talking about football then the next was about halloween.The author focuses on other subjects and doesn't realizes theres not enought infiormation about the main idea  
 Someone earlier had complained that this lense was suggested to them by amazon and it was the wrong size.  Well, that person isn't alone.  The camera I purchased is a Canon S2is, which I love.  The lense doesn't fit it.  I even bought the hood/lense adapter set and it STILL doesn't fit.  This simply is NOT the right lense for a Canon S2is, no matter what Amazon suggests.  Now, too much time has passed for me to return the lense.  I'm stuck with it, and I don't like that 
 As a Muslim woman who covers herself, or is "veiled," we are in no need to find the truth -- we have the truth and that is Islam.   I don't know why others are so hellbent on trying to convert those who follow the fastest growing religion in the world. Maybe because the authors and Sara the dreamer, are insecure with their own faith.   Nowhere in Islam does it encourage forcing religion down someone's throat, yet in Christianity, you can't find a place without some missionary forcing food and the Bible on some child in a hungry city in Bangladesh.   It's actually quite sad when you have no faith of your own and thus prove it by using all your energy to try to change others. Why don't the authors use their energy to become better Christians and leave Muslims alone?  I work with Christians and Jews, agnostics, and atheists and I have never had a problem. No one has tried to convert me, nor have I tried to convert anyone. I show my religion by my actions and vice versa.   Many good people I know are Christians, please stop making them look bad. 
 I bought this fountain because it is advertised to hold 6L / 216 oz.  It does not.  This fountain, when filled per the manufacturer's recommendations to 1/2 inch below the rim, only holds ~160 oz.  In this state, it is still possible to move it from the sink to the floor with minimal spilling.  If you fill it on the floor, and fill it to the very rim (including the clear reservoir and the top fountain reservoir), the fountain maxes out at ~190 oz, anymore and it promptly spills over the edge.  That's only ~5 L.  I called this to Petmate's attention, who did nothing... I even offered to send them a video demonstrating this and they ignored it.  If you buy this thinking it holds what they say, be forewarned that it does not 
 A Recipe for Bees reminded me a lot of the novel Vinegar Hill. In both stories, a wife is living in a dark, unpleasant home environment. In A Recipe for Bees, Augusta, an older lady, approaching the end of her life, reflects back upon her childhood and her marriage. Her mother dies at a young age, leaving her alone with an unaffectionate father. When she meets Karl and they become married, Augusta moves from one unaffectionate household to another. Living at Karl's father's farm, Augusta is only subject to more withholding of affection and is living a dark and depressing life. The rest of the novel delves into Augusta's search for independence and what she chooses to make of her life. The story takes us down journeys of the ups and downs of marriage, being a misfit in the community, and mother/daughter relationships. The main problem reading it, is that I couldn't find it in me to like the main character, Augusta. I also felt that the story left the reader with a depressed feeling of what marriage is like.  The weaving of the "bee" theme added a nice touch to the story, but if you're looking for a great read with a "bee" them, try The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd. The writing in A Recipe for Bees was good, but I felt the story was lacking something 
 I am convinced you have to be one of three things to enjoy this film: male, born before 1935, or a huge Monroe fan smitten with anything she ever put out. Marilyn is so annoying in this I wanted to smack her, and Tom Ewell's character is equally a jerk. I am not sure why this movie was supposed to be funny. Is adultery funny? Not really. I don't mean to sound so conservative, in fact I'm quite the opposite, I'm pretty liberal, which may be why this movie bothered me so much. It is very sexist and dated and Monroe's usual portray of the harmless, stupid, breathy blonde bimbo so eager to please isn't very empowering to young women. The character she portrays has no name, is simply titled 'The Girl' a female puppet manufactured for pleasure. The jokes are dated and fall flat, no longer funny to modern society. I think 'The Seven Year Itch' is one of the most overrated 'classics' ever but what can I say, my 84 year-old grandmother enjoyed it. Maybe she was just nostalgic for the '50s. A much better Monroe comedy is 'Some Like It Hot' where she is less annoying and the humor still resonates to this day 
 I had high hopes for this, expecting a bigger dose of Maureen's refreshing liberal arguments and interesting points.  No such luck.  It's hard to start the analysis considering how she jumps from point to point throughout the book and throughout each chapter.  You'd think the title might give it focus, but that very question doesn't even come up until the mid-point of the book (about where I am now; not sure I have the will to finish), and her wittest method of answering it is some cutesy tangent about genetics and how sperm is no longer necessary to fertilize eggs.  harharhar.  Up until that point, it's mostly a collection of random rants and anecdotes about how men supposedly can't handle women who are smarter than them or make more money, etc.  Also, that all these societal standards are the fault of men, completely omitting women's responsibility in upholding them.  (Get a clue: women are at least as insistent on the man being richer or more powerful no matter her standing, just like women expect the man to be taller no matter her height.)  If Maureen truly believes men desire ditzes, maybe she can find comfort in knowing the release of this book just increased her compatibility 
 I'm about half way through this book and I'm finding it a little boring. I've read so many books about Diana, that I find myself skimming over the stuff that's been written SO MANY times. As a result, I'm probably missing any new stuff that might actually be in here. It's also very hard to find a reading flow--it seems more like an academic text or report, not a biography. Good try at compiling old news into a new book, but I'd recommend waiting for the discount rack or skipping altogether. 
 I hated this book for all the same reasons that the previous reviewer loved it.  Latour's voice changes add some depth to the story, but are done in a manner so convoluted that much of the substance is lost.  Using Aramis itself as the voice of martyred technology just becomes increasingly absurd throughout the book.  There are much better books than this out there about man's relationship with technology, do yourself a favor and find one of them 
 Throughout my read, my head kept shaking with disappointment.  If the "renaissance" of hard SF relies on stories a full decade, even two decades, old, then the genre's future is feebly fixated on its past.  Not to say that some of the stories here aren't wonderful ... emphasis on "some."  But dredging dead decades to claim a rebirth of hard SF fails to deliver on the title's promise.  This is more nostalgia than renewal, and you should read a library-borrowed copy if you want to reminisce about great writers past/passing.  But don't drop any real money expecting a glimpse into Sci-Fi's future 
 This book was horribly written.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the analogies used... describing the American consumer as Wal-Mart's whores... that was great. However, a lot of the author's claims were highly unsubstantiated.  As a Wal-Mart associate, I know that a lot of what he said is untrue. We are NOT allowed to work off the clock, and we are not victims of Wal-Mart's corporate greed. I really like my job, and while I don't approve of all Wal-Mart's policies, I certainly don't think they're as bad as they are portrayed in this book. I'm sure many of the stories ARE true. However, if the author spent half as much time spotlighting GOOD things Wal-Mart did, this book would be much more balanced.  I'm not impressed by his research, the book is lacking in fact, and is full of baloney. The research he did do could have been much better presented. The book was rambling, he repeated himself constantly, and it just felt like the book was slapped together last minute to be rushed out onto Target shelves.. 
 After you have read a few of Coulter's romanic fiction novels, they become the very same story over and over again.  However, her contemporary mystery plots remain very good 
 I think Hemingway wanted to do two things:  (1) critique certain aspects of how WWII was fought (particularly the politicalization of battle plans); and (2) pay homage to his beloved Venice.  To do so, he crafted a fairly thin story about an old soldier who finds himself in one last love with a girl a fraction of his age.  The plot (to the extent there is one) and the relationship between the characters would probably make a nice short story.  The bulk of the book is taken up by tourist writing about Venice (locales, architecture, food, markets, layout, and, of course, the canals) and a journalist's rants about US generals in WWII.  Diehard Hemingway fans will find some jewels worth the read; others should stay away 
 I am doing a self study and do not have any facility to get help of any instructor. I purchased the book after got good reference from some of my friends. The content of the book is pretty good...BUT when it comes to the problems...there are a very very few worked out examples (as usual they are the easiest ones)...Addition to that the publisher decided to earn every bits of pennies. So they created a Student's solution manual. No where in the publisher's site anything mentioned about the manual. But when I purchased , found that the manual has solution for ONLY Odd numbered solution (for them the answers are given in the original book). I was wondering whether they have another solution manual for EVEN numbered problems...!!!  The instructor's manual is out of stock and you cannot download it from the publisher's site (unless you are an Instructor which I am not).  Now I am wondering how I can get help on the even numbered problems....any idea?? 
 This book is written like it's talking to a child, which i find very unappealing.  It's good for a quick read, but hard to keep focused on it becuase it seems rather boring, to me anyway.  It also had very juvenile  information in it, like safety, which is really common sense.  The pictures  were lacking.  I was especially disappointed with the pictures that went  along with the text, because they didn't have captions.  I didn't like this  book very much and I plan on returning it 
 Unfortunately while this book does try to explore a fascinating and worthwhile subject, it suffers the same predicament that most non-fiction books for the past three decades have fallen under - incompetent editing. The author repeats, and repeats, and repeats, and repeats, and repeats her ideas and observations. Perhaps she was trying to meet a minimum word limit ordained by her publisher but that consideration shouldn't elicit anyone's sympathy. The constant re-iteration of points (and the author's desert-dry "voice" that exacerbates the repetition with its monotonous tone) makes for such a frustrating reading experience that I could not go past the second chapter 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 I encountered this wildly overpraised critical study in college. I've should have known I was getting into trouble just by the stupid title. Hoffman's attempts at humor are lame (Camille Paglia is far more livlier  and insightful on Poe in her book "Sexual Personae")and his  insights pitiful (Paul Coates, in "The Realist Fantasy", gives a  much more subtle reading of Poe's "William Wilson" in just three  paragraphs than Hoffman is able to accomplish). What really undermines the  whole book is Hoffman's complete ignorance of fantastic literature which I  think would be essential to doing a critical study of Poe. Only passing  mention is made of E.T.A. Hoffmann, a major influence on Poe (and among  other great writers). Consequently the influence of Hoffmann's doppelganger  tales (such as "The Double" and "Devil's Elixirs") on  Poe's doppelganger tales ("William Wilson" and "The Black  Cat" among other tales)and their influence on such short story writers  as Borges, Paul Bowles, and Julio Cortazar, is not mentioned because Daniel  Hoffman is ignorant of it all and the whole genre. And his conclusion that  Poe only wrote "pure" tales devoid of any inner meaning is pure  bunk and pure laziness on Hoffman's part. To any unfortunate reader or  student who picks up Hoffman's book expecting any critical acumen be  warned: this book isn't it. Two other critical studies (David Ketterer, J.  Gerald Kennedy) are far better 
 The author attempts to paint some trends from haphazard internet-related happenings. His intent seems to be to say --  The internet changes _everything_, becomes a social leveller. Youngsters are making big changes not just in inventing new things, but also new processes, new paradigms, and oldies feel endangered and rightfully so.  He uses stories like a kiddie making big stock gains and being investigated by SEC, another being a freelance lawyer and making it big fast, yet another writing programs to napsterize everything.  He indicates "flattening" of normally hierarchically defined relationships in society and corporations, and has this concept of "insiders" being unseated by "outsiders" due to the ease with which radical new ideas can be imagined, developed and brought to market, thanks to the internet.  There is some truth to his observations, but the few examples he quotes may not be sufficient to determine a wider trend. It is of course true that the internet gives "access" and "freedom" renewed relevance. I like to think of it as "digital democratization" of society.  
 Some of the works of art are lovely, but 2 are too violent for a child to study. In one, a man is being beheaded and another shows a nightmarish scene with a man on fire. Is this the best the author could find? Sure to turn some children away from art 
 it would be a very irritating and unbelieveable read.  I read this book after knowing it is mostly fiction to see what all the hype was about.  The writing style of this book is annoying and difficult to read.  I ended up skipping over much of the content because it was repeated over and over.  I know this is supposed to be for emphasis, but I just found it indulgent.  The lack of correct punctuation was distracting, too.  Had I read this when the book first came out, before everyone knew he lied, I would have found it hard to believe that most everyone in the book relapsed but he was completely fine without the help of AA.  Although I have not attended AA or any similar support groups, I feel that this book sends a poor message to people with addictions, that they are perfectly capable to handle their recovery on their own, which in most cases I am sure they are not.  I found the other characters in the book to be much more interesting than James Frey, and I can't say that I felt any amount of sympathy or connection to him as a character.  Maybe that is what he wanted since he supposedly feels so horrible about himself....but I am sure that now he has made a pretty penny pimping a fake story he isn't feeling so badly anymore 
 If you're looking for the new millennium's sequel to Feminine Mystique or Backlash, keep looking.   Warner spends almost 300 pages trying to figure out whether she's trying to evaluate the mothering cultures of France and the U.S. (when she was in France, she found it far inferior to the U.S.; now that she's back in the States, it's clear that France is superior), resolve the mommy wars (she deftly handles this by arguing that most money-earning moms don't work full time and most SAHMs have some kind of paid work, thereby eliminating the divide), determine the merits of nursery school vs an overly scheduled childhood vs just hanging out, or trace the ups and downs of mothering theory as compared and constrasted to the rise and fall of feminism.   Whew, that's a lot!  No wonder she encapsulates the above (and more) as "This Mess."    Because the general topic is near to my heart, and because I know so many women similar to Warner and her interviewees (heavily pedigreed mothers of the post baby boom generation, which Warner oddly defines as beginning in 1958), I picked up this book expecting to find some really good tidbits if not a wholly coherent structure that pulled all the pieces of motherhood together.  Instead I found...a mess.  My theory is that Warner started off with the best intentions, sure there was a book in all this material somewhere, and hoping that the thesis would shape itself if she collected enough data from enough women (she interviewed 150 moms).  That didn't happen, and she didn't even get any good anecdotes out of the experience.     My own observation, as a mother of four who span the range from college to third grade, is that a lot of the sources she cites (the seminal treatises of each decade that redefined the role of mothers and the relationship of moms to paid work) didn't have nearly as much impact as she wants to believe.  Being a mom has always entailed a significant amount of soul searching, juggling, angst, self-abnegation, and doubt.  But everyone, mom or not, is affected by the increasing complexities of day-to-day life and the ongoing pressure to succeed, do more, spend more, experience more. We are all dealing with more stress, and Warner fails to factor that into her analysis.  (She also somehow forgets to mention that there's a lot of joy to be derived from raising kids, and that there are plenty of parents and kids who are thoroughly enjoying the whole family thing, stresses notwithstanding.)   Warner's only hope of being extricated from This Mess, stated in her concluding sentence, is that society will "come together to make it a reality."  That's not going to happen, and blaming the Mommy Mystique is ultimately a pretty pathetic excuse for not taking charge of your own life.  No need to wallow in This Mess 
 I am a Jersey Girl, about Bruce's age and a big Bruce fan, but this book was a total disappointment.  The pictures seem to be  all from one roll of film taken on the same day.  One poster would cover the whole book for a whole lot less money

 Another greatest hits, except this one is called Definitive Collection.  They just keep spitting these greatest hits out and people keep buying the same songs, over and over again.  
 There are many pages in this book that are still alive, but here is a novel that, I'm afraid, would tend to confirm the suspicions of some readers who haven't read Dickens yet -- that he's wordy.  This gets two stars, but that's because this book is being compared to other novels by Dickens.  If it were by some Victorian unknown, we'd be whooping about a rediscovered goodie!  Mostly I enjoyed it, but I doubt very much I'll ever read the first 200 pages or so word-for-word.  I should note that I didn't read an edition that had the Penguin editorial notes 
 Purchased this book after seeing that it won the 2006 Aventis General Prize for popular science writing. While the book is a quick and interesting read, I found that it ultimately left me wanting more... much more. The book certainly manages to hit many of the high points in the history of electricity and electronics. Unfortunately, it fails to provide much detail about any single person or idea. The book does include an extensive "Guide to Further Reading" and numerous notes for those who like more details. Annoyingly, the notes aren't referenced in the main text so you're forced to read in parallel through the main portion of the book as well as the "Notes" chapter if you want the full story.  In the end, I suppose my own expectations got the better of me: I was hoping for an in-depth history of electricity, perhaps along the lines of Richard Rhodes Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Making of the Atomic Bomb", rather than a entertaining afternoon read.. 
 We had high aspirations and scrupulously read this book looking for guidance, all to no avail. This book contains incorrect and misleading information. We tried the various links for additional data many of which were no longer on the web. Others that we contacted via e-mail the response was not what was designated in the book. Peter and Tara provide their e-mail addresses, but they neither respond nor answer questions. The only conclusion that one can draw is that they crank out the books just to sell them and make a quick dollar. They don't really intend to be there for the consumer.    We have since spoken with others who purchased the book and they were also disgusted and very disappointed. This book was a total waste of money. The only thing that it is good for is the garbage or fireplace 
 I didn't realize this book of stickers was for older kids (should have read the reviews first) and found that dd did not like this book at all.  She is almost 3.  She loved other books, but not this one - the pictures (e.g, bugs in jello) didn't make sense to her 
 Let me say first that I have been a great admirer of Peter Brown for many years. His "World of Late Antiquity" was a seminal work that inspired a generation of scholars to look past the tired old concepts of the fall of the Roman empire, and his biography of Augustine, recently updated, is magnificent.   It was with some excitement then that I sat down to see what Brown had to say in a work that covers a larger span of time than most of his previous studies. And it was with a sinking heart that I realized, after a few pages, that this one-time master of prose has lost his way.  In his lengthy introduction, Brown seems determined to undermine every preconception we may have about Europe's evolution in late antiquity and the early middle ages. To reinforce his point, he puts quotation marks around a myriad of words and phrases: "Roman", "barbarian", "imperial", "Western." For a page or two this seems like a reasonable way of signalling that these words may not mean what we think they mean. But the trouble is, he never stops: the quotation marks multiply, sometimes occurring a dozen times on a page, and seldom less than once per paragraph. And it becomes impossible to know what he is trying to signify. If he finds words like "Roman" and "barbarian" useful, why doesn't he simply define what he means by them, rather than distancing himself from them? It seems pointless to contrast barbarian and Roman, if you believe that the one is not really barbarian, and the other not really Roman.  And it gets worse. What are we to make of the fact that Irish kings ruled over "plains"? Do the quotation marks signify that the kings called them by that term (or its Gaelic equivalent), or that they were not really plains? Why the quotes around "Carolingian minuscule", not just on introduction but in subsequent references -- was the script not truly Carolingian, or not truly minuscule?   I don't know who should take the most blame here, Brown for repeatedly flagging words as not meaning what we think they mean, without bothering to find alternatives that he feels are more accurate, or his editor for letting him get away with it.   I realize other readers may not be as bothered by this sort of thing as I am, but I found it baffling and, ultimately, offputting. I seldom return a book, and I never thought I would return one of Peter Brown's, but that is what I did in this case.    
 I agree with a lot of the other reviews here; this book is more geared towards the childless than the childfree.  There is a huge difference.  The term childless applies to anyone who wants a child and cannot have one. The term childfree applies to anyone (straight, gay, or bisexual) who plans not to raise or bear children for a variety of reasons. If you're looking for a childfree book, this isn't it 
 If you like shallow arguements and can't think yourself out of a paper bag, this is a must read.  Bill use hate speach that will awe the stupid and make the intelligent cry out in frustration.  Remember unlike the government, Bill knows what is best for us....mainly buying his cheap products and buying these third grade readers 
 I LOVE this movie I've seen it probably more than 100 times! So imagine how excited I was to see it for like 5 bucks at Wal-Mart.... this particular copy is sitting next to me right now and all can say is I was really mad when I sat and watched it, the editing is horrible there are times when the camera zooms on people it shouldn't, lines are cut out and sometimes there are voices but no one's lips are moving.  Buy the authorized version not this one this one sucks 
 ... for those with any intelligence what so ever a pointless read.  Vincent points out all of the obvious connections to Kings other works.   There was no interview with the author to speak of... There was no new insight into the characters or about the worlds.  Disappointing through and through 
 PEOPLE, I COME TO YOU AS A PROPHET. HEAR MY WORDS. TAKE THEM AS BOTH WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT AND WORDS OF WARNING. THIS MINI-ALBUM IS TALENTED ORIGINAL MUSIC. HOWEVER, THIS MUSIC IS NOT THE MASSACRE WE ALL LOVE AND RALLY AROUND. AS A PROPHET, I REGRETFULLY PREDICT THAT THE MASSACRE'S NEXT ALBUM WILL SOUND SIMILAR TO THE STYLINGS OF THIS RELEASE.  "The absolute worst thing that can happen to a prophet is to be wrong. The second worst thing that can happen to a prohet is to be right." - Aldous Huxley  I AM THE ONLY PROPHET IN HISTORY WHO HOPES TO BE PROVEN WRONG.       
 Im really astounded by how well this movie has been rated. I love Depp and I thought it was terrible. I think he wanted to do something a bit different and dark but this movie is just sort of pointless. It's about the English restoration and the rebirth of the theatre during a time when sex and murder and general taboo subjects were unacceptable but rampant. It takes the nature of the period to the extreme and was overall terrible. It acted like it was very profound but conveyed very little. It had potential to be an incredible movie but if you're looking for a Depp fix- just pick up something else. 
 This is written more for reader's theater than in performance style.  So unless you're very creative and can re-write, I would pass.  This would be good for Sunday School lessons where you can go right to the appropriate verses to follow up.  Not the best for just performance 
 Ackroyd is a bad scholar, a bad thinker and a bad stylist.  He should never have attempted a biography of Shakespeare.  The best and kindest thing one can do to this rubbish is not read it 
 George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino have got to be two of the worst actors of all time. It's sheer agony to watch these nerds pretend to be macho tough guys.  This whole flick is akin to getting a gift-wrapped package wrapped in the fanciest wrapping paper... Problem is, as is often the case with Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, ain't nothin' inside the package. Get it? These guys like the worst movies and have managed to become the makers of some of the worst movies ever. The word shallow comes to mind. There is nothing there, and I doubt that there ever will be.  However, having said that, I must give credit where credit is due: Juliette Lewis, the talented Juliette Lewis, is terrific as usual. Good to see Harvey Keitel do his thing, same goes for Fred Williamson, the rarely seen Michael Parks (this guy, by the way made some terrific country-type records back in the 60's--and we wish he'd do more. He's up there with Merle Haggard  in my humble opinion) and, last but not least, the beautiful Salma Hayek  is also in this, although she hardly does enough. She still had the curves back then.   In addition to the above, we could have done without all the obvious and crappy CGI effects at the end. The stuff just doesn't work; never did.  By the way, the documentary FULL -TILT BOOGIE is way better than the main feature. 
  This book is neither about Aristotle nor General Motors.  Do not be fooled into believing it is in any way an application of Aristotelian ethics in modern business; it is not.  Morris consistently contradicts Aristotle throughout the book.    An example is Morris' proselytizing conclusion that leadership requires humility.  To make his point Morris quotes ancient Hasidic verse and the Tao Te Ching to establish that we are all worms.  Nobility, Morris suggests, is lowness.  Did Aristotle ever say this? No.  Could Aristotelian writing lead us to these conclusions?  No again.  Is Taoism consistent with Aristotelian reason and logic?  No, no, no.  Is Hasidic verse? Definitely not.  So what is going on?  Did Morris forget to read Aristotle?  Aristotle understood Man as a rational being with happiness as the moral purpose of his life.  Morris does not.  This book does not.  Morris peppers his book with quotes at the furious rate of no less than one or two per page.  He quotes every thing from fortune cookies to Einstein.  Ironically with all this mad quoting he never once, ever, (I checked) quotes Aristotle - never.     This book could better be titled, "If an irrational populist ran a non-profit organization."     The prefaces of basic economic texts usually contain better discussions of the practical intersection of business and philosophy. 
 I was disappointed with the whole thing:  mostly commentary and not much content;  I'd have expected and would have liked more of each show and less of the commentary.  It felt to me like the authors missed their mark and focused on their documentary rather than on the subject(s).  I wouldn't recommend at all, even at the reduced price from the original retail.. 
 I really really really really like Allison Moorer.  Have been a fan since her first record, have road-tripped to see her numerous times, and love her songwriting and singing.  That said -- "Getting Somewhere" is by far the least satisfying of her records.  No memorable songs.  Over-produced.  No "guts", as another reviewer said.  When the Allison Moorer/Doyle "Butch" Primm songwriting team called it quits (in more ways than one), their Lennon/McCartney-caliber teamwork was lost.  Not that Moorer sounds like The Beatles, but Allison and Butch complemented each other well when composing music.    This CD is not only unmemorable but I doubt I would care to ever listen to it again.  Such a shame.  I've never had anything negative to say about Allison in the 8 years I've been a fan.  But this CD left me cold.  It hurts a bit to say this, but I cannot recommend this CD.   The closest analogy I can think of that relates to how different this CD is from her earlier work is the B-story line from an episode of "The Larry Sanders Show".  In that episode, Sanders' head writer Phil (played by Wallace Langham) finally got himself a girlfriend and was happy.  As a result he lost his edge.  When he was a miserable person he was an edgy, cynical, funny jokewriter.  When he was a happy person he stopped being the kind of funny that he needed to be to do his job.      Same with Moorer.  Since her recent changes in her social life she has started "singing a sweeter tune" in her life, but it came with a cost.  She doesn't seem to be the same songwriter anymore and it was that "other" songwriter who was so good -- a little edgy, sad, sometimes bitter, or at least that's how I interpreted it.  Granted, that wasn't her entire oeuvre, but it is what made her songs special for me.  Now she's happy and she might as well be writing songs for Barney the Dinosaur 
 I was thoroughly disappointed in Mirabai Starr's translation.  Her inability to comprehend Catholic Theology is evident throughout this translation; as a Catholic, I take offense at her politically correct terminology.  When you change the term "mortal sin" to "grave error" and "sin" to "missing the mark" for fear of hurting someone's feelings, something is lost in the translation and you have missed the mark (pun intended). I intend to purchase a copy of this wonderful work, but it will be one that is translated by a Catholic scholar that isn't interested in political correctness.      
 I saw this pair of shoes and thought that they were very cute, however, when they arrived they had smalls stains on over the front of the shoe. Very Very disappointed, I will return the shoes and never order anything from this seller again. 
 It seems like a nice complete set of playfood, except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard, and I've thrown most of them out already.  It doesn't take much to crush them.  There are much nicer sets out there, and there are separate pieces sold on ebay, that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better.  Not worth the money 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 This book is more about his autobiography, and albiet amusing at times, isn't a real investing book. His other one: Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World is much better 
 I understand the reason why it is written in such short form, but I hated it. It was way too much. Way over the top.  It makes for such a difficult read.  The book was pretty dull anyway. Not much happens here 
 Remember when Garth Brooks changed his identity, appearance and song writing and put out a lite-rock album under the name of Chris Gaines? 'Set This Circus Down' is McGraw's Chris Gaines album. But where Garth Brooks failed miserably, McGraw does an okay job. The rock songs on 'Set This Circus Down' are the best parts of the album. 'Angel Boy' is a really good tune, and if it would have come out in the mid 80's would have been a cross-over hit for sure. 'Things Change' is basically McGraw excusing himself for leaving his country roots, and pay homage to several other cross-over artists like Elvis and Hank Williams. But outside of those songs, the rest of the album is formulaic. Tim McGraw fans will like it, but it won't win over anyone new. Most of the other songs follow the usual McGraw pattern, of him being jilted or dumped and pining for lost love along the lines of his previous hits 'Don't Take The Girl', 'Just to See You Smile'. I think 'Set This Circus Down' was testing the waters to see if there would be cross-over appeal for Tim like there is for his wife, but it seems people are willing to accept female country vocalist in Top 40 like Shania and Faith Hill, but they are not ready for country male vocalists yet 
 Since I'm currently resolved to redesign my yard in the interests of increasing its ecological value and decreasing required maintenance, this "organic garden design school" SEEMED like the perfect book for me.  And there is a lot of good information in here, about design considerations, planting tips, etc, some of which I've found nowhere else, and which have made the book worthwhile to me.  HOWEVER, winnowing that information from the book was not very easy.  Though the title suggests this is a textbook, it is really a long series of 1- or 2-page rambles about one or another aspect of the author's experience gardening her own yard (and one other yard).  This work is poorly edited and organized, and there is a huge emphasis on just those two examples of garden design.  To apply the lessons of this book myself, I needed more than anecdotes from two situations unlike my own.  I needed some generally stated design principles, as well as some very specific techniques (e.g. how to build raised beds like the author's).  While this information is in there, and some of it is quite illuminating, those gems occur nearly randomly within the 1- or 2-page rambles.  If the book was titled something like "Design Thoughts," perhaps I wouldn't be so disappointed, but a "school" and a "guide," with all the clarity those words suggest, this book is not.  A workbook section at the end of the book makes up for this by finally providing the reader with a definite guide for action.  But it would have been a much more of a "school" and a "guide" if the workbook had been integrated into the chapters, rather than tacked on at the end 
 "Everything is an echo," Ilan Stavans wrote in the essay Lost in Translation. "To live is to plagiarize, to imitate, to steal." And so he does. The editorial gimmick of putting together anthologies of well-known authors under the common title 'the essential...' is usually reserved to creative writers of fiction and poetry, whose work can be somehow distilled, but Ilan Stavans is an author who has made his reputation primarily by writing about others and the editorial gimmick feels exactly like one because there is no 'essential' Stavans, only the 'echo.' I always found it disturbing to realize how ruthless and brutal Stavans has been against Latina writers, such as Ana Castillo and Sandra Cisneros (see 'Form over Content', p. 41). Stavans has been particularly dismissive of the styles conjured by Chicana writers to create their own respective worlds. The reason for such pathological fear of the language of women may be discerned in this book. Stavans' heroes are usually male writers who loom large above him--Octavio Paz, Walter Benjamin, Elias Canetti, Lionel Trilling--writers Stavans has invoked to 'explore' his own identity as a Latino-Jewish male. By his own admission, Stavans exists in the hyphen of his identity, rather than in the assertion of a self-created identity. This is why he writes so brutally against Chicana writers: because they have destroyed the paradise of hypenations, they have asserted their own identities through the difficult task of creating and molding new identities and a new language to go with it. The short stories in this book, particularly, show Stavans at his most derivative, imitating Kafka while alluding to him 
 Alright first of all anyone that only mentions Satellite Years in their comparisons to this cd should sit down.  Second of all anyone that says "people don't like it because their is no screaming", you can also sit down.  The fact is A-Types does not even compare to any of their three previous releases in any way at all.  For those kids that think Satellite Years is their best cd, listen to Frailty of Words which is probably one of the best cds, if not the best in this genre.  This cd is perfection.  The tracks on that cd and some on Satellite Years have a perfect flow, whether there is screaming or singing.  A-Types on the other hand just gets flat out boring.  The singing on the cd is fine, but the guitarwork and drums just fail.  Don't get me wrong there still is some nice guitar work in tracks such as Breathe From a Coma which i do enjoy still, but if you compare any track from this cd to any old track, with or without vocals, it just doesn't compare.  Now the music is just typical and boring when before they could take you from the heaviest breakdown to the most mellow interlude.  They used to end songs with four minute interludes and you can just lose yourself in the beauty of how they are constructed.  Listen to End of an Era or The Far Pavillions.  If you don't enjoy screaming just keep listening to these songs until they get about halfway done and all of a sudden these interludes hit you.  Even in "Frailty of Words" they have many tracks that include singing such as "Endeavor".  This track is very heavy and then comes to a beautiful singing part that just blows you away.  They constructed songs to perfection, including everthing possible and constantly changed everything, whereas now you hear repeated chorus' and many repetitive riffs.  It is almost not even possible to compare this to anything that hopesfall has ever written.  I know that they lost their guitarist and only have one original member, but how can they possibly try to live on as the same band.  They have not matured, they have not sold out, they just have died.  This cd just goes on and bores beyond belief and I cannot bring myself to understand how people say that it gets better by listen.  The repetitive chorus' get worse everytime i hear them.  It is pathetic when you hear the same line in a song about 7 times.  "Woah Icarus temping fate again.."  How many times does it need to be said so that the fans can all sing along.  The old Hopesfall had no specific structure at all.  It was pure chaos and then pure calmness and then sometimes they would even bring you back into the chaos before they ended the song.  I enjoy when bands change styles or when bands have less screaming sometimes because i can appreciate that they are trying to move on as musicians, but once you get rid of originality that you once had, that's when you lose.  I wish i could feel good about their change, but the cd is just flat out boring and does not keep it's originality.  As one of the reviewers said before, if you want to hear a band that makes a great change and matures into a more rock type music listen to "In Response" by This Day Forward.  They got rid of almost all of the screaming and it still is original.  This is what Hopesfall seems to be trying to do, but they fail miserably.  I still love Hopesfall, as they are my favorite band and I believe that the songs on the first three cds are some of the best songs ever, but this cd just even without comparison to those cds, is just boring and unoriginal.  I just wish i could have seen them before they put out this cd, or even before they put out Satellite Years because their old stuff was so original.  I will give it two stars because "It Happens" and "Breathe From a Coma" are decent tracks that are not that boring but as for the rest of the cd i would not recommend it.  Check out "In Response", if you want to see a band progress you won't be dissapointed.  As for Trustkill it is ashame that they had such great bands and let it go to waste and now they are one of the worst labels.  And if you want to hear good Hopesfall purchase "No Wings To Speak Of" because it is the best cd ever made in this genre of music.  
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 As the professor of a Health Care Ethics class, I must admit to being very disappointed in this book.  The first chapter's definitions of classical ethical theories is dense and not helpful at all.  I didn't even have the students read it.  But, as a lawyer and someone finishing his PhD in philosophy, it is the abortion chapter that I found to be quite troubling.  He selectively uses quotations and selectively lays out arguments in order to refute the position he doesn't agree with.  Here it is the anti-abortion position.  I tell my students that the true philosopher is he or she who can see the other side's complete argument and can restate it even better than they.  It is only such a person who can make an informed ethical decision.  This text does not adhere to that intellectually honest principle.    Here are a few examples of where either the facts are wrong or the text is slanted.  The introduction to the abortion chapter lays out a "history" of the debate and basically says that abortion was legal until men sought to show women their place and until the Catholic Church engaged in a war against science.  He really says this--see p. 125.  "As the church retreated from science during the period from about 1869 to 1900, it encouraged attention to Mary (who had been neglected), supported 'creationism' against geological explanations of the origins of the universe, emphasized miracles (the miracle of Fatima was recognized shortly after the First Vatican Council), and vigorously attacked Darwinism."  Not only is most of this historically inaccurate or incomplete, it certainly has no place in a textbook, let alone one on Health Care Ethics.  (By the way, Fatima was in 1917 and the First Vatican Council ended in 1870.  When does something 47 years later become "shortly after"?  Numberwise, 47 years ago was 1959.  Would we say that events in 2006 occurred "shortly after" something that happened in 1959?  That's my point.  You have to go way out of your way to be this biased--and it has no place in a textbook!)  Further, he says on p.137 that the fetus does not have brain waves until the 25th week of gestation.  He states this without a footnote.  In fact, the fetus has detectable brain waves between the 40th and 43rd day post-conception.  That is the end of the sixth week.  (See Eric Olson's _The Human Animal: Personal Identity without Psychology_ and John Kavanaugh's _Who Count as Persons_.)  Nor does he address questions about a beating heart, fingerprints, or the ability to feel pain.  These are all marks of a person and should be part of any intellectually honest discussion of abortion.  His discussion of the potentiality question relies very heavily on the legal definition of a "person," but never says why that matters.  A 1-day old baby is a "person" under the law, but has no sense of self and is not rational.  Why then is it protected but the 2-week old fetus is not?  He says the difference is that one is a "person" and one is not.  The problem is that that is a legal definition, under a 14th Amendment analysis.  It, however, does nothing to dispute Noonan, as he suggests that it does on p. 137. Listen to how bad his reasoning is: "However, having the potential to become a person is not being a person, as we realize when we consider the thousands of frozen embryos...[Also, this argument] collapses the distinction between being human and being a person."  The problem is, however, that he has never told us why the fetus is not a person.  He just assumes it--basically saying, "Well the law says it's not a person, so it's not a person."  What kind of reasoning is that?  Reader, I suggest you pore over Chapter 5 closely and tell me if you find anywhere where he offers an ARGUMENT of why a fetus is not a person and a 1-day old child is.  He doesn't because it's not part of his agenda.     I could go on an on, about what he chose to talk about and what he chose to ignore, about what he chose to characterize fully and what he chose to caricature.  I think that the book has some strong points, but just don't go into it expecting a full and philosophical, let alone historical, discussion of an ethical issue.     As a professor, I could easily present slanted arguments and try to sway students.  One of the reasons I chose this textbook, however, was because I wanted something decidedly neutral.  I wanted the students to *think* and see clearly the issues on both sides.  Toward that end, I have been very disappointed.   
 Horrible video. What is with the boys today with the shaving of all pubic hair? It's so nasty. These guys aren't sexy, intelligent or interesting. What should be entertaining is just pure disappointment.  
 A friend going through the same problems as I am was strongly recommended this book by her therapist and she bought it for me, as well.  I was enthusiastic to read it and at least understand these emotions.  If I could actually use the information to help myself, all the better.  I was warned that the beginning was a bit slow and hard to get through, so I struggled through it, expecting it to get easier to read.  It didn't.  It's been sitting by my bed for months with the bookmark at page 104 and I'm really sorry because I'm sure that the contents are useful and interesting, but I just can't get past that page 104.  I normally refuse to leave a book half unread, but this just has to be an exception because every time I pick it up I fall asleep within 3 or 4 pages.  I agree with some of the previous reviewers that there is way too much emphasis on the actual workings of the meetings.  I feel like I'm watching a video of it, as every minimal thing is described in incredible detail.  But I wanted to read this book to understand the views and conclusions of the group, not to become an expert on the tea breaks they had.  Also, I felt lost as the scientific tests they had previously carried out were explained in such detail, I ended up having to skim over some sections.  This may be a great resource for those who have great patience and/or a scientific background, but too much for a regular Joe like me 
 The camera work is nauseating; it has those amateur jerky, close-up facial, then rapid far-away zooming and back to close-up motions popular with kids today.  The technical advisors (if any) had no say in maintaining an aura of reality.  What cop leaves home dressed in full uniform? When have you seen a cop in uniform with a goatee?  When does a Police Captain bow down to a Lieutenant? When does an accused officer get interrogated by Internal Affairs without an attorney? Did they really think a guy with gang tattoos and a supposedly actual gang member would make it on the force, much less on a Gang detail?  When have you seen Crip gang members have fun on skateboards or Hells Angels bikers without bikes (who actually look like yuppies) hang out with a cholo who by mere coincidence is in the same gang as the cop who busts him? I was so disgusted with such unreality that I didn't even finish watching the movie.  Plus, instead of being original, they borrowed incidents from LAPD's Rampart scandal - gang unit member gets narcotics from Property by checking it out and sells it.  This is a waste of talent at best.  By all means rent it - see what I mean. 
 just awful  save your money, this book is not worth it. The pictures are dull and lifeless, boring composition. Mann hasn't captured anything here but a bunch of worthless photos. Any 10th rate amateur photographer could have done better. 
 Bought it for my wife - the pink just didn't match anything in my wardrobe...  She uses her player for the gym, and treats it somewhat rough.  This "case" doesn't protect the screen from scratches (see most other reviews), but it hasn't fallen off while she's worn it, either.  About 1/2 useful, really.  On the other hand....it was cheap, right?  Right? 
 DONT watch this movie the only reason you should watch this movie is to see how bad it is they shoulda called it backstreet boys from hell even the cheesiest horror movies seem amazing compared to this its a true waste of time 
 I just have a big warning for anyone thinking of buying this book: it is a catalogue for blueprints that you can buy from the Hanley Wood Company. For some reason Hanley Wood calls their catalogues "books." Their choice, I guess.  I will get to what this catalogue is in a minute. What is important is what it is not. It is not a book about the Arts and Crafts movement. It is not a book of photographs of Arts & Crafts homes since almost all of the pictures are architects' renditions of what the finished houses might look like, not actual photos of what they do look like. It is not a book about Arts and Crafts interiors, which is what I thought it was. When I read about getting 85 "home plans," I was so excited to think that I would be getting 85 ideas for room paint jobs, furniture and fixture ideas, etc. None of that. There's just a handful of photographs of interiors and no real attention paid to that side of it: the dominant imagery is of what the building might look like on the street (curb appeal).   There are a lot of other books about the Arts & Crafts movement that can give you ideas for decorating or redoing an existing home. This just is not one of them. I'm now taking a look at "Living the Arts & Crafts Style: A Home Decorating Workbook."  If you are planning on hiring a bunch of carpenters to build you a house in the Arts and Crafts style, I would buy this book for sure, even though a lot of the plans are not very original Arts & Crafts looking. They have a lot of 2000s details like "great rooms" and three car garages, and some of them look like McMansions with some Arts & Crafts features added in. A lot of them though are original looking and rather nice. You just might find your dream house and won't have to hire an architect. Even if you are planning on hiring an architect, I would buy this little catalogue anyway just to keep him or her honest 
 The flagellum of the salmonella bacterium, again? This old canard from the Intelligent Design movement has been refuted, in print and online, for years (check out talkorigins.org for one of these refutations). Ditto for the mousetrap argument. Basically, Dembski hauls out the same arguments that he's always hauled out, with similar lack of effect. Throughout this book, Dembski refers to the theory of evolution as "Darwinism"--which is about as silly as calling the germ theory of disease "Pasteurism." Dembski demonstrates no real knowledge of evolutionary theory, except that it surely must be wrong.  For those with doubts about "Darwinism," I would strongly suggest the following books, which are refreshingly devoid of the kind of pseudoscientific hogwash found in this one: Richard Dawkins--The Selfish Gene and Climbing Mount Improbable Robert Wright--The Moral Animal David Buss--The Murderer Next Door (ESPECIALLY interesting) Good luck in your search for knowledge. In future, avoid "science" books written by members of think tanks. It just leads to trouble. 
 Though I am not a Vogue reader, I picked up this book out of curiosity to see what Anna W's splashes in the tabloids were all about.  While the subject is only mildly interesting to me, the author's prose reads like a 300+ page deposition against Anna Wintour from everybody who had/has a major or minor gripe with her. It's a heavy and boring read.  Gossip, if one can get over oneself and admit that it is entertaining, should remain light and diverting. In this book, it is difficult to garner much sympathy for the subject or its author, much less derive the slightest enjoyment from it. I was very happy to put it down.   Perhaps this lackluster effort will compel someone else to attempt a better job. But then again, when that time comes, Anna Wintour may be have disappeared completely from public interest 
 I was extremely disappointed in this book.  I kept waiting for something to happen besides "scanties", than technology came into play, but the storyline was so boring and nothing worth reading about happened 
 I had to get this book for a young adult lit course.  The class was warned about some of the content in the book ahead of time by the professor, that the author was trying hard to be alternative (dealing with issues such as homosexuality, premarital sex, etc.).  Well, I didn't even make it halfway through the book, and I almost always finish books.  The funny thing is the content isn't what bothered me.  It was the writing.  The entire first chapter is characterization, which isn't bad in itself, except that it is completely told to us by the narrator instead of dramatized.  An undergrad who has only taken one creative writing course knows better than to do that.  Writers are supposed to "show, not tell."  Even if the author was trying for a fairy-tale-esque telling, this is just unexcusable.  Only a couple of the main characters in the book get any characterization.  We don't even know how old the characters are, which is a big deal.  There is a difference between a 14 year old and a 22 year old living with their boyfriend.  Also, it is hard for a reader to picture a narrator when he or she doesn't know if the narrator is 3 years old, 6 years old, or 14 years old.  These are just stupid omissions.  There is little, if any, plot, which makes the book a boring read.  Anyway, stay away from this book if at all possible, unless for some reason you enjoy reading books that are weird, ignore established literary conventions (such as stating how old your characters are), and for some incomprehensible reason, have been published anyway 
 The wipes are quite small and very thin.  Not very helpful for those 'messy' ones, especially when you have to use twice as many 
 I wasn't expecting a show book, I was expecting more of a birthday cake book, that you can actually do something with.  Oh sure you can do these cakes in here...  but would you want to 
  "Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack I went out for a ride and I never went back"  yeah that's impressive... sorry to all his fan's, but I've hated this guy ever since the first time I heard those lyrics... jeez wot wuz that? 25 years?   even worse, the no talent shmuck won't go away...  tell ya what Bruce... don't catch on fire near me...  
 Dr Laura gives some good advice but it is mixed with absolutely stupid advice such as when she says that a person should stay in an unhappy marriage because of their commitment.  It is unfortunate that she chose to use this relationship book as her soapbox to promote her own religous beliefs. If you dont believe in God and as Dr Laura, you can never be happy is the moral of her story. Laura makes a number of irresponsbile and misleading statements such as calling daycare, modern child abandonment. She talks about chastity until marriage several times and about 'shacking up' to use her term but never once does she explain why monogomy is important in a healthy relationship and she absolutely never mentions that a relationship has a natural progression part of which is physical. She moves the step of marriage up to be much sooner than it should be in a relationship while at the same time saying people should wait 'through the 4 seasons' or a year before being married. Actually says 'it is dangerous to pursue a physical relationship without the promise of marriage'. Is she saying men should promise marriage before they are ready?  She would have produced a much better book if she had given more examples of callers to her radio show or letters and given less malformed advice. Her rants and raves are actually entertaining, too bad that along with examples were cut short with her religious promotions and poorly thought advice snippets.  I listened to the whole thing(audio book cd) and I couldnt list the 10 stupid things implied in the title. I guess they are there and maybe under chapters 1-10 in the book. I could call out several stupid things but I didnt see 10 that stood out. Lots of it was common sense and phsychologically off callers made it obvious.  It is fun to listen to but make sure it is not the only book you use as a source. There are other better sources for relationship info. 
 This book was a real disappointment to me.  I own and like several of this author's other books, but I plan to resell this one.  Most of the cards used photos, which I am just not interested in.  I don't think the designs are pretty, either.  Even the cards without photos weren't to my taste.  Might be OK for a beginner, although I'm not sure there would be enough directions for a first-time project 
 I wrote a review earlier about how great this book is, but this book gets boring quick. My little girl was interested for about two days, now she would rather read the touch and feel animal books 
 Full of misquotes, untruths and gossip this book adds no new information on Tibet, but rather glosses over the tremendous devastation created by  China in Tibet.   How does anyone rationalize the murder, directly and  indirectly, of more than one million Tibetans by the Chinese 
 Described as, "loosely based on the life of Janis Joplin," The Rose would be much more entertaining if the film makers had gotten the rights to Joplins songs.  Bette Midler does an incredible job of re-creating a life of turmoil through the eyes of a sixties rock diva. An exhausted, burned out alcoholic who begs her promoter/manager (played by Alan Bates,) to give her a year off to rest, "The Rose," is on the path of destruction.  When she hooks up with an AWOL Vietnam War Veteran, you find yourself hoping he can calm her down enough to save her, but of course, you know that won't happen.  Much of the movie is actual concert footage of Midler singing her heart out, doing "Janis Joplin like," tunes, but again, this movie misses something by not using the real stuff.  And, as well as Midler belts out the songs, she sounds like Bette Midler singing 60's rock anthems and bluesy ballads; she doesn't sound like Janis Joplin at all.  Of course, Bette Midler doesn't look anything like Joplin, either.  Midler is a red-headed Jewish girl and Joplin was a bushy haired brunette from Port Charles, LA.  So, there are no physical similarities whatsoever between the real Janis Joplin and "The Rose."  The movie is somewhat dated by now, and I for one would like to see a newer, more accurate version being released for todays audiences.    
 There is no way this man can be serious.  This book is a joke, it has to be.  It's been a while since I've read it, but while I was reading, I found myself literally marking passages with a pen that were ridiculous, absurd, sometimes bordering on insane.  I can't believe that anyone in their right mind could read this book as anything but parody.  The Enemy Within is not only asinine, but it is also an incredible waste of time - full of pointless anectodes and machismo, rife with typical conservative name calling, Michael Savage is so representative of what is wrong with America today.    Ignorant, bigoted, idiotic.  If these words fit you, you might enjoy The Enemy Within 
 This book was horrible! There was no logical order to the book because it is just a bunch of stories put together about Duveen. It is so boring, all the book does is talk about how dumb millionares were and how they were stupid enough to buy from Duveen and his crazy ways. This book was so bad, please save yourself the time and money and not buy this book 
 Very seldom do I give up on a book; I gave up on this one after several attempts to finish.  I have read Barbara Delinsky in the past and have enjoyed her books. I remember the fascination with the Peyton Place/Grace Metalious hoopla in the 50's and 60's so I was expecting to enjoy this story.  It is dull and tiresome.   
 I imagine this is what happens when you become a successfully published author... you are able to go back to your fist efforts of writing and sell them not for the story, but for the author's name.  I had hopes that the book would turn around with an shocking twist, yet the plot played out like a straight to video 80's action flick. If you need to get your fix of man vs. man vs. nature, save a couple hours of your life and watch deliverance 
 This CD just goes to prove how great of an influence David was on Pink Floyd's music. Out of the box this album is layed back an colored with many subtle textures, it's mellow ambience transports you to dreamy mindscapes. I found the more I listened to it, the more I liked it 
 This book was neither bad nor good and therefore leaves me with little inspiration to write a review. What must be said is that this book had great potential, which was never fully developed. The idea was good. Even some characters were good. Well, actually just Patrick. And come to think of it, I ended up liking Muffin (the cat) more than I did any of the other Mulvaneys. Though even as a cat lover, I got sick of hearing about Muffin and the other animals which were way too many in the first place.  The book did go on and on, too much description about the ordinary (and, oh so cliche at times!).I didn't like the way it jumped between 3rd person and 1st person narrative. I didn't find it confusing, I just found it awkward. It didn't give the chance to really get inside Judd's head (I mean, it was "his" story after all).   I couldn't love or hate anyone in the book. It was hard to tell what their motives were and "who" the real person was inside them. They seemed so in-and-out of character. Maybe that was the author's way of exposing them as phonies? I'm not sure. But without love or hate, there's really nothing left to feel as a reader. Left to chose between a ditzy mother, a jerk-of-a-father (but not a jerk enough to hate him or care about what happens to him), an eldest son who is like a prop in this book, a brainiac son who gets revenge only to disappear and become someone completely different without warning or reason, a victimized daughter, that you can't really feel all that sorry for, the youngest son (also a prop), I'm not sure who to root for (if anyone).  The worst part was, just when I started warming up to the book (forgiving its flaws, hoping for a great ending), I was hugely let down. It took me about a week to finish the last 2 chapters because the end of the book just dragged and I found myself too tired to pick it up. We are told in a quick (but ironically again, long and tedious) after-the-fact fashion about what has become of Marianne and then in the Epilogue everything is "wrapped up" quickly and neatly with no realism whatsoever. I feel if you're going to resolve things in the end, then RESOLVE them---Tell us what it is and how it came to be without just glossing over everything. The book was long enough; some pages should have been assigned to the ending instead of all the fluff in between. This is a book that should make you cry, but I felt nothing (and I am one of the biggest crybabies ever).   If you want a good book about family and family secrets, read Ann-Marie MacDonald's "Fall On Your Knees" or "The Way the Crow Flies" instead. Both excellent books. 
      Ya, sure Mandela is a great person, a personification of a accumulation of moral and ethical supremeness, but lets face it, this book sucks.  I had to read this for a high school english class, and it bored me to death.  So many facts, so many potentially useless information, its as if Mandela intentionally tried to put emphasis on the less entertaining portions in his life.  Personally, I dont see how all the other commentors could stand finishing this book.  Good story...badly written 
 What trash! What a paranoid book! A true work of tendentious and speculative fiction disguised as an essay.   No wonder that Amazon stands ready to sell this book for $0.35! Even then, it's a quarter and a half wasted. No wonder also that warmongers Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle gave it a note of thanks. It reads like their own propaganda in their conspiracy to take over American foreign policy and steer it to Israel's favor.  But the Mylroie-Wolfowitz-Perle cabal DID succeed in having the U.S. attack Iraq. This only shows the tremendous importance of propaganda and the strength of the pro-Israel lobby. Nazi Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's minister of propaganda, would be proud of Laurie Mylroie, since he  once said: "If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it." 
 I hated this book!  It is such a disappointing series after reading The Other Bolyn Girl which I absolutely loved.  This series is centered around a incest - which is detailed graphically in the book(s).  Very disappointing 
 In Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity sends out the subliminal message that he and his writing are about truth, justice, and the American way. Just the title represents everything true and good about him and America. For his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs and Hannity's words are the validation of those beliefs.  If this was written by a ghost writer, he should have withheld payment. If it wasn't written by a ghostwriter, Hannity should have one for his next attempt at literary hyperbole.  The first chapter is written in a maudlin, "those-were-the-good-old-days" wistfulness of his immigrant grandfather who he describes as an honest man of integrity, and a believer in the American dream. But before you can say "Erin Go Braugh" he is talking about the courage of George W. Bush for standing up to terrorism. Exactly how G.W. does, he doesn't elaborate. How he goes from grandfather to Dubbya is a bit of magic.  Hannity's next trick is to impugn Clinton and Gore as being soft on terrorism. His source for this is, of all people, Dick Morris who knew the Clintons and now works for the Fox Republican Advocacy Network. He quotes Morris who makes such vague statements as "It seemed they were afraid of talking about terrorism," or "they seemed to be indifferent to terrorism." These "Morris mind-reads" are conjectural, but Hannity uses them, which he does with impunity.  Let's take a closer look at Hannity's unimpeachable source for a moment. It was Dick Morris who quit the Clintons shortly after the second election. It was Morris who had a penchant for streetwalkers, did some jail time, and entered alcohol rehab. You'd think SH could find a better source if he expects freedom to ring!  But, Hannity doesn't skip a beat. He points out how democrats such as Senators Kerry and Daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills. What he neglects to inform his readers are the reasons they did because of riders that were attached to the bills, or the number of republicans who also voted against the same bills, or the many defense bills that Kerry and Daschle did vote for. He never once advises his reader of the defense spending programs that were killed by Dick Cheney when he was Secretary of Defense. Such deception is called propaganda.  Propaganda is something that Hannity has no compunction using here. This he does in continuing to tell a tale that has long since been debunked. Namely, it is the story of President Clinton being offered Osama bin Laden by the Sudanese government. Again, it's what he doesn't say that misdirects the reader. Sudan made the offer in the hope of having the economic sanctions against them for slave-trading, lifted. However, the FBI determined that the Sudanese were playing us because they had neither the ability nor the intent of handing over bin Laden. The Sudanese also made the offer to Saudi Arabia, but the Saudis had revoked bin Laden's citizenship, and refused to take him.  Benjamin Franklin said "Statistics is a liar." Hannity uses charts for the same purpose. He shows how under Reagan, the army bought over 500 tanks. Under Clinton, the army bought none. This leads one to the assumption that Clinton did nothing for the services. He doesn't mention that the army buys tanks, not presidents. He doesn't mention the army had all the tanks they needed for armored warfare against the Soviet Union that never came. He doesn't mention that the army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles.  Be grateful that Hannity cannot rewrite famous works of literature as he attempts to do with history. If he could, instead of seeing a dead Captain Ahab being killed by the whale in "Moby Dick," we might just see a grinning captain standing next to a tethered whale with the caption: "I caught a fish this big!"  There's something very fishy about his facts, his historical parallels which aren't parallel, and what he chooses to tell you, and what he chooses to leave out.  In this book, he tells whale-sized whoppers!        
 Kevin Trudeau has an understandable vendetta against the government, big drug companies  and modern medicine at large but he goes on about things that I already knew.  Then, wanting his magic answers to the natural cures, he refers readers to his website where he asks a monthly membership fee.  In the end, you come away devoid of any alternative health solutions, unless you want to spring for his fee to access the website.  I call that a bunch of hype and empty promises.  How do I know whether or not his website is any more informative than his tease of a book? 
 I know this film has some historical significance being the first British feature-length animated film and all, but to the modern viewer who has never had the privilege to read Orwell's masterpiece this film is a watered-down injustice due to the added humor in the story (I don't remember anything about a playful baby duck) and the tacked on "happy" ending.  Some other things that I found bothersome were the slow pace and the distracting humming sound.  Read the book instead, it's short and won't take you too long.  MTV will still be there when you get finished. 
 Learned in its own way, this book is basically a romantic rumination rather than a scholarly examination of a topic -- conversation -- that today attracts more careful minds. Deriding in its early pages how-to-win-in-conversation books, Zeldin advocates a new form of conversation that involves greater levels of openness, creativity, etc., etc. While it is hard to disagree ("no more creativity!"), this hardly bespeaks any understanding of how conversation actually works, for which one is better referred to research in sociology, sociolinguistics, and related fields 
 Personally, I don't see what the fuss is about over Penman.  This book was underwhelming in a number of catergories.    For example, the main character Justin de Quincy is two-dimensional and unrealistic.  After spending over 300 pages with this character, I feel I know very little about him, and what I do know is somewhat of a contradiction.  Whilst de Quincy is loyal to his queen, he has no loyality to the woman that carries his child.  Not only does de Quincy cheat on the pregnant woman, he doesn't even think twice about it.  Meanwhile, his sense of duty to his queen and stedfast loyality to her are constantly apparent throughout the story.  The point is, it is very hard to believe a character who is a loyal professional, but doesn't have the slightest bit of regret by living an amoral personal life.    The second issue I have with this novel is the mystery itself.  'Dragon's Lair' has so much potential in this arena, but falls flat time and time again.  The basic premise of trying to find the queen's ransom is appealing, but the way in which the crime unfolds is anti-climatic.  Moreover, the murder in this book does not occur until after page 200 of a 320 page book!    Dialogue is another major issue here.  When murder finally occurs it announced by a character declairing 'there's been murder done!' - for me, that was a laugh out loud moment.  Do people really talk that way?  de Quincy's lover constantly says silly things like 'goodbye lover!' and 'thank you lover'.  Again, people don't talk that way, and I found it very annoying having to read dialogue that was continuously unrealistic.   Lastly, although this book is historical in nature, there was hardly anything historical about this book.  Although the politics of the age affect the events of this story, that alone did not bring the middle ages alive in this story.  Penman resorted to cheap tricks such as having over half the book take place in taverns in an attempt to create time and place.     In short, lack of detail, flat characters, bad dialogue, and no real mystery to solve made this book a huge disapointment 
 Okay.  If you're a historian, you might enjoy this book.  If you're not, beware!  This book is so incredibly dry and flavorless.  I was astounded, I mean, how can you make a book about the Renaissance BORING?  I guess it's possible.  Wilcox gives you a lot of information and it's organized very nicely, but still, this book has no soul.  It's just......dull 
 This book is a complete joke. It was recently ridiculed in a Swedish business weekly for its description of Sweden. According to the book's authors:  1. The indigenous population in the north of the country are called lapps. The expression sami is somewhat derogatory. In fact it's the opposite! This is as if a European guide book on doing business in the US suggested their readers use the word "negro" instead of "african-american." Also, the Sami number some 20,000 persons, not really vital information if you are visiting a country of 9 million people. Moreover, comparing them to American indians or Australian aborigines is somewhat misleading, the non-sami population groups began to settle what is today Sweden sometime 2000 BC.  2. According to the book English is spoken in the major cities but if they plan to do business outside of the urban centres, they should speak German! This may have been true fifty years ago. A visiting US business person would should definately stick to English, German (with a US accent as well, I presume) will not get you very far.  In short, this book seems as if it's been written based on what the authors could find from a quick scan on the internet.   2. Most people in Sweden speak English 
 Another jingoistic, poorly theorized work of fiction. There are countless of these cheap "doom-and-gloom" scenarios. Save your money and play Command and Conquer: Generals. Because really, that is all this book is, another fantasy videogame reading "end-times."   There is absolutely nothing inevitable about a clash between China and America. Neither state has anything to gain from such a clash, nor does China have any reason to overthrow American hegemony. China is greatly benefitting from the Pax Americana without paying the costs of this system. If aggression occurs, it will be due to inept American foreign policy.  And on a final note, Bush has made it quite clear that the U.S. military will not support Taiwan if it were to formally declare its independence. 
 Burleigh's political agenda, made so obvious throughout this long and otherwise useful book, has to my knowledge never been mentioned by a single reviewer.  The author bludgeons the reader with his unoriginal contention that the Soviets were as murderous as the Nazis (or so very close the difference hardly matters), and he turns to this comparison at every possible juncture, including roads that do not meet.  One can hardly read two pages without a reference to the author's obsession. The book would have better been entitled, "The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany: A New Comparison," and that would be fine, but that's not the title I bought and wasn't the one I intended to read.  Not one serious reviewer mentions Burleigh's tendency to revel in his supposed political incorrectness, as if the year is 1965 and droves of lefties park their parkas in cafes, praising Stalin and railing against the bourgeoisie.  Obviously, someone has failed to inform Burleigh that his much beloved political incorrectness has become politically correct, his almost giddy pleasure in playing the role of a conservative "rebel" reminiscent of Bob Roberts in the Tim Robbins' film and rather ridiculous given the current political climate.  In several interviews, Burleigh rails against the continued interest in Nazism as a kind of pornography generated by, of course, the liberal media, which seems to have taken a vacation on the day it published his 800+ page tome about...Nazism. Burleigh's account of Nazi terror, so detailed that one can hardly bear the result, comes as close to his own definition of pornography as anything I can imagine, with the only possible exception being a person -- and the Internet suggests fetishists exist for nearly everything in the universe -- addicted to concentration camp footage. That brings me to the saddest point: Much of the information presented proves to be startlingly new and somehow even worse than imagined, especially the euthanasia program and the massacres that occurred on the Eastern front.  Unfortunately, we're reminded again and again that antisemitism stole many lives in the Soviet Union and its satellites, as if we didn't know that.  This correction of history, as Burleigh imagines it, takes place so often that one could almost assume the author really wants to say, "Yes, the Nazis were bad, but they did us a favor by invading the Soviet Union," only he seems to realize this would be a little too politically incorrect even for his tastes.  In summary, five stars for the information, one star for the interpretation.  With no 2.5 option available, I subtract .5 for Burleigh's rampant consultation of the thesaurus, apparently Roget's because where else would one find these words 
 I got this player from Wal-Mart for about $72 after tax.  I like the long battery live, I didn't have to change the battery after 3 or 4 days of usage.  The only bug I hate is when I transfer audio tracks from my PC to the player, it changed some title and artist's name for few tracks (each transfer is on few different tracks).  Since you can't make any changes when the sound tracks is on the player, nor can you set a "playlist" on the player, so when I transfer an audio book to the player, it is not playing in the order of the chapters for the book.  Because of this bug, I have to double check the title name every time after a transfer and write down the tracks that the name has been changed and later on manually play the tracks in the order of the eAudio book.  I assume people use this player for individual soundtrack doesn't care about this, but for me and people who use it for playing eAudio book will hate this player

 I haven't read a Picoult book in a while because her formula was bothering me but I saw this in the airport and decided it would be a easy yet entertaining read for the tedious 3 hour journey.  It was entertaining to the extent that I finished it. Unfortunately - it was still formulaic and completely predictable.  Elements that I liked:   - Rape is very rarely easy to sort out and date rape cases involving drugs, ex-boyfriends and alcohol are especially difficult. The confusion and obfuscation that Picoult writes (whether that was her intention or just poor writing) surrounding the issue can be representative of an actual rape.    - Teenagers are notoriously melodramatic and self pitying and Trixie, though a little over the top, seemed like a typical teenager... the reaction of other students at her school to the rape and Trixie also seem plausible.   - I liked the graphic novel. The melodramatic aspects are typical of the genre and it was a great way to try and illustrate Daniel. The hidden word bit - hokey.   - I liked learning about the native cultures in Alaska. I would like to read a whole book that takes place there and explores the themes though maybe not by Picoult.   - I liked the idiot's guide to Dante that was incorporated into the book.  Things I didn't like:   - Picoult tries to incorporate too much into this book and thus wasn't able to fully develop it all. Though I liked the native Alaskan bit, it was too jumbled and it didn't really add to the plot. Like another reviewer I wasn't left with the impression that Daniel's haunted past resurfaced. I was expecting a lot more. Murder? That's too much to add to this already overburdened plot.   We lose threads here and there like Daniel's career and the wife's affair - he just disappears after his admission. Cutting is a very real phenomena for many young women and Jodi doesn't explain or develop it.  I don't know that it was at all believable. Could the myopic Trixie have had the wherewithal to make it to Alaska when she could barely see beyond her own break-up and tried to commit suicide multiple times?  The cop, the DNA analyst, the lawyers, the parents, the twist - I've seen them all before in Jodi's other books... it's part of her formula.  I wonder what would happen if Jodi spent maybe three or four years researching a novel and devoting time to its plot. She could excel in character development and careful analysis of difficult topics. I feel like this novel writing machine is doing herself, her readers and literature a disservice 
 This book might be okay for individual study but is kind of boring.  I was looking for something I could work with my fifth grader on.  I like the 1st grade book but the upper grades seem to lose interest for the reader 
 I never received my order thanks alot, os I finally give up and canceled my order. I will never order from you again... Laura Doughert 
 The acclaim and good reviews for this book are mistaken - it is average work by an above average artist who his a sophomore slump with this, his second book. Sleeping by the Mississippi, as derivative as it may be, was deeper and more soulful than this work which offers not much new in contemporary photography. 
 Not particularly interesting or funny. None of the ridiculous turns of language of a Dave Barry column, no elder-statesman crabbiness like Andy Rooney's. Just routine bitching about airlines, office supplies, and so on. Save it for "A Walk in the Woods" or "A Short History of Nearly Everything 
 either drinking, cursing, and laughing in the pub, or replaying the messy home life style. what is this? you call this 'one of the year's top 10 movies!', 'two thumbs up!', 'one of the year's funniest!'?????????? this is one of the most terrible movies with bore-to-death storylines i've ever seen. acting maybe acceptable but, with such a lousy script and a bunch of ugly young female actors, i have to pass. wasted my money was fine, but wasted 95 minutes watching this silly movie? well, absolutely not! rejected the dvd out of the player after about 15 minutes. thanks for nothing 
 The central problem in this novel is that a main character can only be too desperate before one begins to despise them.  
 Prometheus Deception, like most of Ludlum's books, is very fast paced with little break in the action. It is full of twists and turns, with the unexpected occurring every now and then. However, the book seems like a desperate attempt at coming up with a plot and then trying to make the whole story somewhat sensible (needless to say, Ludlum fails miserably). There are instances when you're left wondering whether the sequence of events or the events themselves even make sense. Yes, we are living in a world of increased government surveillance, but I'm sure Ludlum, being the espoinage maestro that he is, could come up with a better plot than this 
 I returned this book. I suspect the author wrote it for herself, not for young children. The rhymes are forced, the pictures inadequate, and the premise self-serving. That is, the author advertises her posters and website. Really, what little kid wants to read a book about the life of a carpool mom? - Reader in Denve 
 Ok, so I figured that a book called "Secrets of Halo 2" might be cool, and show me some secrets that I haven't found yet (there are a lot out there). Instead what I got was this piece of ....  First off, out of the whole book, only about 6 pages are actually about Halo 2, and those are just a walkthrough of campaign.  The rest of the book contains a history of first person shooters, and, get this, hints and cheats for OTHER games.  If I wanted to know about Half Life 2, I would have bought a book on Half Life 2. Oh, and for those really old school fans, there's a quick walkthrough of Halo as well.  Even if I knew what this book was going to be, I would say avoid it.  It has more crappy screenshots, and over used strategies (example: Remember that you can duel wield in Halo 2), then you can shake a stick at.  Avoid buying this book.  Save your money for Halo 3 
 This is but a short "add-on" to Timothy Kearney's excellent review of this book.  I found The Writer's Guide to Character Traits merely another textbook formula for creating wooden people.  Stereotypical.  Gives you nothing that would enable you to maximize these traits--qualify them for  inclusive fitness into your story.  At best, this book is good for (occasional) checklist purposes only.  Far and away, in my opinion, the most USEFUL book on characterization is Karen Hood's Creating Character Emotions.  #####  Before buying this book I would recommend reading Timothy Kearney's review. Re-read it. Then read it again.       
 I tried to read this book, I really did. I've read a fair amount of epistemology, and I'm reasonably familiar with the issues and positions that characterize the field. And I purchased the book, so I had a financial investment.  But no. I can read Kant, and enjoy doing it, but I couldn't read this. What we have here is a confusingly-written compendium of the terminological quagmire into which modern epistemology has fallen, an elaboration that has yielded very, very little. It's no wonder that scientists and others who actually work and succeed with the things of the world ignore the whole epistemological enterprise as irrelevant.  Audi makes it all worse by omitting the historical context and development of the field, so there is little or no reference to what was at actually at issue to make the questions worth asking. What gave rise to epistemology and made any of it interesting was, of course, the challenge of skepticism; but that's stuck at the end, by which time the poor reader is long past caring.  Epistemology itself looks more and more like a dead end, at least in the way it's being pursued; maybe it's time to begin again, only starting from the ontology end.  However that may be, the history of epistemological debate is fascinating and involves many very challenging and interesting questions, especially when those are considered in historical sequence against the background of the times in which they were raised. There are many excellent introductions to epistemology available that tell that story. This is not one of them. 
 I ordered this sight unseen while in Iraq. As bored as I was, I don't think I got one iota of entertainment out of this book. I try not to take chances like that anymore 
 The concept is cute, although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them, but the main problem is that they give you hat hair, compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head.  Regular glasses go in between the hairs, so everything fluffs out.  If you never take off your reading glasses, have a buzz cut, are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head (but be careful of buns), the clic connect reader may be fine for you.  Otherwise, conventional glasses are a better bet 
 I'm a huge fan of Ted Dekkar, but lately I've noticed that his books have been lacking. Showdown was a wonderful read, and I was completely engrossed in it, thinking I would feel the same about SAINT I bought it. I think the most dissapointing about this book was that it was actually a sequel to Showdown, yet you don't know it till halfway through. I found this completely rediculous, and even though the story was somewhat interesting at times, it never really seemed to go anywhere...and never really ended either. There is never any true complete ending, and it leaves you feeling like you read a whole bunch of words instead of an actual story 
 After reading "The Kite Runner" - a deeply involving and heart wrenching story of friendship, loyalty and forgiveness amidst the backdrop of life in Afghanistan during the Russian war and the Taliban rule, I set out expecting more of the same from the Swallows of Kabul.  The latter was quite disapointing.    The Swallows of Kabul focusses on 4 main characters struggling to maintain their dignity and humanity amidst the violence, cruelty and desolation of their surroundings.  The dismal context of this story is properly set up.  Enough time is spent in illustrating the violence and suppression of human rights by the Taliban and the desperation of the Afghan people is clearly communicated. Unfortunately, the novel reads like a short story.  Proper character development is not established, so the reader ends up having little or no sympathy for its key characters who want for more redeeming traits.    The novel is successful in  painting a truly depressing picture of Afghanistan, making us thank our lucky stars for being far removed from such a place.  But if you're looking for an inspiring tale of how the human spirit triumphs over such dismal circumstances, then I wouldn't recommend this book for you.  I was glad to have turned the last page and put this book down 
 This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I enjoy all types of books and was looking for something light and entertaining as a break from heavier reading. The characters were totally unbelievable and shallow. The book was supposed to be a mix of sci-fi, suspense, and romance. The sci-fi part was fun, I'll admit. The suspense consisted of a mediocre crime plot, that was very graphic and disturbing in its description. The romance was nonexistent, unless you consider gratuitous sex scenes romantic. I know that Nora Roberts is known for the "steamy sex scenes" in her books, but these scenes were just stuck in there for the sake of their steaminess. They had no connection to the story whatsoever. The relationship between the protagonist and her husband was based solely on sex. What made this especially unbelievable was the fact that the main character was a survivor of abuse/incest. I'm no expert, but you'd think somebody with this type of background would have a few issues regarding sex/intimacy. I just thought the book was awful. Flat characters, silly predictable mystery. I left it on the train and feel sorry for the poor soul who picks it up 
 I found this book to be a total waste of money.  Sure it has a few interesting pieces of information, but nothing I haven't heard before.  This book may be useful if you have never had any experience with children.  If you have been around children at all, you will find everything in this book to be pure common sense.  I was looking for something with more concrete usable information 
 Yet another PG-13 "horror" film, which means you know it has been "sanitized for your protection." At least this time we have young adults in peril instead of teens. I realize I am being cynical, though it is difficult not to disparage a film when every one of the actors and actresses is young and good-looking. There is nothing wrong with including young and good-looking individuals in a film; it certainly makes the viewing experience more pleasant. Yet, how seriously can I take a movie when there is no good reason for casting this way other than to cater to a certain an audience that cares more about the attractiveness of the cast than the content of the film? This certainly seals its fate as an average (at best) film because we know artistic vision and profundity have been relegated as inferior to superficiality. It is too bad, really, because this story had potential. After the first couple minutes, during which Romanian soldiers stumble across mosaics depicting winged creatures of death in an ancient cathedral, I thought it might turn out to be better than its mediocre reputation. Over the next few minutes, however, I began to get that sinking feeling as the hunky, bland cast was introduced. It then became apparent this would be another clichéd, formulaic film. I could forgive the fact it is more or less "Alien" set in Earth's underground rather than in space because the production values here are top-notch. Aside from the relatively high budget and the occasional swear word, however, there isn't much here to distinguish it from the average made-for-the-Sci-Fi-Channel flick. At least some good came from watching this, though, as it renewed my interest in watching "Alien" again. 
 I'd been meaning to read this book for a long time, and I realize that it's considered a "classic", so I was surprised and disappointed when I finally got around to reading it. Basically, Holt describes various situations where children are playing and learning. If I hadn't already observed the same kinds of things with my own children, maybe this would have been enlightening. If you're someone who's spent time with young children, I don't think you'd get much out of this book. Perhaps if you haven't, then it might be interesting. 
 I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in "w" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.   I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a "brilliant" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life 
 The premise for this book had so much potential--examining cultural differences regarding time--but the execution was horrendous.  The wholescale condemnation of all things "Western," "phallic," "linear" and "masculine," and the unilateral and uncritical praise for "indigenous" cultures reminded me of a freshman in their first college seminar: juvenile, naive, and accusatory.  She praises what she terms the feminine and damns anything masculine.  I found this reductive and insulting.  I am an avowed feminist, but I believe this kind of devisive thinking to be harmful and destructive.    Furthermore, Griffiths is an awful writer.  She is cutesy, smug, self-congratulatory, and badly organized.  Her one thesis seems to be "clock time, bad!" and never moves much beyond that.  There are many other authors, such as Linda Hogan, who can write poetically and also politically, but Jay Griffiths is not one of them.    Avoid this self-important book and its hypocritical, accusatory author.  Direct your precious time elsewhere 
 Having not seen the orginal Rudolph TV show in a very long time I forgot what the story line was... remember that in this version of the story the snowman eats reindeers and apparently elves or anything else that would be upsetting to a child. There are a couple of scary illustrations in this book. My 3 year old was in love with the Rudolph movie but once he saw this book he refused to ever have anything to do with Rudolph again because he said he "didn't like the scary snowman".  Yes, I know it's a classic, but be warned 
 I ordered this pan beacuse I liked the old RevereWare pan I have had and wanted another.  I received this pan and could not believe how much lighter and of less quality it was as compared to the original RevereWare pan I have had for years. I looked on the botom of the new pan and it is made in China.  IS IS A PIECE OF JUNK.  I returned the pan.  I would not recommend this pan to anyone.  
 If you read the reviews that preceded mine, you'd get the idea that they were reviewing the paperback version of the second edition of David Buss's Evolutionary Psychology:The New Science of Mind."  The customer reviews below this one are actually reviews of Buss's HARDCOVER version of his second edition (Darwin is on the cover of the hardcover).  The picture of the so-called "paperback version" is yellow with the words "Cram 101" on it.  It is not the paperback version of the book. It is a study guide to accompany the book.  "Cram 101" consists of the key terms from each chapter (repeated across chapters for those with short-term memory problems)defined in one or two sentences.  The page opposite these definitions is lined and blank, for easy note taking by the conscientious student,no doubt.  At 9.95 it is way overpriced even for a study guide.  Amazon really screwed this one up and if I knew how to contact someone in charge,  I would 
 Amidst all the tirade and rhetoric, cold hard truths emerge: the way IPRs are framed, especially those pertaining to the biotechnology field, is biased towards the interests of multinational corporate entities, and that the current mechanistic gene-centric paradigm in the "life" sciences ignores holistic perspectives of lifeforms and nature which are useful in their own way. While the urgency and potency of the message is not in doubt, the presentation of the content, with all the sidetracks and rambling discourses, leaves much to be desired. Read this book with an open mind, don't take everything in it too seriously, and look up alternative sources of information as well 
 Trust me. I went through many Exchange server books and I am an experienced system admin and Exchange admin. This book is the worst book for technical people. The concept in the book is for readers who are most likely a non-technical managers who want to have an overall knowledge about Exchange. If you touch Exchange server, do not read this book and waste your time. Go with Exchange 24/7 which is much better 
 I expected this book to be about the freshman year experience, based on the title and the way that the book began.  However, the book ended up being more about broad strokes describing student life.  The author did not live in a freshman residence hall and I am unsure if she primarily enrolled in gateway classes or not.  Memorable aspects include her depiction of the student community being comprised of independent networks and the way students learn to manage college (cut corners) as a stragegy to manage their time 
 I am a big fan of Frank Miller's work and I loved reading the graphic novels the movie was adapted from. When I saw this film I was blown away by the visuals. It had an amazing graphic style that was very different than anything I had seen in a movie before.  Having mentioned it's good points I have to say I was enormously disappointed with the dialogue and some of the story adaptation to screen. It seems to me those involved in the screenplay and production were too concerned with adapting this in an overly faithful manner from the graphic novel to the big screen. For the most part the bad dialogue and some of the terrible acting in parts were just too painful to sit through. I had to keep checking to see if my ears were bleeding yet.  Each extraordinarily bad line or horribly acted sequence made we wince like I was being mugged. What works in a graphic novel doesn't necessarily work as well when adapted directly to screen without a bit more adaptation than you'll see here. All the characters were severely and tragically 2-dimensional with none of the depth you get from reading the graphic novel and very little attention was paid to developing better dialogue suitable for a big screen experience. Also, many of the big name actors in this movie were capable of much better performances than they displayed here.  Purists and rabid fans of the graphic novel may be capable of somehow finding a way to look past all the terrible acting and awful dialogue that is rife throughout the film. However, my bottom line opinion is it's a good film to watch for the visual look only, but you will almost certainly enjoy it far more if you keep the 'mute' button on. This film had the potential to be truly great but it is extremely disappointing that it fell so far short of that mark 
 "A Consumers' Republic" is one of those kinds of books that exists on the premise that it illuminates some previously unknown phenomenon. The book purports to be a "bold, encompassing, and profoundly influential book."  I humbly propose that this book is none of the above. "A Consumers' Republic" is certainly not a "bold" book. Quite tepidly, actually, the author makes a weak case that is essentially a rehashing (and a mediocre one at that) of mainstream academic criticisms of popular market culture. Certianly nothing new, the ideas lamely presented by this author were actually prefigured by a factor of centuries by actual scholars such as Smith, Marx, and de Toqueville. Not bold for sure, but also lacking nuance; "A Consumers' Republic" condescends to its readers and its subjects alike.  And is this book "profoundly influential," as the jacket pompously asserts? I hope not 
 Unix in a Nutshell is not for the faint-hearted.  It tries to be a concise reference on Unix but ends up being incomplete (esp. with regard to Linux).  A lot of commands are explained cursorily without complete options or examples.  The presentation is often confusing; witness the chapters on shell programming.  If you know nothing about Unix, don't even consider this book; it'll get you nowhere and more frustrate than ever.  If you already know Unix you can find better and more accurate Unix references elsewhere 
 I'd like to give this game a good review, but unless you read the fine print, you may be as dissapointed as I was to discover that it doesn't work on LCD televisions.  It also is incompatible with rear projection and plasma television sets 
 I purchased this camera based on previous good experience with an older model Fujifilm camera, reviews here, price and functions. At the same time, I also purchased the larger xD card. Almost out of the box, this camera has given me nothing but grief. What others had said about the blurry photos I can certainly echo. A month or so after purchase, the lens would not open, or it would not open totally. I first thought the batteries were dead and that was the cause....after changing the batteries, the problems still existed - SOME OF THE TIME. Not always - just sporadically. Just enough to cause me to miss many unique and memorable photo opportunities.   In addition to that, now that I'm looking at other brands of cameras I find the xD card I purchased is not transferable so I'm out the cost of that as well. Another malfunction of this camera is after "erasing" all photos on the xD card, taking more photos and uploading the new photos, I found that all the photos originally erased were still there and uploaded again with the new ones? I don't know if that was a camera or memory card malfunction but it just added to my dislike of this camera.   I would NOT recommend this camera to anyone....it's a total dud. I'm very disappointed with Fujifilm and am now looking at Nikon and Cannons. Good luck Fujifulm...you need it 
 If you're looking for a tale of self-loathing, arrogance born of privilege and internalized homophobia - then you've found your book.  I was hoping this book would be  a comment on homosexuality in the '50s and '60s but it isn't - it's the over-indulgent self-obsessed story of a gay man who is so hung up on how smart, privileged, "straight-acting" and attractive he is, that mid-way through the book you realize there can be no redemption.  Worse than this laborious and uneventful story, is the author's socio-political commentary on homosexuality and race (Tobias is a self-admitted racist). It's nothing you haven't heard or read - though the surprise is it's coming from a gay man. It's the sort of bland rhetoric you'd expect from a Bush supporter.  Women rank low on Tobias' list as well. The misogynism here is rampant - how ugly, ineffective and useless they are. As do effeminate gay men. The numerous references to faggots are not only offensive, they show the author to be who he really is - a Hitler among homos - someone who considers himself superior and vastly stronger in his own race.  Regardless of the acclaim given to this book for its "honesty" (how honest can a book written under an alias be?), it doesn't mean it's good reading - or that the author is a likeable character. Remember, Hitler wrote his own memoirs, too. Additionally, Tobias' writing is rambling, weak and despite hearing references to humor in reviews - I found none - just the sad, self-loathing tale of a man who I don't think, will ever be comfortable in his own skin, until he loses his judgment and superiority over other gay men. This is the story of an over-achiever who has always strived for perfection, though has never hit on what it is to be a decent human being.  A damaging book from damaged goods 
 This book either needs a re-write, a re-vamp, or a recall.  So much of the information seems out of date.    For example, Whitney gives a pretty amusing example of how to get $5k of credit fairly quickly:  Basically he advises you to open a savings account at a small bank with $1k.  (If you don't have $1k, he advises you borrow it from someone).  Then a week or so later he suggests you ask for a $1k loan (a signature loan) against your $1k in the bank and use that money to open another account at another bank and do the process over again. Use the money that you borrowed from the second bank to repay the first loan, and then do it again at a third bank.    This *could* work, but he never really adresses the fact that it's going to cost you $1k plus interest to do this (if you borrow a your first thousand, you're always going to have to pay back $2k and where are you going to get that money?)    Then he focuses on renting out rooming houses or buying dumps and fixing them up into something a little nicer.  Basically, you'll be providing housing for transient types or welfare recipients, as he seems to only advise buying cheap, run-down properties.  That's great if you have plenty of fire insurance for when the tenants' meth lab explodes and burns down your investment, but otherwise, it's not to attractive a proposition.      Another tactic discussed is to find a "motivated seller", which usually means someone under stress or financial hardship.  Then you take advantage of them and pay them far less than their property is worth.  You may be able to get a good deal shortchanging old ladies out of their house once their husband dies and and the kids move away, but personally I'd have a hard time sleeping at night.    Bottom line, you might get something out of this book, but I wouldn't recommend it.  It's not really realistic and Whitney comes across as kind of a sleeze.         
 I'm a retail stockbroker/financial planner.  The material is almost completely useless for retail brokers and most financial planners.  The material would mainly be usable by fee-only financial planners catering to  extremely wealthy individuals and wishing to take the author's  "concierge" approach to servicing clients.  For most retail  brokers, insurance agents, and most financial planners, the book contains  little of use; don't waste your money on it 
 I got this as a freebie along with W and it lasted only as long as I received it for one year.  The use of fur and skins was nauseating and I couldn't have been more disgusted at the vapid, innocuous, 'insights' it offered.  This magazine has no redeeming social value.  
 Hunter usually does impressive research, but here he shows a total lack of familiarity with chess. Bad job by Hunter and his editors 
 I read the synopsis of this book and thought that it sounded like an engaging read so I bought it expecting a magnificently  poignant novel. However, I was massively disappointed. Simply put, I found the entire book unremarkable. None of the characters seemed real to me nor did I feel any empathy for them. Their situations and dilemmas felt vague and unimportant at best. I believe that this is largely due to the author's continual  time jumping. By the time I became used to one character and her tale the story shifted to that of the character's mother or grandmother. I did not see the connection between the modern day characters life and that of her grandmother.  Why, if the book is mostly focused on the grandmother's life were we told in mind numbing detail about the life of her granddaughter?  How was this supposed to fit into the story? However, I continued to read mostly due to the tantalizing hints of something more exciting and  tragic to come. But this was not to be. The book ended much as it started, pointlessly. The "big" mystery of the novel  that supposedly shrouded the grandmother's marriage was an utter disappointment. The mystery was simply too banal and lifeless to be of any interest. I felt let down by the author after I had invested so much time in the novel to find out that the tragedy was as simple and uninteresting as what it turned out to be.  I did not hate this novel as you might suspect, but I did not like it either. It was one of those novels that is mildly interesting but if you put it down you will probably never pick it up again. If you feel that the novel is still worth reading then I recommend checking it out from the library. If I had done this I would never have checked it out again nor would I have bought it. Overall, this is a waste of time and money. There are too many good books in the world to waste time on this one.  I Recommend : Light on Snow, The Lovely Bones, A Peacock Spring, Not Without My Daughter, I Dreamed of Africa, Flowers in the Attic, Nell's Quilt, the Left Behind Series and the quintessential horror novels the Ravenloft Series. 
 ...I've finally found a Coltrane record I don't like. But first some history.  Coltrane's vast discography includes a large number of interesting-on-paper co-led dates. As most of these took place earlier in Coltrane's career, at Prestige or Atlantic, most of the discs are tossed-off jams, or overbilled sideman exploits. Trane is rarely the focus of these dates; and almost never does he genuinely co-lead. (THE AVANT-GARDE with Don Cherry comes to mind.) It's ironic that the one date where Coltrane shared billing with a true giant (DUKE ELLINGTON & JOHN COLTRANE, 1962) was also the one that allowed Trane to most emphatically dominate the session. The result is one of the greatest records of all time.  KENNY BURRELL & JOHN COLTRANE is not one of the greatest records of all time. It's a typical Prestige postcard jam, with very little shelf life, not much original material, and the obligatory ten-minute Weinstock blues on side B. The Prestige formula was hugely predictable, and to my count it yielded exactly one masterpiece (Sonny Rollins's SAXOPHONE COLOSSUS). And even then, just barely.  KENNY BURRELL & JOHN COLTRANE is not a masterpiece - not even barely. This is a resoundingly indifferent record; besides the spellbinding cover, and three exquisite minutes of "Where Was I Born?" (Coltrane's only duet with something other than drums), there's nothing at all memorable about it. Pianist Tommy Flanagan is in surprisingly animated form, and even contributed one half-decent uptempo tune ("Freight Trane"); and drummer Jimmy Cobb of KIND OF BLUE fame actually gets the chance to rock out a little here and there. Aside from that, there are a few brief Coltrane solos in the general BLUE TRAIN mould; a great deal of Paul Chambers (ditto - often bowed); and some Burrell, who is a typically tame "cool" bop player, maybe a little bit bluesier and flintier than, say, Jim Hall, but not as musically sophisticated. (His one theme, the third track, is not very distinctive.) No-one is playing at his highest level, perhaps because of the unusually uninspired programme of themes.  Surprisingly, there's not that much Coltrane or Burrell on this brief disc, with wide swatches of empty, Flanagan-wallpapered space. Or at least that's how it seems; this album has a way of fleeing from memory almost immediately after it's through. The closing Weinstock blues, "Big Paul", inexplicably credited to Flanagan - it has no intelligible melody - is fourteen of the dullest minutes Coltrane was ever associated with, and although his solo has some kick, it doesn't really go anywhere.  Worst of all, despite Rudy Van Gelder's best efforts, the tape is in less-than-ideal shape - it's full of crackling and drop-outs, and Van Gelder seems to have compensated by boosting the levels of everything.   Avoid, at least until you've already got your first ten or fifteen Coltrane records 
 I picked up this book expecting a nice, enjoyable historical fiction- what a dissapointment! If I had such a depraved mind I would certainly not advertise it.  This book is certainly not one to keep around if you have young children who are readers 
 This movie did have some great music and a few very interesting dance scenes, but overall comes across as a slow moving art film with not much of a story line.  And, if you don't speak Spanish you'll have to pay attention to the subtitles or you'll lose track of what little plot there is.  For those who have invested much of their lives in dance, and tango in particular, this is likely a very enjoyable movie.  However, if you're just a first time tango lesson taker, or a non-dancer, you might find this movie tedious to sit through and you might be tempted to hit the fast-forward button. 
 I found this book dull. It felt hurried and half-written to me. The passages dealing with sex read like a Penthouse Forum letter; the rest was exposition about the tourism industry. It revisits, without adding anything new, the familiar themes of Western decadence and decay, alienation, and nihilism. The back cover of the copy I purchased, unfortunately, gave away the ending. However, I felt I would have known exactly what was going to happen had the cover not obviated my desire to have the ending ruined before I even began the book. When Michel finds happiness, it seems forced and sentimental. I can't tell if the author is a misanthrope pretending to show compassion for humans, or a compassionate person attempting to write from the point of view of a misanthrope. Either way, it doesn't work; there is too little to the characters to care about them one way or the other. I must say I read several reviews beforehand, which is probably a mistake, but I was expecting something much darker. With an opening line that is an homage to Camus' The Stranger, I suppose I was hoping Platform would have the cutting, emotionally charged insight of that wonderful book, or that it would at least work to create the same bond between the narrator and reader. Unfortunately, I found it devoid of real humanity, or even a believable lack of humanity. A dissapointment 
 it sucked like hell. just dont read it. its for 1st graders 
 If you agree with them, the book is of course brilliant.  If you disagree with them, the book is a waste of paper.    Since I do not agree with them, and wanted to learn their arguments, I thought it was a waste of paper.  It seemed more like a collection of chatechismic provebs that social analysis, but then, much of the liberals, radicals, moderates essays suffer from the same ineffable quality.  The book is a waste of paper because readers might better read books such as Prestowitz's Three Billion New Capitalists, or Peterson's Running on Empty to encounter an intelligent and conservative critique of our nation today 
 This product does what it claims.  I recieved it a few days ago and it has performed well.  The downside of the product is the size.  It does a good job if you have an hour or more (depending on the size of your pet) to spend using it.  They tout it's price in comparison to other models costing around forty dollars or more.  I wish I had invested in the bigger, more expensive FURminator.  I rate this product with two stars, only because it's a hassle and time consuming to use on a larger animal.  It would probably be worth it if you own a small dog or cat 
 This is a terrible book! I can't believe the author of Ghosts I Have Been and A Long Way From Chicago wrote this thing! Apart from the author's apparent fascination with death, the plot doesn't go anywhere!  DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!It's awful! The only reason I did not give it zero stars is that there are a few rare moments of humor in it. 
 I really liked her other Shabby Chic books and enjoy reading and looking at them this one was a bit of a let down.It would have been better in a magazine forma 
 My two year old absolutely would not leave the store without this and she still plays with it a year later. However, there are two problems. One, it immediately needed repair to the basic connections and, two, it has a pinching hazard between the basket and the frame. But of course, my daughter never noticed either of those. She simply loves to play with it, constantly, and has to take it on walks around the block 
 This coffeemaker's design is flawed. But my customer service experience on complaining about it was the best I've received from any company in years. They sent their new thermal carafe model, which appears to have the design flaw with the filter carrier taken care of. Give them a chance to make it right. Customer service is part of the equation with any purchase, and Mr. Coffee/Sunbeam has impressed me on that score 
 I'm writing this for my seven year old grandaughter --she loves this DVD- she twirls and bounces and dances all the way thru it -- it transports her to an imaginary stage where she is the star-- I love watching her enjoy this dvd!! 
 After I purchased this atlas, I realized that this is one of those times when one should actually pick up a copy of a book first in a library or bookstore before ordering it.  While the maps themselves are fine, there simply are not enough of them.  The atlas focuses on the USA with approximately 30 pages of maps, but the apparently insignificant mass of permafrost and ice to the north of it gets one page!  The rest of the world isn't treated much better.  There are several very good world atlases that actually deal with entire world.  Unfortunately, this isn't one of them 
 If you don't understand Russian and going to follow subtitles - this one is for you. The DVD quality is perfect (I'm not gonna say anything about the movie - lots of reviews here). But the fact that amazon said it is Russian but it turned out to be Chezh made me sad. 
 This product just doesn't have much variety.  My baby's both are completely bored in it, and have only used it a handful of times.  They are 5 months and 1 year.  She like noise makers and squishy toys, but these are all hard, boring toys ... at least to my kids 
 I have always wondered about Professor Chomsky's writings. He has always been described as mean-spirited and anti-American by the right. I finally got an opportunity to read his book Hegemony or Survival. I was surprised at how readable it was; I expected it to be overly verbose. I was also surprised that I actually agreed with some of what he had to say, particularly about Iraq. He certainly is correct that the US led invasion of Iraq was a fantastic opportunity for Bin Ladin to stir up anti-US sentiment and attract members to his terrorist organization. I don't think you have to be a professor to see that though. Although some have charged Chomsky with being sympathetic to terrorists, I failed to see this. He condemns terrorism but accuses the US of creating an atmosphere that is conducive to the growth of terrorist organizations.  He argues here that US foreign policy victimizes every country it interferes with. The US consistently brutally punishes any country whose actions are contrary to its agenda, even if that country is just trying to better itself. Without a doubt, the US has made some disastrous foreign policy decisions but I don't think Washington is as evil as Chomsky wants the reader to believe.   We Americans like to believe that the US is always the good guy riding in to save the day. Sadly, all too often US intervention harms the very people we believe to be helping. Having said that, the US is not the evil monster that Chomsky portrays it either. He asserts that the US has only one goal and that is global dominance and it is all done under the guise of fighting terrorism or fighting communism. Too often he appears to use fuzzy logic or cherry picks events so that he can apply this contention to various skirmishes the US has been involved in.   On page 9 he states "In one country, Nicaragua, Washington had lost control of the armed forces that had traditionally subdued the region's population" "The us-backed Somoza dictatorship was overthrown by the Sandinista rebels, and the murderous national guard was dismantled. Therefore Nicaragua had to be subjected campaign of international terrorism that left the country in ruins" "The spirit of exuberance, vitality , and optimism that followed the overthrow of the dictatorship could not long survive as the reigning superpower intended to dash the hopes that a grim history might finally take a different course"   What Chomsky chooses to ignore is that after the Sandinistas overthrew Somoza with the full support of the US government, US then made initial efforts to establish peaceful relations with the Sandinistas. Congress authorized 75 million dollars in aid and offered to send doctors, nurses and teachers to help stabilize the new government. The Sandinistas got into trouble not by ousting Somoza as Chomsky wishes the reader to believe, but by supporting the Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador. The US cut off aid and gave repeated warnings to stop providing support to the communist rebels. In 1981 the US even sent Thomas Enders to try to end the tension. He offered them a sweet deal, the US would completely leave them alone to do as they please if they would just stay out of the conflict in El Salvador. They refused. This is was the beginning of the end for the Sandinistas.   I don't understand why Chomsky implies that Nicaragua was on the course to some utopia either. The Sandinistas promised their supporters free elections but refused once in power. They consistently denied Nicaraguans the freedoms they had promised, newspapers were censored, religions suppressed. Some ethnic groups were terrorized and their villages destroyed. The only reason that I can think of that Chomsky would paint such a distorted view of the Sandinistas is so that he can lead the reader to a false conclusion.  Later Chomsky implies that the US ruined the healthy economy of Nicaragua. Any economic growth that the Nicaraguans experienced was due to the US because of the said aid and the efforts of the US to have their World Bank debts forgiven.  Chomsky wants the reader to believe that US conflicts are never about communism or terrorism, that its just a ruse. He's wrong, nicaragua is just one example of where he got it wrong.  I also wonder about his comments concerning Cuba appealing to the UN for help. Chomsky states that Cuba didn't respond to the US with violent attacks within the US, rather they followed the procedure required by international law. Chomsky appears to be implying that the noble Cubans were above the primitive barbarity of the US. Obviously they didn't attack the US because they did not have the means to launch a formidable attack. Keep in mind that after the Cuban missile crisis, Che Guevara, one of the most influential leaders in the Castro Regime was furious. He was angered that the Soviets were weak and pulled the missiles out and proudly announced that he would have launched them all given the opportunity.  Chomsky's claims that Cuba's economic woes are purely a product of the US embargo seem to be a bit of a stretch. Did the embargo negatively impact Cuba? Of course. So much so that their island is the now the equivalent of tropical slum despite the fact that every other country in the free world will trade with them and they get billions of dollars in aid? I fail to see how.  I am troubled at his comparison of the 911 attacks and Clinton Admins attack on the pharmaceutical company in Sudan. Why didn't Chomsky mention that it was in response to attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania? Why didn't Chomsky mention that we believed it to be a chemical weapons plant? Why didn't Chomsky mention that the US released 24 million dollars to the businessman whose factory we wrongfully attacked?  I have numerous other concerns about the authors claims but I've reached my word limit here at amazon.  Cheer 
 That is the call to action by Congressman J.D. Hayworth, representing the 5th Congressional District of Arizona.  In his book, Whatever it Takes, Congressman Hayworth sets to the task of explaining why it is so crucially important to finally get control of the Southern border with respect to the flow of illegal immigrants.  Not only is the porousness of the border dangerous to the national security of the United States, but it is dangerous to the security of American workers.  Focusing on the social problems which accompany unregulated, illegal immigration, the burdens placed on the education and medical systems, the criminal behavior of immigrants during their illegal entry and the threats caused by a fractious multiculturalism, Hayworth lays out his solution to the problem: immigration reform centered on strong enforcement policies.  Not only would the author like to see a security wall built from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico, but it must be monitored by a significant increase in Border Patrol agents using modern high-tech surveillance devices to stem the flow of human traffic.  Moreover, he stresses that interior enforcement of businesses that hire illegal immigrants is the key to any successful immigration reform policy.  It is not enough to try and stop the flow of illegal immigrants at the border alone.  Through the penalization of businesses that hire illegal immigrants, the magnetic force which pulls illegal immigrants to cross the border in the first place would be reduced.  Not only is it necessary to enforce the current immigration laws that the United States already has, but the author elucidates new laws which should be enacted allowing the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service the ability to communicate freely with the Department of Homeland Security to stem the illegal use of forged documents by illegal immigrants to obtain jobs and collect payroll checks.    Congressman Hayworth is unapologetic in his diatribe as he deems the atmosphere of political correctness and race baiting surrounding the illegal immigration debate as disingenuous.  The overly sensitive manner in which illegal immigration is discussed is dangerous to our security, insomuch as it disallows serious discussion of the issues.  In his dismissive attitude of political correctness, he affords himself the opportunity to also address even more controversial subjects such as ending birthright citizenship laws for children born to illegal immigrants, ending "sanctuary" laws that forbid local and state police from providing information to federal immigration officers, limiting the issue of Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers so that illegal immigrants cannot obtain home loans or other financial services, establishing English as the national language of the United States, ending all bilingual education and denying social services and in-state tuition to illegal immigrants and their children.  Clearly the immigration debate is something which Congressman Hayworth is distinctly familiar with.  The 5th District of Arizona, while not directly on Mexico's border, is in the southern half of the state and experiences the migratory effects of illegal immigration directly.  First elected in 1994, Congressman Hayworth is solidly a Republican, with a voting record showing his conservative credentials.  However, his arguments opposing illegal immigration are nothing new and his book is, at often times, an inflammatory diatribe against the "liberal elite" and the "left-wing groups" who support "amnesty" for illegal immigrants.  With the distinct polarization of supporters and opponents of various immigration reform policies, Hayworth's book fits in nicely with Pat Buchanan's "State of Emergency" and Tom Tancredo's "In Mortal Danger," all three of which share the hard-line, strict enforcement approach towards solving the illegal immigration issue.  Congressman Hayworth falls victim, in a significant way, to just what he disparages in his book; the absolutism of his ideology and brusque manner of communicating his ideas leads to a diminution of articulate debate.  As such, the book is more of a duplicitous reactionary rant than it is a well thought-out and researched appeal to tighten the U.S.-Mexico border.  Through his use of oversimplified sloganeering, most of his arguments are based on the fact that because an illegal immigrant has broken the law to enter the United States, it does not matter what the immigrant may do for work, or in what ways immigrants may contribute to American society; the fact that they broke the law is tantamount and needs to be punished.  As much as I can appreciate his passionate appeal to "do something," Hayworth's approach to the problem, and more importantly, his disdain for liberalism in general, leads me to believe that a serious discussion of the relevant issues involved in the immigration debate would be lost in the rhetoric of his ideology 
 Beautiful graphics and nice storyline, but the amount of times the game freezes or you receive an error is just awful! Not to mention, the monsters level up with you so you'll never be at an advantage. You could pretty much beat the game at level 5  
 Here's what this book never explained:  if you are WILLING to cook at all, you can cook anything you want.  So why do you need this book?  You don't.  Cooking for yourself is a personal hurdle that you either accomplish or you don't.  If you can get to the point of cooking at all, then you don't need this book...the world is at your dutch oven.  The advice in the book is nothing that you haven't read in ANY magazine that you can pick up, whether it's a men's health magazine or even any ladies magazine.  The recipes may as well have been gleaned from the same pages as those same magazines.  There was NOTHING in this book new.   This was a major league disappointment 
 Do you not understand modern art?  Or does 50% or more of the art in MOMA confuse you?  If you answered yes to either of these questions then this film is definitely NOT for you.  If you answered no... well, this film still might not be for you.  Do you like to watch people walking around?  A lot?  Walking everywhere?  If you watched a documentary of someone, would you be pissed off if they cut out anything at all, including scenes where people just sit around, or perform mundane activities like making salads?  If you answered yes to these questions, then this film is DEFINITELY for you.  Eraserhead is an experiment in patience (on the viewer's part.)  It starts slowly, the (meager) plot unfolds slowly, and it ends slowly.  Nothing is lost by watching this movie 2x-4x (except the... unique... soundtrack.)  There ARE some interesting/worthwhile scenes but they are few and far between.  There are however, many riveting scenes such as someone getting out of bed, in bed, and out again, someone else walking, walking, walking.  People sitting on a couch.  A woman ululating for no apparent reason.  And many many more.  I don't know about you, but my dreams are more interesting than this.  This film really could have benefited from having 30 minutes or more cut out, but it seems to me like the director felt it necessary to pad the film with unecessary scenes in order to make it 'feature length.'  It's possible to have an artsy film not be boring (see Space Odyssey, Waking Life) but I think you need a little more than what is presented in this film.  If you've never seen this movie before and don't really know what it's about, I highly recommend you rent it first.  This film is not for many people.  Since this film is about 1 quarter interesting and 3 quarters boring, I give it 1.5 stars, plus .5 stars for a good job on the baby 
 I was there, as were several of my fellow Sitka Fire Department EMT's and State Troopers from the Sitka Academy.  The 6 of us, along with two parajumpers from the Canadian Armed Services were flown through the typhoon winds, on a helicopter, out to the Williamsburgh where we spent the next 33 hours attending to the rescued passengers - literally giving them the clothes off our backs and keeping them calmed.  We knew there was a doctor onboard, from Anchorage, but we literally never met or saw him - I'm sure he did good work in the little clinic he had set up - but that is where he stayed.  The real story was out in the rest of the ship that weekend.  But I was disappointed to see that Mr. Jeffers failed to fully research this book - the role the Sitka rescue teams played (both on the Williamsburgh and trying to assess/fight the fire on the Prinsendam) was totally overlooked - despite the fact that there is a lot of documentation available that tells our story - which was the human side & had some quite amusing moments in the face of this event.  I was so looking forward to this book and then to find out he left a large part of the story out, was very sad.  At least we all have our commendations from both the Coast Guard commendant and the Canadian armed services - they knew we were there!   Too bad Mr. Jeffers didn't due diligence. 
 As usual some italians never miss a chance to complain and bash about things they either don't have or don't understand. Clearly the author has been living in the stone age far too long. What does he mean with "How many people have actually ever bought an airline ticket over the internet?". Probably every single person I know! Or "How many people have actually ever sent data over the internet?". Practically the entire US population! His observations are not only shallow and over analyzed, most of them are just not accurate. Further, he fails to capture the true underlying issues embedded in the American way of life. The social and cultural issues that are ripping this country apart. A very poor analysis of non-issues that are, for the most part, just a result of his ignorance. His arrogance. Money NOT well spent I must say. P.S. I am an Italian living in the US 
 Obviously both and Finnegan proves it. Joyce spent seventeen years on this book, which can be properly read and understood by only one person - James Joyce, who passed away in 1941.  Now if you'd like to devote yourself - and perhaps your life - to achieving an understanding of Finnegans Wake, you are certainly free to do so.  And, having once attempted  to achieve such understanding myself, I can assure you that some of your time will be well spent.  But the facts are as follows:  1. Joyce was fluent in a number of European languages and had a nodding acquaintance with many more.  2. From this knowledge he fashioned a special vocabulary of multilingual blends and puns which he used, with ordinary English syntax, to create the solipsistic discourse of Finnegans Wake. It is, in effect, a private language.  3. Since most of his vocabulary is drawn from, and puns on, the languages Joyce was familiar with, the only way one can begin to understand what's happening is to be as familiar with them as James Joyce.   4. The entire book is said to narrate the mostly incoherent nighttime dream of its antihero, "HCE."  This was Joyce's way of "getting at" (whatever that means here) some sort of unconscious European cultural mind - as apprehended and imagined by James Joyce, of course.  5. Finnegans Wake is thus basically incomprehensible. The explications in Campbell & Robinson's Skeleton Key, while well informed, are, as the authors admit (though not in these words) the only sense they could make of it with the assistance of a shelf full of reference books. By getting in on the ground floor, C & W effectively dared anyone to disagree.  Which would, of course, require another pair of literature Ph.D.'s with another shelf of reference books. There can be more than one interpretation of Finnegans Wake, including a belief in the profitlessness of interpretation.   6. Once in a while Joyce can still write a melodious sentence that is close enough to English to carry some meaning. As readers of Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses are aware, Joyce was at one time a master of poetic English prose. Searching for the poetic moments, and those alone, makes for a pleasant diversion, and will undoubtedly reward the extremely well read and knowledgable.  If you're still intrigued, your best bet is to find a copy of the drastically abridged edition with commentary that Anthony Burgess put out forty years ago.  Burgess loved Finnegans Wake in the Campbell-Robinson interpretation, and he supplies enough editorial matter to aid you in your innocent quest to believe in Finnegans' greatness. The book may be  useful to some as a kind of Rorschach/I Ching for your own creativity: "How many puns and themes can *I* find?"  This book allegedly turned Derrida into a Deconstructionist. I believe it. Students of OCD and associated disorders should take a look at the entire Finagin Fannomenikonn, if you know what I mean.  
 This book is from 1987, I briefly read the reviews saying that it wasn't in the digital era, OK I figured that's fine, how out of date could it be? However, I didn't expect that so much of the book would be dedicated to functionality that's now fully automatic, such as TTL Flash, and TTL exposure metering.   It's certainly a very interesting technical read, that provided me with an understanding of all the different macro options, lenses, filters, extensions, TC's, reversing rings, bellows, reverse mount adapters, lens stacking, etc. However, it wasn't for me.   I was after something that would show technique, or provide advice on how/where to find the shots he was taking, but the book doesn't cover that at all, to my dismay the book starts with the author writing "it always surprises me that folks find it hard to find subjects" but then provides no advice. After having bought a 60mm Micro lens I was hopeful this would provide direction, but other than "I probably should have bought the 105mm lens" I didn't get any direction from it.   
 Bad. The songs are only okay, and the dances are pretty bad for Fred Astaire. Astaire later said it was the worst movie he ever made. I agree with him 100 percent 
 I'm really surprised the authors became so famous as the new gurus of CRM or 1to1 marketing. This book is just a collection of superficial case studies but it says nothing on the technologies used, the real problems companies had to face when they implemented CRM programs. This is just a book for high school kids or sunday newspaper readers who want know more about CRM without getting into the details. Not worth the money and absolutely simplistic 
 When I first started reading this magazine back in 2003 I thought "Oooh what a cool mag!!" But clearly I was totally wrong. Since 2003 Seventeen has changed  from a girly sophisticated mag appealing to girls just barely in their teens to to a cheap,overated, cliche`, piece of crap!!! I'd like to know what happened!!!!! It's super boring now. It has no style. All the sections are about health garbage & boring global trash. HELLO? What about the stars, movies,.. the music section sucks! Nothing is good anymore! If you disagree with me your probably just as boring as it yourself. I hate it and I DO NOT recomend this magazine. Don't read it!! You'll be wasting your time 
 Had hoped for much more... it's the type of book that sets up the conflict for 200 pages, massages it for 60 more, and then resolves it in only 10!!  VERY unsatisfying ending 
 The first books by John Ringo were gripping tales of interstellar war and invasion, liberally laced with what he himself calls carnography. By the time his third book was published though, he seems to have learned the all too common skill of filling pages without providing any content.  "The Hero" tries to tell the story of a military special operations team a thousand years in the future. All the characters are totally forgettable, and indeed the authors proceeds to kill most of them off quickly enough. The story consists of the teams travails slogging around a hostile countryside playing Blind Man's Bluff, while some of the members try to kill each other. The situations are arbitrary and meaningless. The authors introduce strange fauna, and then mostly ignore them except when convenient. The equipment carried by the soldiers is shockingly primitive for a culture with a millennium of uninterrupted technical civilization.  The only minor points of interest are that Ringo finally includes the English pronunciation of his Bane Sidhe (for those who hadn't figured it out), we learn a little (very little) about the Aldenata, and there is confirmation that the Posleen were bioengineered, like that's a surprise 
 WELL I LIKE THEIR CD BUT I WAS DISSAPOINTED BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE LIVE PERFORMANCES ON CDS WHERE EVERYONE IS CLAPPING AND SHOUTING. I LIKE THE VERSIONS WHERE THEY ARE IN THE STUDIO AND EVERYTHING IS PEACEFUL. I WOULD  HAVE MUCH PREFERRED THE STUDIO VERSION BETTER 
 Although I appreciated Helen McCarthy's inside information from interviews and her filmography list, I found her analysis of these films very superficial.  In short, I feel that any avid fan of Miyazaki could have written this book: it is simply a collection of facts and, as the other negative reviewer said, gushing about the films.  There is no in-depth, intellectual engagement with Miyazaki's work 
  Although one of the most amuzing & entertaining books I've ever read, it is blasphemous in every way. I read the entire series and by the third book it finally is in the realm of comedy.    Walsh seems to interpret the 10 Commandments as 10 "suggestions". The last chapter (so we won't forget it) of the Bible is: REV 22:18 I,John, solemnly warn everyone who hears the prophetic words of this book: if anyone adds anything to them, God will add to his punishment the plagues described in this book.   For those who doubt this evaulation of Conversations with God, please see the movie Devils Advocate. Maybe then you can see the truth.... BIBLE: (B)assic (I)nstructions (B)efore (L)eaving (E)arth    Not suggestions, not dated concepts, simply the truth of how to live a happy and fullfilled life.  
 I found this book rambling, difficult to understand, and not particularly well written.  The main thesis that all that exists is NOW  (see the other reviews for more detail) was not proven in the book and, as far as I can see, cannot be proven empirically (mathematical proof without experimental proof is not adequate).  In my opinion this book's theories belong to the realm of science fiction. If you want to let your imagination roam, anything is possible. Maybe everything is an illusion.  Maybe I am the only thing that exists in the universe.  Maybe there are all sorts of simultaneous universes that are constantly breaking in on each other.  Etcetera.  If I tried hard enough, I could probably support each of these ideas with concepts from quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity.   I don't think it's unusual for theoretical physics to cross the line from science to conjecture: This book is in that tradition 
 The illustration were very good in this book, but the 'silly dilly songs' were a big dissapointment. Some lines were just taken out of thin air with very little thought behind them - I know it's supposed to be silly, but these weren't. My 7 year old did not find them amusing,, but perhaps a 4 year old might 
 This book by Arza Evans contains too many mistakes and ignores a heck of a lot of contemporary Mormon scholarship that blows his arguments out of the water.  For example, in the case of the Arabian geography of the Book of Mormon, Evans charges that no continually flowing river in Arabia exits (1 Nephi 2:5-8). Furthermore, he charges that Bountiful could not possibly exist too (1 Nephi 17:5). However, even before the book was first published, these arguments were proven void.  In 1994, for example, Warren and Michaela Aston published the book, "In the footsteps of Lehi," revealing that plausible candidates for both Nahom (1 Nephi 16:34) and Bountiful exists in the Arabian Peninsula. Furthermore, only a few years later, George Potter discovered a continaully flowing river in Arabia, right where the Book of Mormon states it is. This was one of the first topics discussed in the 2003 book he co-authored with Richard Wellington, entitled, "Lehi in the Wilderness."  Now, the questions of Evans can be turned on their back -   How did Joseph Smith know so much about Arabia? How did he know of the presence of a continually flowing river south-south-east of Jerusalem in Arabia, when, for decades, critics have derided such (and, in their ignorance, continue to do) as an impossibility (see 1 Nephi 2:5-8)? How did he know of a burial site, *NHM* in the same direction, corresponding to "Nahom" where Ishamel was buried in 1 Nephi 16:34? Furthermore, on this point, lime altars have been found in this region, attesting to the historicity of the name and burial site pre-dating the Book of Mormon volume, serving as the first archaeological evidences attesting Book of Mormon antiquity. In addition, how could Smith have known of a lush garden spot east of Nahom, and describe all its physical and material cultural characteristics, when, again, critics have derided Bountiful in Arabia as another impossibility?  I am only scaping the surface, but this should be suffice to show that this book is far from a convincing critique of the Book of Mormon 
 This novel is set in the 40's, when Elizabeth Short (the Black Dahlia) was found murdered, her body cut in two. The characters revolve around the investigation of this incident, altnough her name is changed. The chapters go back and forth between the views of two brothers: one, an amoral cop, the other, a Catholic priest, Monsignor, businessman, whatever you want to call him.  Neither one is likable, the 40's cop jargon is incomprehensible, and the Catholic politics/building programs are boring.  However, the murder is solved and the end is neatly tied up with a bow.  If old cop stories appeal to you, you might like this, but I'm sure you could find better.  Double Indemnity, for instance, is superior 
 The first two short stories seem to have nothing to do with the main story. I couldn't stand Harriman. If an enginneer says it is impossible or the plan needs to be changed, he should agree with them and change it. The story itself is boring because you never learn much about the main characters 
 As a student using this book, I simply found it a little too difficult at times to grasp what the concepts were.  The examples, at times were just too complicated, and could have been done better with easy to understand examples.  Not so sure about this one.  However, if you are already tamed in automata theory concepts, I'm sure you'll love it 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 Well after reading the reviews of this vacuum, I decided to give it a try.  I have had it a month now and I have to say that I am sorry I bought this behemoth.  Right out of the box and trying it for the first time I noticed things that I didn't like.  I thought I 'd give it some time though and hoped I could adjust.  Here is what I found:  1.  The vacuum is very heavy as other reviewers have stated. 2.  Worse than the vacuum being heavy, the darn thing is really hard to push.  Even on hard smooth surfaces it's hard to push.  I have not figured out yet what the heck would cause it to have so much drag.  For it to drag on hard surfaces, it must be a design flaw. 3.  The on/off power switch is foot operated.  Not a terrible thing but Dirt Devil decided to put the darn thing out of view and hidden by the accessory carriage.  On my first time of vacuuming I accidentally ran over a sock and it got caught in the floor brush.  While the brush belt was smoking I fumbled around for the damn power switch.  I finally had to reach down and press the switch by hand because I couldn't find it by looking down.  It must have taking me eight to ten seconds to finally turn the thing off.  Unfortunately, the damage was done.  The belt snapped. How nice.  I really liked that.  First time out and the belt snapped. Another note about the switch; there have been times I have had to repeatedly press the switch because it would not lock off.  It takes a firm steady pressure to turn it off.  The fun part of this annoyance is that you think you have it turned off because the motor starts winding down and as soon as you let up on it the motor powers up. Couple that with not being able to really see the darn thing it's a real challenge.  Maybe Dirt Devil thinks we have eyes on our toes.  Hey Dirt Devil here is an idea.  How about putting the on/off switch on the push handle.  What a novel idea. Doh! 4. The vacuum hose that detaches is really unwieldy.  It has a long plastic handle that you hold onto and that makes it really difficult to manipulate the hose.  The main reason being is that the hose it too short.  It's like you are fighting the hose all the time.  It gets tiring. 5.  The detachable hose is really hard to re-install in it's port.  You have to wedge it in there really hard to get the thing to seat.   6.  The vacuum is terrible on rugs, on any of the floor height settings. It bunches up the rugs and starts smoking baby.  My old vac was not much better but at least with the old one I could lift the vac and kind of drag it over the rug and it wouldn't get all caught up.  I tried the same thing with the Dirt Devil and forget about it.  It jammed up every time. 7.  The vacuum is poor at getting dirt off of hard surface floors.  It just moves the dirt around or spits it out the back.  I have to use the hose attachment. 8.  The vacuum is horrible on steps.  With my old vac I could drag the vac across each step whilst the vacuum is locked in the upright position.  Easy deal.  The Dirt Devil does not work that way.  When the vacuum is in the upright position the brush is too high off the carpet to do any good.  The only option is to disengage the lock and vacuum with the back slanted.  One little problem with that.  The weight of the vac cause the seal at the base of the dirt canister to open and air begins leaking.  You don't get a good positive suction.  So, you have to play with the position of the tilt to get the proper seal.  The problem is that the proper position you need is so close to where the vacuum locks into the upright position.  It often locks and so then you have to try and un-lock it while balancing this heavy behemoth.  It's a joke.  The only half easy way to do steps is if use the detachable hose and attach the power brush.  The only problem with that is you are fighting the ill designed hose and heavy vacuum, and not to mention that the brush attachment will only really get surface dirt.  If you try putting pressure for some deep cleaning the brush stops.   Now for Pros:   1.  The vacuum does seem to get the carpets pretty clean.  It has good suction and it raises the carpet fibers right up.  It almost makes my carpet look like new, and I do not see an excessive amount of carpet fibers in the dirt canister.  Some vacuums like to just tear up carpets. 2.  The rotating brush attachment works pretty good for removing cat hair off of couches and bedding.    All in all this vacuum was very very poorly designed.  I may just have to donate this thing and buy something else.  I can't imagine fighting this thing every week for years to come or until the motor dies.  Maybe I'll be lucky and the motor will die soon.  Then I'll just throw the darn thing out and buy something other than Dirt Devil.    Steve 
 This is a strange book. Even for a tell-all book it comes across as really strange. I'm not altogether proud that I purchased the thing in the first place but I was a bit curious about Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and what sort of person she was (aside from beautiful). To that end, the book doesn't really help to enlighten anything. Even when the author claims to have been head over heels in love with her, she (and him) come across as nutty and with too many issues for anyone to be remotely intrigued. It seems to me that Michael Bergin should have had more help in writing it; if he wanted love and respect to come through he just didn't make his point. His dislike for John Kennedy does shine through though, dislike and jealousy. The latter might be understandable if it weren't for its lack of nuances that a proper person and a book needs to have. Towards the end of the darn thing, I was genuinely disturbed by the suggestions that linger off each page. Could he have saved her life? Did she live out her final years in utter unhappiness and despair? Did he know or even care? Perhaps he meant well but it sure doesn't feel like it! 
 I purchased this DVD with my eyes wide open, because I had been forwarned by reviewers I respect, and I still place Dylan's 1977 "Renaldo and Clara" near the top of my most pretentiuos doo doo list. But wait, that was almost 30 years ago and this movie stars Jeff Bridges AND John Goodman (the Dude abides), also Jessica Lange, Giovanni Ribisi, Val Kilmer, Bruce Dern, Mickey Rourke and was co-written and directed by Larry Charles of Seinfeld and Friends fame, so how bad could it be? Well I planned on watching it one night but after about 30 minutes became fatiqued and fell asleep. This went on for about 3 more nights until I finally finished the movie. The week before I had watched the uncut "Heaven's Gate" (nearly 4 hours), a deliberate slowly paced film, in one sitting, and yet "M and A" seemed so much longer. I also skipped watching the few deleted scenes (something I can't remember ever doing), and went straight for the "Making Of" and watched and listened to those involved talking about the great script and a movie I can't remember seeing. I realize now that deleted scenes would be overkill since the entire movie seems like it's just a bunch of strung together deleted scenes. This is not to say the movie is unwatchable, I had kept coming back to it night after night, in fact there are some very entertaining and surreal moments in the film, I just wish there had been more of them. For starters I would have liked to have seen more of Ribisi, for he was the most focused in his part (though it also seemed like he was in another movie), they could have beefed up the Christian Slater-Chris Penn bits or even made them the main characters and created a sort of Abbott and Costello Meet Jack Fate. Val Kilmer was great, but he disappeared too soon, and some of the songs Dylan did with his band were pretty good, but they could have given the young girl (Tinashe Kachingwe), who stole the show singing "The Times They Are A-Changin'", more of Dylan's songs to sing.  The best part of the film for me was Jeff Bridges as a Dudesque reporter asking Dylan's Jack Fate lots of bizarre questions, in fact a short that just edited together all these bits would be enjoyable. I guess that's most of the good stuff, but on the other hand, I wish they had removed the entire subplot concerning his dying father (Richard Sarafian) Angela Bassett, and Mickey Rourke, and despite old man makeup, his father still looks younger than Bob (things must have been pretty bad in prison).  Less of Lange and Goodman would have made it less irratating, and Luke Wilson and particularly Penelope Cruz should have ended up on the cuttingroom floor. I'm not sure what to make of Ed Harris in black-face except that I felt like he was a refugee from some old Fellini film. Bob Dylan acts like he sings which isn't so bad in a film where  many of the other actors are so over-the-top, and watching him is like looking at an abstract painting, it doesn't ever change but you keep looking at it to try and find some inner meaning. This is Larry Charles first film and judging by his TV work you would have expected it to be at least funny, but where "Seinfeld" was supposed to be a TV show about nothing but was actually about alot, this movie really is about nothing 
 This remote controller was quite a dissapointment.  I am using two other Philips/Magnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better.  This one does not look like the picture (which looks more like the 425 model).  It does not cover the equipment I have (while the 425 model does), It's learning mode is flaky and unreliable, to say the least. The range is shorter then that of the 425S.  Conclusion:  This would make for a nice ornament (It does look nice, and, if you are lucky you may be able to control  some devices.  
 We purchased this DVD for the waiting room of a psychological practice. -a mistake.  It is Eerie and sinister.  Even my 5 year old said, "mom this spooks me".  The visual images are for the most part solitary and alone.  The music even has a eerie tone.  I finally thought we had gotten somewhere, when they panned to an ocean scene, only to find that they focused on a school of sharks.  That's a relaxing image for you.  Luckily, I previewed it once, shelved and won't see it again 
 IT IS A VERY INSPIRING BOOK I REALLY HATED IT SO THANK YOU FOR WRITTING IT! IT REALLY TOLD WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
 This is NOT a book!! It is a fold of about 25 half-size pages stapled in the center with a cover of card stock printed in black.  The information was totally ho-hum.  Common sense and an IQ of more than 20 will give you the same information with a quick look at the front of any book.  Then there's the cost!!!!!  $15.95 plus $3.49 shipping.  The book would have easily fit into a #10 business envelope and shipped for forty cents.  Needless to say I returned it ASAP 
 I've used the lonely planet guides on other trips before, and have always been very pleased, but this one left me with a different taste in my mouth.  LP was the only guide we purchased, based on our previous experiences with them, but we had the chance to peruse others in the B&B's we stayed in throughout our trip.  Of all of them, I'd rate the LP as the 2nd best for our interests - as they say, individual experiences may vary!  Ireland has become a very expen$ive tourist destination, so upon reflection, we would have been happier with the Rough Guide.  LP has just tried to hard to cover all levels of expense in one guide, and has ended up short-changing all of them in the process.  I hate to say it, but I'd rather see them do one thing well than 3 things mediocre at best.  I'd still put it above most of the other guidebooks though.  Our first and foremost gripe is how out of date the price estimates on everything are.  I realize it was published two years ago, but we gradually learned to depend on everything costing about 20% more than LP listed.  That's quite a jump for 2 years, indicating to me either poor fact-checking for the 2003 edition, or some pretty crazy inflation and a need for another update.  Our second gripe was the local maps.  They failed to provide maps for a lot of the smaller cities, and only provided maps of the city-center areas in the larger ones.  Given the rarity of Irish street signage, those maps would have been a God-send for navigation in towns.  Also, and this may be a function of the 2003 printing, a lot of the towns in Ireland are instituting one-way patterns in their city-centers, and LP's maps rarely identified this.    A third, again related gripe is with the existance, or lack thereof, of the various restaurants, b&b's, shops, etc. listed in the guide.  Probably 30% of the restaurants in the guide just aren't there any more.  I realize they must have been when it went to print, but that didn't help us any.  Our last gripe is the rather uneven coverage of large areas of the country.  Granted, it reflected perfectly the tourist patterns - heavy coverage of larger cities and popular tourist areas along the coasts, pretty awful coverage of less touristed interior areas.  Unfortunately, we didn't just want to go where all the other tourists go, so this left our noses still further out of joint.  Overall, I'd say if you want a guide that covers the sightes well, both LP and Rough Guide do that.  If you want to keep the expenditures down, Rough Guide does it much better.  If you want to go all out, um, there's probably a third option, but neither of these two will do it well.  If you want to be thrifty in some areas and splurge in others, then this guide is the closest you'll get to filling your schizophrenic needs in one place - although, in that case, I'd really recommend getting two guides, one for each end of the spectrum.  One last piece of advice - buy a heritage card when you get to your first castle/tomb/historic place!  If you plan on visiting more than one or two historic places, its 20e cost will be recouped within days with all the free admissions it will get you for the rest of the trip 
 gary grant's mother did not look a bit like his mother, more like his wife, the age difference simply non-exist! a terrible cast. the other problem was the attitude the mother towards his son. she simply despised him, but in fact, her son was a quite successful and respectful person in the society. i just don't know why the mother role was so cynical to her son.  some of the plot twists in this movie also looked very pretentious. the genre also losing grip, could hardly determined itself either a thriller or a comedy. so many scenes simply looked too staged and too phony, the absurdity of the screenplay was self-served to be imposed as normal in a common sense, but of course, if the viewers could lose themselves from the logic, anything was possible and acceptable. in that era, most of the popular movies were all like this one, mixed with romance, suspensful twists of the scenario,  actions, thugs, beautiful and mysterious women, almsot non-stop romantic theme music, sound effect synchronized with all the movements and reactions with the actors and every part of the stories. we've watched this movie couple of times before, but this time, after watched it developed into ridiculous and pretentious scene after scene, we just hit the reject button and put it back into the plastic box. you don't have to agree with me, because this is just my personal viewing after thought.  
 The story is very interseting.  But the lessons learned by the author are really boring. I would only read this book if it was required reading for a class, as it was for me 
 Our two year old loves the TV shows & his Wiggles CDs, but he is not interested in this DVD.  It is simply songs strung together, with little or no dialog and no plot (which our child really enjoys, and frankly, makes it easier for me to sit through, strange as that may sound).  Most songs are performed on the same basic set, which is just a sky & clouds background. Also, as many reviewers have said, the puppets are terrible. I think they will give ME nightmares. They are AWFUL!! 
 David Blight's book has shed much light on the impact the War Between the States (Civil War) has had upon the American mind. However, Northern apologists continue to refuse the Southerner to have his/her view point on this topic, as if to deny that there were not two distinct competing cultures in this conflict; one agrarian and the other industrial. More strikingly is the way the author lays claim to the supposed moral high ground of the Union army in fighting for emancipation and the underlying claim that the South fought to maintain slavery (Gen's Lee, Polk, Cleburne, Johnston, Col Mosby and many others did not advocate slavery nor own them). Sadly, the author fails to mentioned that we are the only Western nation to have allegedly fight a war to end slavery. The North had black codes which refused blacks the right to vote, own property, and attend schools, yet this is not mentioned. Hardly freedom. Blight's book is interesting in tracing the impact the conflict has had upon our memories and nation. The conflict truly established an enduring legacy of American fortitude and will.  However, I was somewhat disappointed that he hardly gave attention to the rise of pragmatism in the US shortly after 1865, thus contributing to Jim Crow laws and segregation(not the correct means to deal with cultural problems). Blight also failed to show a grasp of antebellum race relations and that Southernors, despite slavery, were more yoked together then during the Northern Reconstruction time period. Although I gave it only 2 stars (generliazed view of the social/cultural issues surrounding the War and typical victors' history), it is worth buying 
 This is the fourth Friday 13:th movie. The first was rather lame, borrowing the style of music and some of the story from Psycho. The last 5 minutes were cool. The second was better, with more distance and awereness of not being unike, while not falling into the irony trap that later would poison movies in the 90ies. The third more or less cuts to the chase, with a mindless killer killing not so mindful teenagers.  I don't know what they tried to do in this one. Skinny dipping. Making out. Jason appears, kills, and disappears. Shower scenes. Watching old black and white nude movies. Maybe the ending is good, but the rest?! Dignity, can we have some dignity?  The one cool thing about this movie is that Halloween 4 might have borrowed from both it's beginning and it's end. But now you know, so you can still skip this one. (And now you know that I'm a nerd. 
 Magical Child does have its moments but these are few and far between.  One has to wade through overwrought hyperbole and constant repetition to get at the few insights Mr. Pearce does have.  His comments on childbirth  are poignant and do illustrate just how far we have allowed technology and  modern medical practice to distort what should be a joyous and natural  process.   This book is laced with annoying terminology and proffers claims  of clairvoyant capabilities that would shame a supermarket tabloid.  Had  the author concentrated more on child development and less on developing a  polemic, a more insightful and useful book would have been the resul 
 Now, before you say anything, I have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster(grudgingly playing it though)and now for the unbaiased opinion. I think that this game is so completely stupid. It and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion. 
 I have read other novels by Dorothea Frank, and I wasn't expecting too much- only interesting characters and a reasonably interesting plot.  The book was horrible.  While it did have the usual low country setting, the plot was awful.  The book was written in first person with the narrator being Grace, a travel agent who could not even ask her Italian-Catholic parents to include her boyfriend in their family gatherings. Her spineless mother, who couldn't stand up to her husband, and who was a slave to her own mother, supposedly had some deep secret reason for her doormat behavior, however that aspect was not even explored. Most annoying to me was the Catholic miracle aspect.  Perhaps Frank ought to reconsider writing novels and write sales material for holy water and religious statues 
 Jane Smiley's _A_Thousand_Acres_ had a great deal of potential.  It had a powerful plot (King Lear) that has been little-adapted in modern times.  Smiley chose an interesting and rich setting in her modern day heartland farm.  However, the actual execution of the book leaves much to be desired.  First and foremost, Smiley writes exactly like a writer who has just completed a college writing program.  She uses smart and subtle humor (one may say wit), metaphors and similes.  The problem is that one is conscious at each and every juncture that she is using a simile, a metaphor, or a quip.  While more seasoned writers might have woven beauty into readable text or else have chosen to complexify and engage a reader, instead she chose a middleground that is neither challenging nor readable.  The reader constantly is forced to swallow some rather ridiculous metaphors, all the while conscious that they are swallowing a textbook, but ridiculous, metaphor.  And while the plot taken from Shakespeare had a lot of potential, it was handled quite inexpertly.  Yes, Smiley chose the intelligent path and abandoned Lear about 3/4 of the way through (so that everyone doesn't die).  However, once again, she writes in a way that makes every reader -conscious- that she is adapting Shakespeare, and at times the plot seems ridiculous in its current setting.  Yes, she sheds new light (the protagonist is the Goneril-character, who was a Shakespearean antagonist) in a very intriguing way.  Yes, she invents new excuses for her behavior (former child abuse)... however, had she not tried so hard to make the reader conscious that she was adapting Shakespeare, these plausable interpretations might not have seemed -in-plausable.  All in all, a book with many potent seeds that were not sown to anything near their full value 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 I just read the "not for the innumerate" review on this book,  and I agree. But I would like to clarify why the book disappoints. It's not  that there are too many equations, but that there are too few equations and  way too much jargon-laden hand waving. The hand waving, unfortunately, does  not compensate for the clarity sacrificed by omitting the math. Vince's  thesis that optimal f will maximize geometric returns is a valuable one, as  is the concept of trading at dynamic fractional f to control risk.  Unfortunately, he does not get specific enough to show us how to define and  use optimal f in real life stock trading. I have an extensive math  background, but I cannot get convincing quantitative results in Excel using  his presentation, even after re-deriving for myself all the equations he  deigns to show us. Perhaps if I had a futures trading background I would  find his prose easier to follow, but I would have been much better off with  the equations, in an appendix at least 
 A Dull, Predictable Holmes Pastiche  I found Mr. Day's Sherlock Holmes and the Alice in Wonderland Murders to be a dull, predictable pastiche.  I've read scores better, and this one could have been left for a simple rereading of one of Doyle's superior tales.  Here, Moriarty is back, yet again, not really dead at Reichbach Falls.  His return seems to have turned him into the Joker of Batman fame because he keeps on sending ridiculous clues to Holmes very loosely based upon Lewis Carroll's famous Alice stories, which leads Holmes and Watson into a silly series of comic book episodes.  Actually, the entire story would have fared much better AS a Batman and Robin tale.  Day's handling of Holmes and Watson works somewhat but only because he annoyingly refers again and again to Doyle's famous descriptions.  Save your money on this one unless you are a collector and have to have every pastiche.  I'm just glad the covers are finally closed.  Sorry, Mr. Day.  This is just one man's opinion, but I can only give your book 2 stars.  
 The bag is self was very nice. Compartmentalized beautifully. The problem was the telescoping arm would not stay in the open position, kept closing up by itself. Plus the length of the arm/handle was not long enough for a 5'11" person. I returned this bag and found another swiss gear style with 41" handle/arm that works perfeclty.

 The publication and subsequent widespread popularity of "The Da Vinci Code" has led to a host of books attempting to delve further into the subject matter and separate fact from fiction.  The authors and producers of these books usually fall into two categories: those of the Christian faith that feel threatened and try to discredit everything Dan Brown presents in his novel; and those who wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Brown and seek to reinforce the subject matter of his novel.  Additionally, in my personal opinion, both of these camps also seem to be motivated by a a desire to capitalize on the popularity of "The Da Vinci Code" for profitable gain.  While these types of exploratory 'history' books (and I use that term very loosely in this case) no doubt succeed in clearing a decent profit margin they fail miserably as researched historical treatises on the subject matter of "The Da Vinci Code".  Both, "The Rough Guide To The Da Vinci Code" and "Da Vinci Code Decoded" purport to be properly researched exploratory works with the former taking the side of discrediting much of Mr. Brown's novel and the latter supporting much of it.  However, what the astute reader will notice is that neither makes its case very well and both are guilty of the same gross error, namely not presenting any tangible historical reference to accompany the myriad of 'facts' (I use this term quite loosely as well) presented.  By this I mean, whenever they present any information, whether it opposes or supports Mr. Brown, there is no specific reference as to where that information came from.  As far as the reader knows, the author could be entirely fabricating the information themselves as there is no footnote and corresponding reference for the reader to check to ensure the author is not just asserting their own opinions as 'facts'.  While that type of writing is entirely acceptable in a fictional novel such as "The Da Vinici Code", it is most unacceptable in non-fictional writing where the claim is made that the book presents researched historical facts.  If the books are so well researched, where are the footnotes and references that will allow the reader to double check the facts themselves?  These books are in essence 'he said / she said" publications where it is the word of the author against the word of Dan Brown, and as such are of no use in the realm of legitimate historical study.  Please do not be fooled by the authoritative style with which these books are written, as they are essentially just someone's opinion and should not be taken as fact.  I would recommend the curious reader who desires to learn more about the subject matter of "The Da Vinici Code" to seek out and read academic historical texts for further information, but at the same time I would suggest taking that with a grain of salt as well.  Historical facts have a tendency to become distorted and manipulated over the years to serve personal and national agendas.  If you don't believe it is in human nature to manipulate historical accounts, consider this real world example: the Japanese government as of this day does not teach Japanese students about the atrocities and war crimes that Japan committed historically in Asia (atrocities and war crimes that are well documented by the rest of the international community).  The details have been stricken, literally, from Japanese school history books.  This is even more important when we remember that Japan actually lost World War II and yet they are still engaging in this type of activity.  Imagine if they had won...furthermore, imagine if the Germans had won: would the attempted genocide of the Jews even be spoken of today much less remembered in a couple hundred years?  These are the types of things one must consider when studying history. So, if you want to learn more about the Da Vinci code, ignore "The Rough Guide To The Da Vinci Code" and "Da Vinci Code Decoded", do your own research, keep an open mind, and decide on your own what seems most likely from a logical standpoint. 
 sstephen king can blame no one but himself for this missfire of a movie,because HE WROTE THIS JUNK! never finds it's feet, horror,comedy,drama,fantasy,adventure,and even thriller,it tries to be all and fails at each one!!! skip it!! 
  Like the last guy said, Nothing Sacred is such a bad@$$ hard rock song it makes you wonder what these guys were thinking when they threw the rest of the album together. There's a few hard rock/metal attempts but they all suck and none of them are effective in the least, with the exception of Nothing Sacred..definitely one-hit wonder status for these guys 
 I got this book when it first came out. Read it cover to cover and didn't find any biblical truth in it. I dusted it off recently and reread it. Still no truth found. Only half truths and omitted scriptures. One thing that I do agree with the author about is that there was less emphisis on Jesus in the WCG than there should have been. This they should have done and not left the other undone. 
 All during the 1960s, when authors still appeared on The Tonight Show, The Dick Cavett Show, etc, the two authors who had the most exposure and most  proclaimed their "genius" were Norman Mailer and Truman Capote.   Both fizzled miserably.  Their dwindling fame will be filed under  "Celebrity" rather than "Literature."  Mailer is the  better of the two, but he has not worn well 
 First, as always, the disclaimer. I am a regional author (Suomalaiset: People of the Marsh; ISBN 0972005064) and, like all authors, prone to fighting fits of envy. So, take what I am about to write with a grain of salt. I loved "Cold Mountain". Loved the premise,the historical truth, the characters, the setting, and the writing. I looked forward to the much hyped second effort by Mr. Frazier. The good news is that his writing is still exemplary. By that, I mean the man certainly knows how to turn a phrase. But that's about all I can say, in terms of positives, about this effort. The plot seems overblown and quite frankly, totally preposterous. The main character, Will, is thrown into wars, and disasters, and inclement weather, and every other kind of malady, only to survive, essentially unchanged and unscathed, while all those around him fall or fail. His ability to amass a fortune and hundreds of thousands of acres of land seems, given his humble beginnings, to strain even my vivid imagination. The descriptions of the landscape are lovely but lost in a plot that has no point. The first quarter of the book, the beginnings of a love affair between Will and Claire, the love of Will's life, has promise. Then, for the greater part of half of the novel, we are immersed endlessly in tedium surrounding Will and his adopted Indian tribe, the only point of which seems is to convince us that Will's greed isn't selfish, but done for the good his Red Brothers and Sisters. Far too late, and in a strained and surrealistic manner, the story comes back to Will and Claire. But by then, my patience was worn thin and the return to the real story, the interpersonal struggle between the lovers, had lost its appeal. Two stars might be a little light but that's how I see it.  
 I will not be passing it on to a friend.  The ending left me irritated; why should I close a book with questions in my head?  I will not buy another Picoult book.  I felt "snookered" by Keeping Faith and now I have been fooled twice.  I have to say I did enjoy the book up until the ending, but the Hannah ghost plot was unfulfilled and I was surprised to find out in the middle of the book that Ellie had short hair.  Why didn't I know that before?  Obviously, the characters would have benefited from better descriptions.  
 This book basically tells you alot of boring stuff. It takes the fun out  of Ancient Eygpt. It talks alot of who discovered what and when, more then  anything else, atleast that's what I saw. I stopped reading it after it  went on and on about people discovering the stuff. I mean, sure, we'd like  to know who discovered it, but we would like to learn more about what they  discovered, and what it means etc. This book is probably the worst I have  ever gotten 
 Wasted hours trying unsuccessfully to install the driver for the IOGEAR GIC251U 5-port USB card on a Dell Optiplex GX-1 running 98SE. (This computer already has 2 USB 1.1 ports.) The main problem is that the Add Hardware Wizard does not find a *.inf file in the IOGEAR-supplied CD folder and does not recognize the executable program that is in the CD folder. User has to cancel out of the wizard and execute the driver installation file as a stand-alone program. This results in installation of drivers that show up in the Device Manager. However, the installation wizard comes up at every subsequent reboot and the user must cancel out of it just to get the computer going.  Installed card seemed to work OK for a D-Link wireless adapter, but did not recognize a digital camera that was satisfactorily recognized by one of the non-IOGEAR 1.1 ports. The following actions did not help. (1) swapping the card to another PCI slot, (2) downloading and installing more recent driver file from IOGEAR website, (3) three calls to customer support, where I found sympathy but so solution 
 This story line is probably one you've already read by another author, and it's very easy to tell how the book will end.  The details of the book are original, and it does move along and hold your interest, but it's a repeat of a relationship between two people.  I was actually surprised that Ms. Steel would go down this road, and not offer something more original.  
 As is often the case with this style of music ( elevator , hospital lounges , dentist's offices muzak ), this is an unfailingly, numbingly pleasant, but unexceptional album that sounds appealing enough when it's on but isn't compelling enough to get excited about.  This is the sort of album that is almost anaesthetic, you put it on while peeling potatoes or folding the laundry - in fact, best not to put it on at all.  Absolutely safe , lazy , dull , boring , cheesy and fishy...nothing fresh or new.  Flat boredom.  In the same league of the latest albums by Rod Stewart , Selline Dion , Kenny G. , Carly Simon , Barry Manilow...you know what I am talking about....   
 I give this 2.5 stars, and that's mostly because 1. the gimmick/idea that ties together the "whys" of Dracula is interesting and 2. Gerard Butler has amazing screen presence.  The story: Baddies go to steal a hidden treasure (thinking valuable item). This item has been encased and entombed by Van Helsing (yeah, that Van Helsing), the guardian of this particular treasure. As you can guess, it's not jewels or the Holy Grail. It does have to do with blood: Dracula. Baddies get killed/turned. Dracula, who has some kind of psychic connection to Van  Helsing's daughter, Mary(estranged from Papa and living in New Orleans pre-Katrina), goes seeking the woman of his dreams. Nothing really interesting or spooky happens. Yes, folks get bitten. Yes, some get killed. Yes, nice guy goes to save Mary from a toothy fate. Sirens do their ho-hum thing to nice guy hero. Dracula has showdown with Mary. And...well...not giving the ending away.  Ultimately, we get a new (to me, anyway) spin on the tale when we find out how Dracula was created, and why silver and sunlight and crucifixes and holy water are feared and hated objects to Vampiredom. It's a somewhat elegant answer, but it can't satisfy for a lackluster preamble to the revelation.  Justine Waddell doesn't do much with her role. Christopher Plummer is rather wasted. Jonny Lee Miller has a few cute lines, but is kind of disposable, if likable. Omar  Epps didnt' get a chance to do anything worth watching. (He's much better on HOUSE, where he gets some real characterization and infinitely better dialogue.)  So, there's really only ONE reason to watch this film: Gerard Butler.  Now, putting aside for the moment that it's truly bizarre to have Dracula speak in a Scottish accent--fetching, but odd--one can overcome this oddity by the sheer personal magnetism of the man. He makes clunky lines shine through overwhelming emotive power, some real acting chops, and the physical presence to carry off the role. Oh, if they'd only put better lines into his mouth, and not just sharp canines! Only at the end does he really get to speak and emote and burn. It's lovely to watch, for however briefly. A genuinely excellent choice for Dracula, except that Scottish accent. Weird.  If you're a Butlerian Crushgirl--by all means, rent or buy this. The moments with Mr. Butler are worth the price. When he sniffs Mary, it's the kind of fully-dressed erotic moment that puts all the nude scenes in cinema to shame, and it proves that when you have people with intensity and charisma and screen "itness", an expression, a breathy phrase, these are more sensual than a million displays of nakedness and groaning.  If you're not a G.B. fan, or a serious Jonny Lee or Plummer or whomever else in the film fan, skip it. It's just not very good movie-making. All it's got in the end is the cool historical twist and Gerry Butler. For some of you, that may be enough.   Mir 
 You can hold this in both hands and your finger will only overlap a little.  18 oz's is a LOT of water 
 Hmm, I disagree with most of the reviews for this book.  I thought the photos were small and all looked the same -- I got absolutely nothing useful from them.  Additionally, this book glosses over some of the key things for many projects: turning and starting in a round.  I felt like I learned these stitches in spite of this book, as opposed to because of it.  Looking through  "Crocheting for Dummies" it looks like it would be much better by showing clear diagrams instead of photos and spending more time on things like when and how to turn, and what each stitch should look like 
 I am an Antonia Fraser fan, but I found this book disappointing.  It is very hard to follow.  There are too many characters to keep straight, too many different names for the same person.  Ms. Frazier sometimes refers to people by their family names, sometimes by their first names, and sometimes by their titles.  I found myself constantly going back in the book trying to figure out exactly who she was talking about.  In addition, I didn't find much in this book that I didn't learn in a college history course  The writing style is a bit stilted.  Some of the words she chooses to use are technically correct, but they have a slightly archaic feel to them and, in my opinion, interupt the narrative flow.  This is definitely not one of Ms. Frazier's better books 
 This is garbage! Ritchie Blackmore took himself way too seriously. He left Deep Purple for this? Grown men singing about fairies, kings, dragons and the middleages? For, like, all the songs?  "Man on the Silver Mountain" is a great, classic song (it is also acts as a bait switch...great first song and then all down hill from there). The instrumental at the end is enjoyable since it showcases Blackmore's guitar playing (which is the reason why most people checked this out).  This sounds so silly and dated today. Ronnie James Dio's voice was a bad match for this muscular sound.  Sorry metal fans, this stinks!   
 It was not want I was looking for.  No chapter summaries.  It is more a teacher's helper 
 In my opinion, this is an un-needed book.  Why does a DM need a book full of "monsters" that are vastly powerful GOOD beings.  In the vast majority of campaigns, the players are good, fighting the forces of evil.  With the monsters in this book, the players won't have much to do except watch the battle.  This brings up a minor complaint about D&D that I've had since the game first came out...why do the developers always give a slight power edge to good?  Wouldn't it make more sense to give a slight power edge to evil, since that's what the players will be fighting against.  Take dragons for example.  The most powerful good dragon (gold) is a bit more powerful than the most powerful evil dragon (red).  All this leads to is the DM having to come up with some reasoning why evil dragons outnumber good dragons, like in Dragonlance Chronicles with the abduction of the dragon eggs.  Well, enough rambling off topic.  Unless you're DMing a high level evil group, give this one a pass 
 This book is simply horrible. It takes the stereotypical accountant and shoves him into the pages. It is so lethargic and monotonous that all the valuable information within the book just stops making sense. This book should be read by anyone who has doubts about becoming an accountant. They'll drop everything and go into premed. Horrible 
 I got this as both a book and an audio file.  I had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author, but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts (e.g., I gasped when he suggested Christ went to Hell...what Bible passage evidences this?).  I agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep...but wonder if I go further how much more Eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations.  Where were his editors when this was being written?  Why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities?  I havent read all the reviews here but as one of those "conservatives" frequently mentioned in them I have to admit I may not even finish this book for fear of what else Eldredge has slipped up on.  I did appreciate his story about Daniel and the "delayed" angel...but am left wondering if I need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too.  What a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me.  We are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well..the Bible well.  So far...I may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize Christians and return to the Word itself.  I wonder if I can get a refund 
 You might guess when attempting to cram many thousands of years of human history into a few hundred pages, a lot gets omitted, and you'd be right.  It's kind of like a Classics Illustrated Comics (sans pictures) or an extra-large size Cliffnotes.  Davis writes from a very conventional viewpoint.  He uses a lot of simple words and short sentences, such as,"We evolved in different ways", "They had clever hands", "Dirt and trash were everywhere", and "Some of the Wrights made more and better planes."  He does manage to devote about six pages to the history of McDonald's, though. "Because of all the savings, Dick and Mac could now afford to chop their hamburger price in half."  Yawn... I think I'd have rather had a Classic Illustrated Comic... at least that had pictures.    I'm left wondering why this book was written. I don't see that it filled any particular need, and doesn't ask or answer any important or interesting questions.  I did not find it insightful.  I found it dull rather than entertaining.  Attempts at humor struck me as generally lame.  It is a least a little more portable than Will Durant's "Story of Civilization."  
 How about:  three centuries of gossip in the world of theoritical physics and mathematics...it's a lot closer to the content of the book.    Why do most physicists and mathematicians have to write about the human side of those who contributed to their fields instead of discussing the topics germane to their to main ideas.  I really would like to know about the constants, what their importance is and how they were discovered and developed, not about a debate at a conference in some place I've never been in 1879.  I had hoped, and had believed, that this book would discuss each of the constants in detail.  But, after weeks of teadous reading, I came to the end with my wish unfulfilled.  
 I was assigned this book for a class in East Asian-World Politics, so I read it thoroughly and was thoroughly disappointed.  The assumptions that this book is based on are fallacious and misguided, and the authors seem to  have no understanding of either Chinese political culture or the nature of  international relations. To begin with, the book spends most of its time  highlighting and exaggerating sources of tension between the two countries,  and seems to assume that every tension between two states will inevitably  lead to full-scale war.  This assumption is sadly mistaken.  In fact, the  United States and Canada have outstanding disagreements on a number of  issues, yet experience close relations and have the longest unguarded  border in the world. The book relies mostly on provacative statements made  by members of the Chinese Communist Party to support its thesis.  It  ignores the fact that it is common practice in Chinese politics to speak  loudly and negatively about whomever China currently disagrees with.  Just  because a member of the National People's Congress says war with the United  States is inevitable over human rights doesn't mean it will happen.  Have  the authors ever heard Jesse Helms (or many other senators, for that  matter) speak?  Note their reluctance to use force to settle the Taiwan  issue. The entire book comes off as a heavily-biased college paper on  US-Chinese relations.  The fact that they use virtually no primary-source  material or Chinese-language material not already translated adds to this  perception.  It appears that the authors decided the hypothesis of the book  beforehand, and simply searched for information to support their theory.   As flawed and biased a book as I have come across in a long time 
 this one simply is too mediocre not even qualified being good. i've read all iles' complicated yet fasinating novels, most of them carried the weight as any great book should be except some of the endings felt lame and rushed. but this 24 hours didn't hang on in my hands and lock up my eyes' over 24 minutes, i just returned it to the library the next day and would not think about re-reading it again. the other books such as the quiet game, sleep no more, blood memory, dead sleep are all great reading experiences, his first and second ones were just too jewish focused. concentrating on the south is a trade mark of iles, although after hurricane katrina, the nopd police force seemed to be a totally ridiculous lame duck and incapable of doing anything right, not as good as what iles described in his novels. all said, this time no cigar for you, poncho 
 I had great results with this product with the first use.  However, when I used it the second time, the triangular pad lost all of its abrasive surface, leaving me with a smooth, useless triangle.  I replaced the triangle, thinking I had a "dud", but had the same thing happen with the second pad.  The cream will work without the pad, but not as effectively.  If the manufacturer can come up with a pad that has a more permanent surface, they will have a winner with this product.  On a positive note, I love the facial product 
 I really did'nt like this book at all. I think that it is a very confusing and lame story. Sorry no hard feelings. I mean there was nothing there to keep me motivated and interested in reading it. You talked alot about Econ throughout the story which I thought was very cool, just for the simple fact this is for my Econ class. Its like your telling life time stories about yourself and others. You sure do have alot of characters throughout the book. Overall I think that the book is okay its just not a book for me 
 Of the over fifty books on leadership/coaching that I've read, this is by far the least useful.  There are anecdotes for basketball fans, but as far as useful ideas on success and leadership there are few.  It is the most useless book I've read in the coaching/leadership field (even worse than Coach K's or Dean Smith's). 
 I admit that I am not qualified to "judge" FW. Not because I am stupid, as many 5-star reviewers would assert, I think. I would consider giving up on THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO "stupid." I cannot judge FW as literature because literature is meant to be read, and comprehended. It is not complexity, depth, or any of the like that make this book incomprehensible to me. It is written in its own language. It is its own realm. To judge it would be like judging the writing of an alien civilization. And that is why I gave FW 1 star: it is nonscoreable.  This book--FW--seems to be Joyce's joke, or private world, or both. I doubt that any one who claims to love this book has "got it" in the sense that Joyce meant it to be understood, either. If one has the perserverance, one will find one's own meaning/pattern in FW, if only because it is human nature to impose order on chaos and...gibberish.   FW is certainly fascinating for its complexity of word games. As for the poetic quality of the words? I couldn't speak for that. When a word is over 20 characters long, a mishmash of randomness, I generally stumble like an idiot over every syllable. Thus: it was not fluid. It was not poetic.  Yet, for all of its puzzle-like quality, I could not call FW great literature. This is unreadable. Even if one knew all of the languages Joyce was acquainted with, it would still be, I think, unreadable. Joyce was the only one who understood it, and he is dead. I agree, the many interpretations FW has spawned are impressive; but also quite pathetic, if one considers how many scholars spent their lives trying to decipher this.  If there is any definite meaning here--any statement Joyce was trying to make--then he failed in conveying it.   I'd recommend that anyone who still has any doubts look up FINNEGANS WAKE online--one can find a free online copy. If still your ego insists on reading this, then purchase as many supplementary books as possible, and good luck 
 I loved AGent of Change, its one of those books you can read over and over, I couldn't wait until this book came out in prinT!  However this book does not have its charm.  THe characters are little flat, and I did not feel any empathy toward them.  I think part of it is that the writers were concentrating on getting the plot to a certain point and the characters suffered for it.  I would NOT recommend this book to a person who is just starting to read the Liaden series.  It would kill any interest in reading the other books

 Why does this man enjoy a reputation as a medievalist? Why does he have tenure at a prestigious university? If I were to try to write a book about ancient history, I couldn't dumb it down enough to compete with this "professor's" endeavors. Read the first chapter and decide for yourself. I guess that Tom Wolfe is right about the current state of American college classrooms, if this Cantor is any indicator of what is being taught on campuses these days (I am Charlotte Simmons).   Then again, to the people who glean their inspiration from Dan Brown % co when it comes to history and learning, I suppose that Cantor seems a sage by comparison. If you haven't studied ancient societies one iota, this book will serve you well as an introduction. For anyobe else I would suggest about a dozen other books by way of introduction. Try your hand at Fernand Braudel's HISTORY OF CIVILAZATION, HG Wells' HISTORY OF THE WORLD, and of the Cambridge or Oxford World Hisories, etc. Just put this claptrap out of your mind and don't even bother perusing it, as I made the mistake in doing.   This is the second book from this "medievalist" I've reviewed. All I can say is that it must be a very easy task to get an A in a course he teaches at NYU. So if you you have a son or daughter taking courses there, make sure they sign up for one of his classes. No problem when it comes to outwitting the "professor." Sorry to be so mean, but when it comes to medieval and ancient history, I'm a nudge. I happen to be a big fan of both Herodotus and Gibbon. Professor Cantor is bush league in comparison. No excuses for shoddy scholarship in a field you are supposed to excell in.    BE 
 Also, the book itself is complete crud, being nothing more tangible than one would expect to find in the National Enquirer 
 i have read 5 graham greene books and this is by far the lamest of them. this was conceived of first as a hollywood movie, and it shows. the book is not much more that a silly, corny thriller (just what hollywood orders over and over and over). there is very little character development involved, & the the sense of place (vienna after world war ii) could have been given much greater depth, as well. this is simply a plot being rushed onto the big screen ( a half-baked, lame plot, at that) to make some cash. pass this one by. 
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 I have never found a Jet Li movie I haven't truly enjoyed until this one.  Like a lot of his movies, there are a lot of martial art sequences and some are terrific.  But later on the lion dance competion is hectic.  There are lion costumers everywhere and it's hard to tell what is going on.  However, it is probably something you won't see in another movie so if you want to see a different kind of martial arts competition, try this but it may not be for everyone 
 Karen was a girl who had been to no exotic places so when her so-called "cousin" Blanch nvites her to England saying her dad gave permission, Karen is extremely happy. The story is sizzling and exciting,  the plot is unique, the escape is strategically planned.  I was kept in  suspense till the last page 
 I had been using this lotion warmer/dispenser for about six months when it broke.  The heating element still works, but the pump no longer produces lotion when pushed, rendering it useless.  Also, before it was broken, it was necessary to fill the well nearly full in order to get any lotion out, which meant refilling it nearly every week.  I don't recommend it 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 Throughout my read, my head kept shaking with disappointment.  If the "renaissance" of hard SF relies on stories a full decade, even two decades, old, then the genre's future is feebly fixated on its past.  Not to say that some of the stories here aren't wonderful ... emphasis on "some."  But dredging dead decades to claim a rebirth of hard SF fails to deliver on the title's promise.  This is more nostalgia than renewal, and you should read a library-borrowed copy if you want to reminisce about great writers past/passing.  But don't drop any real money expecting a glimpse into Sci-Fi's future 
 AGELESS BODY is Deepak's attempt to neutralize the word "old" as in old age.  The writer has a knack for making common words, like "body, "mind" and "self," into profound concepts.  His technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies.  But ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound.  	If you like poetry, Deepak may be your read: "The billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life; (P. 36)"  Or try to interpret this one: "The emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born. (P.40)"   	At times he attributes to cells and DNA a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible.  He would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over "intelligent design."  He can't accept the growth of any cell, even a plant cell, without an intelligence involved.  He mentions and attacks evolution only one time on P. 115, asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process.  	Deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms: Intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself.  Whether your word game tosses in the word "quantum" or not doesn't change much.  What a solipsistic thought; what a solipsistic world.  I wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness Deepak speaks of wouldn't, after awhile, go insane 
 Can the blind teach or write about the truth.No they stumble and fall.Someday God will open All eyes,and you will say to yourself,those strange people that seemed happy all the time and always got dressed up on Saturday to go to services were right.Not by our own greatness but by Gods mercy and love.Calling a very few now to teach you all,in the world tomorrow.Take care everybody and I will see most of you on the other side 
 The vendors never sent me the CD...I am very disappointed with the service this time through amazon.  
 ...and save yourself the grief of trying to learn anything from this book. This is the required text in one of my EE courses and I haven't found a single redeeming quality in it yet.  The material is not presented in a very concise manner I typically spend a great deal of time filtering through the chapters to find the important details. Most of the time I have to go to a text from one of my other courses to find what I am looking for.   The examples are few and not helpful in working the exercises at the end of the chapters.   Any good text on circuit analysis which covers the Fourier and Laplace transforms and their applications would be more useful. 
 Ms Rose is without a doubt a talented writer, but her work here is tediously self-indulgent and trite and sheds very little light on Proust, or indeed on his effect on her. Give it a miss and read the master! I don't think I'll be visiting Ms Rose's other work anytime soon.. 
 Not a very good book on any level. Not horrific, but overall really lame. A whodunit that you could never predict, because there was nothing to predict. It's like the author wrote the book and then when it came time to publish it, chose a character at random that 'did it' and wrote the last 10 pages. So save yourself some time, read the last few pages and make up your own adventure 
 After reading Skinny Legs and All, and loving every word, I bought this book on tape.  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with it and stopped listening after the first CD.  How many times do we need to hear about an extra large scrotum?  It must be repeated a hundred times, and it just wasn't amusing.  The reader, Barrett Whitener, tries to do the best he can, but his poorly contrived Japanese accent (which sounds more like a German accent), just doesn't cut it.  I'm sure if I gave it another 3 or 4 hours of listening, I might get hooked, but who has that kind of time to gamble?? 
 If you really know your stuff this book will never come into play only for someone just getting starte 
 This book is a joke.  It is written by a guy who has followed Colin Powell around and has taken a lot of notes on what he has said.  He then put together a bunch of Powell's stories and comments into this book.  The "secrets" are not secrets at all.  They are common sense to most people.  After the first couple of chapters I realized that I was wasting my time trying to read each word and just went to the summaries at the end of each chapter.  It's all summed up there.  Powell did not contribute to this book, he was merely a speaker who fed the author enough information to pull this book together 
 This book is a attempt to make people believe the "red menace" line of thinking, it never says that the soviet union was a defensive  nation, it's nuclear and conventional forces were all defensive, while nato and the US forces were always offensive one may look no futher then the american and soviet navy, the soviet navy was built as a defensive force using cruisers as the back bone of their navy with defensive missles, while our navy used aircraft carriers which we see today in the illegal invasion of iraq as tools to launch invasion from, Turkey 1961 anyone? yet another location was armed and placed within firing range of the soviet union, what was the soviet unions response to that threat? defensive missles placed in cuba to counter the aggressive american(and nato) approac 
 Me like this book. When I got my potty, I weared it on my head like the little girl in the book. Mommy said it looked so cute.  W E E W E E .......I DID IT MYSELF! YAY ME! I MADE A WEE WEE 
 I was very disappointed in the content of Dr. Rosenfelds book on alternative health.  It is clear to me that the millions of Chiropractic patients are more educated about Chiropractic than Dr. Rosenfeld himself.   With 66,000 licensed Chiropractors in the United States alone, the terms "alternative" have an ever-changing meaning.  I would not recommend this book to anyone searching for non-biased information on Chiropractic, or other "alternatives" 
 The title of this book is misleading.  to call it the new male sexuality is quite the statement and one would thinkit encompasses  all forms of male sexuality.  This is not the case.  I totally agree with writing a book concerning straight male sexuality but that should have been a subtitle to the book.  The doc chooses to simply ignore bi and gay men as if they didn't exist.  This is not the new male sexuality.  Male sexuality is much more then five to eight minutes in the missionary position.  Straight couples these days are experimenting with new ideas and techniques.  The penis is only one component to the overall male sexual make up.  there are other areas to be explored as well.  If you want the straight nuts and bolts I guess this book will do but if yu are an adventurous male, look elsewhere 
 Absolutely ridiculous tale.  Sappy to the extreme - - big yawn

 I got this from Dell with my laptop. For some reason Dell doesn't make their docking station anymore, so they just gave me this without telling me the brand and the model number.  I installed it with no problem, but then the video through its USB is so extremly slow. You will see about half second delay more your mouse pointer. Then while I tried connecting a serial port on the docking station, it couldn't transfer the data.  I tried installing a USB to parrelle port printer cable on the computer, some how the Targus drivers made my usb printing disable. It doesn't display any error messages at all. I had to test the cable on another Dell laptop to find out it was the docking station's proble 
 I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed with this one. I have been a big Bee Gees Fan since 1977, and also love to read Biographies, so I purchased this book as soon as it was released. It is an extremely disjointed read - there were a few different contributors, and it really shows - it seems like, as each writer finished a section, they just added the pages to the rest, with no thought to continuity or to the art of storytelling. Also, there are so many different names being thrown around constantly, that I had a hard time keeping track of who was who. It reads more like an encyclopedia than an artful biography with a story to tell. I consider myself a diehard Bee Gees fan, and I had a difficult time making it through the entire book. Definitely not for the "part-time" Bee Gees fan 
 Don't believe the hype.  This book is not a masterpiece, but if you are able to stick through the piles of metaphorical images that are at moments beautiful but most often don't quite make sense together and make it to the end of this novel you'll be pleased to find some actual action and true emotion in Justine.  It took me a very long time to read through the first half of this book.  The narrator is irritatingly affected and the writing drags with a myriad of descriptions that are uneffective at creating a cohesive picture.  But what kept me going were Durrell's secondary characters.  He has a nack for capturing and creating quirkiness that borders on bizarre and his stories of the more minor men and women in Justine are striking, emotional, and entertaining.  I am glad that I was able to make it to the end of the novel (there is a hospital scene that made it all worth while), but I do regret that I recommended this novel to my bookgroup and I do not plan to complete the quartet 
 Let me join the other reviewers in panning this book. The color illustrations are nice (compared to the Adobe manuals, which have gotten thin and have no color), but that's about it. The details just aren't there. For example, the author will show you the star tool, and talk about using its dialog box to set options, but doesn't mention using the Command (PC:ctrl) or Option (PC:alt) keys with this tool, nor what they do. So not only does it read a bit like a manual, but it's an incomplete manual. Beyond that, there's not much content -- try Cohen's "Creative Studio" book or Steuer's "Wow!" book, or better yet, get the video training from Total Training 
 I was lured by the idea of not having to buy lint roller refills ever again, but it seems that this lint remover is actually very hit-or-miss.  It does pretty well with lint and pet hair on the couch and other solid objects, but taking the cat hair off of my sweaters and jackets it another story...it just doesn't quite get the job done.  If your main concern is upholstery or some other fabric-covered item, this is a fairly good product for that, but traditional sticky lint rollers may give you more bang for your buck 
 Andrew Appel's textbook (Modern Compiler implementation in Java) has been prescribed as a Course Textbook. Given a choice, I strongly recommend to take it from the library or any place where you can get it for free for one semester/quarter. This book is not worth the money and is an absolute waste. Not only does it not teach you anything about compilers, but if you already know something, then it serves to confuse you.  The author has tried to explain things using an example and "steps" through the process of writing a compiler. So in that sense, if you are just looking to write a compiler and be done with it whether you understand it or not, then this book might be considered OK, though not good in any sense.   No theory about compilers is explained and the author seems to be talking to himself throughout the text 
 'Why I'm Not a Catholic but Still Insist I Am" would be a much better title. For somebody who claims to know so much about the Catholic faith (and disagree with so many of the Church's teachings), it's truly laughable for him to write a book in which he claims to be a Catholic 
 This mascara works great; it lengthens, separates, and defines your lashes and it doesn't smudge, but it's so hard to take off!  I used Lancome's Bi-Facil makeup remover, which is designed to remove waterproof mascara, but it was still hard to remove.  I lost quite a few lashes in the process.  I would recommend buying the regular Definicils, not the waterproof 
 I have never listened to Nic before I bought this.  Real mediocre 80s disco sound. 
 I'm of the opinion that King's books rarely translate well into movies, and this is no exception. Some of King's work is fantastic,  but unfortunately, a lot of it is simply tired old themes with nothing new. This falls into the latter category.  A novel about a novelist, and one who has a hard time finding inspiration: Please Mr. King, which college creative writing program did you steal this idea from? The writer's ideas showing up in real life: From whence do these fantastic ideas pour forth?  I won't bother to tell you the ending, because if you have the poor luck to watch the movie, you'll have already guessed it by the time you're half way through. It's all bad and hackneyed, from start to finish.  I will give Steven King credit for putting his fame to good use though. If anyone without Mr. King's fame and built-in fan base tried to sell a story this trite, their manuscript would never make it through the slush pile.   Maybe it takes a bunch of bad stories like this to turn out gems like the Gunslinger series, but it doesn't mean that we have to watch them 
 Not to put too fine a point on it but this book is DRY - almost like a text book.  There is very little action and/or suspense brought forth about involvement in the Angola operation and what could have been was quickly blunted with operational and bureaucratic detail.  And that's how the book drags on, with excruciating detail. In one part, Mr. Stockwell describes what he did to finally get a desk to work from at Langley by sitting in the hall in everyone's way and stacking his papers up beside him.  What took him pages to describe should've been done in a simple paragraph.  To be fair, the book is written from the viewpoint of an intelligence staffer not a cloak and dagger operative. Yes, there might be some interest in how inefficient the CIA was operating back in the mid-1970s but that's true for most large government organizations. He also describes some of the "political" machinations between officials within the CIA.  Again, mildly interesting but nothing notable. Some of the descriptions of dialog and reactions of persons seems contrived, almost as if he (or some ghost writer) added these things for effect. It almost "reads" like a fiction novel in that respect. Rather than writing a solid, crisp account with thoughtful and concise opinions about CIA policy and inner workings the book devolves often times into monotonous detail. However, in the latter chapters the account does get more interesting as he discusses "plausible deniability" and the deception of the CIA to "hide" their involvement. One of the more interesting parts is the organizational background and resources needed to run an operation of this type including the shipping of weapons and ammo, the propaganda strategy, the political workings thru committees, the State Department and the President to gain support, etc.  The book does makes one wonder what other rebellions or conflicts the CIA was involved in over the last 30-40 years and is an eye opener about our nations espionage policies. On this level, the book succeeds.  But, in the end the book was almost a grind to finish.  I'd only recommend this one for the hard core 'spook' fan 
 What a weird little skeletal-like woman.   Starving herself, giving up sugar (though she admits going back on in later books), working constantly, never having kids and dismissing them as tiresome, expensive burdens to one's career, bragging incessantly about dinner at the "Cap De Ville" (some tres elegant locale) while in Granada (some tres elegant locale), enthusiastically endorsing sleeping with married men while stating she'd die if hubby did, geez 
 I usually like this genre, but I am giving up on this book after 40 pages. I thought it would be similar to The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls, but it's not nearly as engaging. It was as if I kept waiting for the story to get started. I even flipped ahead from time to time to see if it got better. It didn't appear to.  I also got tired of the bad language 
 I am a Trevanian maniac. I buy every used copy of Shibumi I can find, just in case the world ends and I am left to wander the rubble with no chance of a new edition of Shibumi. get it? I love Trevanian. This new book? More closely resembled something my cat coughed up than Shibumi. Reading this new one, I was praying for the end of the world, just so I didn't have to finish the book. I finally tossed it aside after three hundred pages. Look, I understand that Trevanian prides himself on being a master of every  genre. Maybe I was the only one who loved Incident at Twenty Mile. But I found this new book to be boring, trite, petty, and poorly written, and it gets one star because, as a Trevanian diehard, I have no choice 
 I found Rick Hess's "humor" to be a bit hostile and sexist in places (such as on page 88 when he implies men would rather kill themselves than let their wives manage their homes.) It distracted from what is a serious subject. The probability chapter struck me as being quite irrational. Mr. Hess's states that there is no such thing as probability, that we are denying God's sovereignty, when we believe that 2 parents with blue-eyes are very likely to have blue-eyed children. What I think Mr. Hess is denying is the clear evidence that God *usually* acts within the physical laws he creates. Yes, he can override genetics and give a child any color of eyes he wishes--but under ordinary circumstances, we can safely count on God to follow the laws of genetics. Following Mr. Hess's statement that there are no laws of genetics, one could state that with each pregnancy they would have no idea if they would give birth to a human, a cat, or who knows what. How ridiculous! I'm not even sure how he thought this anti-probability chapter contributed to the central thesis of quiverfullness. If anything, it seems to take away from his argument, since if God is soveign and totally unpredicatable, then we have no reason to think that birth control would ever work anyway, so what would it matter if we use it? While the book makes an excellent case that children are a blessing and that Christians should desire to be blessed with children, it doesn't make a Biblical case that the use of non-abortifacient birth control is "sin". I think many Christians would like the issue to be cut and dried, but the truth is, God does give us choices in life. Many times there are equally valid choices. Sometimes one choice is "better" than another choice, but that doesn't make the lesser choice "sin".  Still, many informative & interesting points are brought up in the book. It is a quick read, and probably worth the read for someone seriously investigating this subject. In my opinion a much better read on this subject is "Birthing God's Mighty Warriors" by Rachel Scott 
 The awfully titled "Food of Love" was Catalonian director's Ventura Pons first English-language film, adapted from a not very good book ("The Page Turner") by American David Leavitt.  The result, I regret to say, was Pons' worst film to date.    The story concerns an 18-year-old aspiring gay pianist, his recently-separated mother and an older pianist with whom he has his first gay sexual relationship during his summer vacation in Barcelona (with his mother).  However, this is not a "coming out" film; all the problems are generated by the mother's feeling due to her divorce and, especially, the intergenerational conflicts between the two leading men.  (Sex is fairly tame too, and the nudity consists of shots of the young man from behind.)  Unfortunately, the movie is poorly scripted (the lines of dialogue are quite laughable at crucial moments) and, worst of all, badly acted.  Kevin Bishop, who plays Paul, the young man at the center of the story, gives a really terrible performance.  He is cute, though (the blonde, blue-eyed boy type), which may explain why he gets compliments in other reviews and even by David Leavitt (in the interview he gives on the DVD).  I'm sure if he were ugly everyone would comment right away on his bad performance. Paul is not a very likable (save physically) or believable character, either. (He also doesnt seem to be having much fun in his sexual relationships and he really mistreats his mother... and she lets him get away with it.)  The other male leads give bad performances as well, with zero nuances or depth.  To be fair, their dialogue is pretty bad to begin with.   The film's only saving grace is the great Juliet Stevenson, who is truly wasted in the poorly written (and cliched) role of the mother who is clueless about her sons (and his lovers) sexual orientation.  Still, Stevenson is such a talented(and funny) actress that she manages to make you care about the character by the end.    I recommend you skip this and rent any other of Ventura Pons' films.  He's an interesting director (hence I checked out this movie) but this film was a misfire from beginning to end.  
 First of all, I like to congratulate all the readers that read this book more than once.  That is quite a feat. ONE time is more than enough.  This book is so boring for a fictional read.  It reminded me of the movie, "Solaris", which is about going back in time only it added another twist: if you could change the past, would you?  Anyway, that movie is just as boring, but I must say it is better than this book because the actress is hot.  I thought the author's concept of "One" is quite confusing.  For instance, the chapter when Leslie encourages her younger self to pursue playing the piano, a path she had not taken, this will affect her life and what she is now.  In any case, I don't think one decision can totally change a whole person's life as some readers suggest.  If this was the case, we would all be in deep trouble.  There are always exceptions, such as deciding to buy that lottery ticket and winning, but usually it takes many decisions to shape one's life.  I don't buy this decision-making plot or the plot that everything is "One".  But two stars for the nice self-help pieces littered throughout the book and for the nice cover 
 Many reviewers compared this novel to Jurassic Park, saying it was a better book than Crichton's. What absurdity. I am not saying that JP is an awesome book, but it was far better than Tyrannosaur Canyon.  Tyrannosaur Canyon is a fairly intriguing story, but poorly executed and VERY poorly ended. It's as though Preston suddenly realized that he was going to have to get his characters out of the predicament he had put them in, and didn't know how to do it. The ending is too fast, too unlikely and too unrealistic.  The book closes with a theistic comment by one of the characters, which I believe is Preston's way of attempting to belong to both camps, having his science AND being religious.  Overall, I had high hopes for this book and I am sorry to say that in the last 100 pages, I was greatly let down  
 I am not a horror genre fan, but picked up the book when it looked like a good old-fashioned cheesy "mummy" story.  I admit it,  give me a story about a mummy or Egypt, and I'll often read it even if only for the chuckle value.  This book was so disappointing, that I did not even finish it.  The multiple plot lines vary from "fairly interesting" to unsettlingly sadistic and I found no reason to follow the stories through, even just to see if "it all comes together in the end" 
 As the title says, the remote sensor died a quick death so I got a replacement unit. The remote sensor died on that one pretty quickly as well.  I know that sometimes things go wrong with good products, but two sensors dying so quickly apparently was not a fluke. This is a cheaply made piece of equipment, so I guess you get what you pay for.  I gave a friend an Oregon Scientific unit three years ago and it is still going strong, so I'd advise you to stay away from La Crosse and go with Oregon Scientific 
 Quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book. Hopefully they will remake the movie soon, because the technical capabilities back in 1966 did not do the novel any justice 
 If Dennis O'Leary is a friend of theirs (after promoting this CD on Comedy Central) he should send them some new guitar strings so the band members can garrote themselves. Talk about a bunch of "songs from the darkside"...Jeez, all I can say is if you want to be depressed, go ahead and buy this. 
 I'm sorry I wasted the money. I can see by the reviews you either love it or hate it.  I'm not squeamish by nature, but this book is one continuous torture fest which not only targets human victims, but animals as well.  Three quarter's way through, when I realized this indeed was the premise from beginning to end, I started skipping these parts (which got me to the last page quite quickly). I was bored and disgusted with the author.  I believe he had a sick fetish and lived them out through these pages. In the end my eyeballs got six-pack abs from rollng around so much.  This book is going on my "Do Not Lend" shelf as I value my friends and wouldn't consider them subjecting them to such gory nonsense.  
 I've read this book twice, and I think I have some idea of what the author is trying to say now. (Mind you, I said I think).  The book is not a mere impressionistic pastiche (like Barzun's From Dawn to Decadence).  Mr. Gay is actually trying to say something.  The simplest way I can explain what that something is as I understand it is to write it out as succinctly as I know how:  The Romantic poets, especially Wordsworth and Shelley, their ascendency coinciding as it did with the ascendency of that new social class, the bourgeoisie, influenced society far more than is realized today...Shelley, for instance, whose name was considered unmentionable during his lifetime, became the model of what a poet should be by the end of the century, the ultra-respectable Robert Browning  one of his greatest fans.  All this fascination with the Romantics among the populace caused the society at large to look inward just when, paradoxically, vast strides were being made in what I guess we'll call the material instead of spiritual realm.-First off, I have to give my whole-hearted approval to the importance placed on Shelley as a cultural influence, just as Gay's Yale colleague Harold Bloom resurrected the importance of his literary influence.  Indeed, the two men are the only ones I know of to describe Dickens' work as more "magical" than "realistic."-But Gay's writing and his tone are not pretty.  I mean, he seems to have some bile built up against the age he is describing.  Unlike Bloom, he seems pertly averse to the inward-directedness of the 19th century, and his writing on it frequently verges on mockery.  As he says (sneers) on page eight of the introduction, "...what is the self that Victorian bourgeois seemed so intent on discovering and defining?"-The Naked Heart?-The problems I have with this book are that a)There is a lack of urbanity or even drollery that leave one emotionally deflated after reading it; b)Gay never delves into what is wrong, per se, with what we nowadays call spiritual searching; c)Much of the writing is just plain bad-Perhaps Gay expects us to take from the book's title that something is seriously wrong with a society preoccupied with uncovering something so personal.-The book is confounding in all these respects.  Really, when it comes down to it Mr Gay seems to be saying (ever so subtly) that Victorian "culture," as it were, was a sentimental waste of time.-You have to have grown pretty bald on the pate to write something so....heartless 
 Even with the questionable veracity, I enjoyed Frey's first book, A Million Little Pieces, since it stayed true to an addict's experience.  Leonard, on the other hand, came off as pure fantasy, with very little substance.  Even the description of Frey's struggle was too contrived to be believable.  It was not even interesting as fiction. 
 I bought this for my mother a year ago, and I was recently looking for a vacuum myself, so being a person big on checking reviews on items before purchasing, I asked her how she liked it. She said she liked it, and thought it worked well, and loved how light it was (she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis). So... needless to say I went out and purchased it, trusting mother deartest's opinion.  I HATE IT!   I just moved out of my house, and I had to clean (vacuum) every room in the house. It took three times the amount of time it would ave taken a regular heavy Hoover vacuum to do the job. One sweep for a normal heavy vacuum turns into thirty for this piece of s*** just to pick up some damn crumbs.   Also, you have to clean it out every five minutes because the filter gets covered so easily, after only vacuuming about half a room.  It WILL NOT suck up hair. Rather, it gets tangled in the wheel, and looks like a thirty year old hairbrush that was never, ever cleaned out. Hence, making it harder and harder to pick things up (not that it does to begin with).  It's loud, time-consuming, and the biggest waste of money.  The only thing it has going for it is its weight, which is highly overshadowed by how much it sucks anyway.  OH... AND I've used this product ONCE. ONCE! One time of use pretty much was all it was worth. IF THAT.  I'm taking it back... and throwing it at them.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PEOPLE!! 
 The Edith Wharton novel this movie was made from was beautifully written, sensitive and poetic. While this movie was visually appealing and faithfully rendered the story, the performances of Gillian Anderson and Eric Stoltz were painful to watch. Ms. Anderson especially, while a great beauty, so overdid her lines that I was reminded of high-school plays that I've seen. For emotion or drama, she spoke moreloudly. Her lines were raced through, and punctuated by strange words being stressed. And while she was trying to be distraught, or betrayed, or vulnerable, her face showed no emotion at all. A little bit of eye-brow raised, or pouting lips, but that was all. Eric Stoltz was little better. I couldn't help feel that Ms. Anderson was out of her depth as an actress. Bur Mr. Stoltz, who I've seen in many good roles, was inexplicable. Maybe it was the directing that failed them.  This was so disappointing to me, as I had really wanted to enjoy it, and I had so enjoyed "The Age of Innocence," with Winona Ryder, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Daniel Day-Lewis. But this production, from a superior book, really fell short. I would recommend the PBS version, with Geraldine Chaplin, if it were in any way available 
 The advertising of this product on your site is kind of deceiving, because it doesn't properly show it. From what I saw on the Amazon site, I thought the wallet will be much bigger.  Amazon doesn't give measurements of the product, and there are not enough pictures of the it. Basicly it isn't worth it to buy a product if I'm not sure of how it looks like.  Now I have a wallet that my husband does not want, and I can do nothing with it.  I feel that I wasted $25.00 
 inconsequential jargon  This pseudo-philosophical work is long, insubstantial and boring. The author tries to hide his sterility by avoiding the very basic and fundamental social and human problem, the problem of universal injustice. One wonders why on earth someone should attempt such a work! The title itself betrays the author's philosophical incompetence: "A Theory of Justice." Hasn't he read Plato? Doesn't he realize that justice is not a theory, but in fact practice? What on earth is a theory of justice, which cannot be put to practice? Right at the beginning of his book Rawls insists on a "veil of ignorance" in order to have fairness to start with.; that is plunging into a book, which has nothing give, which can do nothing to change the world we live in. We are not blind. We know too well that there can be no justice in a society whose members are not blind and deaf, and know too well that there are differences separating individuals. How can anyone insist on capitalism, annual growth and availability of goods for all when the world is limited and the earth with its limited natural resources cannot sustain unchecked human growth? And what is more, he can never define what good are, which must be available to everyone. Is raw materialism justice? Are we chickens in a coop, absolutely predictable? The author should have examined the history of philosophy a little more carefully, which is nothing other than a series of failures in putting the cart before the horse, that is theory before practice.  Haven't we learned the lesson from communism and its disastrous results? Marxism too was an elaborate theory, but in reality turned out to be a gross injustice to all. Is the unquestioned democracy the final truth? Before embarking on another long, empty and pretentious "theory" without foundation a thinker should make him/herself well acquainted with human nature. It is too bad that this jargon is often taught at colleges and universities, forcing nave students read this book, discuss it, and even worse, write term-papers on it. For those who wish to have a clear-cut understanding of social problems and a sound theory of justice I recommend Plato's Republic.  Academic jargon is not philosophy. 
 This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever wasted my time watching! Don't dispose a precious cent on this movie unless you are a gigantic Drew Barrymore fan and you are merely viewing the movie for the raw sex scenes and constant,random nudity. The storyline could have worked, yet the movie is pathetically low budget, the acting is horrid and the movie falls desperately flat. It is impossible to like this movie unless you are obsessively in love with Drew Barrymore and you want to watch her at her lowest point. It's so bad that I had to come here to  vent about it online. The director was obviously a film school drop-out who offered the actors free cocaine and produces low budget porn. 
 A useful book that provides a good summary comparing differing Accounting Standards and approaches between countries.  However, it is not worth the price.  It is supposedly written for later year undergraduate and masters accounting students.  It is more suitable for general second year accounting students.  Plus, as I am working with a multinational European bank in Japan, the book is, rapidly becoming, out of date.  There is none of the simply but incisive commentary which can be found in other books about the differences and outcomes of general accounting principals drawn from different countries 
 About this book and author - Since being in the lifestyle for many years my wife and I have been very fortunate in our experiences.  We have been invited into many homes and attended many parties.  It doesn't matter if you're a CEO of a large corporation or a bus driver all are welcome, it's a very level playing field based on trust, honesty, and just people getting to know people.  Now the author of this book and his wife were also invited to some of these parties, homes, and clubs using fake names, Terry and Debbie.  Turns out they're named Jerry and Susie.  Then they move out of town and write a book using everyone's real names.  What's that all about? Sometimes it's not what you do but how you do it.  It's a shame Jerry never had someone to teach him some values.  If this book was about the lifestyle that would be one thing, the truth is it's about a very short 52 year old guy with a Napoleon complex and the love affair he has with himself.  He writes about how all women love him and all men are inadequate or oafs.  If he was entered in a contest at a club and didn't win it was fixed in his opinion.  That's the whole book.  I just saved you $17 bucks.  This is not a swinger's handbook.  If you are already in the lifestyle or thinking of getting into it or just want to know more I would not suggest this book.  It's trash 
 This book was suggested reference material for a college course of study at FIDM.  Initially I thought this was a paperback condensed version of the hardback book.  Upon receipt I found it extremely difficult to read without a magnifying glass - the print is literally micro-small.  At first I blamed my aging eyes, but my nineteen year-old daughter whom I purchased the book for has 20/20 vision, and she expressed a similar opinion.  I would not recommend this version of the book - if you have the option, purchase the full size hard bound copy 
 Readers should be forewarned that this is a polemical tract rather than a work of evidentiary historical scholarship. The idea that Chinese science was "ahead" of the West (however we define the West) is not new at all; it was a central theme of Joseph Needham's work half a century ago, some of which has stood the test of time and much of which hasn't. At least Needham and his collaborators were able to draw original Chinese sources into their studies (and the later works of his collaborators in "Science and Civilization in China" are mostly excellent). Hobson's work is laden with casual and unsubstantiated assertions, overuse of silly and undefined terms like "economic miracle," and unduly credulous readings of previous scholars who had their own axes to grind. As for individual  critiques of his specific assertions about such issues as iron production, currency flows, etc, I'll leave that to the reviewers in the standard professional journals, if they bother to review this book (Although I'm sure it will be warmly received in some fields, like cultural studies, where the citation of prominent European intellectual theorists is more important than having reliable Chinese sources). In sum, this is a contribution to the growing ranks of Sino-triumphalist works by western writers guided more by recent politics and economic trends than historical evidence. A common feature of this group, apparently, is to think that because some of their predecessors have made ridiculous Eurocentric claims minimizing China's significance in their own works, that means it's somehow advisable to make equally absurd and unbalanced Sinocentric claims now - in fact, because the transparency of this approach is so obvious, it ends up preaching to the converted. My plea to others working in the same field: learn to read Chinese and look at some actual texts to check whether they support your arguments. For readers in search of more legitimate works in English about Chinese science, I heartily recommend "On Their Own Terms" by Benjamin Elman, published by Harvard University Press, which seems to be taking up the mantle so unfortunately cast off by Cambridge University Press 
 I would strongly recommend you to get "The Mahabharata" retold by C.Rajagopalachari. This is the best version of the Mahabhatata you can ever read!!! Please do not buy the version by William buck.. 
 Set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War, "Talk of Angels" could have been provocative and sweeping, but it settles for little more than standard-issue Governess Falls for The Rich Guy romance. Vincent Perez has a smoldering presence, but the beautiful Polly Walker is as flat on screen as a Fascist protest poster. The two have little chemistry. The result: a stilted and perfunctory outing. The only saving grace is the always wonderful Frances McDormand, whose hard-bitten, love-struck fellow governess offers a sad little bit of zest 
 I'm not sure what this book is supposed to be -- a tell-all? An exploration of the history of cleaning and its place in western culture? A treatise about the underclass? I think part of the problem is that the author herself is not sure where she is, in the metaphysical sense. I couldn't tell why she was a cleaner. If she liked it. Even where she lived! And as far as "other people's dirt," there was precious little here. Not at all what I expected. I was more than a little annoyed at the curious tone the book took towards the idea that those who hire cleaners are somehow exploiting them... Very confusing. I was looking for an author who was going to dish some dirt and instead got an earful about Marxist theory 
 First off, there are 356 entries in this book, not 366 like the cover and title indicate.  That huge and glaringly obvious mistake is representative of the lack of attention paid to the rest of the book.  "Everyday Mind" is a disappointing collection of out-of-context excerpts from magazine articles and book snippets.   There is not even one original entry in the whole book.  The content is quite light for anyone really interested in Buddhist thought, let alone anyone interested in really improving their lives.  I wasted fifteen bucks on this one 
 The Mangree/Camoudile Puzzle half way through the game is so damned difficult to solve - and you can't continue the game unless you do solve it. After a year of trying to solve this puzzle I chucked the game away in abject frustration - as have a couple of my colleagues for the same reason.  What were Ubisoft thinking? Be warned 
 This is a rather peculiar film for Seagal, and the first thing that should be pointed out to any Seagal fan contemplating whether or not to give this one a try is that this is really not an action film.  Seagal only has a couple fight scenes in the whole film and they are all extremely brief.  In fact, they are extraordinarily brief, though thankfully free of wirefu.    Though Out of Reach is by no means a total failure (it's actually pretty entertaining, Seagal as always is fun to watch, and some of the scenes are well done), the script nevertheless exhibits some problems and plot holes.  This film is a drama about a nature nut (Seagal) who roams the forest looking for injured animals.  He has a pen pal in Poland, a young girl, and when he hears that she will no longer be able to correspond with him he becomes so upset that he travels abroad to look for her, even though he really has no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with her.  This brings up the main problem with this film, namely, a lot of it simply doesn't make any sense.  It turns out that the girl has been sold to a human trafficking ring, and Seagal goes through the motions to save her.  As per usual with Seagal nowadays, he obviously refused to actually finish the production, and so we have the usual dubbing problem here.  It is even more salient than usual in this picture, however, for here we have not one, but several different people dubbing Seagal's voice, none of whom even remotely sound a thing like him!  Here the most frequently heard fill-in for Seagal sounds like a knock-off Benecio Del Toro with a much higher-pitched voice.  As you can imagine, the effect is very humorous.    As stated above, the main problem with this movie is that it simply doesn't make sense, which was apparently realized by the director, as he has, in many scenes, the voice fill-in for Seagal narrating an explanation of what the character is thinking! How obnoxious!   Seagal's character likes to teach codes and ciphers to his pen pal, which she later uses to communicate with Seagal.  What makes no sense is that every time she leaves a message for Seagal, the villian, ineptly played by Matt Schultz, sees the girl doing it and yet leaves the message for Seagal to find! In one ridiculous scene the girl arranges some caviar on crackers to make a code.  (Apparently three crackers of one kind followed by three crackers of another kind followed by three crackers of another kind means "This is a trap.")  The villain sees her doing this, and, instead of destroying the message (which would make sense), later has it delivered to Seagal! Huh? In a scene when the girl leaves a message on a mirror telling Seagal where she is, the villian sees her doing it, comments on how clever she is, but then leaves the message!   There are also quite of few mistakes in this film, several of which are laughably obvious.  At the beginning and end of this film, for example, Seagal has long hair which looks like frizzy, black cotton candy being pulled off the back of his head.  During the rest of the film, however, he has short hair.  At the end, after some BS macho dialogue about how Seagal hates taking life but will enjoy killing Schultz slowly, each character uncocks his pistol even though Schultz's pistol does not have an external hammer to uncock, and even though in the very next closeup Seagal's pistol is still cocked! After a sword fight, which ends on a classic move from older chambara films, notice that there is clearly no blood on the floor, and that then, all-of-a-sudden, there is a huge trail of blood between the two characters.    In the finale, the above-mentioned sword fight, the camera cuts between closeups of the two characters to faraway shots that are clearly of someone other than Seagal.  This brings up another frequent complaint of many Seagal fans: his overuse of stunt doubles.  It's almost so bad now that one could say that he doesn't even film his own fight scenes now.  Have you ever noticed that in Lord Steven's early films, when there was a fight scene the camera would pull back and let you see his moves? Now what happens? The camera gets as close as possible, shows some shots of his face grunting, shows some arms playing paddycake, then pulls back showing some fighting while never showing Seagal's face.  Ever wonder why? It's because, surprise, surprise, that's not Seagal doing the fighting.    In the gun fight, which is actually a very decent action scene, watch Seagal as he enters the room.  His character enters the fight by doing a foward aikido roll, which is probably the simplest move in aikido, though it is obvious that it is not Seagal doing the roll.  What is even more irksome is that both at the beginning and the end of the film, which shows Seagal's character "roaming the forest looking for injured animals," or whatever, it is clearly not Seagal that we see walking through the forest.  Was he afraid that he'd trip over a branch and injure himself? Was he afraid he'd be attacked by an injured animal in the woods? I don't know.  What is likely the case is that Seagal again refused to finish the shoot and some scenes had to be constructed after-the-fact, using another actor, in order to make the film work.  I'm really not bashing Seagal, I'm merely complaining because these are persistent types of flaws in his recent films that could VERY easily be fixed.    Be on the lookout for the bizarre scene when Seagal goes to the post office.  The postal worker calls Seagal "Mr. Delacraw," or some such bizarre name, even though his character's name is actually Billy Ray Lancing.  Seagal then proceeds to mumble some French to the man, and then suddenly adopts a cajun accent.  This scene is downright strange.  What is also strange is how Seagal is dressed in this scene--like some kind of New Orleans Anne Rice fan, vampire wannabe in a strange, black fur coat.  I don't know, at least it's good for a laugh.   If Seagal continues in this manner he will quickly find himself unemployable.  The only truly schocking thing is that this hasn't happened yet.  He shows up late to shoots, leaves early, refuses to finish productions, and yet people keep hiring the man.  He repeatedy refuses to do the requisite work for a complete production.  He needs to start finishing his films.  In closing, Out of Reach only has two VERY brief fight scenes, but they are somewhat well done.  Seagal actually takes a few blows in the climatic fight, which is a very nice change and certainly makes his character seem more human.  
 If you are someone who is interested in learning the actual history of gay culture from 1947-1985, then move on.  This was the longest book I ever wasted my time reading.  I'm sure the author is a very talented writer, but the title and cover were misleading as to the contents of this book.  For someone wanting to do actual historical research, this book is a pointless collection of trivia centered around what would be considered extremely stereotypical gay 'interests'-most notably a continuing thread running through the book that rehashes the movie "All About Eve."  Several times.  A culturally elitist book about a whole lot of nothing 
 I bought this book in preparation for a party.  When the book showed up, I was severly disappointed - it's basically the same recipe over and over again using different tequilas.  The book does briefly talk about a lot of different tequilas and has a few (and I do mean few) recipes for other margaritas (fruit etc).  But instead of buying this book, try [web address] you'll find a much better variety and save yourself the money 
 This one is perhaps the worst one I've seen of the Jason series. I couldn't even sit though it all. 
 I have bought this product and i have gained 5lbs. It didnt worked on me. I guess you just have to try the product. I just ordered hoodoba, on amazon and hoping that will work. Hoodoba has good ratings 
 DW Griffith was amongst the early filmmaking pioneers, the battle scenes set the standard for what would follow in the next several decades.   He was also a southerner full of racist angst with a vehicle to vent his toxic spleen. Not only were many of the present day stereotypes of African Americans either started or reinforced by this film he goes one further and rewrites the outcome of the civil war. Anyone who thinks this is an accurate portrayal of reconstruction and the mission of the KKK is sadly mistaken or prone to the same sort regressive school of thought that denies the holocaust, thinks the native Americans had a chance to fight back, and believes the history of man began 6,000 years ago.  This is actually a great tool for teaching tolerance. When it is presented in the classroom most students can plainly see the contradictions between this film and legitimate history.  Those who do not see the contradiction (versus legitimate history) as obvious need to catch up on some reading and/or have some type of moral reevaluation regarding their thinking. 
 After watching "Anthropophagus- The Grim Reaper", I came away with mixed feelings.  On the one hand, "Anthropohagus" had its moments (albeit quite few) where it was somewhat chilling.  The Anthropohagus, himself, was rather effectively creepy as a horror movie villain.  Some scenes did fairly well building up to a moment of horror, but the problem is that these effective moments of horror are few and far between.  Unfortunately, the majority of this movie is beset with horrible acting and a very cheaply made horror movie, and for some reason, it is just very difficult to get over this fact in "Anthropophagus" probably because these weaknesses are so glaring.    "Anthropophagus" may even have outdone itself with some of the gore scenes, so the gore-hound shouldn't be disappointed with this flick.  However, with that being said, "Anthropophagus" simply is not all that scary except for the few moments that deliver a scare or two to the audience, and even those moments are fairly pedestrian when compared to the classic horror movies we have come to know and love.  Ultimately, what you have in "Anthropophagus" is horrible acting, a poorly written screenplay, uneven and poorly developed plot and action, below average plot execution, just a couple of scary moments, some laughable scenes, a fairly decent amount of gore and an absolutely disgusting, deplorable and depraved scene of violence (fetus scene) that really crosses all boundaries of horror movies that I've ever seen and which really offers nothing as far as the merits of the movie are concerned and certainly offers nothing to cinematic horror.  If that kind of thing appeals to you, this could be right up your alley, but it doesn't do much for me.  I would rather find a really compelling storyline and a scary movie that delivers atmospheric tension, suspense and a scary story, and you simply do not get that in "Anthropophagus".  To answer a few questions that could be asked about this movie...did "Anthropophagus" bother me? No.  Did I think it was scary?  Certainly not, laughable at some points in the movie but not scary, and nor did I find it disturbing.  However, it can certainly be said that what else do you expect from a low-budget Italian-made horror flick? Touche!    In my search for a great horror movie lost in the annals of cinematic horror like a needle in a haystack, what did I find in "Anthropophagus" but another shock and gore horror movie with horrible acting and a barely watchable storyline.  Indeed, it is very difficult to give this movie any credit.  A word of advice, if you have to try to make yourself like a horror movie even after repeated viewings (like I did with this one), it probably just sucks.  For all intents and purposes, that is the case with "Anthropophagus-The Grim Reaper".  Nevertheless, sadly, I've seen much, much worse. 
 And I don't care anymore. If liking this album is the only way I can be cool in the world I say to the world F**K YOU!!! I never liked this album for the most part. From the first riff of "Black Dog" to the last riff of "When The Levee Breaks". There was some breaths of fresh air on the song "Going To California", but the rest of this is overplayed, and way too much requested. "Black Dog" is just annoying, "Rock And Roll" is good for the first half, but when the 3rd verse came into play it just fell flat. "The Battle For Evermore" is good for the most part, but when Plant repeats that one word over again it sounds like a cat meowing, and it gets on my nerves, then you have "Stairway To Heaven", and all the glory it's recieved as a holy hymn to Satan, but to sing it you must play it backwards, "Misty Mountain Hop" has some good sounding drums, but that's all it has going for it, "Four Sticks" the best version of the song is done by an anonymous band off the compilation "The Song Retains The Name", and "When The Levee Breaks" is a depressing lament that kills the ears, soul, spirit, and just makes you want to pull a gun out, stick in your mouth, and pull the trigger. I know that I think it's the worst piece of S**T that I've ever heard. Now that you know how I honestly feel about this album I can move on. I no longer care if you like, or hate me. I'm free. 
 I heard from the net from many people this was the best anime movie out there so I decided to see it.  Well this movie is old and I would probably say this movie was the best movie on it's time but not no more cause I thought of the story being lame but the movie was more focused on the action scenes which I may say they do I alright job when it comes to action scenes.  But if you like a some great action scenes, sex, weak story then go and rent it and see if you might like it.  2 stars is what I give it cause really not even average to what anime movies can reach at these days. Cause I expect more in anime movies than hollywood movies. But if I were to rate this movie when it had came out probably a 4.0 out of 5.0 but these days story and characters are big parts in anime that should grip you and let you go when the movie ends.  Verdict: 2.1 out of 5.0  An alright movie to see in the weekends if you are bored but when you want to see something good look elsewhere 
 This has not aged well. The scripts are silly, the acting is of the "chewing up the scenery" variety. Gale Storm no longer seems cute; she comes across as annoyingly perky. Spend your money on something else 
 Instead of hangers to hold this up they use velcro. This puts strain at the top and eventually cracks the thin peice of wood holding it straight. Great for holding air, not great for holding items 
                 This review is in reference to "Nancy Drew: Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon Game + Strategy Guide" edition.                                               I've played 3 or 4 of the Drew games.  This one played faster and was over before the time it took to install the game.                                               Before I had installed 'Blue Moon Canyon', I had installed "Morrowind the Game of the Year Edition", which sold for five dollars less than 'Blue Moon Canyon'.  Morrowind is a huge 4 disc game that has, at the bare minimum, 400 hours of gameplay, and possibly might literally be endless.  The entire Morrowind set had been installed and up and running within 15-20 minutes.                                    After I had installed and played 'Blue Moon Canyon' we installed and got up and running "Age of Mythology Gold" also within 20 minutes. This is another massive game, a Real Time Strategy game that included the expansion pack "The Titans". Both 'Mythology' games were completely installed.  This is another game that can be played and explored for years.  The two game set sold for five dollars more than 'Blue Moon Canyon', or the original full retail price of the strategy guide edition.                               "The Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon" took so long to download...we went out for dinner and let it download while we were gone.  We have a P4 at 3.2Ghz, an 80GB HD, of which only 23GB were used, and 1.5 GB of RAM.  There is no reason on earth why Nancy Drew games should take so long, over an hour, to download...unless their copy protection program conflicted with our Toshiba Super-Multi Drive drivers.                                 The actual installation was not as painful as the download.  What was painful was the gameplay.  I had a lot of fun playing the 'Secret of the Old Clock'.  Whereas most of the Amazon user reviews came across as lukewarm to the game, I liked playing the golf game, and the car chase, and the "bank shots" of reflective light beams to be aligned.  I even felt proud when I finally got the sewing completed.                                  I knew that the Drew games wouldn't deliver the value that the two games (mentioned above) did.  But after the reading the reviews of 'Blue Moon' I expected to have more fun than I did with 'Secret', even though I knew it would be short lived.                             What a let down.  The game was over in two or three hours. Most of the gameplay was a memory test of what order what button was pushed or stick was knocked over, or  which way the track leaned to.  The 'arcade' games in the General Store were just hit the button or in this case 'click the mouse'. You didn't even have to look.  The most complicated task was getting a piece of paper to do a rubbing. It was very boring.                             Between the price, the concern over the length of the download, the most unimaginative gameplay set to walking back and forth on a train, I cannot recommend this game as being fun. It had a few moments with the Math/scale problems but it wasn't enough to carry the game or balance the huge amount of needless dialogue the player has to endure listening to.                                                  I realize I'm an adult, but the eight year-old little girl (I bought it for) lost interest after the first 15 minutes.  She was wiser than I.                        Sorry Nance, this one is a waste of money, and might contribute to hardware damage with driver conflicts.                                 marf   
 I've studied in IT major and my professor use this book as the main text for this subject. Even though I'm not English/USA but I read many text book before. unlike the other texts, this book is pure nightmare.. use very bad language and very hard to intrepret what the author try to communicate..  Moreover, the picture in the text represent nothing. I get nothing from the figure and it's totally useless. I try to find a group of people and let all of them help to translate the books. Surprisly, most of them do not understand the text as well as I am and we cannot conclude what we can get from the book.  I ask the senior student who already pass the class I'm studing, all of them said that this is the worst text book that we had seen in thier real life.  - hard to read, (no common-fundamental word here.., author always use high level descriptive language ) - expensive - dull - case study that hard to understand / useless / old / not update - lots of fussy comma.. will cause you headache. - etc.  Finally, I advise that you do not purchase this title and all title compose by these author unless you already did read it first 
 I bought Trawler because I had read O'Hanlon's previous books, Into the Heart of Borneo and No Mercy, and so thoroughly enjoyed them, I could hardly put them down.  By contrast, Trawler was such a huge disappointment, I could hardly bear reading it until I finally put it down for good without finishing it.  It's full of the kind of fishing and sailing detail of Moby Dick, but without Melville's nuance or complexity.  Instead, we get an insignificant frenzy of unrelated "facts" that we might expect from someone in a drug-induced state, who imagines that each experience during that time is fraught with deep significance.  It's perhaps telling that early on, O'Hanlon admits that "months after the contract was signed," he still owed his publisher a book.  Trawler ought to serve as a reminder not to let term papers go unwritten until the night before they're due 
 This book was NOT FUNNY.  Anybody who compares it to Woody Allen is hurting Woody!  He wrote about his imagined friendship with President Kennedy; not funny.  The Hansen's Christmas letter each year was not funny.  Even the discussion of Martha Stewart's vagina was not funny.  The book looked like it was trying too hard and totally missed the mark. The title could have been really funny and wasn't.  I bought it in the aiport and had a long plane ride and was really psyched to read it.  The book was lousy from beginning to end and I don't even recall anything funny in the entire book.  Don't waste your money.  See the show, but don't bother with such a lame book. I would have given it NO STARS, but the system wouldn't let me 
 People who did this atlas wanted to cut their job and limited the Eastern Europe by deviding it by two parts. One and very big part of the Eastern Europe is not in the Historical Atlas. The biggest European countries such as Ukraine and Russia as well as other countries - Baltic states, Belarus, Armenia, Georgia, etc. are not concidered to be Europe in so called Historical Atlas of the Eastern Europe. I would reccomend the authors to get some geography lessons before making any other job.. 
  I got this mat for my 3 month old, I was very disappointed with it. It is a very hard plastic,..and has sharp edges. It isn't plyable enough for a baby to pat and play with.. I was swooshing the water around trying to soften it up some and it split at it's cheap and sharp seems..Water went everywhere.. Thank god my infant wasn't playing near or on this product when this happened. I won't be buying anything from WHOOZIT again 
 The "Journeyman" is the most confusing Western I have ever seen, and I've seen hundreds and hundreds. Filmed along the border in the Big Bend Country of Texas the story is a complete mishmash to the point of sometimes being unable to determine which character is which. Don't be misled by Willie Nelson's name in the cast: he's killed off in the first minute. The writing, direction, and acting (except for Barry Corbin) are all abysmal. You will be disappointed in the film 
 I think  Mallory and the Dream Horse was a good idea for the BSC series, but it wasn't as detailed as other horse books. I should know that a white  ribbon in a horse show is 4th- I have 2 of them! Still, good idea. ALSO-  riding instructors should NOT let their riders pick what horse they want to  ride; that could be bad for all 3, and maybe even cause fights. The horse  and rider's bond wouldn't be as strong, either, and it takes at least a  month to get to a canter 
 Si eres un fanatico de las liricas fuertes y ritmos poderosos que hicieron famoso a Ruben Blades, te advierto que probablemente no te va a gustar.  Si quieres comprar salsa que sale fuera del area geografica normal compra "Salsa Around the World" o "Mandali" del grupo Africando. Lo que tenemos aqui es un animal completamente differente.  Suena como algo sacado para peliculas de Disney World.  Mi punto es que el cambio de instrumentos y estilos toman el mando poniendo a las raices de la salsa en una posicion de menor importancia.  Es musica de verla tocada en una universidad en vez de las discos salseras de Miami. Obviamente le gusto a mucha gente, pero no creo que casi ningunos sean aficionados salseros 
 I found this book very dramatic and as a soldier in the SAS very  unrealistic.  The writer, Leroy Thompson should take a good hard look at  himself.  Us readers don't want to read fairy tails, we want to hear the  facts.  An insight into the real life drama's of war from which readers can  learn and prepare would be most welcomed 
 I very much looked forward to receiving this book through the mail, due to the tons of praise which people expressed for it. I am however very disappointed. I have only read the first few pages (including the first one which quotes the multitude of praise) with emphasis on the summary/chronology of South African history. I am a South African, and I find it littered with inaccuracies which SHOULD NOT be present in a history book. It is painfully obvious that the book was written by a foreigner. Examples: The Boer war becomes "The war between the whites". I would have liked to see the Rand Revolt mentioned by name. Botha becomes prime minister. Botha who? Pik? PW? A newcomer to SA history should not have to guess at such things. 1981-1988 South African forces invade Angola. Uh....NO. SA started incursions into Angola in 1976. Since this is a history of SA, I will point out that a quick scan of the book reveals no more detail around these events, yet he takes a cheap shot at the Afrikaner government by making it sound as though they willy-nilly went into Angola for the sake of oppressing people. It seems that the author opted to avoid explaining the historical facts behind these VERY important events. What the reader does not know, is that Fidel Castro through this period of time circulated 350 000 (if I remember correctly) Cuban soldiers through Angola to infiltrate southern Africa with communism, through a war sponsored by Soviet money and state-of-the-art military equipment and training. The South Africans were responding to this threat to avoid the spread of communism into the region (it is rumored that the CIA condoned this until the withdrawal from Vietnam). Simultaneously civil wars in other southern African countries were tied in to this, as well as Soviet military training of ANC members such as Thabo Mbeki and others. The events surrounding the incursions into Angola has tremendous complexities tied into it that had a direct cause and effect role in the interaction between the government, apartheid era crackdowns, and African political organizations. That the author did not discuss these influential details in a modern history book is a scandal. He chooses to refer to a province we officially call KwaZulu-Natal, as KwaZulu. Overall the first few pages do not bode well for the rest of the book, but I will report back when I'm done reading it.  This is the report-back: After reading the book I realized that my initial harsh criticism was borne from an expectation of having purchased a detailed history book. After realizing that it was not, I eased my expectations somewhat despite the errors. Overall the book is a readable but superficial summary of South African history, and anyone who wants to claim that they have a balanced understanding of South Africa's history cannot do so without having read further than this source. The book was clearly written for an audience (perhaps at freshman university level) who need a first-order introduction to SA history. In this sense the book is fairly well written but omissions of essential events and several factual errors prompt me to rate it 3.5 stars. I rate it 2 stars however, because this book is marketed as THE authoritative book on SA history, as the praise by Desmond Tutu and the title of the book misleadingly suggests. It is nothing of the kind (at least I hope it's not the best there is!!!!!). I think the praise this book received is outdated and inappropriate for today's day and age and the title should read "A summary of SA history". Since the author seems to update the book as time goes on, by adding chapters, he cannot be excused for not filling in the gaps, correcting errors in previous chapters, and adding details. The book therefore seems to propagate the gaps in recorded SA history instead of aspiring to become an accurate and detailed authoritative reference as time goes on. It's a pity.  One more comment: At least one reviewer has advised to take the last chapter with a grain of salt since it appears too pessimistic to him. I couldn't disagree more! The last chapter is - apart from a few opinionated (would be subtle to foreigners)statements by the author in terms of seemingly continuing to make Africans the underdogs and Caucasians the antagonists - factual, and an accurate (and perhaps even understated) recording of the dismal deterioration of SA society and the incompetence of the government that played out from 94-2000. The continuing trend of these events can clearly be seen in everyday South African news up to this day. 
 I was highly disappointed in this item. This is only a 2 page pamphlet that is an excerpt from her book. My advice, go to the library and borrow 'Conducting a Needs Assessment' by the same author 
 Unfortunately, it seems to be an increasingly popular trend today to try and destroy the reputations of deceased screen legends who can no longer defend themselves. This is certainly not the first of its kind, and it's obviously not the last either (too bad!). This book has many brief chapters, each one filled with the worst scandals (abortions, adulterous affairs, criminal activities, etc.) of a specific female screen legend, such as Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo, Jean Harlow, Joan Crawford, Lana Turner, Judy Garland, Ava Gardner, Grace Kelly. Elizabeth Taylor, Hedy Lamarr, and several others.   The sections on Lana Turner, Greta Garbo, and Hedy Lamaar were especially infuriating, filled with rumors that even the National Enquirer would hesitate to print. For example, according to this book, Mickey Rooney and Lana Turner had an affair in the late 1930's which resulted in Lana having an abortion. Lana Turner already denied this rumor, and the very idea of a beautiful goddess like Lana Turner going for baby-faced Mickey Rooney is, quite frankly, disgusting and totally unbelievable. It also hints strongly that she had an affair with Clark Gable, although in her memoir she wrote that they had no chemistry off-screen. While some may find this kind of book entertaining, I think it's in poor taste. The book also describes Hedy Lamarr's orgies and bi-sexual relationships, and basically tries to pass her off as an arrogant nymphomaniac (the author does the same thing with Garbo).  This book quickly summarizes the screen careers and lives of these great actresses yet goes into great detail about their sexual activity (and preferences). Don't be too naive when reading about the many imperfections of these famous actresses. After all, there is some truth to many of the scandals mentioned, but there are also plenty of rumors that no one could posibly prove to be true. And after all, the author is merely rehashing what you've already read in previous books written by better authors. I suggest that instead of reading this trash you buy a well-researched biography. 
 This man should have never appeared on Oprah.  He's not an AIDS activist but a slick businessman making a quick buck by fanning the flames of black homophobia.  It is unconsciousable to use HIV as a means to sell books and make money.  I read an issue of the Atlanta Journal Constitution that did an article of JL's luxury home and I wanted to vomit.  Lives, both male and female, are dying and this loser wants the world to know that he's living large?  Who cares?  If you buy this book, it means you're naive, and who can respect you if you're naive 
 I found this product to represent extremely poor value for money.  I purchased the product based on all the marketing hype and testimonials.  However, I have since come to the conclusion that these guys must pay people to write positive testimonials.  This product only covers the basics (levels 1 & 2).  Then they try to rope you into paying even more money for their intermediate levels.  I have since purchased a cheaper 'Tell Me More' package (for Spanish) and have been highly impressed with the scope of it.  They have packed so much more value into their package.  And it is a complete package - all the way to advanced level.  I think it's really disgusting that Rosetta Stone get away with selling such a seriously inferior product at such a highly inflated price and people still buy it.  I think it borders on being a scam 
 Blakie needs to learn a few new words. Patently and arguably were so over-used that I dreaded turning the pages of what is an OK story 
 This books offers canned advice and can be summed up as: 1. Find a good accountant 2. Find a good lawyer 3. Find a good business broker.  The three people above are your 'team' and will carry you through the pitfalls of buying a business.    Oh yes - he also spends one chapter on why lawyers are 'deal killers.'  That's it - I saved you money. Three is no further detail, only a checklist.  Nothing worth $19.    You should only two Kiyosaki books: Cash Flow Quadrant and the Investing Guide - all else is nonsense and filler - regurgitating what he already said in previous.  From his advisor series, the only person who fills the books with valuable information is Diane Kennedy's Loophols and Real Estate Loopholes.  All other advisor books are filler and junk. 
 I grabbed this volume from an airport bookshop hoping, as always, for a good read, but as well to learn a bit about a period of Chinese history that I have not read deeply in. Alas, Man's book fails on both levels.  Halfway through and the Mongols are conquering Asia. This part of the book is well written. Exactly why Genghis is the leader and why the Mongols are following him is left unclear. Indeed, after a rough childhood, being kidnapped and escaping Genghis emerges as head of the Mongols? Why? I do not know. The historical record here is probably sparse, but that is no excuse to skip over these years. They are pivotal to explaining why the Mongols emereged. Would the Mongols have emereged under another leader? Or, was it just Genghis?  The final third of the book is spent in Man's quest to find Genghis grave. The lack of any maps to go with the travelogue leaves this section quite confused. Then again, is Genghis's resurrection only to be seen in Man's hiking about the Mongolian woods?  Somewhere there is a good biography of Genghis and the Mongols, but this is certainly not it 
 It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.  It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends?  I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something.  
 I read some of the reviews about this book present on this site and was somewhat surprised to see mostly positive ones. Maybe it is just my perception or the expectation I had after reading these reviews but before buying the book that lead to my disappointment in the book. What were my expectations...? I did expect Galen to tell me what he thinks and feels before, during, and after taking those great pictures. I did NOT expect a HOW-TO book (which it is definitely not). I expected a book about artistic approach to the outdoor photography. What I found instead was mostly a travel log. The first 2 chapters were as close to my expectation as it ever got. The author talked some about his creative approach and very little about his technical one. The rest of the book doesn't even present his "photographic philosophy". He simply talks about his travels, places he visited, people he met. All that would be great for an illustrated travel book but not for a book that was supposed to tell me about how HE came to those pictures, what (in his opinion) made those pictures great or standing out (there is some of it but so little it almost doesn't exist). The book's title has "inner game" words in it. I wanted to know what that "inner" game was before, during, and after taking EACH picture (or at least most of them). Overall - disappointing and expensive for that 
 This book is terrible!  There are so many mistakes in this book, I don't even know where to start.  The family tree is so complex, that not even the author seems to have been able to keep it straight.  In addition the plot takes so many twists and turns and so many of them dead end that it is hard work keeping the story straight.  And the ending is predictable.  A character ("Ashely") identified as Odile's grandson on the family tree is called a great-grandson in the text.  The novel describes events that take place in 1999, yet Odile's birthdate is given as 1918, when the characters are supposed to be coming together to celebrate her eighteth birthday.  And when a character talks about an event in the 60's, she describes it as almost thirty years ago?  Last time I checked, that should be almost forty!!! In addition Henry's son is named Harry Jr.  Aren't Henry and Harry different names?  How did he (Harry) get to be a Jr. I couldn't put this book down - mainly because I wanted to see what would be wrong next. These errors bothered me so much, I got up to write a review at midnight - and I've never written a review before 
 Benford is one of those writers who wax hot and cold.  He is acclaimed to be a science fiction writer's "scientist" in that he deals with a lot of "hard" science.  In this case, the result is pedantic and - the ultimate sin - boring.  The main character was not exciting nor interesting - just smart.  The great experiment and the result were so-so.  I kept waiting for something - ANYTHING - to happen but soon realized that this was it..a globe that was tested, studied and explored. I am reminded of the poem..."this is how the world ends - not with a bang but with a whimper.&quot 
 This is the worst song I ever heard.  It's both boring AND ugly.  My mother would HATE this song!  The video is stupid too.  I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE COULD LIKE THIS!! 
 If you had AP Lit course, the only useful thing is practice tests. But they nothing more than simply OK, nothing exceptional. I would not buy it 
 I was not familiar with Laura Schlessinger before buying this book, but after reading this book I think I'm as familiar as I'll ever need to be.  It's not so much that I disagree with (at least some) of the concepts in this book, but I just couldn't stand her dogmatic, absolute tone of voice in an attempt at enforcing her point of view.  Here's a quote that REALLY wound me up - I think that how you feel about this quote will pretty much determine how you'll feel about this book   These are the author's comments in reference to complaints about recruits from military trainers:  "I figure that those same young people who can't tolerate rules, regulations, yelling, cursing, hurt feelings, or any compromise of what they imagine their rights to be, are probably going to be very upset when they are shot at, sniped at, mutilated, bombed, assaulted with chemicals and biological weapons, captured, tortured and so forth. Think they'll cope? I doubt it. Actual warfare will probably hurt their feelings, damage their self esteem, and diminish their immediate experience of happiness - all the values we hold most dear. This country better pray we never have to defend our land. We may no longer have the warriors to do so."  I was actually hoping to bring up my children in a way (and ideally in a world) that would make a "warrior" mentality irrelevant, or at the very least, NOT an asset.   
 This is an addendum to my review of two years ago.    First off, I mentioned that the book is written on a grade-school level.  Why not produce another edition, with the title "The Depression Workbook for Smart People" or "The Depression Workbook for the College-Educated"?  This may help some of us to feel less put off and alienated.  Additionally, the book is also written from a highly feminine point of view.  The profession expresses concern that more men are not coming forward and seeking help for depression, but I believe many men are not comfortable with many of the suggestions put forward in this book (and many others).  Men are not inclined to take up painting, or knitting, or flower arranging.  We like skeet shooting, NASCAR, and cage fighting. In other words, expecting men to become more like women in order to get well is unreaslistic.  Another suggested edition: "The Depression Workbook for Men." 
 Lounger looks like it was used.  Looks like stains from tanning lotion 
 I would love to review this book but I never received it.  After filling out the return form and sending back "The March of the Penguins" (that I did not order)twice,I gave up.  I have not been able to "Journey into Power" or get any response.  I know it was Xmas, and you were busy, but this is a poor performance. Do I have to go to Barnes ans Nobles to get it.?? 
 This book seems be based on research done by other doctors who do not own a supplement company.  The advice is very good, although copied, but the supplement advice is to be taken with a grain of salt, (figure of speech) The supplements sold by Dr. Whitaker's company are much higher priced than the exact same supplements sold by other reuptable supplement comapanies like Puritan's Pride, The viatamin Shoppe, Swansons vitamins etc. I prefer other books on this subject sold by amazon, and written by reputable doctors doing research for heart clinics rather than a book written by a doctor who runs a commercial research instutite which is also a supplement company.

 My fiance was a best man in a wedding recently and had never given a speech before. So I bought this book and another one. Boy am I glad that I bought the other book, because this one was no help at all. It only gives you examples of specific toasts and speeches for specific families. It doesn't help. It's not generic enough for someone to put together their own speech from it. It doesn't tell you how to write a speech or do's and don'ts about writing toasts. I would not recommend this book to anyone. If you want a good book for this, buy The Best Man's Handbook. It has way more useful information on speeches and toasts than most speech books 
 It is amazing someone would spend so much time to translate a text like this only to not translate it in it's entirety.  I have seen this before with Conze's translations of Buddhist texts which are equally appalling.  This being a ancient religious text, it has repetition.  But it is there for a reason. One, often an important point is repeated so that you remember it.  Two, with Buddhist texts, many of them are meant to be a meditation, the repetition is part of that.  Third it is a poetic device.  But again when you buy a translation of a text don't you expect to get the WHOLE text and not have it edited at whim by the translator.  The Sutras are the equivalent of the Bible in Buddhism.  Wouldn't you think something is wrong if every time a translation of the Bible repeated itself (as the synoptic gospels do) that you just got a note instead of the actual text.  I can't believe Wisdom even published it, no one would publish a bible that way.  Worse still, Walshe doesn't note the majority of the items he leaves out but just gives you a ... to indicted he didn't feel the point was important enough to translate.  And these often come a point where it really interferes with the reading of the text.  I want my money back 
 this book actually had me laughing at some points.  he makes references of how god is now proven to exsist based on evidence that he presented.  the worst of them being the whole earth is so fine tuned to support life that it could not have arisen by chance.  this assumes that life was supposed to be on earth.  if the conditions were different, no life would exist.  this does not prove a god.  it proves evolution more than anything.  the other laugher was the whole every complex system requires a designer, machines are not naturally found in nature.  this is decisively false, complex machines in nature are found in the form of cells.  he assumes that these had to be created, removing the solution from his arguement.  his knowledge of evolution sucks, as a biology major, evolution is undisputable.  he says god is infinite love, and yet he casts away most of all his children into a pit of fire for etenity to suffer without any chance of saving.  i try to give religion an even shot against athiesm, but books like this only make me angry at christianit 
 As a Hmong-American, I thought the book did a good job explaining parts of the Hmong culture and had interesting information about the Hmong people, despite the fact that some Hmong words were spelled incorrectly. But overall, I thought the book was only okay. The plot was basic and characters were not very well-developed. The reading level of this book would fit more with middle school kids, so I would only suggest it to kids in grades 6-8 
 Though this is by no means Argento's worst film (his Phantom of the Opera was pure rubbish), this film is also not among his best, and was a disappointment even to Argento (he considered the production of this film cursed--in a way himself buying into the superstition which was part of the plot of the film).  For the Argento fan this film is quite enjoyable in a piecemeal sort of way, but it simply does not work as a whole.  The plot is fraught with enormous gaps in logic.  The scene when characters in the film rely on the memory of birds to identify the killer among opera audience members is utterly absurd, and the end monologue in which the herione announces that she doesn't need other people and has a lot in common with insects is absolutely random, nonsensical, and has absolutely nothing to do with what preceded it in the film.  Such scenes aside, what hurts this film the most is its absolutely corny heavy metal soundtrack, which has a very negative overall impact on the mood and atmosphere established by the film.  This said, the notorious "peephole scene" is one of Argento's most brilliant and effective sequences in any of his films, and this movie is well worth viewing for this scene alone 
 All Covey is saying in his longwinded book, basically, is this: Listen to the people you love. Put the family first in all your decisions. Blah blah blah and something about synergy.  The writing is horrible, and the metaphors are overused. I also dislike Covey's plagiarizing material from the Bible and not acknowledging where he gets his "inspiration".  In one passage he equates the Bible and other books of scripture with "Chicken Soup For the Soul" as "wisdom literature".  Despite being a supposed devout Mormon himself, obviously he's afraid to mention the Book of Mormon in that passage. Perhaps he's afraid of scaring away potential pigeons--I mean, readers.   This was a book my book club decided to read; otherwise I'd have never even tried to get past the first few pages. I wonder how a man who is on the road more often than not can really interact with his own family and give "us", the poor ignorant masses, advice on our own families. In one passage he even says that other people's advice may not apply to our own situations. Then how can he expect us to take his advice?   Don't waste your money. If you absolutely must read it, get it from the library. Covey doesn't need your money, he has a huge house with a basketball court and indoor pool. He's doing fine. 
 Having read several CS books, this one breaks no new ground.  Had this  book come out five years ago, it would have been more useful.  As is, the  book seems terribly dated and not especially enlightening.  If you've read  nothing about customer sat, then this book is a good read 
 I've been following Burn Season since their start as a local Florida band, and had always been simultaneously 1) impressed at how many songs they were able to write and record, as well as 2) in awe of how they shamelessly rearranged tracks and completely redid the lyrics for many of them.  I have also amassed quite a collection of their live acoustic performances.  However, upon purchasing their (finally) debut album, I am disappointed.  Why?  Quite simply, several songs that had seemed polished before this release have been re-recorded with nowhere near the luster and energy of the originals.  The sole exception here is "Carry On," which has been given a brand new spirit in itself, and has been created anew.  Frankly, the vocals on many tracks seem uninspired and rushed, and though the guitars and drums are amped up for this professional release, the once-proud frontman of this band has been reduced to mediocre cannon fodder.  "Revolution" and "Addicted," once spectacular scream-fests, are now out-of-key and boring.  Of course, the whole album is not all bad.  New tracks such as "Perfect" and "Save Me" offer a more sobering view of the band, and go a little deeper, which is nice for a change.  But nothing excuses Burn Season for slaughtering their older songs.  Nothing.  Their label ought to be ashamed, and their lead singer should have pushed for more takes.  I cannot listen to this record straight through, and that's unfortunate, since it took so long to "perfect."  This album is far from flawless, and although I would still recommend a live show from these guys, this disc is not worth the money their label wants for it.  Move along - there's nothing to see here 
 In his book, The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz, embodies four principles for experiencing personal freedom in life.  He says that we should be impeccable with our words, not to take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and to always do our best. The basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents.  He calls this process "domestication" (p. 6). Ruiz says that 95% of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection.  The agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives.  While there are various nuggets of truth throughout the book, some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what I would consider to be to be an illogical conclusion. In some instances he uses biblical scripture to support his claims; however, in looking further, he takes some of the passages from the Bible out of context.  Some of his ideas are presented as if they were new ideas, but I would think most of us by a young age, should already an understanding of these principles. Although his book has been highly rated, I hold the position that Mr. Ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer, therefore, losing good standing with me as a reader.  According to Ruiz, as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our own beliefs.  When we go against the rules we are punished (or rewarded for compliance). The fear of rejection leads us to agree with, or become something that we are not. In essence, we become a carbon copy of someone else, such as our parents.  He says our normal tendencies are lost and we judge other people based upon these agreements.  He boldly states, lacking statistical data to back it up, that 95% of our beliefs are based upon a lie (13).  The implication is that we are merely nothing more than a society of mindless, "domesticated" individuals, hurting ourselves, judging and victimizing other people along the way.  This kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the positive aspects they bring to our lives. By his interpretation, if 95% of what we believe is a lie, then 95% of what our parents taught us is also a lie.  I would disagree.  There are many people who exist today as viable, productive members of society who I'm sure would point out they too became a copy of someone else's beliefs and values.  If these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves, by his interpretation, we don't need parents, teachers, or leaders. He undermines our personal paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a different path, which I believe is our right of passage. By his rational we lose the ability to choose our own destiny.  Instead, we become victims of it.    One of the few things we agree upon is his first agreement, be impeccable with your word; however, he misquotes the bible (John 1:1) when he says "In the beginning was the word and the word was with God, and the word was God."  He uses it to epitomize the use of "word" as in what one speaks (26).  Looking a little further down in that passage, it also says "The word was made flesh and dwelt among us".  This passage is not talking about a form of speech, or speaking, but rather "Jesus Christ".  Christ became flesh and dwelt among us.  In that same chapter he says that "sin begins with rejection of yourself" (31).  However, in Christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law (1 John 3:4) and that sin is neglecting to do God's will (James 4:7).  It's not about self, but about disobeying God's ordinances. While I agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for, this is not a new concept.  Most children have learned by the age of 6 that if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it at all.  In his second agreement, don't take anything personally; he says that nothing people do is because of you. While this is true to some degree, he leads the reader down a path of illogical extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head, it was nothing personal.  So in essence, when Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot by Amy Fisher, her expression of displeasure regarding Amy's behavior was nothing more than a fundamental form of projection because according to Ruiz "you are dealing with yourself, not me" (51).  No, realistically, Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot because Amy Fisher wanted her dead. This kind of logic encourages victims to remain in dysfunctional relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims.  As an American, I'm glad that someone took 9/11 personally.   According to Mr. Ruiz he takes neither destructive nor constructive criticism.  It seems arrogant to place myself so far above reproach, that I would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism.  When my College writing professor, gave me his opinion regarding my work, if I were following the authors line of reasoning, I would believe that my professor was "trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his emotional garbage" as Mr. Ruiz suggests (49). I would rather believe that my instructor has my best interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a better writer.  Another agreement is about not making assumptions in life.  He says when we make assumptions, in essence, we create unnecessary drama.  Unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely possible.  Assumption is a necessary part of a thought and reason; even within the scientific community a hypothesis (or assumption) is formed in order to test a theory.  In order come to school each day I must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree, and that he or she must be reliable enough in life to make it to work everyday.  In his forth agreement, always do your best, he claims it is based upon the actions of the other three agreements, stating they will only work if you do your best.  Again, these are fundamental principles that almost any child has learned.    While Ruiz does indeed present some viable ideas, his concepts begin to unravel when he doesn't back up his statements with facts, but instead takes a basic concept and follows an illogical line of reasoning to reach his final conclusion.  I can't completely discount everything that he says, but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and weak rationalizations. 
 The worst phone I ever baught. I have since a month later baught a new phone. Can't not hold a long charge. Battery life is very very short. Annoying. Not happy 
 PROS: 1. John Corey is still a funny, memorable character.  CONS: 1. Very little suspense. The author's use of a doomed character's point of view--switching to third person--to tell the reader all of the hows and whys of the main villain's Dr. Evil-esque plan ("FIRE THE NUKE!"). Then, after we know everything, we get plopped back into the first-person, investigative head of Corey, who doesn't yet have the story solved. The result is predicatable and tedious.  2. The don't-look-behind-the-curtain (gratuitous?) use of the Ted Nash character, who makes a brief appearance at the end...despite having died in NIGHTFALL...and, uh, THE LION'S GAME. Why is Ted's appearance so brief here? Well, he admits to screwing Ms. Mayfield. Naturally, Ms. Mayfield opens fire and fills Ted with bullets. Presumably, Ted's dead for good now.   3. The politics of DeMille's novels has been present in other books, but it's never been this catty. Why is the nuke kook a right-winger? (Hey, why not?) I should have known when the jacket cover said the book "will challenge you to question everything you thought you knew about your leaders and your country." The only thing this book has made me question is how anyone can seriously be more worried about conservatives nuking L.A. and San Francisco than the real terrorists out there...the ones who want to slit throats and post the footage on the web.    4. Continuity problems from how the last book, NIGHTFALL ended...Corey and his wife seem way too disaffected by it all. Yep, they are bothered by 9/11, but they are both working their same jobs, apparently having gotten over the whole sickening coverup (witnessed via videotape) that the "accident" of the TWA flight 800 was really caused by a missile. There is passing reference to this, but not much. Apparently, a guy like Corey doesn't do much soul searching. He just keeps going to work. In realilty, it's hard not to notice that DeMille still doesn't know how to deal with the storytelling hole he got himself in with the last book.  Corey is really all this book has going for it. And, while in his capable hands the world will be saved from kooky nuclear schemes from kooky Republicans, he can't save this book.  I think I'm done with DeMille, for better or for worse 
 As shaman and psychedelic researcher I can honestly say that this is not only not a psychedelics encyclopedia in the most remote sense, but rather an extremely uninformative, incomplete & poorly organized & written yet pretentious 400 page pamphlet.  I could not have asked to be more dissapointed by a book with that title, and suggest that no one waste their time money or energy on this book 
 It's a real shame that one has to go out and buy these suction cups after spending several hundred dollars on the Nuvi.  Yet, the cubs quickly become fused to the windshield (no matter what season), and if removed often, they quickly lose their stick.  Thus, if you want to move the Nuvi between cars (the only advantage over having a built-in GPS system), then you must buy extra cups for each car.  I found Garmin impossible to contact 
 What I find so troubling about many of Gregory's books is her failure to present a heroine who isn't insipidly weak.  This book, "The Favored Child," and "The Virgin's Lover" both spring to mind.  "The Favored Child" had great potential in terms of Gregory's beautiful writing, but Julia's consistent inability to stand up to Richard ruined the book for me.  I found the characters neither realistic nor sympathetic.  After 400 pages of drama, I quickly flipped to the last page and read Julia's letter to James.  I immediately threw the book down because I was so disgusted.  I would ask Gregory to write a book where the heroine actually has a backbone.  I understand that the modern mindset greatly colors my thinking when it comes to a woman's role in society, but no one expects that degree of historical accuracy from 'pleasure' reading such as this.    I'll throw one bone to Gregory - her descriptions of Bath were marvelous.        
 I felt that this book really just skims the surface of so much.  Maybe Dr. Brazelton just wants to give a little info so that you will buy his other books... but I was unimpressed with this book 
 This is such a condesending book about "Middle America."   The characters seem like the creation of a Harvard undergrad who thinks that mid west rubes are just so darn cute and earthy. Yuck 
 Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.   Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time.   I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that "hip-hop" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45 
 Hmmm. I'm struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating. She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. I don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the "who, where and why" were finally revealed in the end. I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn't know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. Very disappointing. Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd 
 Maybe it's just me, but I can never seem to get it to angle just right to take an accurate temperature 
 This book tries to provide an encyclopedic reference to Latex.  It contains lots of good stuff which I have found useful. HOWEVER it is a dreadful book.  This book was written by Latex gurus but they forgot that for a reference book to work it must index the simple as well as the archane. Trying to find out very simple things you might have forgotten (e.g. what are the allowed Latex charcters) and you spend hours flicking from index to pages on obscure packages. In the end I usually find myself looking it up on the web, until today ... when I vented my spleen by writing this. 
 I have been reading Jodi Picoult's books since I first came across The Pact at the library.  And from there I glommed most of her books reading back to her previous titles such as Songs of the Humpback Whale and then her books, Keeping Faith, Salem Falls, Perfect Match and Plain Truth.  Unfortunately in recent years I haven't been able to get into some of her titles, specifically Vanishing Acts and My Sister's Keeper.  The latter title was just too sad for me to finish.  It was therefore with some trepidation that I picked up the CD of The Tenth Circle while at the library. Because I was told that there was a parallel story told in comice book form, I was concerned that I might be missing something although other readers said I wouldn't be missing much.  But at this point I must add that while the reader did a fine job and I was initially intrigued with the plot and characters, this book dissolved into a listening experience of a book which went off into too many directions to be a good reading experience for me.  I won't review the details of the plot or characters since so many others have done a fine job of this, rather offer, instead my  views just as I finished this title.  I just finished listening to The Tenth Circle and found it was such a grim book.  Not that Jodi Picoult's other books were rollicking fun but this one reminded me of a line from one of her books that said, "There ought to be a moratorium on grief."  Unbelievable the imagination some writers have.  Maybe that's why they're writers and I'm not.  But there were some unanswered questions, coincidence, sheer improbability and then she wrapped up the ending a bit too quickly.  And I might add a bit too happily or hopefully from all that happened for me to consider this a book I enjoyed.  But I do have to add that there was some wonderful writing about what it means to be a parent but I just found it overall very disappointing. I do hope I'm not spoiling this for anybody with such a negative review but I used to love this author's books and wonder if I'll continue to read her which makes me sad. 
 If you are interested in reading this text, be prepared for another journey into the ego-centric world of a man who has decided to define himself as a champion. He relays many events that are handle-bar gripping, and of course he is characteristically self-agrandising about his own accomplishments -- detailing his efforts as if they were anything more than the other wonderful riders in the Tour de France. Basically, Lance Armstrong succeeds because of his teammates -- his team is the champion, receiving very little credit from Lance. I was appalled at his lack of humility and his lack of generosity to the other athletes in the various races. It takes more than a self-appointed race winner to make a champion -- it takes a man with humility, generosity of heart and spirit, and most of all it takes a man. Lance Armstrong is no man or champion -- he is a "me, myself, and I" sort of athlete -- not a cycling champion. Read "Gred Lemond's Complete Book of Cycling" if you would like to read about a real man and a real champion 
 Buyer beware: this Elektra version of the wonderful Judy Collins "Colors of the day" has bad mastering. The tape Elektra used was obviously played back with Dolby-C, while not encoded as such. This disc should have been taken off the market. Try and find the gold disc instead 
 After the safe arrived my son was very excited to use his new toy.  Unfortunately, one of the key features the toy promises, setting your own secret code/combination to open the safe does not function.  Neither he or any of the three adults in the room were able to reprogram it to the numbers he chose.  He was very sad about it but after waiting so long for it to arrive by mail, would not return it.  Since it arrived at my home I have researched other reviews at Amazon.  You already have product reviews stating the same complaint.  This is not an inexpensive toy and it does not work as promised.  It should be taken off your item list until it has been fixed.  As it stands Amazon is selling a low quality item to young children and parents who are very disappointed. 
 As curious as I was about this movie it had me dazed. The 'Good Shepherd' always struck me symbol for Christianity. Shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten. What's good about that? Fortunately, sheep don't have the intelligence to be paranoid. With Bourne Identity movies under his belt, Matt Damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies. Is this one a killer or dead on arrival? With a budget of $85m, we've got Oscar-winning actors, writers, cinematographers, and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see. Pet project of actor-turning-director, Robert De Niro, "The Good Shepherd" tells a story of the CIA from its early days, weighing in at just under three hours. The scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around once that's miss you won't get it. This is a shame, because it's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically shot.  This movie is told from Damon's point of view, its scope is epic, and covering the years from 1939 before the CIA was even a speck in President Truman's eye, to 1961 and the Bay of Pigs. We see the founding years, the London Blitz, post-war reconstruction in Berlin, and increasingly intricate machinations as the Cold War gathers pace. Angelina Jolie doesn't feature in much of the movie, but when she does, she' get into character very well. It's enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable.   Robert de Niro (got to love him), in the director's chair, is sadly the weakest link. Although he handles it professionally, almost magisterially, he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum, convey gradual moral decay, or make this the Godfather standard-bearer of CIA films. He's done a fine job - just bitten off a bit more than he can chew. What he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world's most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity; if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to, given that his mentors are people like Francis Ford Coppola (who is the executive producer). With sufficient dedication, it is easy to imagine De Niro pulling off an Oscar for direction in a future film: his grasp is very broad, and all it needs is a little tweaking. 
 I was so disapointed with this book when I got it.  I wanted some ANALYSIS and scholarship in conjunction with the photographs...but NO, there was NONE TO BE FOUND.  The reproductions are nice and if you just want something to look at fine...get the book.  However, if you actually want to read a book about french studios this is not the book to buy 
 Many of the essays in this collection appear to be a forceful attack on the sovereignty of Indian tribes, spun as a bizarre imitation form of radical Indian rights activism.  A common theme is the angry defiance of  Indian tribes' right to decide who their memers are.  Jaimes makes this  argument most directly in an essay called "Federal Indian  Identification Policy," in which she claims that Indian tribes copied  their enrollment methods from a congressional statute, the 1887 General  Allotment Act.  However, contrary to Jaimes's assertions, the General  Allotment Act in fact never contained the "blood quantum"  standard that Jaimes accuses Indian tribes of imitating.  Ultimately, the  false information about Indian tribes spread by Jaimes and other  contributors to this volume amounts to a meritless attack on Indian tribes  and a concentrated effort to confuse the public about Indian issues  generally.  Unfortunately, since most readers know so little about Indian  political issues, many will unwittingly take this propaganda as gospel  truth. The predictable result will be greater oppression for Indian tribes  and Indian people 
 Pretentious and sloppy, filled with mistakes and repetitions. See the AMS review on-line for some details.  Terrible. And shame on S. Pinker and B. Greene for their glowing cover reviews. Were they swayed by the adoring references to them in the text 
 this text is required for my course on introductory topology. Not only does it omit entire branches of the subject, for example only giving cursory treatments of vector field topology, metric topolgy, and combinatorial techniques; but, the presentation is mostly unexplained. The author has concentrated on following a very dry quick example-theorem-proof technique instead of theorem-proof interspersed with discussion and example technique. I have yet to find a superb text, though for algebraic things i like masse 
 The information is inaccurate according to historical records.  I would suggest reading "A Ghost Hunter's Guidebook" (Third Edition) by Troy Taylor and "So There I Was... More Confessions of Ghost Hunters" by Troy Taylor and Len Adams for more information on The Myrtles.  You can also do a search on the internet for the article "The Legends, Lore and Lies of The Myrtles Plantation".  Or, if you're ever in St. Francisville, you can go to the courthouse and the historical society and check through the records yourself.  For instance, Winter was indeed murdered on the front porch by an unknown assailant but after being shot, he immediately fell down and died.  His bloody trip through the house never took place -- information that was easily found in historical records.  There is also no evidence to say that Judge Woodruff ever carried on affairs with his slaves.  Although the house is genuinely haunted, which can be attested to by generations of owners, guests, and ghost hunters, it is not haunted for any of the reasons that have been claimed in the publicity surrounding the house.  As has been said more than once - "when the legend is better than the truth, print the legend".  This is an adage that has been closely followed by the Myrtles, misleading hundreds of ghost hunters and enthusiasts over the years.  I do not discount paranormal activity at The Myrtles - just the legends that surround them.  Although, some of the events in this book are not quite true to the nature of ghosts (read Troy Taylor's "A Ghost Hunter's Guidebook" (Third Edition) for more information on that).  I am compelled to say that the story about black kids having classes with black teachers and white kids having classes with white teachers and that there was a black lunch and a white lunch in school (when Ms. Kermeen bought The Myrtles) is not true.  I was in high school in Louisiana at the time Kermeen bought The Myrtles.  Black and white kids went to the same classes, were taught by both black and white teachers, and they all ate lunch together - and had been doing so since before I started school.  In 1980, the federal government would not have allowed this separation to occur no matter what the local residents' feelings were on the subject.  My mother was a teacher in Louisiana at the time of integration.  By federal mandate, black students and teachers and white students and teachers had to be combined - and it had to be as equal as possible.  This was not a choice and this happened way before 1980.  I am currently a teacher in the Louisiana public school system so I do know a bit about its history and the federal regulations governing the public school system.  This separation would absolutely never have occurred.  This story was too much like The Amityville Horror...more of a "Hollywood" type ghost story than a "true" ghost story.  It's a waste of money and it insults your intelligence.  This quote is from a booklet about The Myrtles: "James and Frances Kermeen Meyers passed through St. Francisville in the 1980s on a riverboat cruise and while visiting purchased the Myrtles. The Meyers ownership coincided neatly with the then-current fad of "Murder Mystery Weekends" in which local historians and surviving family members say that history was rewritten in a manner they consider "disgraceful"."  If you're interested in true ghost stories, read books by Troy Taylor.  He's written quite a few 
 Fukuyama misunderstands history in a way that is not entirely his own.  One need only leaf through the pages of Hegel to find such unfounded optimism.   As a scholar, I recently took a look at what would be the continuation of Fukuyama's statistical work.  That is, the growth of democracy, and it's funny how that growth has been curbed in the past 10 years or so.  Time will show this book to be Fukuyama's Folly 
  Nothing new here but lies and half truths..His assesment of Orthodoxy is totally garbage....Good book for the trash can 
 This is one of those books where you get suddenly to the end and gasp "Huh?!"  I didn't see an end coming at all, and what a let-down when it did.  I listened to the audio version of this book and was never very engaged by this novel (perhaps I was distracted?).  The subject is interesting and educational, but I didn't get a sense of direction for this book other than a Polish officer who goes around fighting the Nazis while snagging "quality time" with women along the way.  In the end, this book just didn't do it for me, and I would avoid further Durst novels 
 I enjoyed "Temple" but this book was just awful.  Reilly's books are full of amazing, improbable but fun action scenes.  You spend a few hours suspending common sense but having a good time.  In this book however there were two elements that were just so bad that they ruined the rest of the adventure.  1) The career Marine captain has a romance with an NCO who reports to him.    and 2)There was a bear family that played a key role in the story - mama bear, baby bear and papa bear.  Right.  The only place you will fine a papa bear in a bear family is in Goldylocks.  Read "Temple" instead 
 I would not read or listen to anything this douche writes ever again.  As talented as he is, he is not to be trusted and the"cat is out of the bag" with his players and assistants now.  Watch his demise unfold at Alabamma. His next book will be "How I slit my wrists with a paper cut. 
 The first chapter will pique your interest. The next two chapters will present interesting examples of emergent behavior. The remainder of the book will likely leave you feeling frustrated at the poor presentation and disappointed at the lack of follow-through on your expectations from chapter 1. The density of useful information drops precipitously as the book progresses, degrading to something at or below what you would expect to read in a blog (I'm serious). I must admit I haven't been able to finish the last chapter 
 While I've had the pleasure of hearing Don Campbell speak, his information is, sadly, quite flawed. As others have rightly noted, the "science" in this book is simply horrible and there are many with his comments concerning classical music. The fact that he also copyrighted the term "Mozart Effect" is also deplorable. Finally, this type of book is responsible for placing music and sound on the backburner at many research institutions as it falsely implies that the use of music and sound belongs to "new age" nonsense. As a rule, I cringe when I see that someone else has used this book as a reference to back up other poor research. 
 I travel for work, so I often rely on fitness DVDs to help me stay in shape. I've only been working out seriously for a few months, and this DVD is definitely too easy for me.  There are 2 cardio workouts, 5 toning work outs, a warm up, a cool down, and an all over toning workout.  This seems great, but when you actually look at the details, you'll see that the cardio workouts are only 13 minutes each, and the toning workouts are only 5 minutes each. So when you actually look at the pre-set workouts (without warm up and cool down), you're only getting about 20 minutes of real exercise.  I would say this is a good DVD if you've never exercised or you are really out of shape.  But even if you've been exercising for a little while, you'll probably find it too easy.  I strongly recommend The method cardio bootcamp, or 10 minute solutions carb burner, or 10 minute solutions pilates.  All three of these videos will give you the ability to choose your workouts or combine smaller segments into a longer workout.  If you're looking for a good toning workout, try Self Bikini Ready Fast.  
 What an incredible disappointment!! I have to agree with the point of view of one other reader...this book has absolutely nothing new to tell anyone about organizing... the writers try to pretend there is a different spin to their method, but it just ain't true! I read the book hoping that someone would give me some refreshing ideas that would enable me to throw away my daytimer forever. Imagine my suprise when we get down to the nitty-gritty and up pops the picture of a daytimer-type organizer page, as well as other materials taught at Franklin Covey seminars!! Hey, if that had worked I would not have picked up this book! Bottom line I got from the book: creative people have to learn to stop and focus some of the time. Consider yourself right-brained in a left-brained world and do the best you can. There is nothing new under the sun 
 This book is a complete waste of paper.  The reader is subjected to page after page of disgustingly graphic descriptions of diarrhea (the author's), flatulence (the radio man's), the construcion and instructions for use of Afghan toilets and, not least, the "fact" that Afghan men wear long shirts so they can move their bowels in public and remain covered while doing so.  The author also appears to burst into tears at the slightest provocation (perhaps he bores himself to tears!) 
 What was once an indispensable guide to US politics has been steadily ruined over the years by the shrill, sanctimonious editorializing of Michael Barone.  I used to by new editions of this series every two years but quit several years ago because I was getting less information and more op-ed preaching.  I did pick up a copy of this edition at a local book store and spent a great deal of time flipping thorough it and saw that little has changed.  Barone is simply a blind apologists for the Bush administration and contemptuously dismisses anyone who does not subscribe to his philosophy as merely being a part of the "feminist left."  It is such a shame, as a lot of the information in here is valuable to someone with an interest in US politics and elections.  It is too bad Barone's ego has gotten in the way and ruined a once great series 
 The author obviously began with an economic theory to explain what he calls an "antigovernment" movement, but without the historical perspective that the movement is actually as old as the republic and is driven by dissatisfaction with corruption and abuse of power, and that the movement is stronger today because the corruption and abuses are worse than ever before. It is the same movement that led to the American Revolution, and it is motivated by the same kinds of abuses. He chooses to ignore the abuses and dismiss them as "conspiracy theories", but one has only to read the many books on such abuses to find the real causes of the militia movement, and learn the stories of the many victims of abuse that haven't been told yet. The author could spend his talents more usefully by writing about those stories 
 I have enjoyed many of Anne Tyler's books, particularly, "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant," "Breathing Lessons" and "Back When We Were Grownups".  "Saint Maybe" was a huge disappointment.  The plot and characters were mediocre at best, and a bizarre religion, The Church of the Second Chance, played a major part in the story. By the end of the book, it had completely taken over.  The Church of the Second Chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult.  Yes, Ian Bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life, but why the book was named, "Saint Maybe" is still a mystery to me.  One of the children in Ian's care made reference to Ian as perhaps being "Saint Maybe," but who the heck is Saint Maybe??  The closest I could come up with is "MAYBE you will finish the book... and MAYBE you won't! 
 I would rather have thrown 17 dollars worth of quarters into one of fountains at the mall then have spent it on this book. It just took waaaaaaaaay too long to get to the parts about Clay. I can't believe that by page 125 Clay STILL hasn't been invented. 125 pages of nothing but reading about an annoying main character (Davie) that does nothing but smoke cigarettes with his best friend, kind of like a girl named Maria, remember the one time a boy named Mouldy beat him up and think another main character, Stephan Rose, is weird. Seemed like a lot of filler or maybe David Almond, the author, decided he just had to write about his own dull childhood.   Anyway, I don't make a habit out of being mean about a writer's work, but there just were no redeeming factors about this novel except, I dunno, it has a neat cover. I wish I could have the time I wasted reading this book back. I paid full price for it from Borders and fully intend to return it so I can trade it in for a better book. What a waste. I only wish I could give it zero or negative 1 stars. 
 In Edward Klein's The Kennedy Curse: Why America's First Family Has Been Haunted by Tragedy for 150 Years, there isn't much new here except for pure gossip, rumor and innuendo.    Klein starts off to make this a pseudo-scientific study of facts contributing to the Kennedy curse including lots of psycho-babble, genetic factors, etc.  He claims his book is a detective story.  He tries to show how "the Irish immigrant experience of poverty and humiliation developed into an obsessive lust for power and dominance over others at the expense of all ethical behavior."  Throw in domineering fathers, cold mothers, alcohol, drugs, sex, thrill-seeking behavior, ADHD, restlessness, boredom and impatience, and you get a prescription for tragedy.  Many people believe a black cloud has followed the Kennedy family for many generations.  It actually appears that the Kennedy's followed the black cloud on their own.    In trying to prove his curse theory, Klein spotlights seven family members including immigrant Patrick Kennedy, Joe Kennedy, Sr., Kathleen (Kick) Kennedy, JFK, William Kennedy Smith, JFK, Jr., and JFK's maternal grandfather, John Honey Fitz Fitzgerald.  He barely mentions other Kennedy's that have suffered tragedies including Bobby Kennedy, Ted Kennedy, and Joe Kennedy, Jr.  It was interesting to read about the immigrant experience of the Irish, as well as some of the lesser known family members including Kathleen Kennedy and Honey Fitz.  But overall, there isn't much new here, and what is new seems mostly rumor and innuendo.  For instance, Klein accuses JFK of having "chronic venereal disease" and claims it is possible that this caused the death of his pre-mature son, Patrick.  This is a pretty serious allegation to make without proof.  He also tells how Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's friends destroyed her drug stash after that fateful plane crash.  I don't believe the Kennedy's are saints and I know they've done some atrocious things, but give us hard facts.  Overall, my recommendation is to skip The Kennedy Curse.  If you want to read more about this fated family, there are much better and more comprehensive books to be had.  It is hard to believe this book was written by a Pulitzer Prize-winning author. 
 Walter Mosley is normally a detective writer, known for his Easy Rawlins stories. Blue Light is a diversion into a genre that would fall somewhere between science fiction and new age. Various people in northern California are zapped with a blue light that makes them weird. According to the book's cover flap, the light brings out the potential of any person it strikes. However in the book it simply magnifies their existing personality. A smart girl becomes really smart, a young girl with quick reflexes becomes something of a ninja, and a promiscuous wife becomes a sex goddess. Mr Mosley is a talented writer. His prose and some of his action sequences makes this book readable. Unfortunately there's little balance between good and evil, which is problematic since the whole second half of the book is one long buildup of suspense towards a final apocalyptic encounter. Even more unfortunate is the fact the long awaited encounter is tedious and uninteresting. There's a few great and captivating scenes in this book, but otherwise extremely little to recommend itself 
 ... But that's not really saying much. At least the main characters are back in this installment of The Sword of Truth Series.  This one has Richard Rahl, his wife Kahlan, their bodyguard Cara and company still traveling through The Old World. Richard's magical powers are failing, his headaches are back and will probably kill him if he can't get to his grandfather Zedd in time to help him. But then a group of desperate people poison the Lord Rahl in an effort to force him to help them, so now it's a toss-up as to what will kill him first - the Army of the Imperial Order, his gift or the poison. Meanwhile, Emperor Jagang (he's the bad guy) is moving in on The Wizard's Keep and things are looking dire.   Okay, It's nice to see old friends again. Zedd and Adie are here, along with Nathan (one of my favourite characters) and Ann and even Chase and Rachel show up - lots of fun there, but since when did simple, straightforward Richard become such a pompous, didactic windbag? The last few books in the series have been growing increasingly preachy, but in the past it has been other characters doing the preaching with Richard as the voice of reason teaching by example. Now, all of a sudden, he's spouting long-winded sermons about the virtues of hate and vengeance - what's up with that? And then there's Betty, the goat. She was irritating in the last book, but she's just a pain in the rear now. Don't get me wrong, I like goats, but come on - lock her in a pen and keep her out of the way!   I enjoyed some of the story in this one - especially with Zedd and Nathan and Chase, but out of 725 pages, maybe 300 were story. The rest is crap. I loved the frist few books in this series and often re-read them, but after the last two (this one and Pillars of Creation before it), I don't know if I will bother reading the last three of the series 
 I read all the reviews on this DVD, but went ahead and bought it anyway. Other than the live footage and the "Only you can rock me" promo video, what a waste of some hard earned cash. I know that UFO was never that big and probally needed the cash on this one, but come on. You know you are in trouble when on the back of the DVD it says that this is unauthorized. Warning sign right there. Other than 2 people they interviewed, I had no idea who these other people were. Nick Tauber (producer of Marillion's Fuguzi) and Malcome Dome is a magazine writer ot the only names I knew. Dont waste you money. But you have to wonder, if Pete Way was on this DVD, how is it unauthorized 
 I am always interested in the intellectual history of science, particularly the Faustian dilemma.  Often we want to sell our souls to the devil for an article or a grant.  For scientists in Nazi Germany, the Faustian dilemma was to sacrifice their Jewish friends and colleagues on the altar of Nazism. Hundreds of careers were made this way.  Overall, I was very disappointed with this book.  First, to fill the first hundred pages, Cornwell spends way too much time discussing WWI without any real connection to the ideological development on Nazi science and the danger of scientists who embraced Nazism fully.    Second, Cornwell deals rather efficiently, without finesse or surprises for that matter, with the usual array of popularized accomplishments of Nazi science during the war.  The book reads as a companion guide to a documentary on the History channel.  Stories of V1 and V2, zyklon B, radio navigation, and the A-bomb have been told better before.    Third, the book avoids the "big" moral and scientific dilemma in Nazi science: Lebensraum.  When the Third Reich occupied Poland, it relied heavily on economic analysis on the economic viability of the occupation.  Economists and sociologists walked hand in hand to analyze the most efficient way to occupy that country and to extract its human, capital, industrial, and agricultural resources.  Cornwell mentions the economic analysis of the viability of concentration camps, but that is only a small proportion on how social sciences supported the Nazi ideology.   Fourth, it was hardly surprised then that genetic experiments in the concentration camps are glossed over in the book.  Benno Muller-Hill is reduced to being a reference.    Fifth, the most glaring omission is the role of social sciences, which I tangentially mentioned earlier.  During the 1930s an entire generation of new academic social scientists were "manufactured" to benefit, polish, improve, and offer scientific backing to the emerging Nazi ideology.  In less than 15 years, history, sociology, economics, linguistics, geography, and political science were rewritten and reanalyzed by this committed cadre of bright, young Nazis.  Following the end of the war, these still young academics were not removed.  Although many of them wholeheartedly embraced Nazism, they were able to keep their academic appointments, except for a few of the older guard.  They sold their soul as much as the younger group; few of them were removed and some became marginalized not because they were Nazis.  Those who kept their academic positions served as teachers, professors, and advisors to a new class of students. Few of these academics retired before the 1970s and they dominated the German intellectual contribution in social sciences for over 50 years from Nazism to social democracy.  
 As many reviewers have commented, Prof. Lopez does an excellent job deconstructing the many fantasies Westerners entertain about Tibet. I was very dismayed, however, by his sneering dismissal of the work of Trungpa Rinpoche and Sogyal Rinpoche, who he declares are not "real Tibetans" because they dared to try to present a difficult terma text in a manner that they believed would resonate with Westerners. While Trunpa Rinpoche did often present the dharma in psychological terms, he consistently affirmed the conventional Tibetan understanding of the six realms and other teachings. Surely Prof. Lopez is aware of the years of vigorous traditional monastic training Rinpoche underwent as a tulku in pre-invasion Tibet, as a result of which he received both the Khenpo degree in religious and mundane studies and the Kyorpon degree in astrology. For Prof. Lopez to think that he is in a position to weigh in on the validity of the teaching choices made by these two lamas strikes me as quite arrogant and presumptuous 
 If mystery wood bugs you and you have to know what it is, this is the book to use.  Appearances can sometimes be deceiving even for experienced woodworkers.  The techniques in this book are easy to use and, as the title  says, accurate 
 I teach Statistics for a living, and this book replaced the book by Wiers, a move that I have berated the folks that do our purchasing ever since. The other Stats lecturer felt the same, and we have ended up using old copies of the prior book. For example, the book gives a miserly single page to explain Quartiles, and has very little in the way of examples that are helpful. If you HAVE to have it because your school dictates, you have to have it, but if you want to buy a book for the purpose of teaching yourself Stats, look elsewhere 
 Three baby owls awake one night to find their mother gone. Alone in the dark and understandably frightened, the older babies discuss where she may be while the youngest cries, "I want my mommy!"  Mom owl finally appears and assures her babies that she will always come back. Although this book addresses a common concept familiar to toddlers and pre-schoolers-Will Mommy come back if she leaves?-I have to say that it should have remained a picture book. Although the black ink and watercolor crosshatched illustrations on a black background are very realistic, they set an ominous tone that, in tandem with the plot, I am not certain should be introduced to very young children; at least not introduced before bed time.. 
 It is difficult to figure out why McBrien wrote this book. On the whole, it is amazingly similar to the classic "Oxford Dictionary of the Popes" by J.N.D. Kelly. I wonder how much real research went into this book? What is good here can be found in a more reliable and less polemicized form in Kelly's book ... unless you like to read scurrilous gossip about the Church from one of its most widely published dissenters 
 I wasn't thrilled with the CD, and when I lent it to someone at work the review I got back was "it has no soul". I think that explains it perfectly. It does not, in fact, swing. Set this side by side with the music it was based on, or some of Bireli Lagrene's Gypsy jazz, and it comes up short all the way around. I might have given it two stars, but I feel that the 5-star rating needs to be corrected 
 Ordered an antenna the middle of Nov, 05. Received wrong item with in 10 days. I let them aware of problem then I  mailed back wrong item. Within 14 days I received duplicate of wrong item. After I emailed them to let them know of problem, I heard nothing. I had to send an ugly email, stating "what's up?". They cancelled my order, then refunded original amount charged to credit card, plus .11 cents. Still fighting for them to reimburse me for my cost to send back 2 wrong items. 
 Something fishy is certainly going on if the average review for this movie is 4 stars.  This is truely THE worst adaptation of a novel ever made.  Costner should be tried for crimes against cinematography.  This movie is far beyond AWFUL 
 While I was reading this book I felt like I was reading  journal. Essentialy it was a journal with a little plot to beef up and pad the book. This was hard to read because it had very few exciting points. I only finished this because I had to read it for a class. 
 For those wishing a more comprehensive history on DJ culture, you will be better served by reading "Last Night A DJ Saved My Life".  I expected a lot more from this book, although I did like the informal structure of the book as it reads as if the author was having a conversation with a room full of DJs.  But it contains so many DJ's that no one has ever heard of...and I get the feeling that the nightclub DJ is not well represented...nor is the music industry itself.  The section on record pools is abysmal!  After 27 years in the music industry, I may be a little jaded, but I expect a person to at least get it right 
 I've tried for the fourth time to read this book. For the fourth time, I had to give up half-way. This book is just too dense for my simple mind.  I am sure that it contains more substance than most books on writing (hence, the generous two stars), but the packaging and, maybe, relevance compelled me, once more, to use the time I would on it to some other book more suitable for my Philistine tastes 
 This book is just an overview of computer animation. You can't learn anything from it. I was hoping for a vanilla instruction book because I own Carrara and Hexagon and I have to buy Maya or Lightwave books and try to adapt them to Carrara and Hexagon. The pictures inside aren't that great either - the cover has the best characters. For the money, I would rather have bought another Maya or Lightwave book 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 If these two men were so intelligent and had such insight, why did they waste their time on a game of trivial pursuit?  They fully beleived they knew all and had the final sayso on  everything. They also were not sure they wanted to share this info with just anyone except to write a book and cash in on their 'secret knowledge'. 
 no wonder Mr Sutton was kicked out the country. We never should have let him in in the first place 
 I have read the first book by this author, and while I found his treatment protocol interesting, I did not find it very practical to implement.  It is very difficult, if not impossible, to delete every source of salicylate from every product that you use.  Every makeup item, every skin care product, every shampoo, conditioner, soap, deodorant, dish soap, detergent, cleaning product...the list goes on and on.  There are plant extracts in nearly everything that we use on a daily basis.   If you do not work, perhaps you have the time to begin this intensive program.  If you work full time, however, you are already exhausted from the fibro and simply do not have enough time left in your day to research every personal item that you use to see whether it contains salicylates.  Even if you do, there is no proof that it works. Furthermore, I have yet to find a doctor that I could "introduce" this protocol to who would take the time to research it and learn more about it.  Sure, I have been to many different doctors and tried many things to help rid me of fibromyalgia.  The fact of the matter is, if this was a proven cure, it would be everywhere by now, in the media, online, and more doctors would be embracing this protocol.    The bottom line is that proper nutrition and exercise are the best weapons that you have.  If you feed your body only nutritious foods, it will slowly begin to respond to getting the nutritious "fuel" that it needs.  As it responds, you will have a little more energy and be able to slowly begin an exercise program.  As you increase your exercise, you will have more energy.  As your body gets physically healthier, you will feel better.  This will happen without guaifenesin and without deleting salicylates from your life 
 I found this book vacuous and jejune.  And frankly, I met the author (without knowing who he was) and he tried to pick me up, and I've never heard such a pile of cr.. in my life.  And I'm not even close to beautiful.  So good luck with his advise 
 Not a bad story, but readers should know up front that this is a book primarily about the paranormal, and not a cozy mystery as the name of the book might lead one to believe.    Also, while the author obviously wants to make points about how a divorced mother needs to approach dating, the misgivings that the protagonist has toward her suitor -- while furthering the understanding that the protagonist is a woman who always puts her kids first -- has the (I hope) unintended side effect of making the reader feel like the suitor is creepy.  In a book where good and evil are so clearly delineated, it's unfortunate that one of the main characters comes off as ominous and naggingly "there's something not right about this guy."  
 Cudos to the front part of this book that provides low-carb fundamentals and reviewing the popular low-carb diets. The physical binding and good paper are pluses: these things get the 2 stars. But I found the recipes in this book disappointing. They are not what I would call low-carb, calling for no-nos in the low-carb world such as flour, pasta, white bread, milk, sugar, and so on. Many if not most of them use specific brand names  unavailable where I live; is the book funded by BIRDS EYE, HILLSHIRE FARM, EGG BEATERS, FRANK'S, FRENCH's, etc.? I found many of the recipes geared to low fat diets, not low carb; it makes me wonder if the (unnamed) authors really understand the difference. Now, I appreciate the advice in the front part of the book about controlling portion sizes: this is one big difference between the U.S. (my citizenship) and Europe (where I live now). At the same time, I see some of the portion sizes in the recipes so tiny that it is the only reason the carb count is as low as it is. I don't find the recipes appealing or even possible to reproduce with the ingredients list. I regret having paid over $25 equivalent for this so-called bible. Sorry. 
 The description of this product was very misleading. I ordered it once, sent it back because it was the study guide and not the actually book. I ordered it again thinking that it was a simple mistake the first time because like I said, the description did not mention that it was a study guide and yet again I received a CRAM 101 study guide. The shipping was fast and returning the items were painless. Amazon did not give me a hard time with the returns whatsoever. Amazon, however, should me more detailed with the description of the product 
 Too juvenile for adults, and not likely that children would really enjoy it 
 This person wrote a bad review because he said it was only in stereo.  Not all SACDs are in surround, but even the stereo ones have better sound quality than a regular cd, if you have the right equipment!  Or maybe the problem is you're listening to Journey 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 As a teacher of many years, I've seen a direct correlation between students who do their homework and succeed in life.  I have to wonder what racial background these authors come from--one way to keep the lower class down is to convince them they don't need what is good for them.  The key to successful homework is moderation--homework itself is necessary.  How else are we to prepare our students for the workloads of higher education?  If we do not prepare them, then we have truly done a disservice to them, they will drop out, and remain in the lower class.  Look around--people who are well-off are generally well-educated and have worked hard for some portion of their lives.  Homework is a way to build the kind of work ethic that will get lower class students out of the lower class.  This book maintains the same attitude of the slave owners 160 years ago--don't worry about the [crud] you'll put up with in this life, and don't try to get ahead, you'll be rewarded in the after life.  What a way to support the fatalism of the lower classes 
 Martha Grimes has had a good thing going with the Richard Jury series, until now.  Bizarre is too interesting a word to use for this book.  More like muddled, drawn out, and difficult.  The story within a story is an intriguing idea, but it went nowhere.  The plot is weak, the characters' actions unbelievable, and the ending disappointing.  I have enjoyed reading this series, but to be honest, this book was a waste of time.  I think it's time for Jury, Plant, and pals to be put to rest.   
 We had a cheap monitor of the same type by "First Years" and thoought it great, then bought this one 10 months ago to use for my second child.  The background noise is so bad that we can't use it in anything other than a noisy room. Also, there's no warning when the battery goes so we once had my elder daughter crying for us and we had no idea - we didn't know the batteries had died. Absolutely not worth any money - there are better options 
 If you read this book looking for ways that your product, company, or whatever could be marketed for wild success then you will be disappointed with Tipping Point.  Gladwell has some interesting anecdotal stories about a few products that he hammers on but it wasn't at all obvious how these unique tales could ever be duplicated.  He builds up a theory of things needing to be Sticky, which is fine, but that was the closest i felt he had to a generalized theory.  Anyway, the stories of the businesses he covers are intersting and he's a good writer so you are likely to enjoy the read none-the-less 
 I used to love SB novels, but the last few have been so very disappointing and "Into the Storm" is, by far, the worst.  There is no character development so we don't understand why couples who are formed in the book would be attracted to each other.  Basically, they've known each other, at best, casually through work - they sleep together - having the most amazing sex ever! and they suddenly decide they care deeply about each other.  Hmmm, that may work at 17, but the characters are in their late 20s and early 30s.  They have very responsible, professional careers and by now, should know that love is based on far more than casual sex.    The situations SB keeps coming up with are becoming more and more amateurish and bizarre.  All of these factors caused me to quickly lose interest in the book and I began skimming pages hoping that something, somewhere would grab my attention.  No such luck.  I used to love reading SB novels.  I couldn't wait for new books to be published and I'd stay up late into the night reading.  No more.  In fact, I think I'm done with Brockmann.  Granted, I never read SB for the suspense.  I loved the character development, the character interaction and the adventure that made sense to the story.  If I want suspense, which appears to be where SB would rather go these days, I'd much rather spend my time and money reading Tess Gerritsen or Karin Slaughter.  They do suspense so much better 
 Before I start on this idiot-magnet, let me get one thing straight - Jackass was a GOOD TV show. For all it's gross-out moments, there were moments of genuine class and originality.  And I guess I know where they came from. On the one hand, we have Johnny Knoxville, who has moved on from Jackass to become a genuine star in Hollywood, going from mainstream success (Dukes of Hazzard) to critical acclaim (Grand Theft Parsons) in just a couple of years. A genuine talent, and someone to watch in the future.  Then we have Bam Margera, who took his "is cruel to his parents" thing from Jackass and made an entire show out of it. And it quite simply the most crass, unfunny and utterly, utterly FAKE rubbish on television.  It's maybe a pity Bam didn't have parents who were, I dunno, better actors than they are, because their "outraged" responses to his ha-ha-larious stunts wouldn't seem out of place at a Sunday school play. The mother is the worst offender, and while Bam's stupid tagalong friends laugh in all the right places, there is a genuine cruel streak and nasty side to Bam that makes the whole program have a very bitter after-taste. I'd like to see what would happen if one of the yahoo's DIDN'T laugh or go along with everything.   Of course, this show isn't aimed at the likes of The Curmudgeon. It's aimed at the big-shorted dumbass kids who think Avril Lavigne RAWWWWKS and can't see another phony being stuffed down their easily pleased, "Hey Kids, This Is COOL" MTV propoganda-fed throats.  A loathsome, spoilt man child abusing his stupid mother and morbidly obese father? You wonder why it doesn't work. Then you remember it's one-trick pony Bam Margera, a guy pushing 30 who still tries to act like he's 14. And that his mother and father are in on every single second of it. Another pitiful MTV product that you should steer well clear of.  [... 
 One day it just stopped working. I got the dreaded "orange and green flashing lights of death"... the contents of the File space were un-recoverable... and I ended up just pitching it after extensive attempts to revive it.  Apparently this is yet another one of the bad products that Apple likes to keep hush-hush 
 I have never written a review before (and probably won't again) but I was so appalled by this waste of a perfectly good camcorder, that I had to warn others who might be sucked in by the sacrilegious "testimonial" on the box comparing this to Romero's flicks. As a zombie-phile, I'll sit through almost any zombie flick....within reason. However, I tried to sit through dog several times but never made it past the first hour. This trash smacks of being written by a couple of twelve year olds who got into their parents liquor cabinet. The "actors" appear to have been involved in dinner theater....as waiters, and the dialogue is more hackneyed than a Michael Bolton love song. The only horror here is that you'll never get back the 90 minutes of your life that you wasted watching this. The social commentary on the media is as subtle as a Doc Maarten to the groin. If you have sinned greatly and need to do penance, watch this film or if you have really sinned greatly, do what I unfortunately did and buy this film. 
 A rehash of lateral thinking, in particular the idea of a 'provocation'. Johansson's stories are fun. de Bono got there first 
 And wasn't it awful. Slow, nonsensical, not to mention boring....  Basically, it's about a poor guy who finds a black pearl. And then bad stuff happens. That is all the book is about. No sub-plot, no nothing. To be honest, the best bit was when the main character's baby gets shot and dies.  The book (about 70 pages long, to be honest I can't remember. I don't want to remember) is really slow to start with, and stays that way until the last 10 pages where a million things happen at once. It is way too descriptive, and nothing remotely interesting happens. And then it just ends. It was really empty.  I have read other "Classics" such as War of the Worlds, Animal Farm, Lord Of The Flies, etc, all of which had more substance and staying power than this.  
 I generally like Sheldon's "beach" reads.  Usually great fun which decent premises.  I'm not hard to please.  However, this offering was dismal.  Storylines were picked up and dropped without resolution.  Most of the characters were grossly underdeveloped or mere stereotypes.  You know going into a Sheldon book that it's not going to be an English Lit assignment, but this one was weak in comparison with his other selections 
 I really wanted to like this book, and I did for about the first half. Towards the end the story just became too unbelievable. It seemed as though the characters were fully modern individuals who just happened to be wearing period clothing. The so called spies were as inconspicuous as an elephant in a china shop. The very end up of the book was really the last straw for me, it was incredibly cheesy and predictable, and worst of all entirely implausible.   The dual storyline of the modern Eloise had potential, but never went anywhere and was therefore unnecessary and didn't flow with the "historical" (I use the term loosely in regards to this book) storyline. 
 I went to Confession today, and the priest ordered me - as my penance - to obtain and read this book.  In order to fulfill my penance, I came here and purchased it.  Then I began reading these reviews.  One reviewer mentions that the Vatican Information Services website contains information concerning the Church's stance on Fr. Anthony De Mello.  I searched the website and found the information in question: an edict by none other than the current Pope, formerly Jospeh Cardinal Ratzinger, endorsed and issued for release in 1998 by Holy Father Pope John Paul II.  An excerpt from the edict:  "Consistent with what has been presented, one can understand how, according to the author, any belief or profession of faith whether in God or in Christ cannot but impede one's personal access to truth.  The Church, making the word of God in Holy Scripture into an idol, has ended up banishing God from the temple.  She has consequently lost the authority to teach in the name of Christ.  With the present Notification, in order to protect the good of the Christian faithful, this Congregation declares that the above-mentioned positions are incompatible with the Catholic faith and can cause grave harm."  Rome, from the offices of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, June 24, 1998, the Solemnity of the Birth of John the Baptist 
 Glass has some good suggestions on how to rebuild your marriage after an affair,  however she made some very troubling comments in regards to affairs with ex's and/or "Old Flames".  Some of the comments almost seem to encourage affairs with Ex's.  Her are a few examples: 1) Page 34 - If the old flames reconnection results in marriage these unions are highly SUCCESSFUL?  How can she describe an adulterous affair that destroys a marriage and family SUCCESSFUL? 72% of rekindled romances stay together.  If they were 1st loves, the stay-together rate is 78%.   2) Page 130 - "There is a 60 % divorce rate in 2nd marriages...unless you are marrying an old flame from your youth.  The chapter notes state that the old flame marriages had a 72% stay together rate. Chapter 15 talks about giving up and the steps to take to have a smooth divorce. Not a good chapter to read if you are trying to save your marriage. 
 unfortunately was the cover of my new book a bit damaged. I really did not like this because I especially ordered a hard cover. 
 This CD was a big disappointment. It was one song after another that sounded like the last. By the time I was halfway through a song, I found myself fast-forwarding to the next track. It would be OK as background music but otherwise I find it pretty musically boring 
 my first problem with this book was the amount of art Wolpert discusses, yet the only pictures are maps that are hard to read.  There are pictures of harappan seals, but not in this book.  My second problem is his Hindu bias, Bramin are supressive people, but he glosses over supression campaigns in India by declairing them proof of Hinduisms openness to new ideas.  There were others too, but oh well 
 there were only a few selections on the CD.  Not much in comparison to the others that I purchased.  It should not have been as expensive in my opinion.  
 I gave this book to my grandson about to turn 10 years old. He is an avid reader and reads several books a week. He was interested after reading the back cover. He just got started reading and then refused to continue due to the language. I have to wonder why the writer would put those "colorful" words in a book marked for 10 years and up. It's not necessary for a storyline of that nature. It may be the way kids talk today but kids need better examples. It could have been a hit, but its not, in my opinion 
 I've been kinda exclusive to Remington MS3's for a few years. They've just been had inexpensively here and there so that's the main reason I've stuck it out. But in all honesty, these seem to cost me more than I've thought in the past.  Like other reviews have stated, this razor takes effort to get close. Hair does collect on the foils and thus as I've noticed, causes the blades to bind on stubble. I'm a patient person, not usually in a hurry to shave, so again not too big a deal after a quick cleaning.  But here's the weakness: the foils are like paper, and flake holes in them.  I just purchased the 2700 right before the holidays for about 25 bucks (a good deal I thought for a microscreen 3). My other 0003 was shot and running on a foil or two (once a hole developed, and I'd rashed up my neck accidentally, I removed the bad foil). I'd bought one foil pack before and gradually went through those. So I thought a new unit was the trick.  Well, now just three months later, the new 2700 has burned through two foils and is down to two (used a foil from the 0003 when the first went out). My bathroom is riddled with these things. My patience is now out and I'm headed back to an old faithful: Braun 
 I have been reading Cornwell for about a decade now and in the 1990's I thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there. Her first 5 or 6 novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book - Trace - represents an all-time low.  The thing that got me was the level of the writing, it just seemed so flat and lifeless. I found it repetitive in the first chapter when Scarpetta is saying to herself that "she should have been told....". It just seemed so ordinary, almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like Cornwell. 
 I'd heard the buzz (both pro and con) and thought I'd take an independent read. I was dismayed with this book. James Frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had. One of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the TRUTH so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him. Lies are what enable "slips" and "enabling" and "denial" and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure. Recovery is nearly impossible without honesty. So, can we look at this man's "memoir" and expect it to offer anything of value? It's poorly constructed, repetitive, and narcisitic. Even if Oprah hadn't exposed him, the writing takes the tone of "whoppers" like Frey's account of the drug house visit in which he "rescues" Lilly. Other reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one, and I can't improve on that. Suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera.  Story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life, the same way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction. A real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result. I was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept. Like a joke of some kind. I'm not laughing. 
 Sue and Sue are propagandists spewing forth ignorant writing. They fill the minds of all in the counseling field with their bias against all white people. The book states that all white people are rascist even if they think they are not. This state mandated/book course (Ohio) is much worse than a waste of time. It teaches all minorities to view white people as oppressors and full of hate towards all minorities.   We should love our neighbor as we love ourselves. We should not be teaching this ignorant trash. 
 Deepak has this incredible ability to link spirituality to quantum physics or any serious scientific research to superstition. If you shut down your critical thinking, Deepak will let you believe that time can be stopped. His pseudo-logic example is the following: He took a plane to London and chatted with his neighbor. Time "flew" and he was in London before he knew it. This proves he was able to stop time. I am not sure this is just the track of time that his mind lost. I would beg any reader to pay a visit to the critical thinking section before reading Deepak Chopra's material. 
 I would have to agree with the person who described the book as "lacking depth." It is hard to follow what the author is trying to say, and her descriptions are one sided at best. Yet another conspiracy theoretician : 
 The pic that I ordered showed a knee length half slip.  Instead I received 3 long half slips from Her Room.  I cannot use the long half slips and I sent them back. Also, I had bought them with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and couldn't find where to apply that, so the cost was put on my visa. Thanks. Jeanne Alle 
 I used this text in an elective on electrical machines and found the book very difficult to learn from.  Readability is not bad.  The writing is fine and easy enough to follow but the equations in the text were frequently the wrong equation for the topic.  Several tables had eroneous information.  While most text books contain some errata, this book contained more than any of the dozens of engineering books in my personal library.  None of the end of chapter problems had any answers in order to check work.  While only a nuisance, example problems in the text would reference a machine from several chapters back, requiring the reader to flip back and forth to understand the situation of the current example.  I did appreciate the fact that the book includes matlab examples and exercises as to aid understanding with simulations 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 We weren't expecting much from this one. My husband remembered it as not being great, but being tolerable. I think he was interested in the weapons in the program.  Anyway, even my husband could only get through the first five minutes. The writing is spectacularly bad. It's kind of funny in that Richard Burton clearly is drunk/hungover and hates the script as much as we do. He's practically rolling his eyes as he recites his lines.  You should only buy this if you're interested in collecting the world's worst films featuring the world's best actors 
 I ordered the product on Dec. 15/2006. The product was shipped, but never arrived (Tracking Number:  1Z YX5 952 03 8168 867 7) I called customer service: Kathy Wynn, Customer Service Manager, Taylor Gifts at 610-725-1100, she said she would send another product out. It finally arrived on the Jan. 10 UPS #(1Z YX5 952 03 8210 311 7 ). The product was missing the peg inserts that screw into the coat rack. I called Kathy Wynn again on the Jan. 12 and she told me, she could not send my another one and that my credit card would be credited. She was a rude + short with me and not very helpful. My card has not been credited yet by amazon. I would still like to have the product. Please help!!!! I can be reached at 678-296-9041.  thanks, Don Young 
 My hunch is this is a cheap sequel.  Not a lot of discussion, just a lot of (regression) results reporting.  Extremely repetitive.  Moreover, given that this often verves into being fairly social science (as opposed to pop), the causal linkages seem pretty poorly established.  If you want to read this for professional reasons (social science or urban planning), most of this could be ignored; if you want to read this for personal (i.e., recreational) reasons, it's really boring 
 While most reviewers seem to be bent on lauding Gloria Anzaldúa's "insightful and progressive" writings, I can't help but take a different viewpoint.  The vast majority of her essays, while cloaked in a sense of righteous equality, are quite simply racist drivel.  She speaks of acceptance and tolerance for foreign cultures in America, and harps on the evils of correcting students when they use improper English, yet instills her writing with a blatant and offensive racism.  I make specific reference to the article "How to Tame A Wild Tongue".   In her conclusion, she praises the perseverance and endurance of the mestizo race/culture, making reference to walking by "the crumbling ashes" of American civilization.  An eagerness is felt to see the day that "white laws and commerce will rot in the desert".  One would be hard pressed to come up with a more hypocritical conclusion.  Here is an author preaching tolerance and acceptance of different languages and cultures throughout her entire article.  She whines about the troubles she had fitting in with English speaking people.  She goes in depth to explain the numerous bastardizations of Spanish that are spoken in various Hispanic cultures and tries to convince us of how each is a viable language, even so-called "Spanglish", just a blend of English and Spanish that you might hear in a high school Spanish I class ("el chairo = chair,la ceilingo = ceiling, etc.) .  And after all that talk of acceptance, she ends by completely blasting American culture and expressing her wish to see it crumble to dust, while at the same time presenting the mestizo as the dominant race which will endure this fall.  Talk about racist.  I understand pride of your country and people, but this goes far beyond simple nationalism, especially in light of the overall message of the article.  Tolerance is right out the window here.  Don't be fooled by Anzaldúa's overly wordy diction and pseudo-intellectualism.  She is a flat out racist that for some reason is tolerated (forget that, praised to the roof!) in many academic circles.  Her educational philosophy is naive, irresponsible, and fundamentally flawed.  Hopefully her writings will soon fall out of the limelight 
 While a perfectly fine introduction to vegetables, there is precious little information about the Victory Gardens in/of World War II.  The illustrations of children dressed in mid 90s or later garb also negates the World War II-era/Victory Garden concept 
 This item performed as expected, reads and resets fault codes in all vehicles with OBD-II connector. Easy to use - only 2 buttons! You might be able to find it $10 cheaper at a local store on sale, but even at the price I paid it was a BARGAIN! Cost of tool = 1 diagnostic visit to local shop 
 Overall, not terribly happy with this units user interface and design.  The spartan instructions require pressing buttons referred to in the manual as "SW1" SW2" etc, but they are not labeled as such on the device.  You toggle through modes that are abreviated on the display with just 2 letters to tell you what they are ("TR" "CH" what??) Just an unfreindly interface all around. Look for a better unit. 
 Daniel Pipes does not disappoint here at all.  He is a man on a mission making the most of recent events to make sure non-Muslim World turns and remains paranoid of all Muslim groups and nations.   What makes his kind of scholarship particularly devious is the fact that he is well armed with facts and figures that he uses very selectively and has carved himself a pseudo-academic position.  Though in this book even his usual rather thin veneer of fake objectivity has been thrown away.  His naked dislike of most things Muslim is scary.  Even scarier is how many consider him to be the voice of reason and truth.  The title suggests that USA is about to be overrun and destroyed by thousands of Muslim militants who have penetrated our society.  It is a call for "Jihad" in a way.  According to Pipes, only good Muslim is the one who has denied his religion and culture.  While any influence of Islam on politics of any kind is evil, the same criteria does not seem to apply to other religions.  While he urges all "good" Muslims to organize against the extremism, he also categorizes any Muslim organization as a likely front for extremist ideologies.  He seems to have a particular dislike of those groups who have been critical of US Middle East policies.  The fact is Islamic extremists in USA do not even register as a threat to this country.  The political influence of mainstream Muslims in USA, though numbered in millions, let alone extremists among them, is negligible.  There is no measurable internal threat from American Muslims as the author strongly suggests.  The irony and hypocracy of this deeply and militantly Zionist author extolling the virtues of disengaging religious zealotry from politics seems to have been lost on many readers.   Far beyond analysis, Pipes pretty much dictates what exactly everybody should be doing to counter this menace of Islam.  His audacity to lecture UN, US presidents, other World leaders and bodies in the pages of this book is just breath taking.  It is no wonder that Pipes almost completely focuses his wrath on Iran and Iraq (book written before the start of Iraq war), the two states in the region in a position to threaten ambitions of Israel.  One would think if Global "Islamic" terrorism were the main concern, Pipes would focus our attention more on Saudi Arabia which exports and finances some of the most extreme Islamic ideologies around the World.  None of the 9/11 terrorists were Shiites.  Pipes tries to make us believe that source of terrorism are theological, somewhere in the Islamic culture if not in Islamic teachings themselves.  He laments the attempts at politicization of Islam, while he is not disturbed at all by other ethnic or religious based regimes in the region.     This book is highly one-sided and represents a bigoted interpretation of not just the causes but also the scale of the dangers Islamic(?) terrorism presents to the rest of the World.  Pipes offers not a way out but a way to deepen the crisis in service of his ideology and causes. 
 The Summary (short version)  The characters...  Go to restaurants and drink.  Go to bars and drink.  Go home and drink.  Go to bullfights and drink.  Insult each other and drink.  P!ss and drink.  Go to sleep, wake up and drink.  Take baths and drink.  Have sex and drink.  I became an alcoholic just by reading The Sun Also Rises.  Summary (the long version) Several expatriates lick their emotional wounds and cavort around spending money left by their rich parents. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is a reporter left impotent by a war wound. He and Uncle Toby from Tristram Shandy could have had a ball together (if you've read Tristram Shandy by Laurence Sterne, you'll get the joke). He's in love with the beautiful Brett Ashley, but his impotence makes it impossible for their relationship to have much substance. She falls in and out of love with other men while he stands around watching and feeling jealous. A little bullfighting and violence and drinking later, they're right back where they started: in limbo.  I've never cared for Ernest Hemingway's writing style. It's like he made sure you knew you were reading a story from a REAL man: very macho in tone and style.  And this coupled with the boringness of the story makes The Sun Also Rises a dreadful read 
 The only worthwhile part of this book is the 3 pages on carbo loading.  The rest is a total waste of time.  I assumed that since the book was titled "Eating for Endurance" it was geared toward endurance athletes, who I assume had a certain level of knowledge when it comes to nutrition.  It appears that Ms. Coleman has targeted high school health class with this book.  Example:  she devoted an entire chapter to the 6 classes of nutrients: carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamin, mineral, water.  Are you kidding me?  Like I couldn't have figured that out myself.  Any information contained in this "book" can be located for free in many places on the internet.  Save your money and research nutrition and/or endurance training.  Do not buy this book, please, DO NOT buy this book 
 I dig the Aimee Mann vibe in general, although I must admit that even on her original compositions she sounds bored and enervated. Sadly, when she plays cover tunes she sounds like she's fallen asleep. This is one BORING Christmas album. Makes you wonder why Aimee even made it. "Christmastime" isn't even new; it came out a decade ago on a "Just Say Noel" benefit album I used to have. So all you get for your bread are some depressing rehashes of boring Christmas songs you've already heard done better. 
 This book is horrible - not at all funny.  Waste of money - good thing it was relatively cheap.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone 
 A waste of time and money. Most of the stories are corny, self-conscious, and dull. Quite a few are so poorly written that they are just an adjective or two away from being inadvertently funny. Imagine (if you can) reading an erotic story in "Reader's Digest" or "Good Housekeeping." You can see it here first.    
 Many folks rate this above Maltin's m0vie guide. Why? It has an overall tone of snotty, over-intellectualized condescension that grates on the nerves. Plus, it delights in reviewing obscure, third-world flicks no-one's heard of, nor would want to see. It doesn't have a rating system, doesn't show availability in any format, doesn't show MPAA ratings, nor does it tell you where films are available for purchase or rent. In contrast, Maltin supplies all of these. Even if you don't always agree with his evaluations, in all, he provides much better info for decision-making 
 Is basically a brief introduction and outline and then many examples. The examples are all mostly from the 2000 decline in the market. So the book outlines a very specific approach and highlights examples that fit that approach.   Given the cost of the book , I don't mind having it in my library. So far the best book on short selling was written by Justin Mamis . The book by Kathryn Staley is great as well. The focus there is how to look at the balance sheets and corporate shenanigans. Both these books are not light reading though 
 I was looking for something practical to help me design and build a tree house for my 5 year old. This is a great book if you want to consider "possibilities". It helped a little, as well in terms of providing conceptual designs. It was not as good in providing detailed plans on how to build a specific tree house. If you are an experienced builder you could probably take what they have here and develop your own blueprints. If you are a novice,and need detailed plans this book will not get you there 
 I learned a great deal from Edward Smith's other book, The Vegetable Gardener's Bible, and I use it as a reference on germination and growing soil temperatures.  So I did not hesitate to order his Incredible Vegetables from Self-Watering Containers when I decided to buy some books on container gardening.  I ordered this book and McGee and Stuckey's Bountiful Container. Bountiful Container is comprehensive, thoughtful and very helpful.  However, this book reads like an ad for self-watering containers, which were apparently provided free to the author with the hope that he might endorse them.  Unlike the author's first book, this lavishly illustrated book is short on information, more suitable for a coffee table than a container gardener. If there were a money-back guarantee, I would request it 
 I have read all of the books up until this one, and this one is definitely the worst so far.  In fact, it makes me wonder whether I will continue to read the series.  The book is misnamed.  The Ionian mission is only the last fourth of the book.  The first three-fourths is a very boring description of two battles that came close to happening but never did.  The Ionian mission itself is fairly confusing with all of the personal names and place names bandied about.  Jack Aubrey, as in most of the other books, is burdened with an extremely difficult mission.  He must decide who to support in some kind of three-way civil war.  He makes the wrong choice, but then is called away to fight another party who has seized some British vessels.  Talk about deus ex machina!  There is nothing of much interest that happens in this book.  Stephen Maturin doesn't really do anything interesting in the espionage line, and Professor Graham is a bore.  The final battle scene is as predictable as most of the others--Jack Aubrey wins against all odds because he is a good captain.  I recommend skipping this one if you are reading through the series.  I would bet that Patrick O'Brian did not spend very much time writing this.  In fact, it seemed like bits and pieces patched together to form a "novel. 
 If you are looking for a biography on Daphne Du Maurier, I would not recommend Haunted Heiress.  This is a rambling, free form work of literary criticism.  You would do better to check this book out from the library rather than paying the steep price.  You can learn more about the story of Du Maurier's life by doing a web search.    Also, if you are interested in visuals, there are none in Haunted Heiress, save for the cover. The text did conjure up some mental images of Ms. Auerbach, though... (narcissistic, cranky, and snobbish) but none of Daphne Du Maurier.   I did very much appreciate Ms. Auerbach's observations on Du Maurier's affinity for the way men can live their lives, with more freedom and flexibility.   I wish Ms. Auerbach would have done more research on Du Maurier's life and interwoven it with her pop-up thoughts on this book or that 
 I purchased this item for use while driving my car in Oct of 2005 for $29.00 without tax.  I was told it would work for the LG phones which is what I have I see now you can no longer find these for sale and gee I wonder why... I probable used this item a total of 8 times when I drove my manual transmission car, I didnt really use it while driving my truck which was automatic.   The Jabra now does not work...and after only 8 uses, a friend of mine also bought one and his lasted about 6 months as well.  While using it the phone cuts out and the caller can not hear you at the other end and you have to constantly pull the plug and stick it back in, after a while you just give up cause it doesnt work. I emailed the company several times at info@jabra.com but have not tried to call them yet and had no results with the emails.  I have a feeling I lose anyways with this purchase. The thing is not worth the money and does not seem to last long and is not made for LG cell phones, Iknow the one I got with the phone stinks due to the fit but al least it was free and still works top notch. To bad this was a comfortable ear piece but very short lived. do not purchase this even for the 4.99 prices you may find it for on Ebay 
 I don't think I've ever written a negative review on Amazon before, and I'm sorry to feel compelled to do so.  But this book got in under my radar with the droll concept and amusing cover.  I feel as if someone who looked like they might become a new friend slapped me in the face, not once but repeatedly.  I avoid books that signal early on that they will be full of fat jokes or dripping with contempt for fat people.  As an author, I think that's the laziest sort of humor--like currying favor with prejudiced people by telling racist or sexist jokes.  Let those who find that funny subsidize such humor.  This book waited till p. 14 or so of what had been an amusing story, and by p. 47  I was offended enough not to want to read the rest.  Life is short.  There are many books. I don't have to read books that insult fat women.  I won't totally avoid other books by this author, but I will examine them carefully before buying 
 Having been a young boy in London who lived first hand through the regular bombing of his native city by German bombers and "wonder" weapons like the V-1 and V-2, John Cornwell's "Hitler's Scientists" is his attempt to consider the morality of scientists, Allied, Soviet, Nazi and others, before, during and after the great world wars, and into the Cold War and the War on Terror.  Getting away from simplistic "Hollywood" depictions of scientists, Cornwell considers the, "presence of pressures, temptations and compromises, involving spouses, families, fear of loss of opportunity to do science; desire to receive academic recognition, resources; conflicting loyalties, towards academic discipline, colleagues, institutions, student bodies and Fatherland."  And generally he succeeds.  He does however, by way of omission and improper contrasting, paint many of the scientists who worked on the American atomic weapon program as villains.  For example, he cites the case of Rotblat, whom in my extensive reading of Los Alamos history, I had never heard of before, as a case of a heroic Los Alamos scientist.  Rotblat quit Los Alamos once it was determined that the raison d'etre for the Los Alamos program, namely the fear that Hitler would have the bomb first, was unfounded.  Allied intelligence determined the war would be over long before the Germans could possibly assemble a nuclear weapon of mass destruction (WMD).  For this quitting, Cornwell calls Rotblat courageous and heroic for going against the powers that were.  May I take it by this reasoning that Cornwell considers the non-quitters as non-courageous and non-heroic scientists?  In prior pages along these lines, moreover, Cornwell factually states that the use of the atomic bomb against Japan had, and continues to have critics stating that Japan was on the verge of defeat.  He never mentions the history that as US forces approached Japan island by island, the Japanese defenders would die almost to a man, and that US casualty rates were atrocious and getting worse.  He never mentions that Japanese commanders, after the first atomic bombing of their nation, attempted a coup against their emperor in order to press on the war.  Instead, he despicably connects the arguments of the German scientist Haber, who developed and personally deployed poison gasses in World War I, to those similar arguments of the Allies who claimed the use of atomic weapons shortened the war and saved lives in net.  It's true that (actually practicing the sterilizations they preached) Americans were the leaders in eugenics around the 1920s, and that the Nazis borrowed many of their racists ideas from the Americans.  And it's fair to connect these scientists.  But it is not fair to connect Haber in one fell swoop with Allied scientists.  Haber's first wife committed suicide to protest his poison gas war work, and yet he pressed on unhindered going to the battlefield himself, and even when suffering increasingly under the rising tide of Nazism because of his Jewish ancestry, he still pressed on.  He cared about poison gas and would deliver it to his masters regardless of their politics.  On the other hand, I've read biographies of Oppenheimer, Teller, Lawrence, Fermi, Feynman, Wigner, Meitner, Gamov, Ulam, Sakharov, and Einstein who wrote to President Roosevelt about the risks of atomic physics from Nazi Germany, as well as many books on the Manhattan project familiarizing myself with Groves, Szilard, Bush, Connant, and many others.  These people debated the building and use of nuclear weapons.  While some, like Teller, pushed for even more powerful H-bombs, some, writing a letter to President Truman, asked that the US only demonstrate these devices to the Japanese, while others worked hard to promote international control of these bombs--Teller, beside his ambitious and personal drive for H-bombs, had the Soviet threat in mind.  Had we quit work on atomic weapons when the "heroic" "who-in-the-hell?" Rotblat quit, would the Soviets, who were abreast of our atomic programs thanks to their many misguided British and American scientific spies (typically scientists who believed in balancing world powers) have quit?  I doubt it.  Then what might have happened to the world when only Stalin had the bomb?  Simply replace the name Stalin with Hitler for a quick back-of-the-envelope answer.  Cornwell doesn't consider these thoughts.  More of the same can be said about Cornwell writing on Niels Bohr.  Citing Niels Bohr's letters about his encounter with Heisenberg in Copenhagen, Cornwell paints Bohr as a lying scientist with a guilty conscience after-the-fact.  You see, the historical record shows that Bohr and Heisenberg met over several days, surely discussing atomic physics weapons work--German work included--yet the historical record shows that Bohr had no problems during the last evening of Heisenberg's visit, playing music and having a good time at his home with the German physicist.  If Bohr could be so accomodating, then surely, Cornwell reasons, Heisenberg didn't reveal anything scary about German atomic bomb work.  Why then, Cornwell questions Bohr, did Bohr report to Allied forces the urgent need for an Allied atomic weapons program?  Was it for reasons other than the defeat of Hitler?  Was it for science, for political gain, or some other disingenuous reason aside from fear of Hitler?  Bohr, Cornwell cites after all, wrote with seeming guilt years later that perhaps he had overreacted, and thus had helped create the Allied atomic weapons program.  Does Cornwell consider the case that perhaps Bohr was friendly to Heisenberg beyond their long history to spy on Heisenberg about German physics over Mozart and spirits?  No.  And given the overwhelming progress of Hitler's Nazi war machine sweeping across Europe and steeping these nations in blood, was it not better, if not just plain natural, for Bohr to have chosen to believe in his worst fears when even his own nation would soon knowingly be invaded?  Perhaps Bohr, like other wise people, hoped for the best but expected and planned for the worst.  You won't get these questions from Cromwell.  To this end, I recommend to the reader the biography of Ulam, who figured out how to make H-bombs work for the Americans.  He'll tell you how many scientists and their families died under Hitler, and what the émigré scientists were thinking while they worked on the Allied atomic bomb as they lost family under Hitler as well.  These people were not Habers, but thought about what they were doing and did what they thought was best.  Sadly, where I do agree with Cromwell is that science does not necessarily lead to enlightenment.  One has to look at the man or the woman, their nation, their academic pressures, their ambitions, their opportunism, and many other factors to see that a scientific education often doesn't correlate to benevolent, egalitarian morality.  I wish it did when I think about the Iranian atomic scientists working on their weapons under a rising tide of Muslim fundamentalism which believes that it's okay to kill even Muslims to kill infidels, even to kill the world, because Allah will sort them out, for the sooner Muslims get to Allah, the sooner they're in paradise.  I'm grateful though to be a citizen of a nation with an enormous stockpile of atomic and hydrogen bombs because something inside me tells me the Iranians in particular and Muslims in general aren't that MAD.

 Like many of you Argento fans, I had heard a lot about "Deep Red" and some people even considered it to be Argento's best work.  So, I just had to buy it.  However, after viewing the movie, I respectfully disagree with the opinion about "Deep Red" being Argento's best work.  While it is true that "Deep Red" is a bit more coherent with regard to plot development, the movie's atmosphere is no where near as effective as Argento's superior work in his true masterpiece named "Suspiria".  "Deep Red" is about a pianist who observes part of a murder and becomes obsessed with figuring out the identity of the murder and the mystery behind the killings.  Unfortunately, the movie drags on and on, way too long to keep one's interest consistently with respect to a typical plot development with a beginning/introduction, rising action, climax and falling action.    In "Deep Red", you have a murder in the beginning that is fairly impressive, but the subsequent murders, mystery and investigation by Marc Daly are not equally as impressive.  Unlike "Suspiria", the score and music that is utilized to create a chilling atmosphere and horror movie like theme is rather ineffective and I would argue that the movie that is played during the kills is more akin to the kind of music that is played during a trash pornographic film rather than a horror movie...the effect is damaging to the movie's ability to inspire a horror like theme within a sophisticated horror movie audience.     There is a great deal of "much ado about nothing" in the body of this movie called "Deep Red".  For that reason, the movie is largely ineffective as a horror movie.  There are parts of the movie that are good and there is a kind of horror like atmosphere at times, but overall, the movie works more like a mystery and suspense thriller without the thrills necessary to make it work as such.    Overall, the kills aren't that impressive (notwithstanding the first murder) really and as the movie drags on, the viewer becomes disinterested and frustrated at times.  The identity of the killer, while somewhat unexpected, is really a downer when one considers the prowess or lack thereof associated with this villain.  I agree with a previous reviewer that "Deep Red" is too long and drawn out...there are periods of time when nothing really happens and the result is a fairly dull movie.  While there are times when a horror movie like atmosphere could be argued to be present in this movie, it is nowhere near as effective as the horrifying atmosphere present in Argento's stylish "Suspiria".    In short, I highly recommend the classic "Suspiria" as Argento's true horror masterpiece over that of the dull and often insipid "Deep Red".  To be honest, TWO STARS might be a bit generous for "Deep Red" as with regard to its merits as a horror movie.  
 I agree with the rest of the reviews.  I've read this series since its' inception, and enjoyed almost all of the books.  The sex has gotten stanger and more prevelant, but even through the last book it was still an adjunct to the plot.  This one however has nothing BUT sex.  No plot, no action.  If you took out all pages which contain sex you wouldn't have 5% of the book left 
 In recent years, Routledge has gone from consistently producing excellent language courses to producing some excellent courses and some bad courses. Unfortunately, Colloquial Catalan is a prime example of the very worst Colloquial courses.   The main error in this course is the fact that it's exceptionally limited. After completing some of the more extensive Colloquial courses, you will master the grammar of the language and have a solid basic vocabulary. Colloquial courses like Colloquial Italian, Colloquial Czech, Colloquial Albanian or Colloquial Icelandic list over 2000 words. The average Colloquial courses list 1000-1500 words. In sharp contrast, Colloquial Catalan doesn't even reach 600 words!   In my opinion, the Colloquial courses are often a better option than Teach Yourself courses, but that's not the case with Catalan. Teach Yourself Catalan will teach you more than twice as much as Colloquial Catalan. 
 Okay, the rating above is not going to be liked but I have to be truthful.  The only good thing going for this movie was the return of "Snake Plissken".  This film's plot was essentially a rehash of the original "Escape From New York"...A bit more special effects (which in fact, did not make this a better movie)...   When I go to a sequel I expect to get what I paid for a totally new adventure with the same character / characters.  Kurt Russell's character is older and even more in the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them.   Obviously the movie doesn't really know where it's going as it takes two scenes (15 minutes of the film) (1st scene - President, Commandant, and Lackey give Snake the mission) (2nd scene - Commandant and Lackey brief Snake before he leaves for the mission)  to explan to the audience what's the basic conflict.  I guess either Carpenter or Russell are just getting too old to take a GREAT leap and recount either an earlier Snake Plissken adventure or an adventure well worth telling..  I also wish to comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie trailer... "Carpenter....Russell! " Please don't tell me "money" caused you to revisit a "cult figure"!   Some redeeming qualities are the acting performances of  Cliff Robertson, Stacy Keach, Steve Buscemi, and Pam Grier.  Robertson, Keach, and Grier may be old but they can sure make you believe in their characters!  Sorry, Snake...."I don't love L.A."  The-Big-Green-Pointy-Eared-One!  
 Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are good, but Xenocide disappoints; in fact, Card could've ended on Speaker.  Instead he takes the worn path of Lusitania for his setting again.  In Xenocide, Ender must deal with numerous impossible tasks such as solving faster than light travel, averting the destruction of Lusitania by Starways Congress, stopping a war between the humans, piggies and formics, and saving the life of an electrically based lifeform, all the while contending with his messed up adopted family of geniuses.   And Card solves all these problems neatly.  What annoyed me most was Card's sudden use of italics to gain emphasis in speaking parts.  With such overuse of this device, I found myself giggling at the melodrama - and taken out of the story. Oh well.  Card, you've got talent, and I love Ender, but 'cide should've taken Ender to a new place 
 Reviewer Santteresa was totally correct. This is another incoherent nightmare from a bad revisionist author with a good publicist. The author does his usual rewriting of history. He often ignores the sources we have, and reinterprets them along his own inane version of political correctness. On one page he makes the most bigoted and incorrect statement one could imagine. "He said that the blood of the Gauls who sacked Rome in 390bc proudly ran in his veins. First, that proves his dismissive attitude towards the builders of western civilization. Second, the Irish have NOTHING whatever in common with the "Italian Celts-Gauls who started the wars with the Roman Republic!" As for his New Age version of Christianity. "How could the author, or anyone else for that matter put themselves in the minds or hearts of the apostles Peter or Paul? PLEASE, don't waste your time or money 
 The problem with Acharya's book is she compares Jesus figure, her main source of knowledge about Jesus is the four Gospels of New testament and the other contents of the NT, to the historical, more accurately mythological, figures. If the author asked any Muslim what you don't accept about Jesus, he/she will answer her that Muslims do not accept concepts like Trinity, Son of God, Jesus is a god, the idea of Jesus death on the cross, the idea of his resurrection, even 25th of December as Jesus birth day (Muslims know clearly that Jesus' birth day  was more likely between July-August not in December!)...  There is no doubt that the Gospels have been affected by the ancient mythologies and many concepts of modern Christianity have been derived from ancient civilizations (Egyptian, Indian, Iranian...etc) however, this does not mean Jesus did not exist or his character had been reconstructed from the ancient history only...Also, this does not mean the Gospels' writers added these concepts; it could be the generations who came after them! Although the gospels had been changed by addition/deletion, but the truth still inside these books and you can easily refute these concepts that had been added to them from ancient civilizations if you read the bible rationally...There is no doubt also that Buddha, Krishna, Mithra, Huros...etc were also good figures, more likely messengers/prophets of God to different nations, in their times and a few decades after their death, people transformed them into gods.  Similarly, the idols that were around Kaaba, in Mecca, were for good people.. A few generations after the death of those people, ancient inhabitants of Mecca, the Arabs, made figures, Taboos/idols, to remind them with those good people...After that, people start to worship them as a link to God as ancient Arabs used to do before Islam.  Similarly with Isis and Otheris and their son Horus...A few generations after their death, they became sacred figures and ancient Egyptians started to worship them and build superstitions about their regular life..The question that the author (and maybe the readers as well) has to think about is what is real about Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, Huros instead of trying to prove they all are image of one person. I agree that there are common myths about all of them...but this does not null their existence as normal humans (More likely messengers of God with a common mission and after some time of their death, their life became a myth as aforementioned).  The link between Solar system and these figures is notable since ancient cultures were so interested about astronomy/astrology.  Thus, to mix what people like about the Sun with real Mirtha, Krishna, Buddha, Huros..etc can be explained as an ancient idea propagated to different era and nations and became an inherited myth...In conclusion, there are a lot of myths about Jesus, Buddha, Mithra, Krishna, Huros..etc that nobody can deny and these myths have a common ancient background...but the real identity of those figures can be explained in many different ways.   This book is your best choice if you are interested to know about ancient religions and transformation of good figures into mythological gods.     
 Minding the Spirit is a collection of previously published articles that have been grouped by topic for the study of spirituality in the Christian tradition. This book is a bit of a disappointment. In general, the book is a polemic for the field of spirituality as an academic discipline especially at the graduate level. Key concerns are the definition of spirituality and the object and method of study. A few authors note Paul's use of spirit (pneuma) or spiritualities (pneumatikos) but most authors identify Christian spirituality with Christian experience.  The reader will quickly notice how little Scripture is used in this book. The few biblical passages cited are mostly illustrations from previous theologians (e.g. Origen, Augustine). The Scriptures are seen as the basis of Christian spirituality but most authors in this collection are quite vague about connecting spirituality and the Scriptures and some struggle with the role of the Scriptures. For example, Liebert views the psalms as a special case in the canon but the canon is a special case in Christian literature so any encountered text can become a living text, 94.   The struggle to merge historical concepts (traditions) and post-modern thinking is evident throughout the book. One example would be J. Matthew Ashley's statement challenging theologians to, "develop the conceptual tools to manifest the truth - or perhaps better to make the truth," 160.  This book will be of interest to those who are seeking to grasp the agenda of the post-modern university for spirituality as a discipline.  It will not be of much help for any interested in a biblical or personal understanding of Christian spirituality or even those seeking a history of the topic. Yet, students of a theological mind would all profit from the chapter (article) by Elizabeth A. Dreyer on the Holy Spirit in Augustine. Though presented as being to a wide audience the book is decidedly Catholic in perspective with Karl Rahner being the modern theologian referenced by most authors. All in all it is a disappointing work on such a great topic! 
 Very complicated book. Bad examples and format. AN FYI for college students trying to save money, the older edition is the SAME as the newest one. What a rip off. 
 The Bloomsbury edition illustrated by Ralph Steadman is ABRIDGED. Do not purchase unless you are buying it for the drawings 
 I'm pretty sad about this one, especially because of the cost.  I'm 34, with decent skin but some of the typical lines starting around the eyes, forehead, lip line, etc.  My skin does tend toward oily yet sensitive at times, if that context helps any of you out.  A friend of mine all of a sudden looks 10 years younger, beautiful, glowing poreless skin without needing any foundation so I asked her what she was using.  This was one of her key products and she said it took about 2 months for the effect to really be noticeable.    Unfortunately I can't use it enough to find out.  First I tried appplying it around my eyes, on my forehead and above my upper lip.  I broke out in really deep cystic acne in those areas after about 4 days.  I started relegating the application only to the eye area and even that is now having a horrible reaction.  I look like I've got insect bites under my eyes, or like I've been punched out.  Yuck.  It's gotta be some kind of allergic reaction.  It works so beautifully for my friend, I guess I'll be giving it to her to finish 
 there's nothing you can tell clearly about this movie, because from the very beginning to the end, i've just heard lota f words; f....this, f....that, typical stupid stereotyped mafia talks. and i swear to god when i watched this pathetic movie and thought that if mafia could be this stupid, and if they could just use that fxxx word in every sentence they talked, and if they thought that by using this fxxx word once they open their mouth to talk and used this f word to show their smartness and toughness, or if they thought by simply using this big F word and they could kill thy kingdom come, then america might not look like what we're seeing now. maybe the mafia could just use this big word to kill all the terrorists in the world, maybe they could just use it to solve all the problems and guess what? they're just using that word to kill each other. or is this just what hollywood think that all the mafia mob guys could walk the walk easier by simply using this big F word to talk the talk? i don't have any clue, man 
 I bought this book because I thought it would be funny and well, good. Im sorry to say, it's weird. And I've never written a review of any book before so I don't mean to be rude, but these stories are just way too abstract and so far from the point. Most of them don't even tell what happen in the relationship but  rather what happened in the girls mind. There are a couple worth reading but you could just thumb through it on the shelf. If you're looking for a good cry or laugh, this book won't give it to you. This book is simply filled with a lot trying to be too good writers instead of just telling what happened with the realtionship. Ok, Ok, I'm not a writer, but I honestly was excited to sit and read this book and lighten my mood and it just flopped. I would not recommend it. 
 What the Dormouse Said is an attempt to try and tell how the personal computer developed out of the 1960's counterculture. Sadly the author becomes so fixated on one person that he misses his chance to tell the great story. No author has yet to be able to capture the development of the personal computer but this book does have most of the salient elements. From the development of the ARPA net to the IBM 650 we can see the computer industry cloacae.  The need for the killer app or the internet is apparent but the attempts to link this all to one visionary who was not even involved in decision making or work on these projects is pitiful.  Doug Engelbert was not even around for the roll out of Xerox's computer or the Altair craze that ended with the distribution of Gates software.  This book gets two starts for the fact that it has all of the pieces there but loses the rest for being unable to connect them. Hopefully someone will finally tell this story someday.  
 I do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment. But I simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it. This is called censorship, and it gives me the creeps. As a parent, I have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children. So to realise that somebody has been cheating on me, trying to do my job so that I did not have to explain how society has evolved, how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud. this review is about the Harper collins Edition , edited by Patricia C. and Frederick L. McKissak, illustrated by Michael Hague 
 Even though Amazon specifically recommended this bag for the Panasonic Lumix (DMC-FZ20PP) camera, and even though I had to return it because it was too small, and even though my camera does not appear on the compatibility list shown in another customer's review, Amazon annoyingly CONTINUES to recommend this bag for my camera. To add insult to injury, Amazon tried to deduct shipping from my refund by claiming that the error was not their fault. (It took two emails to get the full refund, and that was even after I put a LARGE message in my return box not to deduct shipping -- aargh!)  Regarding the bag itself, construction seemed sound and this might be a good bag for a small point-and-click camera that requires no accesories 
 This book illustrates the product manager's duties, responsibilities in detail, and provides a good overview from product initiation to product lifecycle management. Sample templates are provided to provide an idea to a beginner. This book is not for present product managers. If you are a student and would like to become a product manager, then start with this book 
 In high school "Stroke You Up" was the jam, so I went downtown and bought the cassette. Let me tell you something: It took me 2 days to listen to it because it was utterly boring. Even "Stroke You Up" became unbearable to listen to. No funk, no groove- just lukewarm soul. That was the first *and* the last time I listened to "Changing Faces." The two chicks who made up "Changing Faces" had airy, monotonous vocals- no edge to their voices at all. Even the album cover looked boring. These chicks had no style or any type of pizzazz at all. Skip this at all costs and get Zhane 
 The story goes beyond bad. This is a story of three little girls that torture and kill the wolf in a premeditated way. My 4 year-old son was very sad after someone read the story to him in a school interview to preschool. He said to me that it was a bad story, and the girls have done "bad choices". I can't believe this is in the list of books recommended for 4 and 5's.  
 I read exactly half the book and stopped.  Based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending, that was a good decision.  As it is there went hours of my life I won't get back!  The book is silly and laughable.  The premise sounded great - but the book is bad.  Really bad 
 This program is good if you want to mold the matrix bit by bit. But if you want to make games in a snap, spring for the professional and get a level editor on a DarkBASIC website 
 Unless maybe you are a single person who eats out at fancy resturants, and would like to consider this an alternative. Then again, that is if you could only understand half of the recipe directions! This book is the only ... thing you will be getting out of it. Not at all worth the money, (good thing I checked it out at the library before buying it), I would reccomend either The complete Tightwad Gazette, or Not Just Beans anytime before I would this book!!! 
 Umberto Lenzi's most notorious entry into the "Italian Cannibal" subgenre is a contender with Cannibal Holocaust with the most bloodshed. Whereas Cannibal Holocaust was a well made exploitation film, Ferox is just a standard Euro-trash film laden with shocking gore moments. A student travels into the deep Amazon with a group of friends to prove here thesis that cannibalism never existed. They of course find evidence to prove this wrong. Our characters meet up with two criminals (tied in with a poorly explained subplot that takes place in New York City) who, guilty by association, get the entire group into sickening torture situations by a vengeful cannibal tribe. As usual, in poor taste, there are some real animal killings. Most of the music was taken from Umerto Lenzi's previous cannibal film Eaten Alive! 
     In Down to Earth, environmental historian Ted Steinberg struggles to establish nature as a profound force in the general narrative of American history. The book is rife with interesting facts and fascinating events, but unfortunately it does not consistently build upon the notion that the American past has been shaped by man's interaction with the environment. Steinberg offers some anecdotal evidence early in the text, but he seems to lose track of the book's purpose after the first few chapters. The last half of Down to Earth, in particular, leaves the reader wondering if there existed any sort of positive man/nature interaction after World War Two. Still,  several far more troubling problems emerge from the book.      Too often Steinberg's assumptions pass for evidence, and the author frequently reveals his own ideological biases. Down to Earth also neglects many major themes in environmental history, and seminal works by George Perkins Marsh, Frederick Jackson Turner, and Leo Marx do not even show up in the bibliography.      Down to Earth offers a good deal of trivia, and some breezy reading, but in order to really understand environmental history, erudite individuals should turn to works by William Cronon, Richard White, Donald Worster, and Martin Melosi.          
 I was forced to read this book because of a teacher of mine, for a topic at the university. She came to the classroom with this book, as if it were the ultimate guide on teaching. First of all, I thought it's not a topic for the kind of subject we were having/discussing in the classroom. Secondly, the things the authors wrote are so obvious, at least for some persons, that all I can say is that I really had a very good time reading it as a comic book, nothing else. I laughed very much with all the explanations a teacher would give to a 7 or 9 year-old pupil, because he touched her on the arm. It was a lecture, not a simple explanation! Clearly we have to be polite, encouraging and nice towards the students. But this book really exagerates some points in such a foolish way, that I could only laugh. I never had problems with students in my classes, I always tried to encourage them to like the subjects; I am sure they learned many things, as well as I learned from them, too. This book was just a waste of time. The worst thing is that the teacher I am talking about, the one who came to the classroom telling how wonderful the book is, doesn't practice what the book preaches! She is hated at the university and never behaves as the book says to. How is it possible? She didn't learn anything from it???  Maybe it's good for people who are starting a teaching career - then I would say read it, but even though I would be very cautious. But being recommended by someone who does exactly the contrary than the book states, I could imagine it wouldn't really be that good. 
   The layout and language of this extremely expensive textbook, written by one of the most seasoned and successful PR practitioners, unfortunately makes this book almost unreadable. Not only is it completely boring, but the language makes the topics seem very vague and disconnected from practical PR practice.   Chapters in this book are much too long. One can infer from the title of the book that it will cover PR practice in great detail, however, the most important topic the book covers "the execution of public relations" only gets 112 pages of a nearly 600 page book. 
 I saw on the cover it said something about the New York Times bestseller list, so I kept reading (for a while) since I thought it must have something good in it to get on the list.  Well, it never did!  It's just a bunch of ridiculous long-winded drivel that couldn't get to the point.  The author dragged out the most boring unimportant acts for pages upon pages upon pages, and nothing ever happens.  The LONG descriptions are of something like Val whining ad nauseum how she doesn't want to go to this memorial service, or Jake acting crabby on the plane, or how Val sat around for hours looking at Tony's picture in her apartment, etc.  Anyway, I don't know how it got on the NY Times list, that's for sure 
 I found this book to be poorly written and repetitive.  Needed some more peer/editorial reviews before going to market.  Could not even get past the first 3 chapters 
 I wanted to like this product. I looked forward to its arrival. The day it came, I unpacked it and raced to sweep my kitchen. Unfortunately, I was let down from the very first sweep. Whether on "auto" or "manual" setting, I have to almost knock the front of the unit with my broom to get it to turn on. Once on, the suction lasts 5 seconds during which I have to furiously try sweeping the debris in. Even then, it does not get it all.  I suppose if I had back problems this might be a true boon -- until it came time to clean the unit, that is. In the meantime, I've reverted to using my broom and my cordless vacuum to accomplish the same thing... and I gave this unit to a friend who hasn't shelled out for her own cordless vacuum yet 
 Absolute mindless tosh, stick to Iggy pop , this is a waste of plastic and oxygen on the part of the artists 
 We have several other planes from Estes that fly very good. We decided to get this one and had nothing but problems. One day we flew it and it flew away and fortunately came back. A few days later we flew it again (perfect wind conditions) and it flew away again and this time it did not come back. My 8 year old son was so upset. All of the other Estes products that we have tried have been great but not this one. It seemed like the radio couldn't control the plane reliably 
 I LOVE her cake mix dr books but hate this one. Every recipe I have tried has been awful. I don't cook with many prepared/boxed foods so maybe it is not a fair judgement. I love the idea of the book for when things are crazy and you want to make something fast and easy but the flavor of the dishes are really bad 
 This book left me very unsatisfied.  Most reviewers here hail the book as a "classic" and magnificent thriller, and many seem to feel that since Ambler is the "father of the modern spy thriller" they are duty-bound to beatify this work.  I'll take a modern spy author any day.  True, the plot moves steadily forward, the characters are fascinating and well-drawn, and the descriptions of pre-war Central Europe are delicious.  But the book seems to move like a train -- you get on, you look out the window at the passing landscape, and then you get off.  There was little if any excitement; the suspense was tepid; the plot  turned on convenient contrivances aimed only at enabling the author to keep the book moving.  The ending, to me, was naive and left me saying:  "Is that all there is???"  Like I say, in the face of all the rave reviews, I must be missing something 
 My son, husband, and I really do not like this DVD because (unlike other Baby Einstein DVDs) this DVD is too focused on cheap looking computer animation. There are very few puppet scenes, and the ones they have are pretty quick and lack much depth. The music is pretty bad, too. I prefer the music of Baby Mozart or Baby Beethoven. This sounded synthetic and computer-generated, not "real." I found this DVD to be boring and couldn't keep my attention or that of my son. My son (15 months) can't watch this entire DVD. He gets very bored and sick of the monotonous sign language instructions  (which take up most of the DVD and are pretty fast in pace).  I was underwhelmed and wish I hadn't purchased this DVD. It is not like previous BE DVDs.  I suggest Baby McDonald, Baby Da Vinci, or Baby Mozart to those who wish to purchase a BE DVD.  
 I bought this and shortly after I started using it the sides of my noise started swelling up and peeling. I didn't know what was going on and I stopped using it and it immediately went away.. as soon as I started wearing it again the swelling and pain came back. I am a person who doesn't break out very often and I can tolerate many products. I now have a permanent red mark on the right side of my nose and it hasn't faded yet. I tried to take it back to nordstrom and they wouldn't exchange it. This product sucks and as it was the only one I was using I know thats what caused the swelling.  
 I am unhappy with this product. My newborn baby is 22" long and weighs 7 pounds. I purchased this item after speaking to the rep about size. I've found that my son can easily get his legs out of the bottom pouch through the opening. I think that if there was a longer strip of velcro instead of the short square, this would be prevented. He also can get his arms out of the top. If the velcro strip could be larger, going more toward the back and side of the product, this would not happen. Maybe my son is more narrow at the top than some children and this is not a problem for many, but I think this would make the product more useable, one size fits all. Also, he is long, and the small size was too cramped. I'm assuming the next size up would have been too wide for him and therefore making it impossible for his arms to stay inside - which is happening anyway. I like the product idea and the fabric and construction,(which is why I gave it 2 stars) but this product did not work for me. I have recently purchased The First Years swaddle blanket, but have issues with that one as well. I am currently searching for one to fit. 
 After reading this book, I caught a duck to use on the links. Despite naming it Ping, my distance and putting went down the toilet. I would not suggest using Ping for your average hacker 
 I've had this book through 4 cats and kittens, and if you have a really healthy cat who never develops any illnesses, it's great. I find myself using the Cornell Feline Health Center online for my cats.   The diagnostic tree is just too vague, the descriptions of diseases are also too vague and there's just not enough information. Using a vet's resource center with a dictionary handy does you--and your cat--more good, especially if your cat has something really serious.   
 I viewed this movie when I was young when it first came out and was overjoyed to see it was available on DVD.  I received it today and I am very, very, very diappointed.  It was made in Malasia by the chinese I think, and it looks terrible, like a bad quality VHS.  It was likely copied from something, and I am surprised Amazon would carry something like this.  I will be sending it back 
  This is just an awful battery.  It came as the OEM battery on my Panasonic KX-TG2267 phone.  The P-P511 appears to have been used to power a host of other Panasonic cordless phones as well.   The battery quickly stopped holding a charge.    I looked for alternatives, and got an Eveready ER-P511 NiMH battery, which at 1200 mAH, is a slight improvement.  But hey, most NiMH AA batteries are way better than that these days!    So I decided to make my own battery, out of some 2500 mAH Eveready Energizer NiMH AA batteries.  It's not that hard.  Here's how you do it:   First of all, save the original P-P511 battery that came with your phone.  Study it.  The P-P511 battery is essentially made of three AA batteries linked together in series.   Linking batteries in series just requires that the minus pole of one battery contact the positive pole of the next battery, and so on.  These links can be made by using wires or strips of metal.  Take an Exacto knife or something similar and cut/peel away the outer plastic wrap of the battery.  The bottom part of this old battery will have a hard plastic frame that holds the three AA batteries together.  Save this plastic frame for re-use.  Next, note how the original three AA batteries are linked together.  The alignment of the three batteries is such that the one on the left will have the minus pole down, the one in the middle will also have the minus pole down, and the one on the right will have the positive pole down.   The plastic holder has two holes, one in the middle, and one on the right side to allow the middle battery's minus pole to contact the handset's spring leads, and the right side battery's positive pole to contact the handset's spring leads.  OK, so now all you've got to do is figure out how to hook up the batteries in series so that these two battery poles end up at each end of this daisy chain series.    Take heavy duty packing tape and some heavy duty aluminum foil (the kind that comes in the large heavy duty lengths work fine), and cut small 1/4 inch strips.   Tape the end of one such aluminum strip to the minus pole of what will be the left hand battery.  Run this aluminum strip flush along the body of the left battery to the other end of the battery, and tape the other end of the aluminum strip to the positive pole of the middle battery.  Next, tape these two batteries to the plastic frame holder and cover up the aluminum foil generously with some of the packing tape.  The next aluminum strip needs to run directly over the positive pole of the middle battery without making any electrical contact with it, so the positive pole of this middle battery needs to be well covered with tape and insulated.  So, tape down one end of a strip of aluminum foil to the top minus pole of the right hand battery, and run the foil strip across the top of the middle battery, and make contact with the bare positive pole of the left hand battery.  Tape dowm the aluminum foil to the top of the left hand battery.  Tape the right hand battery to the other two batteries and the frame, and then wrap the whole group of three batteries in tape again, just to make sure the whole thing stays together.  Voila!  You've made your own P-P511 battery!  
 I ordered this magazine as a gift for my brother almost 5 months ago and he still has not received an issue. I cannot get a straight answer from anyone about what is happening and I have not even been able to get my money back.  I would not recommend anyone wasting their money with this magazine unless they can find a legitimate web site to get it from.  Kerr 
 I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long.  There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost 
 Although the book presents itself as a grammar guide, it actually only contains pages of mostly worthless rules on the gender of nouns. If you want excercises or to actually learn grammar, then don't buy this book. I would recommend "501 German Verbs" 
 She has tried her best and  I admire her for the effort.  She sings with her heart , but ...I like some of her old stuff.  If you like her , you should listen to another great Lady who is the only one who can match her nowadays , Regina Belle.  Try her latest release,"Lazy Afternoon",and then let me know :-)    
 I must say the positive reviews here fooled me. I expected much more fun. I would have loved a real blend of soap opera and (even cheap) fantastique. But this doesn't even make the grade as 'so bad it's good' fun, at least for me. Well, maybe the first episode, but the second is just very boring. Yes, there is eye-candy in a soft porn kind of way, but not in the way of real cinematography (very crude camera blocking) or production design (the hospital set is awful and as for the rest, they're ok but too few). And it's just too badly written. There's some bad acting too, but that doesn't really hurt this kind of movies.  The second episode is less soft porn and more fantasy and plot-driven, but having to play every scene in the one same street and two or three poorly dressed sets, makes the characters eternally go back and forth between them, which gets tiresome pretty quick and also doesn't allow for really fluid plot development. Also fx or action scenes are sorely lacking. This could be secondary if the script were any good but there is no logic or clear rules in the universe they're creating and it ends up a mess. I guess they didn't have much time to shoot this but overall it's just not worth your time.   
 I bought the first gen. Pixter in 2004 for my daughters, it didn't have the updated video features but you could play games on it pretty good.  After a few months, it went dead, everytime you turned it on and use the pen the screen would freeze.  So I figured ok, this thing has just gone bad.   In 2005 I purchased the new and improved Pixter (in pink) for my girls, with the new video feature, and hoped maybe just maybe this one would stick around for a while.  Needless to say within  two months, the game was blinking on and off and not playing at all.  I wrote to Mattel and let them know of their faulty product and they told me to send it to them, I did and they sent it right back, still a broken mess.  I'd never buy another Pixter again.    Leapfrog has a much better handheld video game Leapster and their games are far more educational and practical than Pixter.  
 This book is the same old one-sided ranting found in most graffiti books. It only tells one side of the story; the selfishness of most graffiti writers to place their egos on city walls. It says nothing about how graffiti effects the people who live with it everyday in their neighborhoods. It also says nothing  about how graffiti has fueled a multi-billion dollar abatement industry in the US alone. No voices are heard from the real thing that keeps graffiti alive; the intense effort by US city governments to eradicate it. This book only scratches the surface. If you want a book that gets much deep check out Michael Walsh's powerful book Graffito. It hits on everything I've mentioned here and is visually much more dynamic 
 This book is not well researched.  It is based on a couple dozen short snippets of Nietzsche's work that Conway uses over and over again.  The rest of what the other reviewer who gave it only one star said is correct.  The whole point of Conway's book is to say that Nietzsche was vain, wanted nothing more than to control his followers, and that his readers are all fools -- which must surely include Conway.  Conway is a postmodernist whose prose is mostly unreadable.  His political orientation is Hegelian.  But Nietzsche was free of the Hegelian nonsense.  Conway rejects the individual.  But the individual is the central concept of Nietzsche's political thought.  Conway believes in totalitarianism, like Marx.  He has no faith in people, only in groups and their leaders.  Conway wants the PoMo future: utter ignorance and strong arm leaders who are allegedly benevolent because they have been freed of the fetters of law and existing contracts.  Conway thinks Nietzsche is an irrationalist, but Nietzsche ridiculed irrationalism throughout his career.  Conway and his postmodern moralist cohorts believe 'it is a sin against everything of value to become scientific' to cite just one bit of Nietzsche's mockery that fits the PoMo mind frame (CW Postscript 1).  This book is worth almost no one's time, and all students should avoid it 
 This book should have been good.  There are several separate story lines interwoven around the main one which I expected would add depth, complexity and interest.  Disher has the potential to paint a vivid picture of small town Australia.  But somehow  -  for me, at least  -  it just never picked up any momentum.  Many of the characters were under-developed and one- dimensional and some of the situations described were just implausible to me. It was obvious from quite early in the story who the serial killer was (there was no other convincing suspect!)and there was a total lack of suspense or tension for much of the narrative.  The action did pick up a litle towards the end, but that didn't compensate for the dreary plod through the rest of the book 
 I am a man with DID and I found this book insulting to those who truly suffer from its effects.  The book was written with an attempt to read like a novel.  The author obviously fills in many trivial events with specluations.  Since the Mr. West was NOT co-conscious for much of the book, he fills in the missing details with fluff and extremely poor writing.  The book is easy to read since it was written on a 5th grade level.  My eleven year old could easily sit down and read this.  The constant swearing and profanity left me baffled as to why the author decided to insert offensive language.  It didn't further the plot or define himself.  If it was an attempt to show the reader that he was a tough guy dealing with DID, it missed the mark since he spends most of the book refusing to take any responsibility for his actions, his family, and his diagnosis of DID.  The author spends most of his energy attempting to create a gripping story around his DID which falls flat in many of its 300 pages.  Not only are his sessions not realistic, but he paints his DID as debilitating deciding that he cannot work or take care of his family or even his young son.  The wife decides to work and puts the son in day care so that the father does not have to do anything but lay around with a blanket and toys and moan.  In truth, people with DID get up in the morning, dress, go to work, make dinner, help with homework, fix the plumbing, etc.  This is not an accurate portrayal of someone with DID.  Life with DID is hard and devastating, but DID is not an excuse to quit life.  Instead, all of life's responsibilities actually helps the person with DID to be in the present.    I found the therapy techniques in this book more consistent with DID therapy than in Fractured Mind.  However, Mr. West was not able to find a therapist who gave him the dose of reality that he needed until the last few chapters. The first therapist never encouraged Mr. West to be present or taught him the skills he needed to be present and function as an adult.  This obviously gave Mr. West the green light to whine and whimper through most of the book.  At the end of the book I became very concerned about Mr. West entering the field of psychology and leading others down the his distorted path of healing.  In short, I find the book poorly written with a great amount of offensive language, a contrived storyline with an abundance of holes, and an inaccurate portayal of someone who struggles with DID.  I am concerned that readers of this book will assume that there is important information within the pages that will help them. It will only assist the reader in becoming more confused about the disorder.   The Dissociative Identity Disorder Source Book is still the best book that will help anyone learn about what DID is and how to deal with it.  Energies should be spent reading viable material that will explain, teach and help those with DID and their support. Please do not get sucked in by the media hype and the over effulgent swooning of others who obviously have dealt very little with DID. For respect of those who daily brave the storm of DID, do NOT buy this book.  You've been warned.   
 Looking for a supplementary text for my Numerical Analysis course, I had my students pick up this text-  I have found that other Outlines give a lot of excellent worked examples and provide good summaries- Not this text.  If you are a beginning student, go get yourself a real text (I would highly recommend Burden and Faires, or the new text by Tim Sauer).  This text offers little to no insight into the algorithms or the analysis, and spends way too much space on one dimensional interpolation problems.  If you're simply looking for summaries of algorithms and practical advice on implementation, a much better text is the "Numerical Recipes" books.  In summary, I'm not sure who the audience is for this book-  There are many, much better, options out there 
 How could a supposedly comprehensive compilation of VU tracks not contain a single cut from Loaded? Where's "Sweet Jane"? Where's "Rock 'n Roll"? Those songs are just as much a part of VU's legacy as anything from VU & Nico, and it's ludicrous that they aren't represented. Sure, John Cale left prior to Loaded, but that doesn't mean it isn't a part of the band's catalogue. Also, there's an obvious predilection on the part of whoever assembled this CD to negate all the great experimental work the band put out. "European Sun" is arguably as significant a VU & Nico track as "Heroin", and where's "Sister Ray"? Including only "White Light/White Heat" and "Here She Comes Now" makes White Light/White Heat seem like The Velvet Underground and Nico Part II, which it obviously is not. WL/WH should be appreciated for the dark nihilist art piece that it is. Let's have a real VU retrospective, one that better encapsulates the band's monolithic influence on American art. Better yet, let's not have any retrospective at all. 
 This is Marcuse's most famous work and one that was a major influence on and during the student revolts all over the European continent of 1968. Many of the catchphrases of that time, such as "repressive tolerance" and the like, are derived directly from Marcuse. He has since lost much of his popularity and audience, and in my view, quite deservedly so.  His main thesis is that modern man has become one-dimensional due to the totalitarian, all-encompassing exercise of power by the entrenched capitalist class. While this of itself is not such a bad idea, though certainly romanticizing and exaggerating reality, his approach to explaining and attacking it leaves very much to be desired. Marcuse overuses empty or unexplained phrases endlessly (like "cutting off perspectives through an overwhelming ossified concreteness of imagery" and similar things) while at the same time hardly making use of any prior thought or philosophy on the subject at all. This makes the impression of much ranting and little content. Even worse is his general laziness as a thinker - he never actually bothers to explain why such a full-spectrum dominance has occurred or how he wants to prove its existence, he merely asserts it and then goes on about the manifold bad effects it has.  Rather bizarre in this context, and perhaps even nihilistic, is his general dislike of what he perceives as "rationality". He only uses this word in negative contexts (particularly in the context of industrial expansion) and seems to consider it the primary form of "one-dimensional thinking", affected by the symbolism of capitalism. Now it is one thing to say that the fashionable concept of rationalism is false and ill-founded, but to reject relying on rational processes altogether as he seems to do is a bit too much.  To put it bluntly, everything Marcuse has written in this book has also been written in, say, Debord's "The Society of the Spectacle", and then in half as many words and quite more philosophically coherent. The early Marcuse (of Eros and Civilization) was much better; this book warrants no more interest than a purely antiquarian historical one 
 My challenge would no doubt be viewed with contempt, despite the many justified challenges of the status quo in history. Somehow it is always thought that although profound mistakes were made in the past, the contemporary establishment has things straightened out. My contention is that what is called Goedel's proof is a fundamental embarrassment in the history of logic and mathematics.  There are many particulars in this book that I can criticize which extend beyond Goedel. There is the formalization of deductive systems tracing back to Hilbert. It consists in using symbols without meaning, which are afterward "interpreted" according to subject matter. The like happened most prominently in non-Euclidean geometry, when terms like "straight line" and "plane" were reinterpreted to designate certain curved lines and surfaces, to then demonstrate that some Euclidean theorems do not hold. The problem is that this commits the basic fallacy of equivocation. By redefining words, the statements containing them no longer apply to the original meanings. Likewise, meaningless symbols in formal systems can be defined in conflicting ways. Presently this concerns the use of "Goedel numbers" for such symbols.  "Goedel's proof" is about a sentence which may be phrased as  "THIS STATEMENT IS UNPROVABLE (IN THE SYSTEM)".  The sentence has been recast into logical symbols, and it is these symbols, individually or combined, that are given "Goedel numbers". The argument then is that whatever is determined about the sentence applies to the numbers, viz. to mathematics. The equivocation should be obvious, but alas it isn't. The thinking is explained away by examples like the use of algebra in geometry. But these concern actual mathematical content. The sentence now at issue has no such content, the numbering merely designating the linguistic constituents.   Now to the sentence itself. As indicated there inside parentheses, the sentence is said unprovable in whatever deductive system is used, but Goedel is held to have proved it via "meta-mathematical" means outside the system. This contention I see as an excuse, avoiding contradiction. For, whatever the logic in the proof, it can be made part of the system. To exclude valid logical procedures from deductive systems unjustifiably cripples the systems, and to do so only serves the purpose of claiming an impossibility by not utilizing available tools.  This means that the alleged unprovability in logic, let alone mathematics, of statements otherwise decided true is false, and the statements can thus easily be shown to harbor contradictions and accordingly constitute paradoxes, rather than be part of an assumed consistent system. Regarding the above capitalized sentence, the argument advanced can be put as follows.  If the statement were provable then its negation,  "THE STATEMENT IS PROVABLE",  would also be provable, since that is what the provability would mean, and if this negation were provable then the original statement would also be provable, since the negation says so (p.99 in the book, in different words).  Then it is argued (p.100) that since "if a formula and its...negation can both be derived in some formal calculus [deductive system], then the calculus is not consistent", it follows that if it is consistent, "neither the formula...nor its negation can be demonstrable".  (This is said to make the formula "undecidable", which interestingly supposes the system consistent, in saying, p.101, "that an undecidable formula can be constructed within [it]". Here we see another pitfall of "formal", i.e. meaningless, systems. It is somehow thought that if they comply with grammatical rules, there is no problem. But grammatical sentences can in meaning be contradictory.)  It is further argued (pp.101-2) that one of the above capitalized statements must be true, and since the initial one was found "undecidable", namely to have "no proof inside [the system]", it is the true one, by asserting that unprovability.  It is finally reemphasized that this was not deduced "from the axioms and rules of a formal system, but by a meta-mathematical argument."  But those axioms and rules, unlike contended, easily accommodate the logic, which is quite common. That neither of the above capitalized sentences is provable because it implies the other follows by the "law of contradiction"; that one of them must presumably be true follows by the "law of excluded middle"; and that it is the initial sentence which is true, since just found unprovable, can be said to follow by the "law of identity". Thus the unprovable sentence is contradictorily proved via the well-known "laws of thought".  As indicated, the sentence is correspondingly internally contradictory and can be added to other paradoxes, rather than be proclaimed true and unprovable. 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 Willard goes into extensive details about theological things he knows little about, or at least has only a passing understanding of. This book is way too long and gets bloated and outright boring in places! This book is filled to the brim with intellectually superior language, and a reductionist look at the Bible, a book that is certainly challenging, but not as complicated as Willard makes it out to be! He wastes the readers time by roaming from subject to subject, and drifting off the subject entirely at times.   I was disappointed in this work; it was not at all the 'gem' that I thought it would be. Read something by C.S. Lewis, Philip Yancey, or Henry Nouwen, you will be inspired and not driven to distraction by all the superfluous theological notions. There is nothing conspiratorial about THE DIVINE CONSPIRACY, it is simply another book that beats Christians over the head with wearying and overly complex ideas that may, in fact have little to do with the Truth of Jesus Christ 
 A book written by an apologist, one whose idealism prevents her recognizing the truth. Perhaps the current "Islamic rage" about the Pope will wake her up.  I suggest anyone interested in the facts read: The Sword of the Prophet by Serge Trifkovic and, Prophet of Doom by Craig Winn. Facts are facts, and both of these books present facts.  If the truth about Muhammad offends Muslims, then part of the problem has been identified. The Koran, and the words and deeds of the Prophet cannot be challenged, criticized or scrutinized. Blind faith in an infallible man is the basis for "Islamic rage. 
 Have you taken meat & eggs out of your diet? Are you still trying to limit saturated fat to less than 10% of your total calories? Are you popping statins to keep that cholesterol level below the maximum de jure? How about some pills for that hypertension? Do you need more little brown bottles sitting on the bathroom vanity? Don't be fooled by the title of this book. Scott Deron takes the politically correct route through the "cholesterol & saturated fat" minefield, choosing dogma over science at every turn. Where's the new information about CRP in this book? Eighty percent of this book is a rehash of the same bromides we've been swallowing for 30 years. Cardiovascular disease, meanwhile, has continued to climb unabated. If you're looking for the root cause of cardiovascular disease, you won't find it in this book. If you're looking for interventions that split with the already-disproved AMA/AHA doctrine, you won't find that here either. Do yourself a favor. Use your  money to buy Colpo's "The Great Cholesterol Con", McCully's "The Heart Revolution" or Francis' "Never Be Sick Again". Your heart will love you for it 
 If you are looking for info on hotels and restaraunts - keep looking.  This was the least useful of the three books I bought.  It is way too out of date.  It is useful for things that dont change like day trips and general travel info, but much of that was too generic 
 Petra of all places. Supernatural protection, persecution, on ad naseum. The one drug on, and on, and on,  and on ......  Same tired story, persecution by Carpathia a lame attempt at evil incarnate and his lackies. Sorry..   I think the series denegrates Christianity rather then exalting it.   I've read all 12 and found it morose and condemning. The opposite of how I view Christianity is. 
 Normally, I find it hard to put a Sue Grafton book down once I get started. Not the case with "S". I did not enjoy the plot about Violet and her abusive husand.  The main character Violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs, red hair, just a boozing slut over all.  I didn't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her. The ending wasn't clear either. I did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades. Most of the characters just weren't that interesting overall.  I missed her interactions with Rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor, the handsome 80 year old baker Henry. Usually, there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here.  I would vote pass on this one. 
 It's not too much to infer that the author's main concern in writing this book was to be the first person to deliver a Java image processing book (1999), since he says as much in one of the many radically uninspired (and frequently self-generated) "pithy" quotes that precede each chapter.    Every bad thing the other readers have said about this book is true- here's my contribution. Throughout the book, he references advanced mathematical concepts as though the expected reader was a graduate mathematics major. Nevertheless, when the concepts get easy enough to cover comprehensibly without too much effort, he explains them in detail. So, for instance, he goes into what a histogram is, what the formula for finding the roots of a binomial equation is (which we all learned in 11th grade ) etc. etc. Compare this to his explanations of the higher mathemtical concepts upon which his code depends which seem to be penned in order to win some contest for expository opaqueness.   Basically, if you can understand his fragmented, confusing, telegraphic and seemingly careless explanations then you already know enough so as not to need the book in the first place.   But hey, it was first.     
 This is the first book or internet site I've found that explains the science of eczema. Very interesting and useful information. I bathe better now and notice a difference. My complaint with  the book is his push to use drugs, like all the other dermatoligists who seems to care less about a person's long term health. "Take these creams and come back next months with your money" I can control my breakouts with the food I eat and there are countless other people saying the same thing. I also use an herbal cream that works as good as the steroid cream I was prescribed. My sister-in-law stopped drinking orange juice and her eczema vanished for good.  According to Dr. Nasir we should continue eating our Big Macs and taking his steroids. 
 Contains every trendy lefty misconception there ever was about the war.  Totally and hopelessly untrue 
 We bought this for our son for x-mas, he already has a voice changer that he plays with a lot, but it's one of those bull horn type things that you have to hold up, so we thought he'd like this.  It only changes the voice in 2 ways and then it's a matter of turning the tone up and down.  The headpiece for the microphone is designed to fit a very large adult and doesn't go down to a small enough size.  The one we got I think was a returned item refurbished, because upon opening the seal of the item had chips in it (not the top or bottom) and the voume control just spun, which made it difficult to turn on.  For a $16 dollar item, I'm not sure it's worth the return cost to return it and get a new one, it just isn't all that fun for a 6 year old, he prefers the old bull horn one we have 
 I attended a workshop with this dangerous charlatan. I was truly shocked by what I witnessed. This self-procliamed messiah had an almost hypnotic effect on his devotees. He appealed to their egos by telling them they are the "chosen ones" privy to the wisdom of the "ancient mystery schools." But there's a catch,to be a part of his special circle one must embrace thier darkness. "I am the darkness" is the mantra of those who follow this man. And the results are what you might expect puppet-like people who slump and then stand to attention depending on their master's pull of the string. 
 This book is a joke.  To nearly every sentence as well as the title there should be added the phrase "except for sports."  In 1969 when I was entering college, virtually all Americans, including those like Mr.  Levine who were part of the New Left, were close-minded about sports such  as soccer and cricket.  Thirty years later the New Left still hasn't become  open-minded about foreign sports.  Neither The Nation nor In These Times  could be bothered to run articles about the Women's World Cup this past  summer, nor does Levine exhibit any open-mindedness about foreign sports in  this book.  His demand that others be open-minded rings hollow, given that  he himself is close-minded 
 At less than a dollar per sparkly Frisbee, this is the best price I can find for Frisbees. They don't fly very well and they break relatively easily, but this is the best value I can find for 100 Frisbees in one place.  A lot of people are disappointed because they expect to be able to use these discs as writable CD media. The problem with that is, they don't work very well for that either. I, too, tested this for myself.  Using Nero Burning ROM, I tried many times to burn different kinds of data onto several of the discs -=AT 4X=-, just like you're supposed to. IT WORKED! It burned fine. Then it took 5 minutes to open a simple HTML document on the burned disc. Subsequent trials run with the "Verify Written Data" checkbox checked revealed that every other sector or so was unreadable after burning. It's like writing with a white crayon, except this is white paper. This persisted on several OTHER computers with different CD burner drives and even different software.  I finally realized what great Frisbees these things are. Cheer up people: THEY ARE GREAT FUN! So grab your spindle, go outside, and start chucking these things at your neighbor's annoying dog.  PS. I need to sue Memorex for selling this junk. These disc are just a form of abuse 
 The stories chosen for this book are average at best.  The new stories do nothing to grab the imagination and the stories from established authors just give the feeling of being chosen more for their obscurity (cheap royalties?) than the quality of the stories.  The whole thing just seems to have a feel of "let's get as many words into a book as cheaply as possible".    If you're looking for something to while away the time, you've come to the right place.  If you're looking for a collection of stories that either defines the genre or challenges the imagination, you'll want to look somewhere else 
 A glorified cliche, this book does little justice to Shakespeare's writing ability as it isn't nearly his best work. Its marvellous dissemination and public love and recognition beffudles me. Superficial, lackluster, and diaphanous often foolish and loathsome compourtment and intelligence of the characters makes this book nothing more than a wonderful waste of valuable time. Never has Shakespeare created a work so imbued with cliches and idiocy. Basically, Romeo and Juliet is a story about two romantically-impaired "star crossed" lovers who have to avoid the obstacles presented by the feud between their families to realise and consummate their ephemeral marriage. They arent star crossed! They are inane idiots too immersed in "love" to recognize the imprudence of their actions. Their deaths were not the least bit pitiful, but risible. Cognitive, yes. Irritating, yes. Interesting? No. The utter folly of the characters is murderous, very uncharacteristic of Shakespeare who usually presents intelligent and philosophical personages. Do not base your opinion of Shakespeare on this pathetic work, he has created and transcended this one with a myriad of his other much more meaningful and enthralling plays. I d much rather recommend Midsummer Night's Dream or Hamlet 
 I thought this book was going to interact exegetically with the texts that each system uses to establish itself. At least as far as the central three chapters go, on that score, this is a disappointing book. The author starts his overview of dispensational theology with the same tired arguments (posed and answered many times before) over the origins of dispensationalism along with the (apparently) obligatory derogatory language ridiculing dispensationalism. (In the culture at large, it seems the only people one can deride without fear of being called intollerant are evangelical Christians; simply deriding them/us is somehow a means to establish oneself as superior. Among evangelical scholars this role [mock-able and dismiss-able] is assigned to dispensationalists). (He apparently got some of his material from B. Rossing's really mean, poorly researched and really bad attack piece "Rapture Exposed." Please! can we just leave C. I. Scofield's undocumented past out of the discussion? How is this "testing" the exegetical foundations?) The author demonstrates a serious ignorance of dispensational theology when he claims that Matthew 24: 36-41 (p. 112) is "of course" a "favorite text to prove the rapture." Simply false; that text is about the Second Coming and no reputable dispensationalist I know claims otherwise. He conflates texts that speak of the rapture (1 Thess 4) with texts that speak of the Second Coming without a single reference to the dispensational arguments that keep such texts separate. It boils down to Witherington's assertions as to the meaning of 1 Thess 4, 5 and Matthew 24 set next to inaccurate and inadequate summaries (by Witherington) of what dispensationalists teach (see the summary list on p. 109). His discussion of the nature of prophecy is largely irrelevant to a critique of dispensationalism since many of the points he makes could be and are made by dispensational exegetes.  His overview of Romans 9-11 is not really a critique of dispensationalism, so much as his contribution to the very crowded boat-load of Romans commentators; some more some less amenable to dispensationalism. Yes, there are implications for dispensationalists given the author's take on Romans 9-11 but Witherington's view casts a shadow over many alternate interpretations and is by no means the most sound (see Moo, Romans: NICNT, among others). If you are a non-dispensationalist looking for a fair overview of the system this book is clearly not it. 
 The camera feels slick.  The software that comes with it gets a 4 star for efficiency, though the intuitiveness is not its strength.  While the large LCD display is terrific (the main reason I got it), It is worthless in a high glare situation.  You can't see what you are shooting.  It's worthless!  And since Nikon did not give you a viewing lense for such situations, there are times whey you have no idea what you are shooting. While the viewing wheel, to rapidly cycle through the shots you've taken, is quite handy, the rest of the navigation is less than intuitive, and often takes so long to figure out that you give up.  Pictures are generally good, though the conditions have to be perfect, or you get grain or blur.  There is one lovely feature, but it is only useful on a tri-pod.  It is a function which allows you to take a flash photo and have the aperture remain open for a little while after to fill in the background.  It creates flash shots without the black void background typical of such pix.  I use that feature a lot, but its worthless without "legs" for the camera.  I bought this on a whim, counting on the Nikon reputation.  Had I known, I would have stuck with the Canon 
 There is no objective advise here.  While I've worked in Cosmetics and know there is a lot of hype, there are great products out there that she just completely destroys - mostly anything plant based.  Not all here descriptions are valid and unless you have terribly sensitive skin, you can just ignore this book.  The truth is keep your reciept! Take a tack and pin the reciept and box to a bulletin board and try the product your interested in, if you don't like the result, return your products to the store.  If in 4 weeks you don't see ANY difference, it's not working for you!  But this book will simply scare you, when most products are perfectly safe without reactions 
 This book should be re-titled, "A Collection of Interviews with Leading Product Designers."  I purchased this book, thinking that it would provide some sort of insight into the process of becoming a product designer - the education, experience, portfolio build-up, etc.  Instead I read through eleven chapters of interviews with some of the leading industrial designers, but nothing, really, on "Becoming a Product Designer."  I have taken a few product design classes and have discovered that product design is ineffectively taught  through endless hours of lectures about past experiences of other designers, instead of actually helping to develop the skills of the aspiring designer.  This book was reminiscent of those classes, and thus, i was somewhat disappointed.  However, I gave it two stars because it does indeed have alot of info about other designers and it also does provides some insight into the other branches of product design.  Unfortunately, none of the information actually talks about "How to become a Product Designer.  This book merely describes how other designers decided to choose a career and what their opinions are in product design.  So, if you're looking for an informative book on how to become a product designer, then don't buy this book.  However, if you like reading about other designers and what their experiences are like as product designers, then by all means go ahead and read this book 
 Text gives good introduction to concepts only and not good for advanced studies because not explain how to apply the concepts to real world problems.  It lacks in calculations needed to sovle problems and has no  solution guide for the questions that are in the text. A lot of reference  texts will be needed to solve the problems. No periodic table found in the  text or conversion chart in the text which is very poor for a chemistry  text. But it is an excellent text for learning the concepts of  environmental chemistry 
 Thia book is out-dated.. the information it provides is to broa 
 It may be good for a university classroom, but I don't think this book works well on its own.  It lacks the details that would really make clear the significance of the people and events and leave them in the memory.  I was even bored by the section on the Cultural Revolution!  But I did learn a fair bit nonetheless 
 I consider myself to be very fortunate to have discovered this band here on amazon in my quest to find comparable bands to Depeche Mode in that same vein of dark melodic synthpop. However I am even more fortunate to have chosen this album as one of the last and final additions to complete my De/Vision collection because had I chosen this as my first exposure to the band, I might not have become a DV fan at all.  Looking past the intriguing cover art and amazing single spawned from it( Heart Shaped Tumor ), this album is terrible. You'd never know it to read the tracklisting, but tracks like "Silent Moan" and "Drowning Soul" are actually featherlight tracks full of optimistic and silly lyrics{"It's a beautiful world, we've got so much to do, this life is a grace, you know it's true" HUH?!?! This band did not come into popularity for making happy feel-good songs }and even weaker paper-thin synth beats. Do not misinterpret that I am just some gothic snob snubbing the band because they don't have their typical heavy doom and gloom dance sound. DV is perfectly capable of constructing a masterpiece of softer, more upbeat tracks and that is proven ten fold with "Devolution". Listening to this album almost makes me want to scream out in frustration! I can hear the lovely voice of the band that I've grown to love so much, still as true to form as ever, but the music, beat and lyrics sound so terribly cringeworthy that I would have never guessed that this indeed was DV if not for those familiar vocals.   Further disappointment is the 3 bonus tracks included on this US edition, as they are all tracks available on the "Heart Shaped Tumor" maxi single, which is an extremely better purchase as compared to this. "Two" would be best classified as a DV ballad album but don't expect anything remotely similar to the sweet emotional magnificence of previous DV ballads like "Dress me when I Bleed", "Moments we Shared" or "The Melody of your Face". With the exception of "All I ever do" and "Heart Shaped Tumor", and the 3 bonus tracks, which are all true to DV's masterpiece form and thus, achingly out of place here, this album is chock full of unispired melodies, dreadfully boring synths, and laughable lyrics. Even if these tracks were completely redone by the likes of such masters like VNV Nation, Mesh, or even Depeche Mode themselves, they would still fall short of what De/Vision is all about.   I feel that this album is for completists only. Those who want to own the quality bits of this album need only to aquire the "Heart Shaped Tumor" maxi single and download "All I ever Do". If you're starting from scratch then pick up "Zehn" ( a lovely singles compialation ) and anything from 1992-1998 for a taste of the classic dancable  darkpop sound. The rest of the newer albums are all great and worth owning for a mellower, softer DV sound. Check out "Void" if you're into the experimentation of guitars in the mix, "Devolution" for a GOOD enterpretation of more optimistic and upbeat songs and the full fruition of the 'ballad album' idea with "6 Feet Underground", which is what I feel the band may have been shooting for when they made this album. Thank Goodness they fully recovered and got that one bad album behind them 
 Let me begin by saying that I was a huge fan of Rossi's first book.  So big a fan in fact, that I used it in current events classes that I teach.  I will never make that mistake again.  This, her follow up book, could best be described as self-indulgent uber-drivel.  The book begins by telling us that Bush and conservatives are evil and she gives us a few statistics to prove it.  For example 42% of people go to church once a week.  And some neocons are Jewish.  Can you feel the evil?  Poorly researched and a poor carbon copy of the fat guy in the baseball cap, Rossi's book is the kind of biased tree killer that you would expect from someone with a degree in.....can't seem to find out....from....can't seem to find out.  Of course, the book is good for a few laughs.  It begins by telling us that conservatives are evil because they view the world in black and white.  Turn on your hyposracy detectors and break out the vodka shots!  I think we found a new drinking game!  Everytime you find a poorly rearched tidbit, a non-sequitor, or something hypocritical take a drink.  You'll be drunk before the end of the first chapter.  Good for a laugh but do us a favor, save a tree and don't buy it 
 there's no music, as it were, in what a.s. byatt does:  i have read three of her novels now and i'm, i think, in a pretty good position to judge her stuff as utterly pretentious and banal.  read just one page of hers and compare it to a paragraph (a single sentence?!) of James Joyce.  i am an english prof--hence all the lit allusions in this novel just kinda made me sick.  she drops so many names/quotations you need an imaginary broom to sweep them away.  dreadful dreck.  you need something Englishy to read--investigate William Boyd or Julian Barnes.  byatt is like a parody of good writing.  only salman rushdie's fiction is more onanistic (though his criticism's pretty cool).  byatt is the literary equivalent of Stevie Nicks!  Icky!!! 
 A joke that swept through The University of Texas a long time ago:  A freshman physics teacher at Texas A&M asked his class to name the greatest invention of all times.  One student said fire.  Another said gunpowder.  Another said the internal combustion engine.  Then a Texas A&M football player on the front row said, "The thermos bottle."  When asked by the teacher why he would pick that as the greatest invention, the student said, "You put something hot in it and it stays hot.  You put something cold in it and it stays cold."  The teacher asked why that made it great, and the student replied, "How do it know which to do?"  That thermos bottle is in this book in the form of a magic (indistinguishable from magic) sphere.  I liked the first book, in spite of its "magical" science.  This novel seemed like a shaggy dog story leading to the thermos bottle.  Much ado about little 
 If you like Redon for his vibrant color, look for another book. Dream symbolism and spirituality that inspired Redon's imagery are the main topics of this book. Most of the many examples are black and white drawings. However, the real magic of Redon is his use of color in his mature works. This was not adequately represented.  
 There are times when this book goes off on a tangen. Sometimes I actually forgot that the book was about fressmasonry because it rambles on about things in way too much insignificant detail.  Also, some of the investigation into the historical aspect of the reasearch unjustly discredits the many things that have already been proven by scholars and archeologist. Overall, I think the authors came to their conclusions about history because they found what they wanted to find and made sense out of things that was most convenient for them. It is sort of like looking for a cloud in the shape of an animal...if you look hard enough you will find it. I was not as dissapointed when I learned that neither of these authors has a background in history, research, or the arts. One is in advertisement while the other is an engineer ?????? My recommendation is to look for publications written by those in their respective fields 
 Reading this book is a little like reading the Kama Sutra. Both books discuss fascinating subjects but readers are given far more information than they are ever likely to use in practice.  Some critical weaknesses. First, there is the number of metrics: there are 114 (and some metrics are divided into sub-metrics, too). Another problem is that while the authors describe a broad range of metrics and scales, they are often less than informative as to how measurement is to be accomplished. They maintain, for example, that brand awareness should be measured on a scale of 1-7; but they give little information on how this notoriously sensitive subject can be quantified accurately. The same is true of metrics such as customer intentions and loyalty.  Finally, does this book really solve the problem of how to measure marketing performance or payback? On the whole, it does not. Nor does it discuss the key decisions that managers must make about marketing, and this lack of decision-orientation is the biggest weakness of the book.  Managers need guidance that links with real world decisions.    Much better alternatives are: - Marketing and the Bottom Line (ISBN: 0273661949) - Marketing Payback (ISBN: 0273688847 
 I have never really "reviewed" an item, but always read, so here's my donation.  No even  grinding in either mill (one holds salt, the other pepper) without lots of fussing with the screw nob at the top to adjust the opening. Some peppercorns come out broken in half, while others are appropriately "ground".  Peppercorns get caught in the grinding mechanism.  In the case of the salt mill,  again uneven grinding.  It may be because the sea salt I have in there seems a bit more moist than bone dry.  My chief complaint is that when you use the mill, you need to adjust the screw on top with every movement, thus, you get what I mentioned...the case of the uneven grind!  
 I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The "bowel movement" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book 
 This book is devoid of humor or insight. Save your money and apply it towards "Adventure Capitalist" by Jim Rogers.  I wish I had 
 I found this book exciting and interesting as far as the history of true Mediterranean Cuisine, but some of the statements of the author are quite opinionated, bold and brash (and couldn't necessarily be substantiated) and some extremely biased against Christianity. He is an Arab-studies scholar before this, and so it seems he finds time and again places where he can make digs on Christians of the past. I had a hard time getting past his little remarks to get to the real meat of his history.   As far as the recipes...they are a bit disappointing. Like the other reviewer, they are scattered throughout the book, seemingly without organization. While trying to write about true historical Mediterranean cuisine, he throws in modern recipes from friends at various spots....almost like an afterthought. There isn't much rhyme or reason to where or why recipes are in a certain section or chapter.  And it is very longwinded.. 
 this film was funded by the centeral intelligence agency in the 1950s and was maipulated to suit the need of a capitalistic propoganda machin 
 I've been a user of Pinnacle version 8 (which I loved), and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer DVDs.  What a disappointment this "upgrade" has been.  Crash after crash.  What is most disappointing is that Pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could "help" them develop a better product.  This means to me that they knowingly released bad code, and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a $100.  Guess what, I don't want to help Pinnacle build a better product.  I want a product that works when I purchase it.  Lesson learned.  Next time I read a bad review on a product, I'm staying away 
 this was the first book of Bell's that I have to say throughly disappointed me. I had read some of his more recents books and loved them and decided to look up his older works. I'm glad I was going backward and not forward or I would have never read the later well written stories. This was NOT a keeper. 
 I put one star because it's the minimum, if not, I would've gave it zero stars. This CD can be reviewed in so few words... here are some: NO!!! Don't Bad Stay Away from it I told you, NO!!!  In short, no music from the movie is here, and the music that is here... well, it might as well not be here, and it would it be better that way.   Summary: NO!!! don't get this CD, use the money in something else, get a hamburger or somethin 
 I really wanted this product to work, but it really didn't help with my problem. I always have erect nipples no matter what and this really doesn't fully flatten them, or make them less noticeable with t-shirts, etc 
 Whatever happened to Elizabeth Lowell's steamy romances like "To The Ends of the Earth" and "Winter Fire"?  "The Wrong Hostage" was...well, it was boring and confusing.  There was so much unnecessary dialog about Mexican politics and drug lords that I just tuned it out. (Oh, I listened to this book on CD.)  There was zero chemistry between Grace and Joe and only one steamy scene between them. This was very slow moving to the point that by the time I got to the last CD, I was so bored that I just wanted it to end. It was way too long; way too complicated; definitely not worth the time it took to finish it 
 Nowhere in the description of this book does it say that you need J++ or Access, however, all the examples required them.  All I wanted to do was learn SQL, not purchase J++ and Access, nor did I want to learn them.  My goal (when I grew up) was to learn SQL as applied to any database, hopefully IBM DB2 
 I HAVE BEEN SOMERSIZING FOR ABOUT 5 WEEKS AND HAVE ENJOYED THE FOOD RECIPES IN SUZANNE SOMERS 3 BOOKS, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY THIS DESSERT BOOK.  SO FAR I HAVE LOST 10 LBS AND AM LOVING THE RESULTS WITHOUT STARVING MYSELF.  HER PROGRAM IS TRUELY A WAY TO LIVE BY.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PURCHASE HER PRODUCTS, BECAUSE SHE GIVES YOU MOST OF THE RECIPES IN HER BOOKS, I LIKE THAT!  THIS DESSERT BOOK DID FALL SHORT THOUGH COMPARED TO THE OTHER WONDERFUL BOOKS.  I HAVE TRIED THE CHEESECAKE WHICH IS OK, BUT WHEN YOUR EARLY ON HAVING THE SUGAR CRAVINGS IT LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED, I SUFFERD THROUGH.  WE ALSO TRIED THE ICE CREAM AND THE PREVIOUS REVIEW IS EXACTLY RIGHT, THE SOMERSWEET MAKES THE ICE CREAM HARD AS A ROCK, IT WASNT VERY GOOD.  I HAVE YET TO TRY ANY OTHER RECIPES.  THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY LOOK MORE LIKE THE DESSERTS I AM USED TO ARE ON LEVEL 2, SO I GUESS WE JUST HAVE TO SUFFER THROUGH.  I HAVE MADE A GOOD MOUSSE DESSERT USING SUGAR FREE CHOC PUDDING AND CREAM, BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE AN ALMOST LEVEL ONE.  I PERSONALLY WOULDNT WASTE THE $ ON THIS BOOK. 
 This book is way to simplified - It doesn't have step-by-step pictures for knotting some difficult knots (3 pictures just won't do it for beginners like me) 
 I have never put down a book (actually, I have, once) I Have never left a series  unfinished I am leaving my third decade I have read this book one and a half year ago. No one goes anywhere and they go slowly. I Will probably finish the series when i get to be around seventy, so I can say that I've finished it and go in peace with myself and maybe get Mr. Jordan's hidden message, which I seriously doubt.  I am also posting this on book one, so no one goes unwarned, as the series started off pretty well.   Shame 
 As a textbook, this book is a total failure. I would avoid it at all cost 
 Ice T is a air force pilot turned evil doer for hire in this action "thriller".  Apparently on US Air Bases, they don't lock anything and easily allow their stealth jets to be taken.  Also, the guards that are supposedly looking out for people trying to break in to the base are completely surprised, when the exact thing they are supposed to be doing happens, and allow themselves to be shot.  And where exactly did a man that feined his own death get at least 5 bank accounts all in different countries?  Wouldn't it suffice just to have one Swiss bank account?  Apparently not for Ice T.  Of course in the conclusion he is ultimately spoiled by a wristwatch with no band, that can apparently counteract all the stealth features of his jet.  I would recommend this movie, but it is terrible.. 
 if you have used the online version in the past, stick with it. buying it on disk does not allow you to import data from previous returns if done on line and you can not upload to myturbotax. almost as if two separate companies! plus the User interface on this software stinks bigtime. very hard to navigate back and forth. online version is actually better (though i didn't try it this year). does intuit actually employ programmers or watch real users? they spend far too much money on useless features like videos and not enough on simple ui issues 
 I loved it the first 2 months i had it.  With out notice the cable shredded.  I called and emailed and nobody at the company got back with me.  It seem that the inside of the wheel was rough and began tearing it.  The customer service is bad and so was the product 
 Just a reminder that this guy cheated on his wife around the same time Clinton was being pounded for his indiscretions.   Sean Hannity, early in his book "Let Freedom Ring" reminded us of how Bill Clinton tainted the office of the presidency and then not two paragraphs later noted how Morris was a good friend of his (Hannity's) and then led into negative opinions on Morris of Clinton.  Didn't bother to mention anything about Morris doing the exact same thing- and this little worm woulda lied with his palm on the Ark of the Covenant so don't give me (...) about the lame@ss lying under oath Republican punk.  (...) hyprocrite!   
 I bought this book 2 years ago - almost to the day...I have the receipt stuck in the book...I can only seem to force myself to get to page 50 and then I just can't stomach anymore and I put it down for 2 more years. Maybe this is a piece of art. Something to be treasured and something that should change your life. But pleasure reading shouldn't be this painful. I wish the store would take it back - but I think I've probably had it for too long 
 This is NOT country music folks.  Taking into account the previous review who acclaims the powerful electric guitar licks and instrumentation....he's right...they are powerful.  But they don't fit into country music and what its supposed to be.  This may be a phenomenal album for those who like "pop" music but this will never measure up to "Have I Got a Deal for You" or "My Kind of Country" or even "Unlimited" from her Mercury years.  One of my least favorite Reba outings.  
 i order it on july 14th, but i still have to wait for more than a month to get it. 
 This book is required for a Finance course.  This is one of the worst college level textbooks I have ever been exposed to.  I am taking this course as a requirement for a 3rd college degree so I have bought a few textbooks.  There are answers to every other problem and not one explanation as to how the answer was derived.  Oh wait!!!, you can buy the accompanying student workbook and there are some semi-explanations there.  If this book is intended to be a teaching tool it has failed.  The authors deserve an F and should reconsider themselves as "professors" or educators.  My university will hear about this total waste of money.  Authors (of this book), educators and others: feel free to contact me and I will elaborate.  I will also offer suggestions and solutions to better present the material where this textbook fails.

 What a disgusting stupid movie. I saw this when i was just a kid. and news flash drew barrymore doesnt look like that anymore. Not trying to be rude, but what the hell is wrong with that girls chin? It grew over the years, because she looked fine in bad girls this movie, and i think boys on the side, but movies like never been kissed, and at the end of charlie's angels full throttle, all you can see when you look at her face is that huge white chin, like a jay leno chin. reminds me of the moon man from mcdonalds... with the huge chin that sticks way out. it's a cruel fact of what time does to our looks, when you get older you arent as pretty as you use to be, but i never thought chins grew bigger, in her early years her chin was of normal size now it looks huge and deformed. AS for this movie, not sexy at all, unless you find a backstabbing, murdering, lying, crazy ass teenage girl ..... sexy? Maybe men would like it, because all it has is sex scenes. only for shallow people who get excited when it comes to "that fantasy" of a much older man having sex with a teenage girl, and he's old enough to be her father. I dont find it sexy at all, it just wasn't believable in any way shape or form. A complete waste of time, money, and talent. Flat out garbage. thumbs down 
 I bought this vacuum and it was fine on carpet (though a bit noisy.)  It was awful on hardwood floors - it blew the dust everywhere.  Stay away if you plan on using it on anything besides carpet 
 A pretty good movie, it was definetly better than I expected it to be, good enough for me to submit a review about it 
 this is day 10 now and im still waiting for my package!!!!!!amazon seems great but when something goes wrong they run like chickens!   However.....LARRY BIRD IS THE MAN AND DONT EVER FORGET THAT 
 can comment on DVD - have been writing to ESPN to get a "best commercial" volume out for years - many great ESPN commercials missing - such as "Electric football" commercials and "Sports Center the cartoon" commercials - ESPN has a great opportunity to make some money on a comprehensive DVD of the commercials but fails to do so.. 
   Ok..take that back...it does have all the answers in the back of the book, that is worth one star.  I would recommend many supplements to help you learn the steps fully.  Very confusing text, nothing really explained well.  A VERY solid knowledge of calculus is required...get out and study all of Cal 1 and Cal 2 again to refresh 
 This book is unbelievably tedious and repetitious. There is very little actual content for the length of the book. It takes nearly 200 pages just to define some very basic terms from graph theory. This might have been fine if the space were taken up by some sort of meaningful discussion on the relevance of these graph theory concepts to sociological studies and theory. The book (possibly the field?) has the flavor of "here's a hammer, now what can we hit with it?".  Would have liked to see a format based on justification of the analytic techniques from sociological principles, or something much much more concise. Nothing much to see here, move on 
 This book fails in teaching calculus. It is simply a guide of problems without answers. Worthless for anyone looking to be learn calculus. It assumes a student has a good teacher who will explain everything. Very few classroom instructors spend enough time with students to make up for the deficiencies of this book.... 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 24-Hour Party People is a mocumentary at the lowest rung (if Best In Show was not enough) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste. The British scene in the 1980's was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave, and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way.   My main issue with this film was it's attempts at being funny in a hip-Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious. The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway, and the film never really follows it's premise as much as it should: the rise of Factory. I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments, though, even if exploiting Ian Curtis's death was slightly in poor taste.   Unless you're a fan of the Brit explosion of the post-punk era, and an extreme fan at that, I could not recommend this film. It's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into. 
 I was so excited about this product.  I love simple appliances and this one fit the bill.  However the filters were impossible to find and the whole thing stopped working after a month of use!  Don't buy this product.  Spend the extra money and get a better humidifier 
 Birch once again gives us more information about herself than is needed.  Check out Donna Farhi's "Yoga: Mind, Body and Spirit" for a more thorough examination of the subject matter without all of the self-important jibber-jabber 
 Now I like Neruda. I think he is an important poet, and I fully expected to love this collection. But as I read it I found that I didn't really like any of the poems. There were a few that were almost passable, but only a couple. I don't know if it was Merwin's translation, Neruda's writing, or just me not connecting with the poetry. I say read Neruda, just not this collection 
 I really wanted to like this book. I bought it to read with my 9-year old because she and I are so interested in Pirate stories. I am also a fan of Dave Barry and so thought this would be fun for both her and I.   However, like many parents, I decided to read some of it alone to make sure that it was appropriate for her age and her sensibility. My husband and I are not prudish by any means. But we do feel a need to preserve childhood for our kids as much as possible and shelter them from that which they do not know or need to know at such young ages.   And I am so glad that I read a few chapters before sharing this book with her as it is HIGHLY inappropriate.   For example, there is a Captain Slank in this book that at one point is flirting with a governess named Mrs. Bumbrake. It is innocent enough at first. He meerly gets excited at seeing a flash of her naked ankle. But later Peter (Pan) hears the two engaged in the following:     "Oh, Mr. Slank!" she was saying. "You are the devil!" "That I am, Mrs. Bumbrake!" boomed Slank. "And you know what they say!" "WHat do they say, Mr.Slank?" "They say," roared Slank, "the devil take the hindmost!" Then Peter heard Mrs. Bumbrake emit a very un-governess-like squeal, followed by what sounded like a slap, followed by some thumping, then more squealing, then more thumping, and then much laughing. From the sound of it, Peter figured they wouldn't be breaking up the party any time soon.  OH MY! I don't think they were playing checkers! And I am certainly not going to put myself in a position of having to explain this to a 9-year old ...(which is the suggested audience age for this book, by the way)... nor do I think it is appropriate or necessary for a book like this. It is published by Disney for crying out loud!  So, for parents who are pro-active in securing a nurturing, peaceful, unsexualized childhood for your kids, stay clear of this book. It was only on page 55 that I found this inappropriate scene. I imagine there are more 
 Sounds exciting, but actually, well, boring, mostly because the author  fails to distinguish between two very different claims:  first, that  boredom, the state of mind, didn't exist until recently, and second, that  it wasn't talked about much until recently.  The first claim would be  exciting and bizarre, but the argument at most supports the second 
 I bought this book to use in a class, but I only read four pages before giving up because it was just too much to read. Get a magnifying glass people. This book is written in fine print. You'd think they would publish it in a font that would comfortable to read. For that reason alone I returned it in favor of another 
 This book could have been written in 1/4 the number of pages. The author repeats his information countless times. He has some good things to say, but saying them so many times is senseless. The layout is also counterproductive. Many times throughout the book the author refers to the Liver Detox Diet, but doesn't give that diet until toward the end of the book. Summary of the book: Take a week or so and eat/drink nothing but juiced or pureed fruits and vegetables (organic preferred) 
 I came across a pile of these books remaindered for 10 cents and figured - "Well, you can't go wrong for a dime, Right?" -  WRONG!!  What a load of rubbish this book is.  Pomposity and egotism on every page.  Libeskind's love affair with himself is not worth the paper it is written on ... not even at 10 cents a copy!  This one goes straight into the recycle bin 
 I've been using a Win 98 version of this software for years and the opportunity to upgrade to the XP version was tempting. However, it does not work at all in my portuguese XP. After searching for the misterious error code through the manufacturer's database I was informed that it does not work in non-english Win XP. All the previous versions worked fine in my PCs but this one was totally disappointing. Living in Brazil, I had to give up my money since the shipping costs were about the same value I would recover. Shame on them 
 I did not get the crossover tube in the box like the picture shows. I had do modify one of the tubes so it would work with my old crossover. Go to weber in the future to get what you need , its worth the extra money 
 The event that destroyed the DC Universe. See the Flash and Supergirl die for no real reason other than cheap shock value, only to be reintroduced a few years later in "hip" new versions! See the Hawk lose his partner and brother, the Dove, also for no apparent reason other than because they had to kill a beloved character in that issue, but nobody too famous that people might complain about since they were already going to get flack over Flash and Supergirl! See meaningless changes to "continuity" in fantasy stories! See DC denying its past in hopes of appealing to young people, and failing at both 
 Unfortunately, I was forced to read this book by my photography professor. Every word, every page, was sheer hell to struggle through. Trying to follow Barthe's chaotic train of thought is next to impossible. This book is full of navel-gazing gibberish that can only loosely be described as "English". He admits to not being a photographer, and goes on to claim photography itself doesn't exist. How then, did he write a whole monstrous book on photography? And moreover, why am I being subjected to it?  My heart is warmed somewhat when I read of Mr. Barthe's history. He spent a lifetime suffering from tuberculosis, and ended it splattered across the front of a van. Good. The bastard deserved it for what he's inflicted on hapless undergrads around the world. 
 Diamond Dogs was Bowie's first misstep since becoming famous, but his aura was so powerful that most people hadn't noticed. As far as the media was concerned, the photo of Bowie as a post-apocalyptic half man/half dog mutant provided more than enough fodder for their copy. The album's hit single "Rebel Rebel" helped to disguise the paucity of continuity on this album, but the fact remains that Diamond Dogs catches Bowie at a fairly uncertain moment in his career. Fed up with Ziggy Stardust, but unable to entirely throw that persona off, Bowie dabbles in various modifications of his image with this album. Unfortunately, none are anywhere near as convincing as his previous incarnations. The main reason this happens is simply because the material is lacking. Bowie was certainly an artist who was capable of pushing his image before his material, but he was always imaginative as a songwriter, too, so the material always seemed to come from some rarefied place.  Diamond Dogs is too schizophrenic, so the album suffers. Since Bowie expends a great deal of energy trying to develop a theme that never gels, two straight-ahead rock and roll numbers ("Diamond Dogs" and "Rebel Rebel") have the burden of carrying the entire album. They aren't enough. The "Sweet Thing/ Candidate" medley is the only other musical offering on side one; It takes him minutes, but takes us nowhere. The same goes for side two's "Big Brother" segment. "Rock and Roll with Me" is as close as Bowie has ever come to writing generic material, and "We Are the Dead" is lifeless, which leaves "1984" to carry the entire second half of the album. Even this is greatly disappointing, though, especially since it was drastically edited from the ten-minute centerpiece that it had become in recent live (and televised) performances. Why spend so much time and energy introducing your audience to something if you aren't going to utilize it on your album? It is questions like these that remain unanswered, and it is reasons like this that make Diamond Dogs seem so inconsistent, schizophrenic, and confused.     B	Tom Rya 
 Unbearably pretentious.  In a failed attempt by the author to appear intellectual, the book is poorly written and at time incoherent 
 This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever 
 I bought this book because I had read a good review of the follow-up "Murder of Angels" and thought this would be a better starting point.  I am a voracious reader, and I can honestly say I rarely use the word "hate" when describing a book.  I won't use it this time either, but I will say that I can never get back the time I spent (wasted?) reading this book.  To be fair, maybe it just wasn't for me.  If you are really into super-confusing, creepy books with self-pitying, annoying, wear-it-on-their sleeve outcast characters-- this might be just the tale for you 
 The self-improvement books How to Win Friends and Influence People and Talking the Winner's Way are both way superior to this short book. Most of what you read is basically review if you've ready other similar books. And what's present doesn't pack enough substance or "how to" to make it really worth your time. About half-way through the book, Gabor started presenting fresh ideas. The problem, however, is that it was half-way through the book. Not a bad read, but there's so much better. If you happen across it one day on the street, it won't do any harm to read it. But I can't recommend paying money for something you already know, or can get for a better deal 
 bestseller -Stupid plot -horrible plot -dumb characters  I have one conculsion Matthew reilly was trying to buy up all the copies of this book to save himself from embrassmen 
 I thought this glass would be of better quality than it is. It took 3 shipments (re cieved and returned) to get my complete order without any breakage. These glasses are too fragile and in practice, impractical. Because of the design, one must live with fingerprints all over the body of the glass. Not too appealing when you are observing the "legs" of your wine. Recommend that you pass these by 
 I purchased this rail today for my daughter's crib that "converts" into a toddler bed.  Everything on the outside of the box looked great, until we got home, put it together and put it on the crib.  There is only about 6 inches of space for my daughter to climb in and out of bed.  Also it sits in about 3 inches which significantly reduces the amount of sleep space.  After playing with it for awhile, I decided to look over the instructions again.  It states in the warning section that this rail is only for a bed with a box spring and mattress and is not intended for a crib or toddler bed.  My question is "WHY DIDN'T IT SAY THIS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX?!"  
 I was not really impressed with this CD.  The previous 2 CDs(Mission to Please, Eternal) were so much better.  R Kelly is a great producer, but did not write the best songs for the Isleys for this.  2 Bad !!! :(  Isleys were better off with Jam and Lewis from the Eternal CD.  Listen and Buy at your own risk 
 The book was okay, but I really loved the movie.  There are major differences in the book that completely change the tone.  First of all, she's British and more closely resembles Bridget Jones than her movie counterpart.  You see a lot more of her friends in the novel.    Also, she seems thoroghly preoccupied with her weight.  She is not described to look anything like Debra Messing, but rather an overweight "squishy" girl, which is completely fine, but it is not fun to read abotu her obsessing about her weight while downing a box of chocolate cigarettes.  The writer is British, I believe, so it has more of the British slang, which at first is a little confusing.  It's not Thackeray, mind you, but don't expect any American tones.  Their relationship is more drawn out, which is fun to read.    Still, what I remember most was how we envision all the characters (Domonic included) as a little chunky.  They aren't size 0 models, we get it! Now get over it 
 As I said, a huge disappointment.  I really enjoyed the Duets CDs from Sinatra, and, being a Tony Bennett fan, I had high expectations for this cd.  Don't bother with it - it is a real loser in my opinion.  Dull, boring, just plain bad.   Sorry Tony - but this one is a stinker 
 I normally like her books, but this one was not only hard to read, but mildly offensive.  I have always enjoyed her books because they show women as strong, capably people- this one does not.  And while rape may be appropriate in pirate literature and historically correct, I choose not to read stuff that glorifies it.   In short, even if you normally enjoy her works, leave this one on the shelf 
 ...than finish this book.  I gave up half-way through. Great premise, lousy execution 
 I find it disturbing that John Updike can apparently find no female artist worthy of mention in his book...beyond one artist who is practically unknown. And she is included only because his family owned a piece of artwork created by her. Updike seems very dismissive of even this one female contributor.  He does find room in his book to include a nude photo of the great artist Georgia O'Keefe, but no actual artwork created by O'Keeffe. That should give you a clue what the rest of the book is like.   Disturbing, too, are Updike's dismissive comments about Edward Hopper; he claims that Edward Hopper can't paint faces very well.    So even though I purchased this book, I don't recommend it to others. Give this one a pass. 
  More bad acting and false passion than any human can stand. If you can empathise with any of these characters see a doctor 
 My 3-year-old son liked Floam because of the goop factor, but unfortunately the goop the little foam pellets are suspended in seems to be a GREAT medium for growing MOLD.  This happened to us twice (despite clean hands/work space) so we gave up on it entirely.    I suggest you try PlayFoam instead.  It's also available here on Amazon, or at Lakeshore Learning Store (look for samples at the checkout for 49 cents!) Playfoam has a nicer consistency, less sticky (but still moldable) and no odor 
 I base this review on the first few pages of this book that persuaded me to stop reading it. The author is vague and confused. Two choices: Naturalism versus Historicism. author says that historicism cannot be accurate because "pre-modern" societies also display "artistic" tendencies. Tripping all over himself: the historiciss are seem to be saying that the very notion of art is historical, so why is Schusterman extending it into pre-history? I haven't read much philosophy and this lack of precision makes me want to keep my distance 
  Irving Wallace has a smooth, easy-to-read, absorbing writing style--he's a natural, born writer. But in writing this novel he has wasted his talents and craftsmanship to an extreme degree. At about page 400 I tossed the book into the trash can--it was so bad that I couldn't endure a moment more of it. Here are some of the reasons:   1.   Gratuitous graphic sexual descriptions. It is cheap porn, and is totally unnecessary.   2.   Gratuitous violence that, given Sharon's character, she would never have induced, as the author has her induce it. She was much too smart for that, but to create false conflict and an explosive situation, the author forces this.  3.   Extremely overwritten--by about 250 pages--with boring, tedious, meandering discussions and conversations that should have been succinctly summarized because they lacked dramatic appeal, impact, and stimulation.   4.   Characters that keep acting inconsistantly with the way they were originally conceived and established by the author. This was done, of course, to move the plot forward. Therefore, the actions of the characters are often unbeliebable, forced, contrived, and ridiculous.   For example, Brunner telling Sharon his name was absurd--he was one of her kidnappers! In fact, early on, he enumerated the consequences that can arise from kidnapping. So would he EVER tell her his name, since later on he could be found, arrested, charged, tried, and convicted? This belies his character.  And Shiv leaving his jeans in the bathroom where Sharon could find and search his wallet--and discover his name--this guy was way too foxy and cagy for doing this. In fact, he never would have gone into the bedroom with his wallet with him--he'd have left it in the other room with his fellow-kidnappers, so as not to take any chances. And would he even leave his jeans in the bathroom? Way too risky! But it moves the plot forward for the author so he has Shiv do it.   There are so many unbelievables like this in the novel that made me almost retch.  This novel was not carefully thought out by the author--it appears to have been quickly knocked off for a quick buck--otherwise it would not have the countless plot holes in it that it does.   Don't buy this book unless you like to leave your brains someplace else when you read a novel. It is an insult to anyone who values true, logical cause-effect human interaction. The book just wallows in cheap, base, tawdry, below-the-belt sensationalism and inconsistancy.   
 As far as I am concerned, '8 Minutes in the Morning to a Flat Belly' was a total waste of my money.  I've been following this workout and eating plan for over four months now and have seen no reduction in neither my belly size nor my weight.  Frankly, I was seeing more results from my old Denise Austin Low Impact Aerobic Workout tape than this, so it looks like I'm saying goodbye to Jorge and going back to Denise.  Sorry Jorge, I gave it my best shot but your plan just doesn't work for me 
 To give it credit, this CD set is beautifully produced, and reminds me many times of Windham Hill recordings. It is dominated by slow tempo acoustic arrangements, usually piano. Kate's voice is of course gorgeous, and the lyrics are often excellent.  However, all of that can be intellectually appreciated, but it's different than enjoying it. If you are looking for any of the adventure, creativity, or risk-taking that characterizes so much of her other work you will be disappointed. Maybe two songs on the entire two-CD set have any true life to them. Only one really has any of the vocal fun that made so much of her earlier work exciting. Also, other than the many straightforward piano arrangements, most of the remaining songs seem to re-use pieces of sounds or rythms from previous work.    I own all her other work and I hate to say it but this CD set is disappointing and I don't suspect I'll replay it often if at all. For the most part, your ear and mind quickly forget this CD as soon as you've heard it 
 Dr Axelrods Atlas has reached the 10th edition, published late 2004. Supposedly it has been greatly revised and enriched. Why can we only see the 9th with a publication date of oct 2004 This is definetly a mistake 
 It was impossible for me to get into this book. I ended up checking a book out at my local library to write a book review. 
 The book reads more like a dry legal document than a helpful consumer friendly book written with checklists and perhaps a simulated negotiation indicating what to start out looking at first, must have's vs nice to have's in a lease (based on realistic market conditions), etc. The book is more appropriate for real estate agents than a small business owner about to sign a lease. Maybe its a 5 for a commercial real estate agent but a 2 for a prospective tenant   
 Since this is one of my top four all-time favorite films and I love films passionately, I am ABSOLUTELY beside myself in fury and anger at the HORRIBLE packaging on this magnificent film. I could forgive the lack of extras. I know A LOT of people working for these international movie conglomerates don't give a damn about the Classics (or even movies in general, really). But the lack of thought that went into the packaging of this truly great, PERFECT, scene-by-scene-, shot-by-shot, movie is STAGGERING. Not only do they include a throwaway line of dialog in the middle of the images, not only do they clutter it up with a bunch of extras from a scene in the boxing ring... they picture the villianess, not the heroine, with the hero ! Where is the original poster art !!!!! THe insert art !!! The half sheet art !!! The reissue art !!! There . isnt . even . a . booklet . . or . flyer . inside . NOTHING ! This looks like a release that belongs in the cheapie bin with the public domain stuff . Columbia Pictures.. I am shouting . At . YOU  
 Chargers work great and are a great bargain.  However, the generic "LG" driver software that comes with the USB cable to transfer music from computer to phone doesn't have an authenticity signature.  I don't know about other computers, but mine with Windows XP (SP2) won't accept it 
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 Let me say right up front I did not read this book. However, I heard a talk the author gave in 2000, in which she made the following "predictions".  1. The euro would fail as a currency. 2. Great Britain would not enter the EU.  Additionally, to paraphrase, she said that no one in their right mind would trade FOREX; you should trade futures instead. Finally, she showed overhead projections of various technical indicators, some of which she couldn't explain. Huh???  I was all set to buy this book until I heard her talk. For all I know, the book may be excellent, but based on her presentation, I'm not as enthusiastic about spending the 40 bucks.  Just my opinion, and you know what they say about those.. 
 I don't understand what happened in this book. There was hardly any plot line. The characters did not develop well enough either. I wish I could have given this zero stars 
 I don't know if we got some old box left over, or what. Magnets are so weak, that kids can't make anything vertical. They just collapse, and slide. If I knew of course I wouldn't have purchased. I got rid of the box, so I couldn't even return it. OVER PRICED BIG TIME!! 
 I was intrigued by "The Replaement Killers." After seeing "The Professional" I became interested in the premise of a hit man with a heart. That the movie chose not to take this route was the first of many disappointments. It turns out that the hit man isn't really a professional at all. Instead he is killing in order to save his family. The first two killings went flawlessly, but when he is assigned to kill a child rather than criminals he can not bring himself to do it. That too is an interesting premise, albeit a much more familiar one, and it raises a separate set of questions: Why did he get involved with the crime-boss? If he has only killed two people how did his skill become so remarkable?      However, I must admit that I rented this because I felt a little blood-thirsty tonight and by the end it was definately quenched. It's just a shame that it didn't answer some very important questions. It did EARN its one star, I was moderately entertained but I felt two stars was too generous 
 The design is such that when you pour out liquid, some of it seeps into the space between the outer plastic and the vacuum glass container. Then, when one sets the carafe on a counter, the liquid leaks out. This could be a problem with a particular unit or a marginal design 
 I wish I could have read the reviews here before buying this book. I bought it while at the airport because the description on the back sounded interesting. It isn't the page turner that it could have been.   The beginning is great and the gets you hooked, but it's pretty much what's on the back cover that got you to buy the book. Even from the beginning, Edward's prose is annoying, she describes things for no reason and it feels like she's wasting our time, trying to draw out the storyline.   Once the main event is over, the plot goes nowhere and it's incredibly boring. I started flipping past paragraphs of irrelevant descriptions.   I didn't think the ending was surprising at all. You know it's going to happen, you're wondering why Edwards takes so long to get to it. I did think it was touching and, fine, I admit it, it made me cry... but in my defense, I cry at everything (even that depression commercial chokes me up - Where does depression hurt? Everywhere. Who does depression hurt? Everyone.)    All in all, this book seemed interesting, but I wish I had chosen another (better written) book to read. 
 The opening strip scene is reminiscent of Barbarella - too bad those aren't Basinger's legs though. Nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by Kim Basinger. I have never understood Ackroyd's characters. And keeping in form, he is once again as unfunny as mud. Basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film, but that's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film. OK so she munches on batteries, and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime. She seems a genuine Betty Crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts. Jon Lovitch also tries to prop up Ackroyd and this weak script. However, his contribution seems way overstated to me. He doesn't have much to do. Funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people. Basinger's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do. Think, Jar-Jar Blinks. I suppose it's OK as a backdrop for housecleaning. But that's it. Flat and mechanical 
 I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual "pap" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character.   Although the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie.  This movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like ''The Three Amigo's''; on paper you would think it couldn't miss, but on film it's painful to watch 
 I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD.  We were barely able to make it through one listening.  This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music.  The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling.  It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating.  I want my money back 
 I clearly do not share the enthusiasm of some of the reviewers here, who will all have to forgive me for thinking that Susan Cooper's "The Dark Is Rising" is plain awful. This book was recommended to Harry Potter fans who have run out of HP books to read. I must say it was a waste of my time to read "Dark."  Never have I read a book in which no physical description is given for the hero. In this case, we are told that on his 11th birthday, an English boy named Will Stanton discovers he is the last of "The Old Ones." Unlike JK Rowling who, in the first pages of Harry Potter & the Philosopher's (or Sorcerer's) Stone, provides the reader with a vivid description of Harry as skinny, with an unruly mop of black hair, startlingly green eyes, and, of course, a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, Cooper does not describe Will Stanton at all. The result is that the reader, after having read 244 pages, still cannot visualize what Will looks like!!  I also find quite annoying Cooper's approach to this good vs. evil tale. She is vague and abstract till the end as to who exactly are The Old Ones, and who or what exactly is The Dark. As for The Dark being evil, all the reader succeeds in gleaning is that The Dark means cold, snow, and--of course--darkness. Excuse me: but is this the best Cooper can do?  Is this what this book is about?--the Druid pagan worldview of light vs. dark, summer vs. winter, warmth vs. cold? What happened to the conception of evil as MORAL evil? 
 Crescent reminds me of how great a period of supreme artistry that Coltrane sustained during the last few years of his life.  I feel a need to inform all fellow lovers of this period of a little known album,currently out of print, called "Infinity" that truely ranks with his best. It was rescued from the vaults back in 1972 by Alice Coltrane who added a string arrangement which truely lends a mysterious quality and produces probably the most unique Coltrane recording of all time.  I first heard this album as a teenager and its mystic tones were a religious experence for me. There is something about the music that speaks of a man who knows he is near physical death and is searching for a path to eternal life.  Please note that I accidently gave "Cresent" a one star rating - I meant to give it five stars.  
 I don't even use it anymore, didn't think it was that great.  I got a gel rest from fellows, a lot better... 
 The materials appear to be of a good quality, not that I'd know.  The software that comes with it to print hasn't been updated in years, and its the original release.  Sure enough, after spending days trying to get it to work at all it was clear the entire purchase was a waste of money.  I checked the company's website about the software, and they have no updates in three years, no way of getting support.    I expect programs to have bugs; that's normal.  The problem is this company apparently has no intention of either taking customer support requests and hasn't released even a bug patch in years, so the chances of it working on a modern computer with a modern printer is increasingly slim 
 I have no idea where the Velvet Underground comparisons come from in relation to Luna.  The singer resembles Lou Reed only in the sense that he occasionally (actually, more than occasionally) sings off-key, but he sounds an awful lot more like an upper west-side latte wimp, than Lou Reed's late 60s, early 70s Alphabet City junkie.  The music is tuneless (actually, Tiger Lilly is mildly catchy, but that's about it) and has none of the noise or melodic stylings of VU.  In short, they sound like a very watered down Galaxy 500.  There's so much worthwhile music out there--I'm really sorry I wasted my money on this bland, boring, arthritic stuff 
 This movie is typical Hollywood anti-war, anti-military, anti-American trash.  The "show biz" liberals, aided and abetted by their ideological cousins, the left-wing TV news moguls, have always sought to portray American soldiers in Viet Nam as baby-killing, drug-crazed monsters.  This movie is typical of that ilk. If you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war, buy the DVD of "We Were Soldiers."--a much better, and far more honest, film 
 I like Metallica first of all. But this was their worst release along with Kill Em All. All the songs on this album are really horrendous. Metallica only made about a few good albums, want to get one???? Get Master of Puppets, Black, and Ride The Lightning. They all have about 3-7 good songs. This album is a waste!!!! Get those albums insted 
 Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible 
 Bloody Mary is a very poor sequel to Whiskey Sour. It is the same book, basically. Once again, a powerful sociopath has a personal vendetta against Jack. I hope the author has something new to offer in the upcoming third book in the series...Unbelieveably, according to the reviews of Rusty Nail, the 3rd book, he recycled the story again. Forget it 
 I am a big Popper fan, but this book is out-of-date, although it contains valuable information.  Popper's arguments for indeterminism are based on the body-mind distinction: 'physicalism (or the philosophy of the identity of mind and body) is absurd.' G. Edelman explains clearly in his brilliant book 'Bright Air, Brilliant Fire' that mind is a matter of matter. Consciousness is an emerging characteristic of life after a long evolution. Popper's system of 3 Worlds is also flawed (World 1: physical world - brain physiology; World 2: subjective thought - human consciousness; World 3: objective thought - theories), because World 1 and 2 are the same.  His arguments against philosophical and scientific determinism are powerful, but scientifically speaking Laplace's demon is a joke. As Steven Hawking explains in John Boslough's 'Steven Hawking's Universe': 'Even if we do achieve a complete unified theory, we shall not be able to make detailed predictions in any but the simplest situations.' Predictions will be limited to the extreme and determinism will be non-existant in brain physiology (Mozart's G minor symphony could not have been predicted). Indeterminism will be all the more true in the social sciences (historicism). Indeterminism is a cardinal characteristic of matter: all singular events in this world are unique, free.  It is very strange that some of the brightest scientific minds (Einstein, Schroedinger) were staunch defenders of determinism (see Popper's discussions with Einstein on p. 90-92). The fact that Einstein changed his mind at the end of his life is not confirmed in M. Jammer's book 'Einstein and Religion'.  On the other hand, Popper's remark on the arrow of time is to-the-point: 'As to the arrow of time, it is in my opinion a mistake to make the second law of thermodynamics responsible for its direction. Even a non-thermodynamic process, such as the propagation of a wave from a centre, is in fact irreversible.'  Very important is note 3 on p. 43. J. von Neumann, H.H. Goldstine: 'a mathematical formulation necessarily represents only a (more or less explicit) theory of some phase (or aspect) of reality, not reality itself.'  I recommend this book only for Popper fans 
 How can a book about gender struggle written by two esteemed feminist intellectuals miss the boat entirely in examining such an important issue? Doctors Cole and Sheftall waste numerous pages explaining and analyzing the actions of black males within the dynamic of male/female relationships. How about analyzing the actions of women and shedding insight into their psyche? The book is written in an almost apologetic tone to explain male mis-steps. Even worse, it coddles black men, panders to them and persistently excuses their damaging behaviors by blaming their actions on the ever present perpetual myths of racist economics and the legacy of slavery. Historical quotes and antiquated interviews are plentiful especially by Black scholars Cornell West and literary master Essex Hemphill. They even give rapper turned actor Ice T a chance to explain away macho male behavior in an interesting yet un-enlightening chapter on the degradation of women in the lyrics of much HipHop music. But they fail over and over again to tap into real women and real problems that women face and the role that women's lack of self esteem and identity plays in the disintegration of relationships. Although a few notable women were quoted, specifically Audre Lorde and Essence's Susan Taylor, their contributions were not impactful because they were not given nearly as many pages. While I am glad that the sisters brought the subject to the forefront, I am dismayed that (as usual) so much time is spent on understanding why men cheat, beat and are in jail only to come up with the same lame conclusion - slavery, racism and poverty - while totally ignoring the women who "hold up half the sky". Very, very disappointing 
 Woodrow is a historicists he believed at the time of writing this book that all the prophecies in the Bible both Old and New testament have been fulfilled except the second coming of Christ. I don't buy the Historicists position at all. They do not take the prophecies literally, they have to bend and twist the scriptures to fit there beliefs and they state categorically that the anti Christ is the office of the papacy. Something He refutes in a later work of his. I don't buy the anti Christ as being an office of anything, but an actual individual who will be tossed into Hell before the Millennium starts. You cannot toss an office into hell its a person. Also He did not take into account the false prophet of Israel (a reconstituted Israel) and blends him with Anti Christ. No historicists take the prophecy's of a reconstituted Israel literally, but try to say the Church is Physical Israel (we were graphed in as spiritual Israel but we are not Physical Israel) and Yet hear Israel is, reformed in 1948, Jerusalem reestablished under Jewish control in 1967. We see The EU Lining up to be the last reformed Roman empire based on democracy as the scriptures predicted. We see the Russia bear with all her arms arming all the Muslim nations as the scriptures predicted. We see China with a HUGE military as the Scriptures predicted and we see Israel surrounded by her enemies and being a stumbling stone to the whole world as the scriptures predicted. To ignore the prophecy's of a reconstituted Israel is to ignore Moses' Prophesy, Ezekiel's and Daniel's as well as all the major and minor prophets of the Old testament and of the Lord Jesus Himself. There were 300 prophecies of the Christ first coming and 500 of the second, there is just to much to ignore and we must take them literally. If this does not convince you read Matthew 24 and hear Christ's words. Also read all the prophecy's in the Old testament with the DAY OF The LORD mentioned and tell me when a war like that ever happened. Read the Book of revelation in the new testament and you will see that the Historicists position does not hold up. One thing historicists never seem to understand is that there are multiple fulfillment's of prophecy's and also partial fulfillment's. Jesus said this himself about John being a type of Elijah, he said Elijah was still to come (after John) but to those that can accept it John was an Elijah (so a multiple fufillment). If we take the scripture literally on salvation through grace by faith, then we must take the prophecy's of the second coming just as literally 
 If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way ENTIRE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO 
 For those wishing guidelines and inspiration for a new direction in life, there are a number of better titles.  The advice here is mostly recycled from other sources.  The author uses the metaphor of "re-packing your  bags" for discarding whatever's worn out or excessive or redundant in  your life to facilitate moving on.  The material is fairly low-key and  soft-focus, not that useful.  The book design and production was done on  the cheap too, it seems 
 I've researched this duo as well, extensively, from a scientific viewpoint, as one who works in a scientific field. The relationship between these two investigators is unique and well worth studying independently, away from the 'whodunnit' scenarios that this book creates.   The duo of Brahe/Kepler is an 'odd-couple'. For a few examples, of which there are countless dozens: Brahe was a showboat, he loved to party, cleanliness was his forte, kept up on his scientific discipline, whereas Kepler hated to bathe, seemed overly introverted, and was prone to reach out to spiritual/astrological notions about atronomical events.   The person most likely to kill Brahe was his devoted wife, whom he virtually ignored. She was the one who administered his medicine on his deathbed. Tycho suffered for days, the pain never went away. And so it was his wife who euthanised him.  The author Joshua Gilder ignored the family's role in Tycho's death, as Tycho ignored his family during his life. With many children, all to maintain the observatory, we hear of not one child who was interested in the data he collected, or even suspicious of malfeasance. It's too bad, because in ignoring the role of Tycho Brahe's family, Gilder poorly scandalised a great scientific contributor, Johannes Kepler.   If you are interested in this topic, please conduct your own research, it will be worth it. Because the book is awful 
 Paul Tibbet should have been tried as a war criminal. I don't see anything to celebrate about on this 60th anniversary of the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   Perhaps the Japanese are rethinking about these events today and can write their own versions of what they think of these two genicides. Whether it saved lives or not is speculation, just that speculation.  We all know how speculation is viewed in a court of law 
 The movie starts off very slowly, with childhood episodes from Ashton Kutcher's character.  It's at least 1/2 an hour before we see the adult Kutcher, although he does appear at the very beginning for a brief scene.  The premise is good, and it has some good momentum in the middle, which is why I gave it two stars.  The shifting situations of his life and the lives of his friends are interesting and well done, but the overall story line is very weak, and the ending is dreadful and not supported by most of the rest of the story.  Also, the movie has too many tongue-in-cheek references to Kutcher's real life circumstances -- such as the reference to "tighty-whities."  They distract from the story, and make the movie more of a vanity vehicle -- which is too bad -- If you are not a Kutcher convert and are just looking for a movie, skip this one 
   God, this movie was....lame. I mean, it was lame. It limped; it struggled, it staggered.   I lost track of the cliches during the first five minutes.  The really graphic sex scene that indicated the girl was gonna get killed? Check. The sleazeball guy getting killed? Check. The sleazeball guy practically begging for death? "Here, doggie..."?  That's eighty minutes of my life I'll never get back.  
 I watched this movie and I have no idea what it was about. Admittedly it had the usual post-modern, post-Matrix action movie tropes, improbably gorgeous protagonists dressed in tight clothing doing impossible things (I'm a big fan of Charlize Theron in a sheer body suit), lots of explosions, a vast, behind the scenes conspiracy (well, that's kind of redundant, most conspiracies are 'behind the scenes) run by evil bad guys and futuristic storm troopers who are so bad with their firearms that they make the Imperial Storm Troopers in Star Wars look like Marine snipers, but other than that what was this movie about? It's as if the producers decided to take a bunch of these tropes, throw them up against the wall, see what stuck and how they splattered and then make a movie from the messy results. What comes out is incoherent and impossible to understand. "Aeon Flux" is "Plan 9 From Outer Space" with better looking actors and a huge production budget. Well no, it's not even that, say what you will about Ed Wood, he at least liked the movies he made and threw himself into them, but it's doubtful that anyone involved in "Aeon Flux" viewed this incoherent mess as anything other than a paycheck, and it shows. Save your money, in a few years this will be on Showtime late at night as a replacement for "Beastmaster III" and if you're up late you can watch it then 
 I have read the government issued publication and this commerical version and I do not see why anyone would buy this version. Download the real copy and save your money. The team that wrote the book did an awesome job. The real free version is a must for any serious student of CB warfare. 
 In 1990 Bill Bryson set out to "do Europe". He says that his motivation was to relive his experiences from tours in Europe in 1972 and 1973 when he was a young student wandering around Europe with a backpack.  In reality it seems as if the primary reason for Bill Bryson to do this trip was so that he could then write a funny book about the trip.  "Neither Here Nor There" is, in fact, a very funny book, at least in the beginning. Bill Bryson can describe situations in a very humorous way, and he's willing to make fun of himself, as well as everything around him.  Unfortunately, after a while the humor wears thin. Then it wears very thin. Then you begin to dissect the humor, and realize that you've been had.  Bill Bryson's method of traveling is to emulate the kind of tourism we all like to ridicule. He typically arrives by train in a new city in the evening. He has no hotel reservation so he has to spend time finding a hotel that is not really what he wanted. He sees "the sights" that one is supposed to see in that city. He makes no effort to get in touch with the local people, to learn about their lives, or to understand their country and society. He spends typically 2-3 days in each city and then goes to work on figuring out how to get to the next city or country on his list, which often leads to further complications.  This is obviously not the way to travel if you're writing a travel book. Nobody in their right mind would want to read about this kind of traveling.   But Bill Bryson is not writing a travel book, he's writing a funny book, and he has a sure-fire recipe:  1. Do things in problematic ways, and then make fun of all the trials and tribulations that result.  2. Mix in lots of flashbacks to the trips of your youth, with much juvenile humor related to the drives that young men are so driven by.  3. Feign incomprehension about everything foreign and satirize everything that is unfamiliar.  4. Make funny remarks intended to reinforce national prejudices.  This last type of humor can be especially tiring. Here are a few examples to illustrate what I mean:  "Let's face it, the French Army couldn't beat a girls' hockey team." (pg 32)  "The (German) women still don't shave their armpits. ... They all look so beautiful and stylish, and then they lift up their arms and there's a Brillo pad hanging there." (pg 91)  "In Norway, three people and a bottle of beer is a party; in Sweden the national sport is suicide." (pg 97)  "But the most preposterous law of all, a law so pointless as to scamper along the outer reaches of the surreal, is the Swedish one that requires motorists to drive with their headlights on during the daytime." (pg 110)  "I love the way the Italians park. You turn any street corner in Rome and it looks as if you've just missed a parking competition for blind people." (pg 123)  In conclusion, if you're someone who "did Europe" in your youth and you want to relive fond memories in a humorous way, then you may well like this book. Most other readers will probably start out laughing, then smiling, then wondering why the jokes seem to have lost their appeal, and finally ending up wishing they'd picked a real travel book or a real humorous book.

 I bought this USB cable for Cingular my LG CU500 but doesn't work with it. Strongly I don't recommend this others. 
 While I did appreciate the author's honesty and self-explorative approach to this book, I agree with the previous reviewer that this book went on way too long.  The author actually presents the same anecdotes in different  chapters and struggles with the same questions again and agin throughout  the text, with little movement forward.  Funny that the last section is  entitled "Time to Move On." because she doesn't seem to do that  very well. Unlike the previous reviewer, I don't recall anything in the  book that indicated that the author's weight is contributing to health  problems; in fact, my recollection is that she was able to ameliorate a  number of health problems through healthy eating and exercise without any  weight loss.  My sense was that she was attempting to demonstrate that we  talk about weight loss as a health necessity, when it is more often a  culturally mandated appearance issue.  My favorite line in the whole book  was a quote from columnist Ellen Goodman: "Show me a woman who only  wants to be thin for her health and I'll show you a man who buys Playboy  just to read the interview.&quot 
 Since you are inviting me to submit a review of the book that you have not yet shipped to me, I hope this note will help you to revise -- and improve -- your business procedures.  My rating, therefore, applies to the latter, not the book itself; I would've let the rating field empty had the system let me do so. Yours, BG 
 As a beef eating Hindu I am very much interested in finding how cows became holy for Hindus and beef a forbidden thing to eat. I browsed through this book in a book store and found it to be very disappointing.  First, it appeared to be intended more for creating controversy than for informational purposes. It clearly had a bias which turned me off.  Second, I am generally up-to date on current issues and remembered that it did not generate all that controversy as mentioned on the cover of the book. There were some rumblings but nothing of the sort described on the covers ("the government of India demands be ritually burned").  Later I searched on google with the book title and words "ban", "government of India" and found no news reports relating any government of India attempts at banning this book. There were no reports on ban by Allahabad High Court either. All I found were book reviews on the book and other articles written mainly by political commentators known for their leftist opinions.   Third, I found some material on internet on how the author misinterpreted much of the scriptures to support his conclusions.  It basically left me disappointed and I am still searching for some reliable and accurate material on this matter.  
 Many of Dumke's suggestions could be deadly to those with wheat and milk allergies. She suggests using spelt instead of what. Spelt is just an ancient form of wheat! Goat's milk is another alternative she suggests.  Goat's milk is a milk protein with the same allergens as cow's milk! I  first referred to her book after finding out about my food allergies and  was looking for information. I ended up getting severely ill after trying  spelt, goat's milk and other "alternatives." I was clueless and  naive and I don't want anyone else to have to experience what I went  through 
 I wish I could give Tatum a -----***** in honor of Stingley's death today. What a self-centered jerk!! 
 I was just waiting for this one to come out on DVD. Voila! It's here and I rent it. God, oh God, oh God - this film had so much potential and super actors, but the story was so full of holes, I could've drained my spaghetti in it! Not one single question regarding the plot of the film was answered!!! Not a single one! Since I refuse to watch it again, I now have to go to bed asking myself if I didn't perhaps miss something. Let's go on the record here: Acting - superb (Michael Caine's still got it); filming - superb; suspense - superb; action -superb; plot - as weak as my overcooked spaghetti. Everything was there but the plot. Like having my palate whet, without ever tasting the dish. Frustrating, hmmm 
 Car!  For Arnie that is.  Arnie is a gawky, awkward teenage male with few friends and few skills.  But he does come across a car named Christine, which he proceeds to fix up and clean.  This car in turn comes to own him as it itself is somehow inhabited by an evil demon that allows the car to come to life at will, and cause accidents, run over others, and even asphyxiate one unsuspecting intruder with exhaust gas in its cabin.  Together, Arnie and Christine form a bond based on loyalty and violence.  The car makes him cool and he uses it to get even with his enemies and those that would hurt his car; the car in turn protects him.  Over the course of the book, Arnie turns from an innocent and weak teenager to a violent-prone and temperamental adult.  But all good relationships come to an end; and the book ends with Christine being crushed into a cube at a garbage dump.    This book is one of the shorter books of Stephen King.  Written in the early 1980s, it is readable by high school kids, and is easy to get through in one day.  There is minimal gore, some violence, and enough drama to keep one interested.  All in all, nothing fancy and nothing extraordinary from the king of horror 
 This book is several things.  One thing it is NOT is funny.  Blount  worries that, having attained the age of 55, he is experiencing some sort  of humorist's change of life and is no longer capable of evoking guffaws.   Well, then, this book is a self-fulfilling prophesy.  In the process, we  get to squirm through such incessent dissing of his mother that we want to  turn our heads in embarrassment; so much what-did-I-do-wrong whining about  lost loves that we're inclined to "card" him to see if he's  really past 15; and yet more tired and feeble attempts at what, I suppose,  is to pass for "Southern humor."  If this is the best we're to  expect from Blount as he flounders through middle age, he ought to confine  himself to his periodic appearances with Garrison Keillor, reading jokes  sent in by people who know what "funny" really is 
 Noam Chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his, yours, and mine - the United States of America.  He has made millions of dollars teaching, lecturing, selling his books, and investing.  His world-wide fame in psycholinguistics is well-deserved.  His infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own Jewish ethnicity and the U.S., in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the United States.  He has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of American foreign policy.  He goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism, when he always ranks the U.S. and Israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now, and even in history.  His distrust of any authority, benign or otherwise, is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the "underdog," even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as Al Queda or Hezbollah.    Yet since 1955, hypocrite Chomsky has worked for the "overdog" Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has actively and enthusiastically participated in the development of weapons of War and mass destruction, and continues to this very day.  Chomsky trumps his own potential for gifted analytic objectivity with his simple hatred of the United States and the Jewish State.  If he were not so attached to the freedom of making money, earning the adulation of the American Left, and freedom to express himself, he might be able to give more direct and personal support for our enemies and his friends by taking up residence in North Korea, Iran, or Syria.  Let us hope he retires outside of our homeland that he hates so much, the United States of America.    God Bless America, which will continue to give Chomsky the right to speak, teach, and make lots of money.  Raybo 
 Ugh!  Never having heard of the author or his other books, this is the first book I've bought solely on the strength of Amazon's  "Recommended for" list.  I'm disappointed both by the book itself and by Amazon's flawed ability to suggest books.  To be fair, The Amateur has all the elements of thrillers I enjoy:  foreign travel, word play, conspiracy theory, a parallel body of knowledge about which the reader can learn while following the main plot.  But it's dull.  The lines set up to sound world-weary or self-deprecating sound simply smug, depressingly self-satisfied.  Heller, the main character, has all the quirky tics of a Spenser or a Reacher, but none of the depth.  (Yes, even Parker's Spenser has depth compared to the hero of Littell's yarn.)  It' s as though Littell can't be bothered with back-story or background, trying instead to telegraph the results of a life experience with references to "his Mona Lisa smile" and the begging, sniffing, and returning of cigarettes.  Best line:  a remembered message home from young Heller miserable at summer camp:  "everyone here goes around in twos;  I go around in ones."  We do get a brief glimpse into the bizarre, self- aggrandizing, vanity press micro-world of "Shakespeare didn't write those plays."  But the self-absorbed and classist men (only men, of course) who burrow away to prove that no one without a title could have produced Shakespeare's canon are ultimately as boring as the rest of the book.  Littell writes good minor characters - Mr Diamond, Uncle Ludvic --  but one can't help wondering if that's because he doesn't need to sustain them.  Elizabeth is his best character, the only woman who gets more than a line or two.  Toward the end, however, she becomes yet another superficial cipher in the service of Heller's revenge saga.  As for the plot, Littell may deserve a prize for the most sustained series of coincidences in a spy novel.  There's virtually nothing else moving things forward -- certainly not the dialogue, which is both tedious and brief.  Over-all judgment?  Big yawn.  Spend your money on Daniel Silva - great writing, compelling characters, complex plots leading to the heart of varied darknesses and back again 
 I can't believe the other people giving this high marks. I love the wheel, but darn if this isn't just terrible. There isn't even a single on it; I can't believe the studio released it. Thank god I got a promotional copy and didn't have to go buy it in the store. The Catherine Wheel needs to get back together--quick 
 i bought this CD because it had all my fave fred hammond songs on it. but little did i know that they are all, ALL bad versions of them! you can't even sing along! this CD sucks! DO NOT BUY THIS CD 
 I bought this book on the basis of a National Public Radio story which promoted it in an in-depth study of the devestating 1900 hurricane that killed thousands in Galveston, Texas. The radio spot spared no expense with the sound of hurricane force wind surrounding the historic taped voices of survivors describing a night where death pounded on the door. It made a much better radio show than it does a book. The problem is, the eyewitnes accounts are all in cloudy retrospect, some were taped seventy-plus years afterwords and are shaky historic accuracy. The book is a compilation of various communications from victims and survivors; personal letters, weather reports, diary entries, newspaper headlines and the mighty storm soon becomes as redundant as a 'Weather Channel' report. If the authors had found a grocery list of a victim, it would be included. Surely this hurricane which killed over 5000 people in an American coastal community in 1900 was more horrific than the drab, hearsay accounts given here. There is no journalistic quality. Even the photographs show page after page of what appears to be the same pile of wooden rubble 
 Mark Twain called the Book of Mormon "chloroform in print" and he wasn't kidding.  It is by far the most boring read I have encountered (I could barely get through it).  I am a woman of faith - faith in God and faith in Christ and I don't know how anyone could believe this rubbish.  PLEASE, anyone who is taking this at all seriously - do some research on the church.  Ask some hard questions (you will likely get a rehearsed answer, but it's worth a shot).    Joseph Smith was accused (and fined with a misdimeanor) of being a "glass looker" - hired by a man to help him find buried silver mines started and left behind by the Spanish. He would use "magic stones" that were placed in a hat to tell him where to find the location.  So convenient that he later found "gold plates" and used what he called the "Urim and Thum" (which, by the way are actually gemstones that were carried by the High Priests of Israel in biblical times) to translate these plates (he describes them as stones he looked at in a hat).    There are SO many myths that are told by members of the church "most men were SO distraught at the thought of polygamy", the age issue of Joseph translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith's actual role in polygamy (which really should be called polandry - when a woman has more than one husband...  11 of Josephs 33 wives were actually married to other men first and then married to him, having NEVER divorced the first husband - what's up with that???).. etc.. and the list goes on and on...  I am not disputing that Mormons take care of their own... that they are often kind people who have good hearts, I think that is all wonderful and if you want to join their church for those reasons that's great! Just PLEASE do some homework first and don't just rely on the "power of prayer".  There is a reason that Utah is the [...] capital of the USA (I'm sure every one of those people "prayed" about that big business decision - it can OFTEN be mis-intrepreted).  
 One of the first genres moviemakers turn to, when wanting to stir up a little historical or emotional reflection, is war.  Films about war make up some of the oldest in the history of the media, many of them about battles that never took place.  But throw in a dash of historical accuracy here and there (and at the producers' discretion) and you have a recipe for "classic" status.  Exhibit A: "Zulu."  Nevermind that this is the retelling of a senseless battle fought in the name of British colonial expansion, in which countless men died, Brits and Africans alike.  Who cares that the Zulu empire was as oppressive and unforgiving as any tribe on the continent.  Forget that the ultimate outcome - "victory" at Ulundi - resulted in British control of Zululand and naturally, a barbarous system of apartheid for the next 100+ years.  (As one reviewer pointed out, the Africans who played extra roles in the 1964 film weren't even able to go see the movie under the current policies of apartheid.)  Nevermind all that.  Tally ho, mates!  This is war, and war is classic.  Gather round and hear a tale of glory, courage and heroism... again.  Sure, the heroes in question are fighting in the name of racism and greed, but fighting bravely nonetheless.  And to counter any suggestion that the filmmakers condescend to the adversary, the Zulus are presented as equally brave.  Yes, bravery abounds.  After all, what better match for the white man's unflinching imperative than another power-hungry, merciless (but brave) army: that of the Zulus.  Make no mistake, this war story is told from the perspective of the white minority in Southern Africa; there are no significant individual characters on the African side.  And looking at things from that angle, one would have to spin the British effort in a somewhat positive light, or never sleep another night.  But to pretend that it is accurate or just to arbitrarily assign themes like "glory" and "patriotism" to what adds up to brutal militarism, is to deceive one's self utterly.  If anyone can tell me how the effort to defend British fortifications in South Africa in 1879 has made Africa (or the world) a better place, I will gladly take it all back.    In the meantime, filmmakers will continue to rouse passionate armchair patriotism, recalling the brave men who sacrificed their lives for the greater good, whatever that might have been.  Unfortunately, it is the public willingness to accept these tales as accurate, these missions as noble, and these surges of testosterone as plenty justification, that many more men and women will be needlessly sacrificed for years to come.  "Zulu" is indeed a classic war movie.  But ask yourself: is that always a good thing 
 I love this time period and was excited to start this book.  What a disappointment!  I couldn't follow it half the time and the other half...well, let's just say I didn't want to follow it.  The subplot felt straight out of Flowers in the Attic.  No thanks, I'll take my historical fiction "straight."  
 This has a run down of the colts season from game one to the Super Bowl.Thats it.Do not expect the Super Bowl without commercials and edited down because thats not what this is.Very disappointing.The AFC championship game of the week is just a post game show.I would have loved to see at least the 2nd half of that game.It was better then the Super Bowl.The only good things where the few extras with Manning and Harrison wired for sound.I hope there is a better one come'n cause this is not worth much 
 This map is meant to be an accompaniment to the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide to Paris, and it may be that it works well in that role. (I enjoy the books; I think the series is terrific.) But as a standalone product, I found it an unsatisfactory compromise between the Streetwise series and a "real" Michelin city map. It is larger than the Streetwise series, and shows a bit more of the city, but it is seriously lacking in the detail that comes with the Michelin city map. And if you want to go anywhere beyond the central arrondissments, you're out of luck.  The good aspect of the map is that it is laminated and folds easily, but it's a little too big to carry in a jacket pocket. If you're just looking to guide yourself around the center of town, you're better off with the Streetwise guide, which is of a more convenient size. If you really need to find a particular street, and/or you want to explore beyond the tourist areas, stick with the big Michelin or equivalent. They may be clumsy to handle, but the big maps have the best detail.  PS: I agree with the other review regarding the Metro map. It lacks route numbers and it is awfully small 
 Just returned from Thailand this week. We used this book (although the cover photo is different, so perhaps we had the previous edition). Some of the bungalow info was different (i.e. unrecognizeable from the book description), but they change so fast that's to be forgiven in any guidebook. What really irked me was the crazy light orange text colour for headings and numbers - trying to read in dim Asian lighting or the back of taxi was extremely difficult. Also, I found the maps oddly placed. Good size, though, and the transportation info was accurate 
 Save your $$ if you plan to run with this on a jogging stroller.  On a mild windy day it flips up towards you and off to the side.  I didn't think it really shielded my baby from the sun like I thought it was going to either.  I would not recommend this product. It's very cumbersome. When I returned it to the store, there were two others on the counter behind the customer service cashier that had just been returned recently.    
 Prior to this release, Elvis Costello made a series of rock records of such brilliance as to inspire the pursuit of a musical career in many of those who heard them. This album is a slap in the face to all those people,  as well as to all the authentic country music performers who come from places like London, Kentucky instead of London, England.  It is a narcissistic, self-indulgent musical vanity project of the worst kind - an idea as stupid as Loretta Lynn rapping or Sean Combs attempting to sing Ella Fitzgerald or Roberta Flack songs. The more you like his first albums, the more you will hate this one - don't waste your money 
 After reading Vogler I was interested in how an expert might wholisticly apply his structure to actual movies.  Unfortunately, Voytilla's analysis of individual movies is rather shallow and nominal. i.e. He basically rehashes movie plots using keywords for Voglers book to name them. There is no introspection into how these elements provide drama, work with the theme of the movie, or highten an audience's investment in the hero.  The only parts of the book that I found interesting were Voytilla's analysis of Genres. Here he writes about similar structures, themes, and purposes found within genres such as comedy, adventure, action etc.  If you are at a loss to apply Vogler's works, this book will be helpful. If you are interested in breif and somewhat interesting Genre analysis and don't mind dropping a few bucks then you might pick up a couple of interesting tidbits here and there.   However, if you're looking for an analysis that truly enlightens the dynamics behind the dramatic excellence of a movie, skip this book, rent a bunch of movies and apply Vogler's ideas for yourself. (Disney movies such as the Little Mermaid are a great place to start. 
 What a waste of time and money. 10 songs and hardly 20-30 minutes... of pure mediocrity.   Weezer is an amazing band...just don't bother on this one folks. Pinkerton and the Blue album are just classics. I Respect those guys a whole lot.  This is just...disappointing to say the least. It's just BAD, even for a Weezer fan. Lately Weezer has been trying to do with their nerd-rock label and are going for an almost loveable, adorable sort cutesy label.  I can't make myself clear enough. Don't go near this album, it's just the bottom of the corporate barrel. 
 I am a big Percy Blakeney/Scarlet Pimpernel fan and have read Orczy's book at least 3 times.  Based on the strength of a customer review on this webpage, I purchased the boxed DVD edition, featuring Richard E. Grant & Elizabeth McGovern.  The scripts were written by Richard Carpenter.    I was VERY DISAPPOINTED by this screen version of the story.  I do NOT recommend it to any true Percy fan.  I have viewed 3 movie versions of the Scarlet Pimpernel, and this one is by far the worst.  Perhaps screen-writer Carpenter never read the book; perhaps he simply decided to take ENORMOUS LICENSE with the characters.  In either event, the script eliminated much of what was delightful about Orczy's Percy and turned Marguerite into a mild-mannered wimp without the wit or resources to save herself from her own stupid decisions.  Even worse, Marguerite was constantly in need of being rescued by her husband or, ironically, her former lover/the series villain, Chauvelin.  Here are some reasons for my conclusions:    Percy Blakeney, whom Orczy described in her book as the "master of disguise" never ONCE dons a disguise in this movie series (unless you consider wrapping a black scarf around the lower face a disguise).  And **HELLO!!** wouldn't the French be a tad bit suspicious of 3 black-cloaked, black-masked figures strutting around the streets of Paris in broad daylight?  (The French certainly arrested other characters for less!)  These scenes were so contrived, they were painful.  And yes, while it was certainly clever to have Percy escape ala James-Bond gadgetry -- this contrivance negated Orczy's portrayal of Percy as a man whose WIT was his first and primary weapon for defense and escape.  In fact, I found Percy (in this DVD collection) to be more fond of slicing and dicing enemies, than of using his unmatched cunning to save himself and his compatriots.  This twist on Percy was truly, truly disappointing -- the author must be turning in her grave.  As for the romance in Orczy's story...  Neither the actor nor the screen-writer were EVER able to convince me that Percy was the kind of man whom a woman (or a nation) could adore.  Richard E. Grant portrayed Percy as cold & verbally abusive to Marguerite.  Percy ridicules her publically several times -- and Marguerite's dialogue is written so that she never quite "gives" as good as she gets.    But Marguerite's dialogue is not the point.  THE POINT is that Percy, in the book, was a tormented man who loved a wife whome he feared he could not trust.  Never once did Grant's acting convey such breadth; his verbal sniping (as written and acted) was cruel and self-aggrandizing.  Even when Percy is supposed to be "play-acting" this ridicule of Marguerite in DVD #3 to set up a plot element later in the story, the contempt in the dialogue, as delivered by Grant, felt very REAL.  Screen-writer Carpenter's rendition of the so-called "romance" in this movie version touches the very uncomfortable theme of emotional abuse, especially through Grant's interpretation of the dialogue.  Rather than delivering his lines with subtlety (a nod to his hidden feelings of affection for his wife), Grant's Percy most often comes across as a high-handed male autocrat who expects Marguerite to submit meekly to his rule.  While this type of husband/wife relationship may have been historically accurate in 18th Century Britain, I do not believe that the Percy of Orczy's book would have handled himself in this way.  Indeed, Percy was supposed to be the consummate gentleman underneath all the frippery.  And he was supposed to be genuinely in love with his wife.  One of the rare, potentially romantic moments in DVD #1 was completely bungled by both leading actors.  Grant's one-liner about Marguerite being his "life" is delivered with such unbelievable dispassion that it borders on mockery.  (And please:  Marguerite's dimwitted mutterings about unrequited love at this crucial point in the plot -- when Percy is accusing her of complicity in a French family's murder -- was INSULTING to every woman of intelligence in the audience! I just wanted to throttle actress McGovern AND the screenwriter.)  Yes, yes, the original book hinged on this ongoing misunderstanding in the Blakeneys' marriage, but the dialogue could have been written and acted much better.  But if you don't consider the lack of plausible romantic elements a good reason to avoid this series, read on.  The problems with this verison of Orczy's Pimpernel go far beyond the love story.  For starters, Percy is often unsympathetic as a human being:  in addition to sniping at his wife and behaving in court like a smart-alecky prig, he shows a dearth of compassion at the death of his loyal lieutenant, Lord Anthony Dewhurst.  When Dewhurst is murdered by Chauvelin (in cold blood, I might add), Grant (and the scriptwriter) devote exactly 3 seconds to grief in DVD #1.  Grant cavalierly delivers the following dialogue: "Well, Tony knew the risks."  (And this Pimpernel is supposed to be a hero whom a nation adores?  Whom 20+ young British hotbloods would give up their LIVES for?! Sorry.  Didn't buy it.)  If Percy's casting was bad, Marguerite's was even worse.  In the book, Orczy's Marguerite was a flamboyant French actress, full of life and passion & hopelessly in love with a husband who, she believes in despair, no longer loves her.    In this DVD collection, Elizabeth McGovern most often appears as a frumpy hausfrau rather than a sparkling coquette.  McGovern played Marguerite without wit or common sense, & Carpenter's script didn't help.  For example:  Marguerite (a bourgeois who should have known better) tries to pass herself off at the gates of Paris as a seamstress.  Five seconds later, her lily-white, uncallused hands are inspected by the captain of the guard, and she is hauled off to prison.  Carpenter didn't even let Marguerite's character -- the consummate actress -- PROTEST this treatment, much less run, struggle, or attempt to bluff her way out of her predicament.  Marguerite simply walks off between her guards!!  (::groan::)  In DVD #2, she sits meekly in a convent, waiting for Madame Guillotine's troops to discover her and drag her away.  In DVD #3, she spies on 2 characters, learning the double-identity of the villain.  The villain leaves, but the sidekick remains; several minutes later, Marguerite returns from a chat with Percy to rummage through the villain's belongings.  At this point, neither the actress nor the screenwriter allow Marguerite the common sense to first SEARCH THE AREA FOR THE SIDEKICK to make sure that her snooping goes unobserved.  Naturally, this plot contrivance leads to Marguerite's capture later.  ::double groan::  I could go on and on about the characterization of Marguerite as a stupid female, but I'm sure you get the point.  And now you're probably wondering if there is ANYTHING to commend you to this series.  Well, yes, to be fair, there is:  Martin Shaw, who was cast as Chauvelin.    Shaw portrayed Chauvelin as a real human being with passions, prejudices, longings and yes, moments of real malice.  He also had occasional moments of nobility.  He gave the only consistent performance of real depth in this series.  Even in the scenes where Percy completely humiliated Chauvelin, either by word or by sword, Chauvelin somehow remained sympathetic, which, by contrast, left Percy either looking over-the-top arrogant or a tad bit cruel.  In general, the worst storyline of this series is on DVD #2.  MADAME GUILLOTINE has enough plot contrivances to gag an ox.  The 3rd DVD, THE KIDNAPPED KING, is by far the best of the series -- but, sadly, that isn't saying much.    If you're a glutton for punishment and you really MUST purchase this series, I recommend that you amuse yourself by watching the REALLY BAD ACTING of the extras in the crowd scenes (especially on DVD #1).  However, if you want to watch a REALLY GOOD version of the Scarlet Pimpernel, one that is faithful to Orczy's novel, view the 1980s version that stars Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour.  Andrews is comical AND heroic -- a man to fall in love with.  Seymour is a spunky, resourceful heroine that will make audiences cheer.  You might also enjoy the Leslie Howard version, with beautiful Merle Oberon as Marguerite, which was released in 1935.  Both actors do a credible job with Orczy's characters, and the script is faithful to her book.    Happy viewing 
 We bought this for our daughter when she was younger. It was too frustrating. The ants are not made like they once were and it is near impossible to get them into the pants. We would cheat for her and pretend they went in after a long while of trying. Even we could not get them in. Plus the material is so cheesy that they break very easily. Save your money and buy a better game instead 
 Very disappointed with this DVD.  Like I said above, if you want to view a rockumentary watch VH1 alot cheaper.  Description very misleading 
 Although I love the Firm, this one is not my favorite.It is a good workout,there is just something about it...it drags.Perhaps Ms DelRio is not quite as toned as one would hope..I don't know.At one point she has her eyes shut while she squats.I have dozens of Firms and some with this instructor, that I like.It seems that most Firm videos have a way of tricking you into working out hard before you know it, but this one falls short in some indescribable way 
 I purchased my version of El Hazard from a zShop for 19 bucks and I am SO glad that I did. That said, the first series is worth watching for two main reasons: overt lesbianism and Jinnai. The former is self-explanatory while the latter (Jinnai) is without a doubt the best character in the series (despite the fact that he is the antagonist). You can't say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed, but throughout the first series Jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed-out character, as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature. This superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story's main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging. And this is what makes the second series (all four dismal episodes) so tragic: they nerfed Jinnai. He could never have been called a genius in the first series, but he was decidedly intelligent, cool, pragmatic, supremely self-confident and an effective leader (even though he was also manic and delusional). In El Hazard II, as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain, they have turned Jinnai into a slapstick-idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon. I suggest purchasing El Hazard through...alternate means,... watching the first series and discarding the second. Let's face it: even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty 
 I've always been interested in how different people arrived on this continent.  I picked up Chiasson's book with interest.  I was immediately not impressed with the repetitive writing style; more suitable for middle school readers than adults.  I was intrigued by his exploration but put off by the jumping around between explorers and periods of time.  He may have located these maps (many produced long after the period he was writing about thus a bit irrelevant)in the order of his telling. However, if the story was to convince the reader of the Chinese presence on this continent before Columbus, his rendition was very jumbled.  The maps of Africa he showed were the ones falsified by Menzies. The original map never showed the hump of West Africa. If you head north you can't miss it. The currents drifts are not fast enought to bring the Chinese to these shores so quickly. Chinese navigation was never as sophisticated as Menzies and Chiasson lead you to believe.    The big unanswered question is why didn't the Chinese reach Europe by sea when they left. Chinese and European traders had already had long contact via the Middle East.  The currents back to china lead to Europe. The answer is they didn't reach Europe because they never came this way.  Chiasson's mountain top appears to really be Kelly Mountain, a well hiked and traveled area on Cape Breton.  Archeologists (sic) viewing the various sites saw nothing of any of his "evidence"--road, wall, 'tiles', platforms.  Even in the book, the two others who travelled to the site made no subsequent attempts to explore the burial plots, photograph or catalog the various sites.  Pointing to pile of rocks and saying smelter can be done by any 6 year old with a vivid imagination.  Likewise, photoshopping aerial photos to highlight shapes is easily done--just look at the faked Beirut photos the Hezbollah gave Reuters.  In short, I think Mr. Chiasson would have had a better tale to tell had he not been beguiled by Menzies.  As an alternative history, this would have made a great fictional story.  Buy the book if you must add it to your collection.  Otherwise, read it in your local library and save some money. 
 What is this? His first album was great. I think this was trying to be too differnt and obscure. Like the beyond belief weird, " The omen,"( part 2 of damien) with Marilyn Manson.  Most of the music backrounds and not good and dont flow. Plus some of the rhymes dont make any sense, and are  just there for the sake of rhyming, " Ain't no way."  And as a second album it does it justice to being way more dirty and hardcore. Just the second track alone, " bring your whole crew," DMX speaks of raping a girl, killing someone  and then having sex with the corpse. I mean didnt you notice by the cover of DMX imersed in blood? I mean,  "slipping," is alright and, " It's all good," " Heat." As a whole, very un-enjoyable. I would be happy never  hearing this again. I mean inevative is great! But this mabye went too far, there weren't really any popular singles except for, " slippin'" A lot of people think DMX is a  god, and I remember DMX being a little bothered by that. A while ago the man was busted for inpersonating a police officer and pulling someone over. No to this 
 He was at his best when he sang about the loneliness, perseverance and dreams of ordinary people.  In "Sandra" for instance it felt like he was singing about a neighbour.  The combination of his warm voice with his piano could be very moving and was definitely unique.  In the late eighties he started focusing on merely performing and doing cover versions.  He released a few inspired tracks now and then, his first Christmas album had a lot of charisma and warmth, and "Here at the Mayflower" was a sincere effort. He is an intelligent person who cares for music and doesn't let his superstardom go to his head.    So, what has changed?  And why this late in his career?  Barry has reinvented himself as a Las Vegas entertainer, Liberace style.  And he's released an album with unchallenging versions of evergreens.  I have no doubt that he genuinely wants to make people happy, like Liberace did.  And I have deep respect for that.  But I personally regret that Clive Davis and Manilow have now decided to manufacture products for a larger audience - one that doesn't really have any demands.     
 I didn't receive the book yet, I'm still waiting for him, so I dont know if the book is good or not!! 
 I find this movie to be a really good young people's movie.  There is a lot of a somewhat realistic fantasy mood here.  Good songs, good dancing.  The fact they went half way around the world for a different backdrop is also a positive.  This at least has some young people looking for the location of Spain, just to be informed.  Inspirational in a way to send a message you can make it if you try.  Not just singing and dancing, but translating in to anything you might attempt.  Work for your goal, and be willing to work hard.  But there is just one very big glaring misstep, no a dilibrate oversight.  Here we have four very lovely young ladies, of color, but there are purposely no young men of color in any major role in this movie.  Why?  Socially in the 21st century Disney has deleted a part of our society.  From "The Cinderella Story" starring Brandy, to the "Cheetah Girls 2".  No young men of color.  Shame on you Disney.  There is an old saying, "It is not what you say, it is what you do".  What you have a habit of doing sends a very, very negative message to all our young people. 
 First, this shoe runs small, a full size at that. Most importantly the only thing that could make this shoe wearable without mind numbing, jaw clenching, tear jerking pain is a local anesthetic. Steve Madden must Hate Women, this is the third Madden shoe I've bought that was painful beyond description. I thought maybe the first time it was simply that particular shoe and it's design, but the 2nd and 3rd were progressively more painful than the first. Every person involved in producing Steve Madden shoes should be sentenced to wearing them for a full year. 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox!

 Wow... I don't think I've ever heard stuff that's so stupid. Do these guys even know how to spell?!? Let alone RECORD and MAKE MUSIC. This isn't music. BULLver are just a bunch of homosexuals who think they can make "complex" music by playing random notes and saying its art. They should call it "Jazz" so that i know to stay away from it. What ever happened to the good Ulver? Their first album and their third album were good. Then that retard Dickster G decided to turn gay and make stupid music. I've had enough of this bull. Check out the first Emperor album and the first 2 Dimmu Borgir albums and the first Old Man's Child album and a couple Dark Throne albums and the FIRST Cradle of FIlth album and any Dark Funeral album for good music. Death to False Music like this. The Beast has spoken.  - Angel Beas 
 This is a very biased, uninformative book.  The research views are very narrow and the author treats the readers like children, as though the readers are not capable of drawing their own conclusions.  I'm extremely disappointed with this book!  I do NOT recommend this book, at all.  I've found books such as "Mind Boosters" far more informative and enlightening 
 Please note -- this movie receives one star ONLY because Amazon does not offer a zero star (or, more appropriately for this film, negative) rating.    Recently, Entertainment Weekly compiled a list of the "25 Worst Movie Sequels" ever.  How "An American Werewolf in Paris" avoided its rightful place on this list is now one of the great mysteries of my life.   Like everyone else drawn to this unfortunate attempt at a film, I watched because I am a fan of John Landis' original "American Werewolf."  Watched, that is, 15 minutes...which was more than enough time to establish that this 'sequel' should have been stillborn during pre-production.  I was almost tempted to follow this 'film' to its conclusion, to see exactly how bad it could get, but I simply could not subject myself to such torture.  The only thing that could make this a worse movie?  Viewing the original "Werewolf" first, which will emphasize even more the tragedy that was "American Werewolf in Paris."  So, why was this such a terrible movie?  I should have taken the DVD case description as a sign -- it explained that I would be watching a (I'm paraphrasing...but pretty close) 'rockin' horror film with a 'hip, up and coming group of young actors,' and, even better, I would be treated to 'a soundtrack complete with the hottest of today's music.'   Umm...no.  I challenge you to find more blatant lies than the ones offered by the movie's promoters.    To wit, a sample of several idiotic scenes and plot devices: (1) Tom Everett Scott wants to prove his courage by bungy jumping off the Eiffel Tower...which would be fine, except, given the shape of that particular structure (going out from top to bottom), our young hero would be jumping into the tower itself.  That might be a problem, but one he never seems to consider.  Can we really like a protagonist this stupid?   (2) Just before he is ready to leap, a young woman throws herself off the ledge.  T.E. Scott jumps to save her (despite the fact that his rope is not yet harnassed), and gracefully nabs her just before she becomes another splatter on the sidewalk.  She runs off, he (hey, I was right!) bangs his head on a beam and is put in hospital.  After waking, his concern for her is understandable...but why, in any rational universe, would he suddenly be infatuated with a clearly suicidal woman?  He says something to the effect that she is 'different' or 'sophisticated' or some other garbage...despite the fact that their relationship at that point comprises all of eight (wordless) seconds.  (Here, I'm also a bit nitpicky...because I can't for the life of me fathom why he would Julie Delpy even remotely attractive; mental instability is bad enough, but her looks hardly negate those problems).  Anyway, for absolutely no lucid reason, he suddenly decides that this is the girl of his dreams...the entire movie is based on his inexplicable admiration, a flaw symptomatic of the entire plot structure.   (3) The classic scene: the young lovers' first date...in which he 'accidentally' pulls out a handful of condoms, and to subdue her anxiety about his intentions, he is forced to pretend they are actually pieces of gum.  Yes, this is the level of sophistication clearly rampant throughout the movie.    Those are the high points of the first ten minutes, and I'm fairly certain the rest of narrative is downhill from that atrocious beginning.  
 Yes, I know some people will be interested in seeing Paris Hilton act.  Let me save you some time: she does an OK job in a forgettable role, then gets killed.  Now, having said that, the film is equally forgettable.  It is, in one word: boring.  Don't waste your time with this one.  It is not horrible, it's not the worst movie ever made, it's just boring.. 
 Everyone seemed really excited about this game; supposed to be a great launch title, etc.   Turns out that Red Steel fails to deliver like Dominoes during a hurricane. The graphics are meh (Ubisoft could have done way better), and controls are a bit awkward. This isn't because of the Wii controller itself... having played Zelda and Wii sports, I can say that the controller works very very well. So I am inclined to think that the bulkiness of shooting in Red Steel, and the fact that using your sword is more like clubbing a baby seal then fighting with the grace of a master samurai, has to do with the game design, not any fault of the controller. The storyline isn't that amazing either. Pretty straight-forward neverending quest to save your girlfriend (brownie points if you got the pop culture reference!), shoot a lot of Japanese people in the process. Nothing innovative to see here, move along now.   It could have been a lot better. I'm selling this one back to EBgames and getting Trauma Center instead. Disappointing launch title. 
  Ok now I am afraid to try any other Our Gang DVDs! No one mentions how poor the sound is, so that it it almost impossible to understand what is being said! This made this DVD worthless in my opinion 
 Ultimately nothing more than a snuff film for girls who like to get it on with the same sex via an alpha male vessel, Spikester goes to great lengths to make his locker room-talk experiment seem a product greater than the sum of its parts. Coffin-size office floors, psychic monkey sidekicks, a cabinet that spills onto an exit ramp, dysfunctional imps who made faces at the dinner table when they were kids and the "faces" stuck, Pinocchio fetishes. Watching "Being John Malkovich" appears to be a bit like going to a carnival put on by Aphex Twin. I'd rather drill holes through my kneecaps so I can whistle while I walk 
 I know a lot about programming -- and I am also keenly aware that there is even more that I don't know.  I have developed in MS Access, Word and Excel for the last five years on all versions since 97.  I have been teaching myself Visual Studio .NET and am currently attending a Java programming class.    I was very disappointed in my purchase.  I was looking forward to learning how to use the office developer tools in Visual Studio .NET.  Unfortunately, this book is targeted at those that have already mastered Visual Studio.NET as opposed to those who know VBA and Office development and want to migrate to .NET.  My evidence: 1) The coding language selected by the author was C#.  This choice, for good or ill, has the net effect of excluding VBA developers because of the vast difference in syntax.  If you know C++ or Java you can make it through the examples, but these languages are not what VBA developers tend to know.  In other words, this book doesn't allow VBA developers to leverage their existing knowledge. 2) The book starts by discussing Interops and Assemblies.  Again, for good or ill, one should probably be familiar with these concepts before delving into the code examples.  Additionally, you MUST have more than a passing knowledge of threading to make full use of this book. 3) A review of the index yields not a single topic regarding object oriented programming (OOP) concepts for those new to OOP making it much more of an advanced specialty book than a more broad reference and learning tool.  The author clearly knows what he is taking about.  Unfortuantely, those most in need of learning office tools in .NET will not be in a position to take advantage of his knowledge. 
 This review only concerns the digital edition for Adobe Reader. I do not advise buying this version, because some of the important figures contained in the book are missing 
 I do not know what all these 5 star reviews are raving about.  I didn't like this book for several reasons.  They are, in no particular order: It's about too many people and not one of them gets a thorough development--it's just snipets of lots of people's lives.  It's only about women--how boring!  The men in the book are in the background and hardly even named.  This means only mother-daughter relationships are discussed, and it makes for pretty monotonous fare by the end of the book.  Finally, the theme of rebellion against old world culture has potential, but the author gives it a very one-dimensional treatment.  Simply move away from home and drink too much and you're saying something new and different about living in the American melting pot?  In short, I though this book was shallow.  I wouldn't have finished it if not for the book group I read it for 
 Like Karenna Gore Schiff, I was disheartened about politics after the 2000 presidential election--not so much that V. P. Gore, Sen. Liberman, and Sec. Christopher seemed to play to the fears of the uninformed with repeated claims of winning the popular vote, or even about the moral spin placed on a selective recount in an election that was a statistical tie. No, my feelings had to do with a young idealistic college student back in 1988 who remembers learning about a promising Democratic candidate from the State of Tennessee--a candidate who shared his concern for the environment, had a wife who was an advocate for decency standards in the media, and most importantly, had cast a recorded vote in favor of an amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1984 which read, "For the purposes of this act, the term 'person' shall include unborn children from the moment of conception."   Now, almost twenty years later, not only has Vice President Gore abandoned his stance against abortion, but now his daughter celebrates abortionists like Dr. Helen Rodrigues-Trias--a woman who was organizing public awareness campaigns against the Hyde Amendment around the very time when Rep. Gore was writing letters supporting the amendment.  Gore Schiff tells how Dr. Helen Rodrigues-Trias became head of Pediatrics at Lincoln Hospital in the South Bronx after the Black Panthers and Young Lords seized the facility and expelled its leadership, including a Jewish doctor who had fought against the Nazi's.   When not battling the new and inept leadership of the crudely named "Peoples Hospital", Dr. Rodrigues-Trias was apparently hard at work providing abortions for wealthy woman, and cover for poor women to have their babies aborted, as well. Her noble work was campaigning against the forced sterilization of poor women, although she came up against resistance from NOW and Planned Parenthood.  Gore Schiff also places Dr. Rodrigues-Trias in opposition to eugenics movements which are, evidently, from the long list of quotes provided, only orchestrated and lead by men. Margaret Sanger, one of the leading proponents of eugenics during the 20Th century outside of Europe, is only hailed for her "groundbreaking" work in contraception.  Gore Schiff provides this quote: "the greatest problem is to be found in the fact that well-to-do families tend to die out;there results, in consequence, a tendency to the elimination instead of the survival of the fittest."  Gore Schiff offers this quote, as well: "No doubt that many with criminal and perverted strains have been prevented from becoming themselves criminals and perverts in fact, but they are criminals and perverts still, in that they transmit the same strain to their children who, under less favorable environments will develop the same morbine characters"  Compare these to cut and pastes from Margaret Sanger's from Pivot of Civilization: "There is but one practical and feasible program in handling the great problem of the feeble-minded.  That is, as the best authorities are agreed, to prevent the birth of those who would transmit imbecility to their descendants."  "The emergency problem of segregation and sterilization must be faced immediately. Every feeble-minded girl or woman of the hereditary type, especially of the moron class, should be segregated during the reproductive period.  Otherwise, she is almost certain to bear imbecile children, who in turn are just as certain to breed other defectives"  "The lack of balance between the birth-rate of the ``unfit'' and the ``fit,'' admittedly the greatest present menace to the civilization, can never be rectified by the inauguration of a cradle competition between these two classes."  No Stars 
 I used the feature of searching and reading to check it out right here, online.  I searched for their write-up of amazon.com.  And it's there, on page 60.  Read those pages first.  If you think the authors give an intelligent and insightful perspective on Amazon's role in the internet bubble, then by all means buy and read the book 
 I have just finished this lengthy and mundane tome. 564 pages of this author's ponderous personal philosophy,  gratuitous sexual dysfunction, constant and maddeningly self ingratiating referrals to classical music and composers, discussions on all the authors that ever walked the earth, and when finished with all the above, a good little story that could have been written with one third the pages.  As if all this were not enough, Styron pulls out every lengthy, obsolete, and arcane word that he can find with which to propel his story along. (One can imagine him, loaded with whiskey--which he freely admits to being his greatest source of inspiration--pouring over every dictionary and thesauras written in an attempt to impress the reader, or, at least the liberal East Coast intelligensia.)The end effect for the reader is a constant slowing of momentum of the narrative, in order to look up a new and confusing word every five minutes. (One does, however, come to learn what "simulacrum" means; he uses the word some 15 or more times throughout this laborious read.)  I will not go into the story, save to mention the three major plot lines: that it is one of about 10,000 treatments of the after effects of concentration camps; a love story about a deeply scarred woman, having endured life in one of the camps, and a mentally deranged man; and a young Southern writer coming to grips with culture shock in Brooklyn--this being Styron, or Stingo, as he endearingly calls himself in the story. In one of the more compelling passages in the book he realizes that he no longer wants to live in the South and turns back to the squalid and sewer like life of New York. Being from the South, and after having slogged through this tedious read, I only wish that he had been belched into the Northeast sooner.       
 I received it but with great, great disappointment.  The bowl was not crafted from fine bone china, but from fine china.  The apperance was not as white as bone china.  And on the bottom of the bowl you may find it said "FINE CHINMA".   By the way, it is made in Indonesia. 
 Rx for Survival presents a media-friendly perspective of what makes a difference in international development and health. While some of the historical perspective is interesting and useful, the general presentation is facile, missing the importance of government actions, of human rights principles, and of community-based organizations in the identification and response to the diseases presented.  Hilts writes: "In science the couplings of love are sometimes expressed in mathematical models. They are like fluid flows, or combusition spreading." This kind of rhetoric is everywhere and doesn't do much to spread an understanding of the diseases, or the successful response to them, that the author intends 
 While the pictures in "The Jewel Box Garden" are great and may provide the reader with some inspiration, the author's condescending and judgemental text is pedestrian and fails to provide the reader with any original ideas regarding how to think about and plan a great place in a small space. 
 First off, so you know that I'm not biased in any way, I own every single Trance Party cd, as well as, most of the Ultra Trance and Dance cd's, and a host of others. I love trance/dance/house music. Now, compared to last year's Trance Party 4, this is awful. The Trance Party series went from underground, catchy trance and eurodance songs to this piece of garbage. The people at Robbins Ent realized that people like some of their female vocalists so this whole cd caters to them and only them. There are perhaps 3-4 good songs here:  Blue Water is 3 stars, catchy but a little weak. Good bass. Inspiration is a B side at best from IVD. Without Love is catchy but very effeminate. Until You Love Me, are we seeing a pattern? Every song on this cd mentions the word LOVE at least 52 times. It's fine for one or two tracks, but not the whole cd. I Miss You from DHT, the only other good song from DHT besides Listen To Your Heart. Again a sappy love song with some keyboards to make it "trance". Yeah ok. Tell Me from Lasgo, another weak song. Lasgo really fell off. Everytime We Touch from Cascada - excellent beginning, that's about it.  I didn't review the other songs because after 4 listens, I still have no recollection of those songs, because they're so plain and boring. This cd is ok for 16 girls but try putting this disc in with your boys on the way to a club and you'll get straight up tossed out.   I'd say that the Ultra Trance and Dance series are about 10 times better. Check out Ultra Trance 4 and Ultra Dance 6 or various other DJ compilations. This one is not worth 5$. 
 This book seems to have been written by Jeffrey Deaver just prior to his full acquisition of the unique style, creativity, pace and humor that marked his later works.  The Lincoln Rhyme novels, for example.  All of them employ Jeffrey's formidable writing skills, and are tremendously entertaining on many levels.  Mistress of Justice falls short of these expectations, however.  I got only halfway through it, skimmed the rest, then went right to the ending - which was predictable.  Never thought I'd do that with one of Jeffrey's books, and I have read nearly all of them.  The problems with this book are many.  The pace is very slow.  The plot - not very strong.  Too many characters are introduced, too quickly.  Too much writing space devoted to non-essential details.  But there also seems to be a snooty, snobbish tone to the entire book - almost as if Jeffrey had written it to impress his cronies in the lawyering arena of NYC.  While I was reading - I failed to find anyone in the story to admire, to cheer for, and more importantly, to identify with.  Although some may be fascinated by that particular class-based New York / New England culture of old money, politics and snobbishness, I am not.  Yet Jeffrey revelled in laying this all out in a manner that suggested the reader should love and embrace this culture.  Fortunately, Jeffrey moved away from this style in his later novels - all of which are marked by rich characters, from life's many diverse walkways.  Mistress of Justice reinforced my belief that you cannot hit a home run every time up - and that's fine.  And, I am grateful that the mistakes made in this novel are not found in any of Jeffrey's later works.  If you are as big a Jeffrey Deaver fan as I am - and you have not yet read Mistress of Justice - steel yourself for possible disappointment 
 I rated it one star because I couldn't go any lower 
 The mexican cartels absolutely wouldn't have allowed this  guy living on the border to exist in their territory as it  relates to grass smuggling.In Nuevo Laredo and Laredo,Tx. their have been 170 drug territory related killings year to date. This isn't even close to logical.Further,if his ranching business was broke and the bankers were knocking he could not have been anything more than a petty grass-runner.The mexicans have plenty of these types.With no money--you're a mule.This is however good fiction reading.The mexicans-including ''El Chapo'' of the Gulf cartel would laugh at this one.An individual cowboy on the Mexican border that is broke?C'mon.Mexicans fiercely protect their business.FICTION!Anyone who knows anything about this business knows that this story just ain't happening 
 ...I hope this book offers more than eHarmony does.  Seems to me that when you tacitly promise to take such an earnest, structured run at matching folks for life -- and charge accordingly -- the least you can do is offer customer support that measures up.    You guessed it; eHarmony seems staffed with dropouts.  When it takes four days to get an email asking you to restate your question, there's a problem.  And when emailing the good Dr. Himself gets you nada for another week, well...  Then there's the turgid level of matchmaking itself.  Fifty bucks a month for three straight weeks of zilch per?  Three in-the-flesh "matches" in almost as many years?  This is getting expensive ... and painful.    Hey, I'm a believer, but only because of the very interesting, very rare non-commital flukes eHarmony sends my way, even if it turns out they just want sex.  (And I'm male!)    Do I wonder if eHarmony, like a bad attorney, realizes that resolving problems means less revenue?  Almost 
 This book is an innaccurate version of events in the the discovery of teh structure of DNA. What most people don't know is that Rosalind Franklin was crucial to the discovery of the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick actually stole most of her data via Wilson, her supervisor, adn passed it off as their own discoverery.  She was a brilliant scientist and should have been an independent researcher at Kings College, but because she was a woman she was made an assistant to Wilson. She was extremely dedicated and plowed through all the obstacles at Kings College. However, her supervisor, Wilson, showed most of her data to his old friend Crick, who shared it with his partner Watson. They too were studying DNA, although they were on completely wrong track. The data that was pilfered included the famous photo 51, which Franklin obtained over a course of years' work and revealed the spiral shape of DNA. They also positioned the competent of DNA, such as the bases, exactly as she hypothesized. Watson, Crick, and Wilson received the Nobel Prize, while Franklin could not, because she died at the age of 38 due to radiation exposure from the X-rays she used to capture photo 51. The men only mentioned her in passing when accepting their prize, and definitely not as the source of the actual discovery. Then Watson had the gall to write a book that casts her in a horrible light, as an inferior person who was bad tempered and selfishly hoarded her information. He also calls her `Rosy' throughout the entire book, although she despised that name. He once even went up to Rosalind and demanded that she hand over her data. He was a complete bigot, and thought her inferior and was furious when she refused to share her own findings to him. He harps about her appearance in the book, and it is obvious that is the only way he perceives her, and not as a thinking person. And for the record, she was actually quite striking, and wore the latest in French fashions. She was extremely dedicated, and her level of determination would have been completely accepted in a man. That's why I give this book a one, and if I could I'd give it a zero. Watson is just begging for comeuppance for what he wrote in this book. I would reccomend reading other books about Rosalind's struggle, such as 'Rosalind Franklin: The dark lady of DNA' 
 Denise Austin needs to stick with making exercise videos for adults. This video isn't kid friendly, and doesn't have a good feel for kids. To be honest, it is very close to most of Denise's exercise videos for adults. What Denise has forgotten, or may have never known, is kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly, and that means with exercise videos to. A good choice for kids is - Kick to Get Fit Jr. -For Kids, this video is done by a qualified kid's fitness professional, not someone who is just throwing adult type movements at kids, and just hoping they can do them. My kids are NOT at all happy with this program.  There are 6 & 10 years old, and they were bored & turned off by this video within the first 5 minutes, mostly because they didn't understand the movements, and then found most of the other movements very hard to do. Once again, the forgotten point - Kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly. One last point, in the video Denise mentions that she received information from a variety of different professionals in the field of children's exercise & fitness. This is all good except they all forgot one VERY IMPORTANT DETAIL,-  You MUST be able to teach & instruct children at a level they understand. Just because you know something about exercise, it doesn't mean you are able to teach it to children. Knowledge is one thing - Teaching & Instructing is another, and the fact is, some people are just not very good at instructing children. A point that is very clearly displayed within this program. 
 If anyone realizes that if Koreans in North Korea at the time before the Russians came that if you were Korean in North Korea that you needed to speak Japanese or you would be extremely Punished.   
 The notion: that two former Mountain men (Leslie West, Corky Laing) could join up with one Cream man (Jack Bruce) and get away with a new power trio without comparisons to the former bands. Considering that one of the former (Mountain) was often (and not accurately) accused of being a shameless musical expropriator of the other (Cream), this union was either the most audacious act of 1972-74 or the most witless power trio deconstruction of its time. (Which is really saying something, considering a) they were excellent musicians individually, and b) launched right at the end of Grand Funk Railroad's days as a power trio and Beck, Bogert & Appice, period.)  West, Bruce & Laing produced two studio albums about which it is said most politely that they had a few shining moments and a lot more "in the name of God WHAT were they thinking?!" moments. But this live album, released practically at the moment the trio decided the jig was probably up sooner than they made it official, weighs heaviest on behalf of the witless deconstruction argument. For one thing, the kickoff cut, "Play With Fire," which probably had no business being converted to heavy metal, merely exposed the first album's "Love Is Worth The Blues" as the shameless ripoff of the former that it really was and WB&L as a very bad jam band. For another thing, the closing cut, something called "Powerhouse Sod," makes absolutely no sense even if you accept it as an excuse for Jack Bruce to take a bass solo whose virtues (there are a few) are bastinadoed in either onstage feedback or a careless mix. For a third thing, their covering and playing "Politician" this haphazardly either exposed West and Laing as patricidal (if you accept Mountain as having been nothing but a poor man's Cream) or Bruce as fratricidal (if you accept West, Bruce & Laing as his revenge upon his erstwhile bandmates).   All of which is a polite way of saying that lots of artists jump the proverbial shark but it takes perverse genius to jump it twice in one lifetime. If so, then West, Bruce & Laing were three of the most perverse geniuses rock yielded up in their time 
 The latest work of the Donald appears to be even more ghost written than the earlier three, demonstrated especially by its overuse of trite cliches and simple sentences.      The book is intended to be a means to express  views on America.  Covering almost every current issue from a very  pessimistic and critical viewpoint, Trump's analyses are strongly worded  and many void of the technical analysis that might prove them more  feasible.  Among his most potent claims is that getting even must be among  America's top goals just as it has been for him in his New York-based real  estate empire, demonstrating to this reader that he has no concept of  domestic or world affairs from his current job as the dictator of the Trump  Organization.  He incessently makes analogies to his billion dollar empire,  using it as his main medium of experience off of which to gain creedence  for other ideas.      Trump makes the begining of the book more a temple to  his father's memory than a political platform; by the end, however, he has  explained all of this critical thoughts and poorly butressed ideas and then  turns to attacking other people in the political spectrum.      At the very  least, the suffocating arrogance in this book is entertaining, and hence  probably worth your time if you are interested in Trump; it is not  recommended for the reader looking to gain an understanding of real  politics in the coming race 
 Sorry, I really wanted to like this book, since I've had a horrible experience writing code to handle audio on a PC (.wav files, audio sampling are much messier and less intuitive than need be). I AM an expert at DSP, having done it for over 25 years, with many hardware/firmware designs under my belt. I would not have slammed this book for one simple reason. The code examples are buggy and crash. Yikes, the fellow rails on Microsoft and the low quality of their compilers. His code does not work.  Sorry, I tried, I really did, but this book mostly text describing C++ classes which are on the CD. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands - just get a decent DSP book (Antoniou, oppenheim). Try Embree or Rorabaugh if you want books with DSP code in them. 
 Only John Kerry would allow a book like this to be printed about himself. John Kerry, the guy who tried to get out of going into the service on a deferrment and when that was denied pulled every lowdown, dirty trick he could come up with including applying for fake Purple Hearts so he could get out early, go home, run a phony anti-war campaign and then run for President.  The biggest insult of all was at the DNC back on July, 2004 when Kerry made that phony salute and  said "I'm John Kerry reporting for duty." 34 years earlier, Kerry was singing quite a different tune.  More like "I'm John Kerry trying to get out of the service on a deferrment." OR "I'm John Kerry trying to rack up phony Purple Hearts from self inflicted and minor scrapes so I can get the heck out of here and go home."  As if Kerry's military background was not a myth, we now all know that his supposed academic prowess was also a myth. While Kerry claimed to be an A student, in fact he was a D student. And that great speech that he made in 1971, supposedly prepared by Kerry in the wee morning hours with little preparation was in fact written for him by Robert Kennedy's speechwriter who had been coaching Kerry for months. But why be surprised? Has Kerry ever told us the truth about anything? Answer: No!  What happened to that big draft Kerry said was coming for sure in January 2005? And how about those reduced social security benefits for our seniors that republicans were supposed to  install according to inside information that Kerry had? Looks like the only draft is between Kerry's ears and just last week our seniors got the second biggest raise on their social security benefits since Bush I was president and raised benefits back in 1991.  So is Kerry misinformed or just a flat out liar? Check out the heroic military image that he created for himself. Does that tell you something? It's not rocket science.  
 Like so many others I found that the unit fails quickly. The original failed after 4 months. The replacement lasted only long enough to get beyond the warranty period 
 "Pain Free: A Revolutionary Method for Stopping Chronic Pain" by Pete Egoscue is a timeconsuming book to read, because of it's extremely boring and messy layout. As most american books, the information is carefully hidden behind far too many unnecessary words. That's ok, scrolling throug content is easy. But, since this is a book that covers a number of different health problems, you obviously do want to start reading the most relevant parts. That seems easy at first sight, since there is a content list. But even if the advices seems to make sense, you fall asleep before reaching any conclusions 
 I must admit, the setup that Aimee Bender constructs is fascinating: a girl in a claustrophobic town with a strangely beautiful glass hospital quits everything she adores until her routine is disrupted by the threat of her carefully sheltered world coming crashing down. However, the array of what start out as endearingly delicious quirks in Mona and the townspeople can't sustain themselves and become tiresome and forced by the end of the book. I simply could not find it within myself to care for the fates of any of the characters, whose actions and fates are all too trite and predictable.   The most frustrating thing about this book is glimpsing the potential that it failed to live up to. The book seems to awkwardly straddle the line between the grippingly realistic and the delightfully dreamlike. It would have been effective either way, but in the middle ground it seemed to take, An Invisible Sign of My Own was dull and bizarre.   One of the many plot weaknesses pertains to Mona's professed adour for math, which seems to supplemented by a knowledge nothing more complex than long division, despite a high school education. And the question of Mona's education leads to a entirely new debacle of how she is qualified to be any sort of teacher. This could very well be nitpicking, but Bender certainly doesn't seem to have done her research or have constructed a world convincingly magical enough for a reader to overlook illogical characterizations and plot twists. Mona herself comes off as irritating in her self-destructive self-pity rather than sympathetic. Her students are laughably (and not in a good way) precocious, wholly unrealistic without being interesting, and not at all endearing. Her love interest has little depth besides the plot device role he is assigned.   I could not help thinking of the whole plot as a uncompelling and unskilled rehashing of Animal Dreams by Barbara Kingsolver, which I'd have gladly reread rather than waste my time on this one. This whole book reeks of trying too hard. 
 The disc never played.  I was sent a replacement and that didn't play either 
 I really felt like I had to give some real insight to the people who are wondering whether they should watch this or not.You people writing the reviews are being waaay to generous to this movie.With how slow the movie started off you would think that the relationship between the two main characters would slowly and steadily build up-from a close friendship to a romantic relationship.  The guys don't even display a close friendship at the beginning, how are they gonna jump from "a guy you see during soccer practice and around your building" to "hot and heavy can't live without each other love"?It's not believable, and doesn't make for a good coming of age love story that this movie tries to be.The movie just hits you with an abrupt and sudden love scene, and from there they are suddenly in love and everything.In fact,there is no indication that either character is gay until that scene.I mean it would have been nice if the movie showed that one guy was into his neighbor or checked him out from time to time, or even was interested in guys in general but as I said before the movie doesn't display any type of interest the guys may have in each other or just guys in general until the love scene.  Don't get me wrong,I enjoyed the movie but the reviewers here aren't really giving an accurate representation of the movie and are HIGHLY overrating it.So if your in the mood for an ok gay teen movie by all means grab some popcorn sit back and enjoy.If you're looking for a masterpiece of cinema involving a gay relationship.Look somewhere else.This is not the movie 
 I understand there is a CD rom available which contains four volumes.  Has anyone used this 
 This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I enjoy all types of books and was looking for something light and entertaining as a break from heavier reading. The characters were totally unbelievable and shallow. The book was supposed to be a mix of sci-fi, suspense, and romance. The sci-fi part was fun, I'll admit. The suspense consisted of a mediocre crime plot, that was very graphic and disturbing in its description. The romance was nonexistent, unless you consider gratuitous sex scenes romantic. I know that Nora Roberts is known for the "steamy sex scenes" in her books, but these scenes were just stuck in there for the sake of their steaminess. They had no connection to the story whatsoever. The relationship between the protagonist and her husband was based solely on sex. What made this especially unbelievable was the fact that the main character was a survivor of abuse/incest. I'm no expert, but you'd think somebody with this type of background would have a few issues regarding sex/intimacy. I just thought the book was awful. Flat characters, silly predictable mystery. I left it on the train and feel sorry for the poor soul who picks it up 
 WTH?  This book is not for today's children.  I was horrified when I heard my sister in law reading this book to our children.  Spanking a child to get them to go to sleep at night?  YIKES!!!  
 One of the weaker entries in this hit-and-miss collection of New Wave singles, there is only one legitimate reason to own this, but it's a great reason:  Miracle Legion's "The Backyard."  Miracle Legion was a mid-80's college radio band which, like most of the college radio bands of the era, had that sort of post-Byrds, post-VU moody guitar jangle sound (i.e. R.E.M., Guadalcanal Diary, Reivers, Connells, Winter Hours, etc.).  Not a great band, but this one song -- by far their best -- is unforgettable.  An irresistable hook and some moving lyrics about growing out of boyhood make it one of those songs that, 15+ years later I can still sing from memory.  It bears about as much relationship to "New Wave" as, say, Husker Du, but, hey, what can you do.  The rest of this disc ranges from the sort of lame radio hits my generation was forced to live with at the time ("Voices Carry") to songs so bad that the mere thought of them still makes me wince ("Sunglasses at Night") 
 Im a big fan of Van Damne,but when i saw this movie i was really disapointed,the setting is dull,the story is dull and the guy he fights dull.I love Van Damnes other movie,but this is the only one that sux 
 Rairly have I read a book that I hate.  This is it!  Not only is it not funny but it is insulting to anyone who would sit in his dining room.  Tony's fan base just lost one 
 Of course I want to restore my mind and body!  The title alone made me want to read the book.  However most of the "miraculous" claims are supported by case studies from the doctors' clinic without a single footnote referencing any medical study.  Those who are skeptical of traditional Western medicine MIGHT enjoy reading this.  However, I found that this book promoted a lot of unsubstantiated claims to cure whatever ails you.  Too good to be true usually is 
 I found myself listening for 30 seconds to each song and then skipping it.  It's nothing new.  It's not that it's a bad CD, it's just not very good.  The songs are a little more fast paced and "pop-ish."  Overall, the CD is a departure from her typical style.  I felt kind of like I had put 50 cents in the soda machine for a Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper came out instead.  
 I like Meav's voice, and this CD is OK, if you like this kind of stuff. Think slow and somewhat depressing. I think Irish music has moved on so much since Bill Whehlan of Riverdance brought it into the modern times, and came up with this vocal sound, I guess to hark back to earlier times, which worked well because Riverdance has so much contrast in it and the choir songs only appear as relief to the other music. This is all a bit samey and dull. I would say saved by this lady's fine voice though 
 I reminded myself how lucky I was to have picked up Catch 22 first.  For if I didn't, I wouldn't have bothered to once reading Something Happened.  After getting lost in the wacky but wonderful story captured by Catch 22, I couldn't wait to dive into another work by Heller.  However, I found myself greatly disappointed this time around.  Although an interesting approach to writting the novel (the majority of it is simply an inner monologue dealing with the conflict of the main character), I just wasn't captured by it.  This may be due to its depressing nature.  Hint:  if you are trapped in a job you dislike with a family that you're not sure you belong in, don't read this book 
 This book was a bit of a disappointment, the text is informative, but the poor black and white images are really quite awful, and not every state capitol comes with an image, which is very odd in a book of this kind..the book feels like a ph.d disertation that was bound into a book, the physical book is quite second rate in quality, though the text is scholarly..could have, should have been better...seriously over priced 
 What happened?  Instead of continuing on with this fantastic series, the animators decided to use one whole DVD volume to recap all events up to this point.  Did someone in the production team realize that the series was going to be one DVD short in filling up the box set & they decided to remedy that?  Get Vol. 4 ONLY if you have short term memory issues or like looooooooong flashbacks.  Otherwise skip to Volume 5, you'll be glad you did 
 As a lecturer of e-commerce, I was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the Internet.  However, I am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored.  The author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the Internet has brought about.  The result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic.  I have nothing good to say about this book - money wasted 
 Someone recommended this book as the epitome of Augustine's philosophical work. It tries to replicate the style of Plato's dialogues, but its shallow logic, infantile writing, and general  poor scholarship as well as just plain lousy thought and development makes me feel like I got gypped buying it.If I could, I  would ask for a refund. Ugggg 
 MUST READ REVIEW: The Free Speech Haters (lefties) have deleted this review Twice.  Robert Reich, was Bill Clintons scariest appointment. His ideology, ergo his politics has been the of the most extreme left of any Bill Clinton's appointments. And some may argue that he some of the most extreme viewpoints of ANY high level appointment.   Robert Reich and his ilk were very happy when from the 1940's - 1980, radical lefties was setting the public agenda. All items were in play, courts were stacked and extremist's legislatures abdicated their law making ability to the courts. The executive branch simply turned a blind eye when radical lefties created a false impression that they were supporting the constitution when in fact they were and still are systematically undermining it. Left-Wing views that were on the fringe of the Democratic Party in the Sixties and Seventies are now center stage. These views, being forwarded by people like Reich, Dean, Kerry and Feingold, seem accepted as normal.   Left Wingers - control the media, academia, the sciences, think-tanks, and for most of the last century the executive, judicial and legislative branch. Republicans were demoralized, but the pendulum has finally begun to swing the other way. People are finally getting fed up with the extremist left who is arrogantly opposed to honest intellectual debate for they are fervently certain that they are correct in all matters. Their disdain for discourse and for anybody who challenges them is extant.  But the worst part is that radical lefties are uncivil to the extreme. They fill the public airwaves and bookstores with nastiness. Listen to Air America or watch a Michael Moore DVD. Read their editorials and you will find vicious vituperative attacks. Open a leftist political best-seller and you find more mean spirited screeds. Extremist lefties, RAD-COMS (Radical Communists) typically reduce political debate to nonsensical statements that seem to be making point but are nothing but vague and angry assertions, unsupported by facts.  But what we're now witnessing is something far more corrosive of civic life than normal political vitriol: It's viciousness directed toward anyone holding a view other than the prevailing elitist left-wing propaganda. Insults also calculated to belittle and ridicule entire groups or judged to be different are part of the divisive wedge that lefties like to play in hurting the cohesiveness of the nation.  The Conservative tradition values free speech and debate. No one should be deterred from speaking his or her mind for fear of offending some group. Lefties are opposed to this idea, the shouting down of Ann Coulter the attacks on Christians, etc, etc. Are all handiworks of the left. It is their mean-spirited trash talk that fills their protge's with this HATE and ANGER of anybody not like them.  I'm sorry Mr. Reich, I used to be one of these lefties, and I know the condescension with which I was taught to look at people on the right. The attacking of American Citizens rather than ideas, the smearing of whole segments of society for some perceived ills against our ideology. This is leftism at its base. Fear and Hate driven. No. Mr. Reich it will be a sad day when you and your type WIN America. People are waking up, they are realizing that the great Democratic Party of yesteryear has been hijacked by Radicals.   Your book speaks about morals but you never discuss where the morals come from. Conservative position comes from a bedrock of factual and historical facts. They are a clear-eyed view of where America is and where we need to go. Your left wing morals come from a modernist philosophy, blown by the wind and proven to be a disaster. You biggest moral imperative is to BLAME others but that is what happens when you are ideologically based rather than historically and fact based.  I could go on and on, but MR. Reich, I used to be on the left. But the divisiveness, hate, anger, name-calling, utter compliance with leadership, no dissention, no debate, and supreme arrogance drove me away. Once one is away and in the middle you look at the two competing political thoughts and it is scary, very scary to see what you once were.   Mr. Reich, I am not an automaton, and that is what you need to usher in your America. What the conservatives need, is open honest debate, free speech, and equal time. You have a fight on your hands, one that I am hoping for my children's sake that you lose. 
 Had the misfortune in listening to this terrible CD. My homes and the big dawg couldnt believe our shell likes....with a glok and a knock we bit the ring and did it big style G's...the good thing about this shiny disc is that it stops me mug delivering ring burns to me chippenfield man... 
 see through.  I don't wear it because it is so thin it is see thru.  maybe a darker color would of been better but this powder blue sucked 
 This book is written by an annoying, weak man.  The formal innovations are vaguley interesting, but in any case do not rescue the work from its primary deficit: you must sit there for several hours with the voice of a neurotic chatty little wimp who reminds one of a certain kind of homosexual man streaming through your mind, mostly in the form of digressions and non-sequitors.  This is neither entertaining nor enlightening, and since it's the product of design it is actually a little infuriating.  I too listen with good faith to the academic hierarchy present and past for recommendations, and I had in my version the hitherto utterly reliable Frank Kermode as Introducer; but damn, this book - its characters, its plots, its language, its taxing convolusions - is just annoying.  Its only virtue is that reading it might raise awareness that vaguely condescending moralistic little works like this about unheroic, petty, neurotic, sordid, idle, superficially cosmopolitan people are a mistake to begin with, and - since we all have only 70 or 80 years on earth and aren't all compulsive aesthetes - time would be better spent elsewhere.  There is nothing of the hard Sophoclean light here 
 Wanted more scientific information.  How Cayenne works?  How to mix it?  Dosages and recipes  for its use.  Was totally disappointed!! 
 I only read true crime books and will never read another one written by Mr. Long.  This was truly the most poorly written book I have ever read.  Unfortunately I bought this book in hard cover so I really got taken.  It was obviously thrown together for the author to make a quick buck which is a real shame to the families involved who deserve more 
 How adorable this film is.  John Lithgow is brilliant.  I love the scene when he is throwing all the McDonalds hamburgers at the beast.  Catch of the day!  This movie means something to John.  His name is John "Lith", his name is John "Lith."  I wonder if Johns little babie son ever acted again hahaha.  
 Finkelstein's book is nothing more than a character attack on Alan Dershowitz's "The Case for Israel." And it is only that. Furthermore it is poorly written, to say the least it is barely legible, sentences are endless, quotes are everywhere, syntax is pretentious, it seems that the author wants to  prove how cultivated and smart he is. But the try is vain, boring and not conclusive. As for the goal of dicrediting Dershowitz's book it is globally attained but the whole reading is so painful that in the end a small lingering doubt subsists. I do not recommand this book.  
 This game was put together with a nice concept, be a CTU agent and help Jack Bauer stop the terrorist attack.  Also, I liked the fact that there is a mole and that someone right next to you could destroy the whole game.  However, the interactive games and such used to get more clues are not made well.  Though you try to do what it tells you to do, it doesn't seem to work.  Since these interactive parts are so simple, yet not made in a way that one can control what is going on, you waste your time trying to do them and you never get to the end.  I had three college students and two adults try it adn no one could seem to get it to work correctly.  So, if some bugs were worked out, this game could be a much bigger success 
 I have read Schoenfeld's book in an attempt to understand where and how anti-semitism sits within today's society, as part of some research work I have been conducting.  To be honest the book has disapointed me greatly. I have found the book full of half truths, missing counter points, which I feel completely insults the intelligence of the reader, assuming they have never performed any winder reading on the subject of the position of judaism and israel within today's world. In fact Schoenfeld takes the un forgivable position of actually wanting us to confuse anti-semitism with feeling against israel's political position.  For example, on page  29 Sheonfeld tells us, without any references that Palestine was nothing but sand and swap before the arrival of israel (already he is asking to consider anti-semitism along side the issue of palestine and israel). In these remarks he shows either his lack of research, or his desire to lie about the history of Palestine. We just need to look at the poster of franz krauz or look at books such as "Before their diaspora: A photographic history of the Palestinians, 1876-1948 (Unknown Binding) by Walid Khalidi" to see this is just not true.  Nowhere in the book does Sheonfeld address the anger people have towards the way israel has acted to it's neighbours, or the propoganda machine that tries to deny and rebrand the 1996 massacre at the Qana UN post. In fact it seems he doesnt care about exaplaining the reason why people may be ant-semtic/anti israeli, he just wants to cite and fabricate incidents of it.  This book seems to address more the rise of anti-arabism, and seeks to promote it. I would recommend this book only to people wishing to journey into the worrying fantasies of a very racist individual 
 I found this book to be weird quiet frankly. Chapter 2 goes off the deep-end of designing efficient queries before you've even built a report yet. That material should have been put at the end of the book. Creating a report with the report wizard is covered in Chapter 4 but probably would have been best if it was before Chapter 3 which covers creating a report manually. I didn't find anything "Pro", as the name implies, or advanced with the book. It's a broad introductory text only. Also, it only covers using the ReportViewer control for Win Forms and not the one Web Forms. The two are similar enough but coverage of both would have been better. 
 I usually like this author and have read almost all of her books; however, after reading this book I definitely felt cheated. The book is well written, and the characters were pleasing, although I thought Faith was not being true to her character as presented in earlier books in the series. Agatha Christie used to say that a mystery writer must play fair with his or her readers. All of the evidence and the clues must be laid out for the reader to try to solve the mystery before the author resolves it. To do otherwise is to cheat the reader who has invested time in reading the book. No reader had a chance to solve this mystery unless by sheer guessing. Once the murderer is revealed, the reader realizes that it really could have been anyone, and all the clues have meant nothing. I was very disappointed, so I will think twice about getting any of her new books 
 The writing is equally beautiful to Ahab's Wife, but the story seems to be begging for a plot triangle.  It's hard to understand why Naslund would have let this be published in such raw form. Characters make brief appearances and then disappear for pages.  Chapters read almost like separate vingettes.  Makes me wonder if publishers were pushing Naslud to meet a printing date: It is so peculiarly inferior to her other story, and odd when, clearly, her writing standards are so very, very high 
 I thought the beginning of this book was GREAT! So funny and smart. And then it's not. One specific complaint is she has one of the characters go on a page-long tirade against Michael Milken and Reagan and other evil people from the 80s. It seems like she wanted to say these things and instead of cleverly weaving her opinions into her story through her character, she just has them say it, even when it hurts the flow of the story. It seemed lazy. And that was a problem throughout the book for me; good idea but poorly executed 
 WOW!I got this book back in 2003 and I dont recommend this book for begginers its very complex to understand I would rather get  Beginning Tagalog: A Course for Speakers of English     by J. D. Bowen   
 I'm not really a Martha "fan" as such, but I do enjoy her magazine "Martha Stewart Living" and have learned much from her.  I was hoping to learn about her life, her experiences as a model, caterer, etc. and how she came to make this huge business grow as it has.  Instead, this book was a diatribe against her. Nobody is ALL bad.  And, in spite of the author's comments about Martha and her relationships with her parents, it IS possible to learn to love music, art, and nature from parents who are also abusive and nasty.  I suggest you save your money and not even buy the thing.  Amazon.com has many other books that are much more worth your time and money than this one 
 I was more upset with this book than anyother. I've loved every book in the series , but this one was more dissapointing.  I pictured EVERYTHING the sasme as in the movie though... thatrs just telling you how welll it's written and described. But, it was more about the Triwizard tournament the whole entire time. Still, i am addicted to the series . Either way you should read the story just to understand whats going on. I just wish it would have been more exciting and less predictable 
 How can you call sweeping crescendoes pretentious?  I might be wrong but Beethoven employed sweeping crescendoes to his emperor concerto and I really dont think Beethoven was very pretentious considering he died broke and unrevered.  Back to the point at hand, this album is dull and uneventful.  It aims to be pastoral but never evokes anything from its sound beyond tepid instrumentation and monotonous, atonal undercurrents.  Its slow to develop and is a far reach from average.  Remember, talent does not always equate with creativity and innovation.  Try Eluvium or By the End of Tonight instead, you will be much more pleased with the results 
 I must admit, I was more disappointed in this book than any other I can remember reading.  While Cole is working hard at the arguably noble pursuit of writing about math and science for the layperson, she does so at the cost of any sort of actual relevance to the world of science.  By absolutely eliminating ALL mathematical rigor and substance from her writing, Cole leaves the reader with nothing but her own third-rate analogies, sappy philosophical bumblings, and less than shimmering prose.  I will admit that I was unable to make my way to the end of the book due to my utter frustration with Cole's destruction of the beautiful world of logic and numbers, and so it is concievable that the book becomes better near the end.  Unfortunately, anyone interested in learning or thinking about mathematics will likely be quickly repeled long before.  List this book with Gary Zukav's "Dancing Wu Li Masters" as abominations of the world of pop-science 
 This is my 3rd Nora Roberts book.  I've read the first 2 in the 3 Sisters trilogy, and decided to read Chesapeake Blue while I (very eagerly) await Face the Fire in the mail.  Perhaps I was spoiled by the characters, the conflicts, and the love stories in 3 Sisters, but this book pales in comparison.  The Quinns are meant to be a family whose perfect and deep love for one another is tempered by a course and affectionate manly banter.  Sort of like 7th Heaven meets a beer commercial.  Anyways, Seth is supremely talented, handsome, kind, and sizzling in the sack; in other words, a stock Nora Roberts male character.  Alas, he is also entirely thick-headed, vain, and has the mental processes of a mule when faced with his "problem", which he only exacerbates over the course of the book.  So he has a floozy of a mother who blackmails him into huge sums of money on pain of, what, her leaking a story to the press which, once she removes all the parts that reflect poorly on her, would be about 2 sentences long?  And, he can't tell his troubles to his family that he loves "so" much?  I mean, I wouldn't tell Cam anything myself, because he seems to deal with every moment of emotion by pitching someone off the end of a pier in a fit of manly love.  But Anna and the rest seem like good candidates for a chat.  Finally, Drusilla.  First, the name makes her sound like a villian in a Disney movie.  Second, she is flat as a pancake, and I would pay for problems like hers.  At the very end, she exhibits a spark of life, and sort of morphs into another stock Nora Roberts stock character: the sassy, smart, no-nonsense, gal who steps up to defend her man.  Which, I like that character.  In my limited experience, Nora Roberts writes female friendships and falling in love brilliantly, but her male friendships need a few less put-downs and jaws clenched to supress brotherly emotion.  And, I agree with the other reviewers who wanted Seth to end up with Aubrey.  
 I found this book to repetitive.  It just keeps going on and on, on how bad Web feels about the death of his 7 team mates.  Also, it has harsh racist descriptions on some characters that don't really add to the story at all.  It just adds to the stereotype of how life is in Annacostia, Washington DC.  One such description is that of the black grandmother of the missing kid.  She is described as a big black woman about the sides of a small car with big breast and lives in a house full of rat excrements. I don't recommend this book at all, but if you are a narrow minded white male, who thinks that he is at the top of the hill looking down on the rest, this book is for you 
 As a Prince freak let me start off by saying that i love pretty much everything he's ever put out...genius! this is for the casual fans out there...i don't want to see anyone get "juked". THIS IS NOT A CD OF REMIXES OF THE ORIGINAL SONGS/BEATS. it's more like a dance remix you would hear at one of those annoying "glow stick clubs"...i love Princes' music but this one is going to have to grow on me...I AM A HUGE FAN...IF YOU ARE NOT A HUGE FAN...U WANT 2 PASS ON THIS ONE...!...ONLY FOR U IF YOU'RE A COLLECTOR... 
 the authors  argument move away vague, impressionistic and general arguments about the supposed powerless state which globalization is meant to have induced. However,  the concept of state capacity in his book is so vague that will weaken his argument. On the other hand, the states that the author select to support his conclusion cannot represent all the states in world. With the development of globalization, the capacity of multinational corporations is obviously more and more stronger than small states in the world. In Asian financial crisis, some individuals can destroy a nations economy and make is backward about 20 years. From this point, the state become more and more powerless instead of what Weiss think in this book 
 I picture Chomsky in a sunless, cluttered apartment full of scattered yellowing newspapers, surrounded only by walls of his own clippings.  Yes, his recent writing is the result of too little exposure to the real world.  Not everything is a conspiracy theory, and not all facts or events paint an overall trend or picture.  The world is too random for all similar events to be related.  But when you surround yourself with your own highlighted facts of history and dwell on them day after day trying to sell your thoughts, the result is going to be nonsense.  I respect Chomsky's right to say what he thinks, and as a liberal I often find myself agreeing with him (but for vastly different reasons).  What I do not respect are those readers who take his words as gospel, when they are simply the rantings and ravings of someone who has lost touch with how the real world works.  Throwing together a bunch of events across history does not make for a lucid view of how we got to the present and what to do about the current problems.  To me, he is no different from those who have assembled enough disjointed evidence as to convince themselves that 9-11 was perpetrated by the U.S. government.  I am not excusing the actions of any U.S. administration, past or present.  All that I am saying is that the actions of the U.S. 10, 20, even 50 years ago bear little relation to each other or to the present.  And where they do, it is not worth arguing that it is the result of some long-term phenomenon of evil U.S. power.  The world is comprised of random actors interacting constantly, and to say that the U.S. should be able to control or foresee the future is nonsense.  All the U.S. can do is preserve and fight for its own interests, which is all that any state does.   Chomsky's anti-capitalist, anti-globalization, anti-aggression stance is based on an ill-conceived vision of a utopia, one far distanced from the real world in which we live.  In Chomsky's world, it is possible for everyone to get along in a state of equality, and no interests ever conflict.  In the real world, interests do conflict, and equality is impossible without sacrificing absolute welfare.  While I often disagree with the chosen approach to resolving those conflicts, I at least accept that the conflict needed resolution and that doing so presented difficulties beyond the ability of a human mind to conceive.  Sometimes we get it right, sometimes we don't.  But it is only a fool who would take all of the failures and weave together a story of evil intentions.  That Chavez would brandish Chomsky's book while ranting and raving about good and evil on the floor of the U.N. shows just what company Chomsky's theories find for him.  Chomsky's theories could use less lofty language and more grounding on planet earth.  It is no wonder that half of the evidence provided cannot be backed up with verifiable sources 
 Parts of this story are entertaining, but parts of it tended to bother me.  What really bothered me was that Harriet did some mean things to people in her class, but her nanny never told her that what she did was wrong.  She seemed to tell Harriet to pretend to be sorry, even if she wasn't sorry.  That attitude is what really bothers me about the movie and the book 
 DO NOT BUY THIS LAMINATOR. The first one I bought broke and the replacement broke the first time I used it. Waste of time and money 
 This more like a high school paper gone wrong than a serious book for adults. Typical of the nonsense circulating around lately regarding Hydrogen as an alternate fuel.  Poor science, terrible reading......  Does not factually deal with the real issues such as cost of distribution, storage and gasification.  An insult to any reader with a brain 
 I read this book on the advice of a review in the science journal, Nature.  But I must say that it is, at best, a monotonous, plot-free read. There is virtually no history of science here, no gripping detective story or expose, and it is certainly far from engrossing.  There are no personalities involved, little sensitivity to history, and so nothing to grab one's interest.  Except for the first chapter (concerning a law suit over a stolen copy), the rest of the book pretty much consists of a dry, bare-boned littany of the author's survey of extant copies of Copernicus' great treatise, De Revolutionibus.  There are a few entertaining comments about Edward Rosen (another historian of science fascinated with Copernican minutiae )that smack of professional rivalry (or perhaps a generational shift in science history studies?).  The rest of the chapters consist of lifeless prose on boring topics, with an rambling commentary on the then-current Cold War.  The book is tedious because it fails to breathe life into its topic.  But then, how could it? For it is little more than a glorified list of copies.  It took nearly all my gumption (not to mention a looong layover in Chicago O'Hare Airport) to even finish the book.  Stick to the highlights (Chapters 1-3, Plate 1a, and the photo on p. 198 of Galileo's horoscope for Cosmo d'Medici) and you'll have about all there is worth having here. 
 I'd love to review this book, however, it was ordered through Amazon on Feb 13, 2006 and as of this date, March 16, 2006, I have yet to receive it.  What's the problem Amazon 
 My partner gave me this for my birthday last week, and since I can't tell him what I thought about it, here goes: It [stunk]! I mean, if you've been spoiled all your life and never had to do anything (like clean up your place in a hurry) the book may be for you. But overall, I found the author's tone to be irritating, and her directions incomplete (i.e. the wine ordering section simply tells you to order in the middle of the price sheet --- that's it?). To be sure, there were a few chapters that were intriguing: starting various fires, parallel parking; but the overwhelming majority of the book is filled with Adcock's yuppie instructions on what SHE thinks everyone should know 
 First off, I usually just stick to rating & critiquing movies. But, every time I see an ad on this website for this Time/Warner (or whatever the hell the company calls itself this week) rag-mag I start to see red.  "Entertainment Weekly", which was once an interesting weekly deluge from the ho-hum of everyday life, has become just another rag crapped out weekly to stand on newstands week after week prostituting for your hard earned cash.     Back in the summer of 89, "EW" was released and after I read a few issues, I decided to subscribe. I was instantly hooked (the new issue would arrive in my mailbox the Saturday before it would hit regular newstands) & I liked getting the latest news and reviews from movies, music, T.V., and video (that was later added in the mid-90's).   The problem with the magazine started in the late 90's. I started to notice that "EW" would cover a big movie or event that hadn't yet been released and then the following week bash the hell out of it, or try to get some piece of dirt on it in order to generate more sales.   I also hate the damn lists that "EW" comes up with. The latest entitled "The top 100 most memorable movie lines" was a joke. These lists have always annoyed me, because I feel they are truly not thought out and therefore not thought provoking.  The other & most important thing I noticed was the absolute lack of an honest review.   Case in point, a few weeks ago I picked up the latest issue in which the movie "Catwoman" had been reviewed (I wasn't to sure if it was Gleiberman or Shwarzbaum that critiqued it).   I first logged onto "Rotten Tomatoes.com" to see what percentile "Catwoman" recieved from the nation's critics.  Out of roughly 115 reviews "Catwoman" only got 10% of the good reviews while the rest trashed it (a film needs, at least, to get a grade of 60 - 65% in order to place it as a fresh or good movie). That makes "Catwoman" the worst reviewed film, so far, for 2004. Yet, "EW" gave the film a B. What erkes me even more is that "Catwoman" is released by "Warner Bros.", the same company that owns the rights to the "Harry Potter" films, "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, & yes, the "WB" owns "Entertainment Weekly".   Is "Warner Bros." trying to bribe or threaten its own critics at one of its most popular & lucrative magazine's?         I'm not the only who has seen this developement. People have written in saying that there is favoritism among "Warner" products that are reviewed in the magazine. "EW", of course, hotly denies anything of the kind thumping there chests and standing behind there reviews, possibly in fear of being fired (they will deny that also).  My only question to the reviewers at "Entertainment Weekly" is, "Whats it like to stand in your own pile of bull**it?"   Or better yet, "What's it like to stand on a Democratic Podium?" 
 "Compassionate Conservatism" by Olasky is a manifesto for a "bread-and-circus" ideology that grows more transparent by the day. Not surprisingly, it is heavy on rhetoric and light on substance.  The alliterative title is catchy, but "Bible-and-Business Conservatism" is more descriptive 
 This book is practically useless.  The instructions it gives are so vauge and obvious it must think you are an idiot.  I wont say its completely useless,  with 1001 entries I'm sure you can find a couple of pieces of usefull information in the massively thick and heavy book. 98% of its entries are uninformative, and vauge descriptions of what you either already knew or could easily figure out. I wouldn't wish this book on my worst enemy.  Oh wait my in laws bought it for me for my birthday, Makes sense huh? ;)  Seriously though, I have to wonder if the people who rated this book highly really use it? And if so what do they use it for? I'd like to know. 
 The review by Bovey is spot-on!  These games have gotten more boring as they go.  The majority of this game is spent looking for the same shells over and over to make the same necklaces over and over....how much is enough?  There was no real sense of scariness or danger... just boredom! And the game was so short... suddenly it ended!  I am so disappointed in what these games have become.  I loved The Final Scene, I even liked Blackmoor Manor even though I could never have finished it without consulting a walkthrough.  This game was just lame. I don't recommend paying full price for it 
 I bought this book last year and read the first few chapters before getting bored. In other words, I had no desire to continue reading it. Much of what he says aren't his ideas, he shamelessly borrows from the great thinkers, so it's probably better just to buy THEIR books instead of one from an author who simply quotes others. He apparently writes book after book regurgitating material he's done before or from others to get rich.   Dyer DEFINITELY has an intention, and it's to get rich by selling his mediocre books. 
 Many, many years ago I read Catherine Coulter, read her avidly, eagerly looking forward to her next book. Well, this is the first one of hers that I have read in about a decade and WHAT HAPPENED? Three times I set this book down in disgust, only to come back to it out of sheer stubbornness.  There is not enough room to write about just how bad this book was. From generally poor writing (Mary Lisa said, Jack said, Lou Lou said... until you want to yell "I KNOW who is involved in this conversation!), silly plot, unneccessary side stepping.   WHO CARES that the hero digs a chunky chip into guacamole? OH WOW, we get to know the different flavors of potato chips being devoured by three woman while they talk about the big case. WHEN have any of us heard of investigating cops asking "why is she wearing those pajamas when you are wearing those"? YEAH sure, an agent involved in a case is going to let endangered person call the shots in even the tiniest part of the investigation. And the names! Mary Lisa? Lou Lou? Puker? Gimme a freaking break! Aaaarrrrggggg!!!   Ms. Coulter, I used to love your books. PLEASE get back to what you used to do so well. If you cannot write the "FBI style" books that are so popular now, then don't. STOP feeding the bestseller beast anything less than your best. Cease. Desist. Please go back to what you are great at 
  This book was required reading for one of my education classes and copious amounts of coffee were required to get through it. The author's intent was noble but the end result reads like a first draft,(a very long first draft)a sort of stream of consciousness, in an effort, I would assume, to be authentic and true to the youths' words. I had to keep rereading to figure out who was who. I found the writing very amateur and the profound realizations almost embarassing. These few kids are not an accurate crosssection of our youth society (as other reviewers have pointed out.) At least two of the kids has been physically abused and another has an acute psychiatric condition. I think it is irresponsible to call this journalism, and to present it as such. I probably would have been better reading as a novel.  Also--Did anyone else wonder about the incredibly well-adjusted Chris with the perfect parents and the many details of his life only a mother would know? 
 If you work for a large corporation which has millions of $ to spend on DW projects, maybe you should look at this book and even consider some of the ideas that it contains. But if you need to develop a data warehouse using limited resources and within a certain timeframe, your time will better used reading other books, because following the Inmon approach will lead you to an unnecessary complicated and expensive design. I found that the arguments used by Inmon to demonstrate the limits of the dimensional approach are not convincing at all. For example, at page 142 he says "Because there is a different data structure for each data mart, making any data mart into a data warehouse doesn't make sense." Having personally implemented several data warehouses using the "conformed dimensions" approach, I can guarantee that it worked and produced a very elegant and clean data model. 
 If you think that two girly retards acting dumb and getting fired everyday is funny hit "no".  If you think that this sucks hit "yes".  Thus says The Metal Master 92.. 
 This book did not keep my son's interest at all. He is 2. I was quite disappointed at this book. 
 This product is basically a way for the Atlas company to keep the Atlas name in the minds of people.  The Atlas course was written many years ago, but it is still very useful for people interested in natural body sculpting.  It is an amazing course regardless of when it was written.  The best part of this work is the wall poster that is included.  But it is still very basic.  Save your money on this and get the original Atlas course[... 
 _Dog Love_ reads like a dry PhD dissertation; as a former college instructor, I can appreciate the research involved in this text.  That said, the chapter entitled "Sex and the Single Dog" contained a  litany of references to bestiality in literature.  My concerns are for  readers, especially the young and their guardians, who expect to read  stories of inspiration but are instead inducted into a perverse  exploitation of dogs.  Kudos to Amazon.com for warning readers through  reviews such as this [unlike one of your competitors who has now lost my  business] 
 I was deeply disappointed for buying stuff from Memorex. Not a single DVD was usable in the pack. Never gonna buy anything from Memorex! 
 I do not understand why people are so waxing poetic about this album.  There is nothing new or 'fresh' or 'original' or at all thought-brovoking about this music, unless you happen to be easily pleased by any simple pseudo-pop sound.  I have only recently discovered the world of no-wave music, but I was introduced to it through artists like Arab on Radar and Scissor Girls.  So when I tried out my first Sonic Youth album, I was way more than dissapointed.  I don't know how this can be classified as no-wave anymore.  Sure they show some trait in a few wailing off key guitars and an occasioinal shouted spoken word, but they are all only half-assed and are muddled up in cliche indie pop love tunes that have only been done in every other band.  The most notable anything is the catchy medlody of Becuz.  It is really catchy, yet it managaes to be unique enough to rise above the typical "catchy tunes" ethos.  Xiu Xiu's "Knife Play" would probably be considered more of a pop/no-wave sound that does not sacrifice the aggressive anti-music drive of no-wave... AND still retain the emotional pop sinsibility.  I don't know.. All I know is that Wasing Machine is a letdown.  It does not reach me artistically by a long shot.  Emotionally, I can think of am million other artists (Mars Volta, Emerson Lake & Palmer, cLOUDDEAD, Ulver, Edvard Greig!) who can put me on a much higher cloud and help me get in touch with the human condition.  This however is far to cheezy, and I don't know, but I think it reeks of that shallow indie fashion clique.. 
 I'm no prude, but some of the actions described in this book go beyond crude to disgusting and repulsive.  Who needs to waste time reading about such behavior?  Don't we see enough of the depths of human depravity on the news? I would have expected a huge protest from families of middle class black people, who are portayed with every variety of perversion and obsession...the only ones who are shown as decent human beings are strange in their own ways, nonformist to the extreme. 
 The thrilling mystery story that we have come to expect from Anne Perry takes a new twist in this book. Perhaps inspired by true events in 1898 Vienna, where three persons died of plague, this is not so much a story of crime but of survival. Unfortunately other qualitites that we have also come to expect from this author, like sound research and verisimilitude, are absent here. There are glaring gaps in logic, occasional sloppy proofing, and, at least as I understand the nature of plague, serious factual mistakes. This is too bad, since the story could have been a fitting installment in the quest of the protagonists for social improvement in mid-19th century London. As it is, the book gave me the impression that perhaps Anne Perry has currently too many irons in the fire and no longer spends enough time on the kind of careful work that characterized her earlier novels 
 The book is full of useless fillings. Finding your colors is limited to few hair and eye color combinations. It also depends on you doing a test with different colored fabrics & determing how the color reflect against your skin. After reading the book, I still don't know what my colors are. Besides, with so many different color hues on the market, how can one tell if what you're buying is an ever green or true green for example, confusing. The lack of pictures showing the types of collars they're recommending for different body types (e.g Mandarin collar,cowl,bardot...)...is annoying,to say the least. Questionnaires are poorly structured, & the section on makeup, underwear & accessories is trivial. Save your money (i'm glad the book I read was a borrow from the library) and save your time. Pass 
 There is a lot of information here, about one of baseball's greatest  ballplayers, but far too much of it is slanted toward the negative.  Reminiscent of modern attacks on Ty Cobb and others of baseball's halcyon days, this is one of those politically correct, revisionist treatments that juxtaposes modern mores on another time and another place. A good treatment of Tris Speaker would add to an appreciation of the national pastime. This book is not that treatment 
 Blessed are the peacemakers Love thy enemies The meek will inherit the earth. It will be easier for a camel to walk thorough the eye of a needle than a rich man to get into heaven. These arent direct quotes but are some ideas expressed by Jesus Christ, the same man this hypocrite claims to follow. To say that George Bush is a faithful man is so blatantly stupid. Its sad that people in this country can be subdued into believing that this man is a Christian. It seems to me that people who claim themselves to be religious have chosen nationalism over religion. If it makes you feel better to vote for someone who has murdered thousands and thousands of people by saying he is a christian, fine, answer to it when you die 
 I did not like the layout of this book at all--particularly annoying was the fact that you had to turn pages between the "before" and "after" room drawing layouts-they should have been either put on facing pages or on the same page.  Also, her first book worked well because it seemed to focus more on average people with decorating issues, this book was definitely skewed towards people with scads of money like the people with the view home in Laguna Beach, who practically had walls made of windows--hardly what the average person is looking to showcase!  I would borrow this one from the library, but buy her first book 
 I'm a new AutoCAD user.  This was one of two books I purchased.  This wasn't a good to use to get started learning AutoCAD but may come of use in the future.  
 The Good Two videos for "Teen Angst" are featured on this release. The first is an unreleased acoustic version, while the second is the original. A live performance video from MTV's 120 Minutes for "Get Off This" follows. Two versions for Cracker's most notable song "Low" are included as well. "Euro-Trash Girl" and "I Hate my Generation" are the other two videos. After Cracker's videos play out, you are treated to a live performance in it's entirety that was recorded in 1993 at Denver's Ogden Theatre.  The Bad To call this DVD a `best of' is a real stretch. What you're really getting is a nine song live show and few videos. What I can't fathom the most is...is there really a demand for this?! Most people will recognize three songs at best. When alternative/grunge broke in the early nineties there were innovators that lead the way like Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Soundgarden. There were also a bunch of bands who jumped on the bandwagon, but weren't equally a good. Cracker is one of those bands.  The Verdict It doesn't matter whether you grab the CD or the DVD, Get On With It: The Best of Cracker is a perfect example of how boring and mundane Cracker really were 
 ... I read [this] book prior to a week-long trip to Venice.  This book quite simply accomplished none of its objectives.  It is a poor "guidebook" and is poorly written and uninteresting in terms of a travelogue--to quote Simon: "Abysmal with a capital A."  The history and art of Venice are covered better in books from those genres.  The only upside is that it is short.  Yuck, what a waste of time.  My advice is:  get a novel about Venice if you like novels, a guidebook if you want that, an art book, or a history book.  At least you'll get something out of those--this one tries all of these and fails.  Actually, in terms of a travelogue, "Vendela in Venice" far surpassess any other Venice book I have seen.  Although I originally bought it because it is considered a children's book, it is not dumbed down at all and adults will enjoy it... 
 I was forced to read this drivel for a graduate photo program. God I wanted to kill myself and quit photography by the time I was finished with it. If you want to read great photographic essays try Bill Jay's work. Amazing, insightful and filled with a sense of humor 
 She never has an appropriate ending. Can she go back to school and learn the "ABC's" of how to end a novel?  This was just lame.  You couldnt really get into the characters and I felt nothing for them.   Becasue of this book I will not read her novels again 
 if we could take off whenever we wanted and have access to funds to support our trip?  Most people wish to be:  Financially secure Have a loving spouse Beautiful (but too large) home Loving Daughter  What is she complaining about?  Nan can afford therapy. Get some and move on. 
 I knew I was in trouble with FOUR BROTHERS when I saw that Josh Howard (of SPORTS NIGHT fame) was scowling hard, trying to be a tough Detroit cop. Not believable for a nanosecond. And then it got worse when Marky Mark said, "Why don't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee?"  The rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichï¿½d rhythm. Almost every scene in this thing is a howler. And watching it, I remembered I hadn't forgiven Tyrese Gibson for the travesty that was 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS. Still, Tyrese is better than Garrett Hedlund, who looks like he's a refugee from THE OUTSIDERS.  But the movie's not a total wash; after all, it's got a GREAT soundtrack 
 I read this book, it was okay but the story flashed back to much, and I couldn't folow all of it but I read all of it anyway. I wouldn't recommend it. TOO SLOW MOVING, and BORING because of the flashbacks. The movie was the same way 
 This may be a great story, but the illustrations are akin to something out of a public health brochure.  It was a big disappointment 
 I'm a Tami Hoag fan, but this book was weak at best.  The plot was predictable; the characters stereotypical and 2 dimensional.  The reparte between the characters was overly witty and contrived.  Hoag is definitely capable of a more intricate plot and better writing.  
 Virtually all the ideas in this book are already practiced by most successful company's - they just describe them differently. There is nothing new. My other problem is how the author uses the book to promote a personal agenda. And talk about ego - his family, friends, and other business initiatives are promoted in the book. And most of the pictures have nothing to do with the title of the book or how it is positioned. If it's going to be an autobiography, TELL US SO. I should have known something was up when most of the reviewers were either politicians, friends or other people that have never ran successful businesses.   And speaking of business success, a share of stock in Jan 1994 (around the time Mr. Bakke became CEO) was trading at an adjusted $5 per share. Seven years later in December of 2002 (the year Mr. Bakke retired), the share price was $3.02. No thanks - I'll put my money in GE. Need I say more.   Look, I'm sure this guy is a great person and he is obviously super smart but I do not think this is a credible book. 
 The disapearance of USSR was terrible for Tom Clancy - it deprived Jack Ryan of real evil enemy so the author had to invent some new ones. After going through the Japanese and the Arabs he couldn't find nothing better than... vegetarians!!!  This whole book is a pathetic joke! Good Lord, when I think that once I actually DIDN't sleep for 48 hours because I couldn't stop reading "The Cardinal of Kremlin". Mr Clancy Sir  you were so great in the past - what happened? Now every next of your books is simply worse than the previous... And just to be clear - politically I am as much on the right (Republican) side than you, so this is not just the hostility of a political enemy but a sincere disappointment of a former fan Could you try to write something good once more? In memory of good old times? Please? 
 It's obscene to think you thought about reaching for your wallet to purchase this dvd.  This movie was very boring with its juvenile sex humor.  The director didn't even want to be named and the obviously made-up "Woody" Allen is given credit.  "Woody".  Ha! Ha!  That's rich. 
 I thumbed through this book in a local store, because the subject matter was of interest to me.  I was disappointed, but not surprised, by the poor quality, both in content and reproduction quality.  Unfortunately, this is typical of all the books in the Amherst Media photgraphy series 
 I like the character Micah.  I'm really bored with hearing about his, err, outstandingly large physical attributes.  In fact, I'd love for a character in one of Ms Hamilton's books to be average.  
 Well, my gosh, what a waste of time, U2 really should give it up and just go away and stop plagaraising everything with their marketing money making schemes (u2.com members, ticket prices.)  I won't go on and on about U2 being sold out, where it all went wrong, all I know is that U2 are getting by and panicked when Popmart was'nt well recieved, mainly because they were silly enough not to finish the record and get a tour booked ahead of it.  So the DVD... boring whats wrong with it  1. Crap editing, as others have mentioned 2. The band look bored 3. Bono looks like fat Elvis 4. Bono can't sing anymore 5. Was it really neccesary to have a camera in Bonos sunglasses? 6. Extras??? Two thirty second clips of Zoo TV and Popmart both of which they have'nt released on DVD and both of which are impossible to buy as VHS is extinct now. (Despite being their best live shows supporting two of their greatest albums.) 7. The credits are listed as a extra feature. 8. Plagued by material from the overated overhyped and boring album "All that you can't leave behind".   ....has its moments, but at the end of the day its the performance that counts, not the lighting effects and the fancy but pointless and annoying unwatchable!! camera editing.  If you want to have a collection of U2 live before they turned crap and commercialised add "Rattle and Hum" "Actung Baby" "Zoo TV live from Sydney" and "Popmart" VHS's to your collection, thats if you can dig them up from anywhere.  U2 have yet to release a decent DVD, dissapoiting for the biggest band on earth 
 ``People  say again and again that philosophy  doesn't really progress, that we  arestill occupied  with the same philosophical problems as were  theGreeks.But  the people who say this don't understand why ishas to be  so. It is becauseour language has remained the same and  keeps seducing us  into asking the same questions.  As longas there continues to be a verb  'to be' that  looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to eat' and  'to  drink', as long as we stillhavethe adjectives  'identical', 'true',  'false', 'possible',as  long as we continueto talk of a river of time, of  an expanseof  space, etc., etc., people will keepstumbling over the  samepuzzling  difficulties and find themselves staring atsomethingwhich  no explanation seems capable of clearing up.And what'smore,this  satisfies  a longing for the transcendent, because, insofar  as peoplethinkthey can  see `the limits of human  understanding', theybelieve of course thatthey  can see  beyond these.``   ''Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of ourintelligence by means of language``  ``Ambition is the death of  thought'''  These three quotes are from Ludwig Wittgenstein who redefined philosophysome70 years ago (but most people have yet to find this out).Dennett, though he has  been a philosopher for some40 years, is one them. It is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist, John Searle, studied under famous Wittgensteinians (Searle with John Austin, Dennett with Gilbert Ryle) but Searle got the point and Dennett did not. Dennett is a hard determinist(though he trys to sneak  reality in the back door), and perhaps this is due to Ryle, whose famous book 'The Concept of Mind'(1949) continues to be reprinted.  That book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine.  Dennett enjoys  making  the mistakes Wittgenstein, Ryle(andmany others since) have exposed in detail.   Byaccident,just before this book, I had  read ''The Minds I'', which Dennett coauthored withDouglas Hofstadter in 1981. They made some bad  mistakes(see my review), and saddest of all, they reprinted  twofamous articles that pointed the wayout of the mess---Nagel's `What is  like to be a bat?` and an early version of John  Searle's Chinese Room argument explaining why computers  don't think.   Nagel pointed out that we do noteven know how to recognize whata concept of a bat's mind would be  like.  Searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize  thinking  and how itdiffersfrom what a computer does(eg,it can translate Chinese  without understanding it). Likewise, we lack a clear test for recognizing  what countsas good  vs bad--or just intelligible-- for many philosophical and scientific concepts. Our  use of the words consciousness, choice, freedom, intention,  particle, thinking, determines, wave,cause, happened,  event(and so on endlessly) are  rarely a source of confusion  but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy(and anydiscussion detached from the environment  in  which language evolved) chaos reigns. Wittgenstein  was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid  this. Unfortunately, he died inhis prime, his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of  how the mind(language)  worksand he never wroteany popular books,  so  understanding of his work is restricted to a very few.   Searle  is one of the world's leadingphilosophers and has written  manyextremely clear  and highly regarded articles and books,some of which have pointed out the  glaring defects in Dennett'swork.His review ``Consciousness Explained  Away'' of Dennetts 1991 book`'Consciousness Explained'' and his book''The Mystery of Consciousness'' are very well  known,and show, in a way that isamazingly clear for philosophical writing,why neither Dennett(nor any of the  hundreds of philosophersandscientists who have written on this topic)havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem--ie, how do you conceptualizeconsciousness.Many suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things, but it isclear that we are  nowhere near it now. Dennett has mostly  ignored his critics but has favored  Searle with vituperative personal attacks.Searle has been accused by Dennett and others of  being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is(mostly) a branch of cognitive psychology and Searle has made it very clear for 30 years that WE are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious, thinks, etc,.  He just points out that we don't have any idea how this happens.   Searle characterizes as ''intellectualpathology'',the views ofDennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain. Dennett repeats his  mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of  the book, where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how! Unsurprisingly, there isnot one reference toWittgenstein or Searle in theentire book.There arehowever, many references to other old schoolphilosophers who are as confusedas he is.   Like most people, it does not cross his mindthatthe very inference engineshe thinks with are forcinghim to cometo  certainconclusions and that these will oftenbe quite  unconnectedwith or wrong about the way things are in the  world. They are a jumble of evolutionary curiositieswhich do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survivalhundreds of thousands of years ago.Wittgenstein was a pioneerin doingthought experiments in cognitive psychologyand beganto elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtletiesof language in the 30's, and thus he made the sorts of commentsthat this review begins with.  Dennett says(p98)that  his view is compatibilism, ie, that  free will(whichI hopewe can equate with choice) is compatible with  determinism(ie, that''there is at any instant exactly one physically  possible  future''--p25). He wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity. However, the whole book is smoke  and mirrors by means of  which choice, in the sense we normally  understand it, disappears and we are  left with ``choice``,  which is something we cannot choose. Naturally, this  echoes  the fate of consiousness in his earlier book ``Consciousness  Explained``.   It is remarkable that, at a time when we are  just beginning to  reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a  single neuron works(or how an  atom works for that matter), that anyone should  think they can  make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain  its most complex phenomena. Please recall the last sentence of Wittgenstein  from the opening quote: ''And what'smore,this satisfies a longing for thetranscendent, because, insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see `the limits of  human understanding',theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond  these.`` The  relation between language, thought and reality is  extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost. If one is very, very  careful,some understanding is possible, but Dennett throws caution to  the  winds and we are dragged into the quicksand.   There are  at least 3 different  topics here(evolution of our brain, choice  and morality) and Dennett tries  vainly to weld them together into  a coherent account of how freedom evolves  from the deterministic  crashing of atoms. There is, however, no compelling  reason to  accept that bouncing atoms (or his favorite example, the game  of  life running on a computer) are isomorphic with reality.  He knows that  quantum indeterminacy(or the uncertainty principle)  is a major obstacle to  determinism however defined(and has  been taken by many as an escape to  freedom) but dismisses  it due to the fact that such events are too rare to  bother  with. By extension, its unlikely that any such  event will happen now or even in our  whole lifetime in our  brain, so we appear to be stuck with a determined  brain(whatever  that may be). However, the universe is a big place and its been  around a long time(perhaps forever) and if even one such quantum  effect occurs  it would seem to throw the whole universe into  an indeterminate state. The  notion ''there is at any  instant exactly one physically possible future''  cannot be true  if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur--in this  case  there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures. This  recalls  one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics--each  instant our  universe is branching into infinitely many universes.   He correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice.  This obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness(or any other emergent phenomenon).  If so, they will definitely win at least one Nobel Prize, for not only will they have explained consciousness, they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence(how higher order properties emerge from lower ones). So, they would have to solve the 'easy' problem(to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty) and the 'hard' one(what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc?). And while they are at it how about also doing the  impossible--an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain.  It is very well known that these equations are uncomputable, even for one atom or a vacuum, as it would require an infinite amount of computer time.  But infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer.   He starts off on the  first page appealing to the laws of  physics for protection against fantastic  notions such as immaterial souls, but physics is made of notions just as  fantastic(uncertainty,  entanglement, wave/particle duality, Schrodinger's  dead/alivecat etc) and as Feynmann said many times ``Nobody understandsphysics!'' Many think nobody ever will.   On pg  2 he says  our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and  on pg 2  to3 that our personality differences are due to how  our ''robotic teams are  put togther, over a lifetime of  growth and experience.`` This is a bald  dismissal of human  nature, of the abundant evidence that our differences are  to  a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early  childhood, and  is typical of his constant confused wandering  back and forth between  determinism and environmentalism.  On page  9 he notes that free will is a problem and our  attitudes to  it make a difference, but for whom? Nobody but philosophers. We make choices. What's the problem?  One has to step  outside life to experience a problem and then  everything becomes a problem.  What are consciousness, pain,  yellow, intention, matter, quarks, gravity  etc.? I doubt that  anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their  interactions  with people or their decision making processes due to their  thinking about choice. This shows that there is something  strange about such questions. Wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are  different. There are games  for language connected with the cognitive  templates for decisions  or seeing colors etc, and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode. Decoupled modes permit  thinking about the past, planning for the future, guessing  the mental states  of others, etc, but if one takes the results  in the wrong way and starts to  think `'John will try to steal  my wallet'', rather than just imagining that  John might  do it, confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled  mode or distinguish it from coupled mode,  enter the realm of pathology. Some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be  seen this way--they lose control of which mode they are in, eg, notbeing able to see the  difference between the motives people  have and the motives they might have.   One can then see  much of the philosophizing people do as operating in  these  decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them  the  differences from the normal mode. Normal mode--eg, what  is that lion doing--  was undoubtedly the first one evolved  and decoupled modes--what did that lion  do last time or what  does he intend to do next--evolved later. This was  probably  never a problem for animals--any animal that spent too much  time  worrying about what might happen would not be very successful  contributing to  the gene pool. It is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed  culture and began degeneratinggenetically, could large numbers of people  survive with genes that  led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes.  Hence, we  have philosophy and this book, which is mostly about running the  decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real  consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results  in a book for other people to  use to run their engines in decoupled mode.' Let us alter Wittgenstein's quote to read:  ''As longas there continues to be a verb 'to decide'  that looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to  eat' and 'to  drink',as long as we continueto talk of  freedom of action, of saying I  wish I had done otherwise,  etc., etc., people will keepstumbling over the  samepuzzling  difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich  no  explanation seems capable of clearing up.''  As withmost philosophy books, nearly every page, often every paragraph,  changes from one type of language  game to another without  noticing that now one would have to be joking or  dreaming  or acting in a play or reciting a story , etc, and not actually  intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the  world. On page  10 he says we count on free will for the  whole way of thinking about our lives,  like we count on food  and water, but who ever, outside philosophy, standing in  front  of lunch counter full of food, ever thinks how fine it is that  they  have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral  water? Even if I  want to be a serious compatibilist and  try thinking this in decoupled mode, I  have to exit and  enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice. Only then  can I go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have  happened if I had  not had the ability to make a real choice.  Wittgenstein noted how pretend  games are parasitic on real ones(this is not a trivial observation!).  The ability to engage in very complex  decoupled scenarios  is already evident in 4 year old children. So I would say  that normally, nobody counts on having choice, but rather we just choose.    On the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive  basics.  He says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual  atmosphere of choice,  and that `'It appears to be a stable  and ahistorical construct, as eternal  and unchanging as arithmetic,  but it is not.'' And on page 13--''It is an  evolved creation  of human activity and beliefs''. The whole thrust of  cognitive  psychology is that we do NOT learn the basics of planning, deciding,  promising, resenting, etc, but that these are built-in functions  of the  inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously  and start running  in very early childhood. There is no evidence  that they change as we grow,  or are in any way subject to  our beliefs,only  that they mature just as our body does.   On pg 14 he suggests  its probable that our having free will depends on our believing  we have  it!  Do we believe we see an apple, feel a pain, are  happy? The language  game of belief is very different from  that of knowing. We can believe we have  a dollar in our  pocket but if we take it out and look at it we can't  meaningfully  then say that we still believe it(except as a joke etc.). The  inference engine can run in decoupled(belief) mode so we can  imagine havingchoices or making them, but in life we just make them and it is only in very  odd situations we can say  that we believe we made a choice. But Dennett is  saying thisis the universal case. If making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else--consciousness,  seeing,  thinking,etc. If we take this seriously(and he says 'the serious problems of  free will' ) then we are getting  into trouble and if we actually try to apply  it to life, then madness is minutes away.  .  On page 65 et seq., he  discusses causation, intention and the `informal predicates'  that we use to  describe atoms etc, but cognitive resarch has  shown that we describe all  objects with a limited number of  ontological categories which we analyse with  our intuitive physics  modules and that when agents (ie animals or people or  things  like them--ie, ghosts or gods) are involved we use our  concepts (engines)  for agency, intuitive psychology, social minds, etc to  decide  how to behave. There is almost certainly no causation module  but  rather it will involve all of these and other inference  engines, depending on  the precise situation. Discussing  possibility and necessity is much  easier if  one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive  physics,  agency, ontological categories etc. Of course there is no mention  here of Wittgenstein's many incisive comments on causation,  intention,  deciding, nor of Searle's now classic works  on Intention and Social Reality.   He spends much time on  Ainslie's book 'Breakdown of Will', in which is  discussed  the hyperbolic discounting faculties (ie, inference engines) by which  we evaluate probable outcomes. Hemakes much of the excellent work of Robert Frank on altruism, emotion and economics, but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published. It was Bingham's idea, amplified by Frank and by Boyd and Richardson (1992) that  cooperation  was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters. He suggests these as examples of Darwinian approaches  that areobligatory and promising. Indeed they are, and  in fact they are standard  parts of economic, evolutionary  and cognitive theory, but unfortunately, he  makes little reference  to the other work in these fields. All that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them. He does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice.   Onpg 216 he says that making oneself so  that one could not have  done otherwise is a key innovation in  the evolutionary ascent to free will,  and that we can only  be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive  to  opportunities. But where this ability resides is not revealed  for  several chapters! Dennett has a penchant for hiding  his ideas in a massive  amount of rather irrelevant text.  Again, he gets things backwards, as there is  a vast body of  very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get  the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and  these are not provided by some part of our conscious  self, but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the  engines. As he notes, hundreds of experiments  with the Prisoner's Dilemma  and related protocols have shown how easy it is to  manipulate  people's choices and that their calculations are not conscious  and  deliberate at all. When the situation is manipulated to  make them conscious,they are much slower and  less reliable. So, there has been  constant pressure of natural  selection to make the engines fast and automatic  and inacessible  to deliberate thought.  Dennett says `we make ourselves'  so  that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis  of morality and  choice. The evidence would seem to be exactly  the opposite. Our inference engines give  us basic moral intuitions and  we generally act in accord with the results.  If we or others  do not we feel guilt, outrage, resentment etc, then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved.Our genes make us so we can't(mostly) do otherwise, not our will or whatever Dennett thinks can do it.   We can often choose to do otherwise but our own  intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval  usually serve to limit our choices. These intuitions evolved  in small groups between 50,000 and some  millions of years ago. In the modern world the intuitions are often not to  our  advantage and the social controls weak. This is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world.  On pg  225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will  as ''a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making(from certain angles)''. He claims that thisplays all the valuable  roles of free will but lacks some  (unspecified) properties possessed by  traditional free will.  The smoke is thick but I  am pretty  sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice. He insists(top pg 226) that his naturalistic  account of decision  making leaves plenty of room for moral  responsibility, but making ourselves so  we couldn't do otherwise  does not seem to describe the way we actually  function, nor  does it seem to leave any room for morality, as that would seem  to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise.   He  does not propose  any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary  or forced and I doubt he could  do so. Normally if someone  asks us to move our hand, we know what counts as  having a  choice, but, typical of philosophers, I expect that regardless  of  whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position.   At this point he also starts his discussion of Libet's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that I felt was worth my time.   On page 253 et seq., he sneaks in his definition of conscious will--the  ''brains user illusion  of itself''' which has as one of its main roles  providing  ''me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times``.  And ``Illusory or not, conscious will is the persons guide  to his or her own  moral responsibility for action.`` He says  the trick we need is to see that  ``I`' control what is happening  inside the ''simplification barrier''...  ''where decision  making happens''. ``Mental events'' become conscious by  ''entering  into memory''. ''The process of self description... is  what we  are''. The crucial thing is that choice is possible  because the self is  distributed over space(the brain) and time(memories).  He realizes this is  going to leave many incredulous(everyone who can follow this and really understands!). ''I know that many  people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously. It seems to them  to be a trickwith mirrors, some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness, and the real Self , out of the picture just when it was about to  be introduced.'' Many will say he took the words out of their mouth, but I would  say it's incoherent and  thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole  universe(making the obvious extensions of such claims)  was gone long beforewegot this far.    On pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals!  This is a stunning denial of human nature(ie, genetics and evolution) coming from the person who wrote 'Darwin's Dangerous Idea''!  Presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space(the brain and other people) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness(line 6 from bottom).  He says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain(you will have to suffer through 'Consciousness Explained to find that there is no answer there either).  Though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology, he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades(social mind, intuitive psychology, coalitional intuitions etc) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts. If he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture, thats ok, but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes.    We are also told here that R&D(by which he means evolution here, but other things elsewhere) has given us the self  and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality.  I am sure that he will get little agreement on this.  It seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates(and earlier) long before spoken language(though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain).  He continues ``morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago`` which would be OK if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake!  And then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes, which is an amazing (and totally incorrect)thing to say, even if he was only referring to memes.   On pg 260 he claims  that  because we do not comprehend our ''bland dispositions  to cooperate'', they  mean nothing to us, but it is the operation  of our templates that is  everything to us. There is ample  evidence that if one of them is damaged a  person cannot function  properly as a social being(eg, autism).  I would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead Dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think.    He also says here that it was one of the major  evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them. This again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology.  I know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions, like all the templates, are accessible to consciousness.  We may decide our cheating was justifiable, or forgive someone else's cheating, but we still know it was cheating(ie, we cannot change the engine). I suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings.  Another issue is that as culture developed, one had to make many important or 'moral type` decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer.    On pg 267 he says that we now replace our `free floating rationales'(probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines) with reflection and mutual persuasion. And on pg 286 he says that it is a child's upbringing --demanding and giving reasons-- that affects moral reasoning. Again, he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research--the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing. We are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self, which takes responsibility.  It is not any more coherent or credible with repetition.    On pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education(memory) and sharing.  It's clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments. On pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between 'ought'and 'is' , unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago--ie, they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people.  He also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes(eg see 'The Blank Slate').   He often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology, but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion.  This happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like 'praiseworthy' were shaped over millennia by culture, while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms.   On pg 262 he tries to explain how an ESS(Evolutionarily Stable Strategy) can produce morality. His idea here is that genetic `R&D` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture(memetics) produces variations and clarifications.  I would say that we all know, and much research has made clear, that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases.  Culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings.    The last part of the book is mostly  concerned  with moral culpability. He refers to the legal classic by Hart  and  Honore, which I started reading 30 years ago since it's  authors were deeply influenced by Wittgenstein.  Dennett tells us that we have  control over our own morality and  that thinking about morality will improve us.  But, there seems  no justification whatever for this view in this book. There is nothing at  all  here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind. It is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that  has no connection with philosophy- and there is not a hint of  spirituality in this entire book--another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind. I find  more wisdom about how  to be free and moral in any of Osho's 200 books than anywhere in philosophy. One rarely finds spiritually and morally  advanced people teaching at universities. There is no sign here, nor in  anything he has done, that Dennett is morally superior. After 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them.  It seems clear that, like all of us, he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines.   So, how much opportunity is there to  improve our morality? It seems  clear(eg, see Pinker's `The Blank Slate`) that  most of our behaviour  is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our  environment, in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties. On  average, maybe 5% of the variation in moral behavior(variations are the only thing we can  study) is due to our own efforts. The moral choices that matter  most today are  those affecting the fate of the world. But our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect.   How remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is.  And if one did, we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fMRI  equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc.  But a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking, coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is!  And then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first.  To return to the quote at the beginning--'Ambition is the death of thought'.  Indeed--though clearly Wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts 
 Simply put, this book is the drivel of a man who thinks very highly of himself. It's like being forced to have dinner with your egotistical, drunken uncle. "Blah blah blah... And then  I saved the world and looked good doing it.... Blah blah blah... AREN'T I GREAT?!?! 
 Dertouzos churns out the usual 'information wil change the future' vision that dominates books of this nature. Unfortunately, nothing here is really new, nor does Dertouzos write with much passion nor pizazz - his pronouncements come across as somewhat pretentious and trite. I prefer Esther Dyson's Release 2.0, which hawks much the same vision but in a nicely homey, conversational style that reveals how personal her book is compared to this one 
 Later in his career Charley Pride did a massive recording session where he re-recorded all his biggest hits.   At the time it was well intentioned because almost all of the original versions of these songs were unavailable.   But be forewarned, the songs on this disc are all remakes, well done, but nonetheless, remakes 
 i loved the ideas presented in this book, and i do read alot of books about the media, modern technologies, and their effect on our lives and on the society.  although the presented ideas are great, the style of the writing gets to me every time.  absolutely terrible.  im not sure if the author was trying to exemplify the mass confusions, lack of attention span of today's society through the litteral writing, but it detracts from the points that he makes.  many examples are presented have no form of organization whatsoever, and many arent even necessary.  zengotita could have conveyed the message of the book in half the length and it would have been more effective than this book will ever be 
 I am all for the multi-dimensional character.  I found Garofalo's role promising in this.  She was interesting to watch and was pretty much believable.  Uma Thurman was ok too - a little less multi-dimensional but was lovable in a ditsy kind of way.  However, the guy picked for leading man was the pits.  Perhaps he is a good actor but you really can't tell from this movie.  What is it exactly . . . he, honestly, doesn't come across as being smart enough for Garofalo.  He's good looking to be sure but . . . boring.   I don't believe the movie the second he enters it.  I can see her falling for him initially but then getting tired of him because they have nothing to talk about.  It would have been much better if he wound up with Thurman and some really interesting leading man showed up or he turned out to be some con man or something.  There really was NO chemistry between them and that phone conversation . . .   I was frankly embarrassed for Garofalo.  I guess I didn't find her character believable in that.  This movie really misses the mark - I love the premise - but Garofalo needs a leading man as strong as herself.  I own the movie but doubt I will ever watch it again - I could sell it but I would feel like a peddler of shabby wares.  
 The original Halloween was the greatest horror movie of all time. Since then, a series of inferior sequels were released one after the other. Some were watchable such as Halloween 4. And one was actually pretty good; Halloween H20. But most were terrible drivel. Halloween 2 was a let down, Halloween 3 was an abomination, Halloween 5 was a crime against nature, and Halloween 6 (The Curse of Michael Meyers) was perhaps the worst movie ever made. Then Halloween H20 came out and surprised everybody. It was good! Could this be a trend to revive the dying franchise? Unfortunatly, the answer is no because "H2o" was followed with "Resurrection" which effectively sank the franchise back into the depths of its own miserable oblivian 
 I am fresh off of seeing this for the first time. It was so bad, I HAD to warn the rest of you.  The ONLY thing connecting this movie to the first one is Carlito, Drugs, New York and the 70's. There is nothing else since this movie doesn't seem to be connected in any other way to the original. I don't even see how they can get away with calling it a "prequel".   First off, Jay Hernandez doesn't even remotely translate well into the role of Carlito Brigante that Al Pacino populated in the original. You get the idea that he is more likely, playing dress up and pretending to be someone he's not. Which technically is the truth. But come on, who wants to watch a movie and be reminded so often that everyone is just "acting"? We want to feel like everything that's happening is real, and it's right on our own little TV screen.   Secondly, none of the characters from the original show up in this movie. No Lalin, Pachanga (even though Luis Guzman plays a character named Nacho), no Reynaldo, which is who Carlito was connected with before his jailing. Not even Davy Kleinfeld. And  Gail...poor thang is replaced by some Puerto-Rican girl named Leticia.   So all these bizarre 1995 "Shaft" like events happen that leads up to the ending. Carlito is through with the drug business and ends up living in Barbados. Well, how did he come to the wonderful conclusion that he should get BACK into drugs, dump Leticia, move back to the NY and reunite with all the characters that we know and love from the original....plus end up at the place he started at IN THE BEGINNING of the original??????????  Unanswered questions.  This movie is more like a De-quel than a Pre-quel. A DEgrading attempt at recapturing the glory of the original film. 
 After a long wait, I was VERY pleased to get my hands on this book! If you are an Angel Fan (or a Farrah fan, like myself) you'll love this book as much as I do.  It's full of interesting info, fun facts that even after all these years, I didn't know and lots of great "behind-the-scenes" photos.  My thanks to Mike Pingle for putting this book together!  Mike-You did a good job!   Kenny  :- 
 If your school uses this book, not only don't take this class, drop out of the school. If I could rate this with negative numbers I would. This is the worst textbook ever devised by man OR woman. If you are already a CPA looking for a review, it might be worth something, otherwise it teaches nothing. It presents examples without first explaining things then explains things using examples that have no bearing on what is being taught.  If you have to use this book, my sympathy for you. I can only hope the school will refund at least a portion of my money 
 you can see by the name that this band is aother coporate creation to the masses of 10 year old girls tryin' to be hip  and weepin' at the sickly lyrics of "the reason" god when i first heard that song i cried..not because it's a beautiful poetic song with passion and superb word-play it's because it made me nauseous i was ready to spill my guts on the breakfast i'd just ate  are these guys tryin' to be hip or are just marketted to sell  buckle loads of records to the mtv for the price of the decency of rock and roll  i one know it's the second   there name hooba-stank is a double edged sword because  when music fans see the name and cd on their local cd stores  they think "well they've got to be good because they've got stank in their name and any band they purposely puts stank in their name is gonna be bad right?" WRONG   yet if you like it then that's okay we all have different tastes in music and that's what makes un indivudual...  
 After reading the reviews of this book, I for one am just so relieved that all of these tortured tortured geniuses who loved the book finally have a voice.  From what I can tell, most of them were "forced" to read this book by their crafty and maniacal friends and loved ones.  It must be wonderful for them to finally have a champion that can refute all of this backward, nonsensical, mean spirited hokum that we call Christianity.  Nevermind the fact that the only expert that Doherty brings to bare is himself.  Nevermind the fact that Strobel had more than a dozen.  Nevermind the fact that Christianity is the force that has been changing the world for the last 2000 years.    Seriously though, what you should remember is that when Strobel gathered his evidence, he was seeking to disprove Christianity 
 If I could give this movie less than 1 star, I would.  The central character, Ryan, played by Jason Scott Lee (by the way, what happened to the Muscles from Brussels?), is a loser. Why? Because HE SAVES ADOLF HITLER'S LIFE!!! And how does he do this? By killing the leading lady.  Gee, great script guys.  Also, the thing makes no sense. People are obliterated from history, and Ryan knows about it! Hello, if they were removed from history, he would have no memory of them. Duh!  If there was such a thing as a 'Time Cop', they would outlaw people wasting 2hrs watching this ridiculous movie!  
 A work of fiction is a great thing, but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong.  Why not just make up a story with no historical basis 
 It seems every book on evolution nowdays spouts a new version of how we got here.  This book is no different.  What the authors are doing here is obvious: Because life is adaptive and evolves purposefully, these guys are trying to construct this reality onto a foundation of accidents. It's a truly laughable premise that is so funny it almost hurts.  This book is almost worthless.  If this book were a political persuasion it would vote "moderate."  And it's absolutely a joke that any book written on evolution would leave out a detailed discussion of subjects such as epigenetics, horizontal gene transfer, and environmentally-induced gene expression. The last of which touched on in this book, but only fleatingly.  This book is good for one thing: taking neo-darwinism one step closer to the trashcan where it belongs.  This is one last attempt to save a dying theory 
 If you like to read a story where the author is so in love with big, fancy-pants words and spinning his tires without getting anywhere then this is the book for you.  This guy has a great command of vocabulary and language and often writes beautiful sentences THAT GO NOWHERE!. To say that these stories are slow in developing would be an insult to slow.  The first story is great, I will say that, but the others meander and meander and describe and describe and finally you get a hint of true plot and action without endless description and the story is over.  The stories are overlong, overblown and self-congratulatory. Yes he is like China Melville but I actually like China and feel bad saying that. They both have a similar feel to the universe they create and they both have astounding vocabularies but China also incorporates some meat with all the potatoes. This guy had a good idea and then got lost in a thesauras 
 This was a gift for my daughter. Instead of receiving the New Yorker, she is receiving People. You need to fix this 
 I wonder if bad subtitles ruined the film but it was SO PAINFULLY SLOW I found it impossible to sit through. I wonder if it picked up but I couldn't tolerate it. It's also unbelievable past the normal suspension of disbelief. OK there's one guy with deep thoughts but everyone else has deep thoughts and/or is a maniac? Can't anyone have a blank mind like Homer Simpson 
 Apparently I am the only person who has noticed this, but a great majority of the music on this CD is NOT the actual music that plays during the film. I love this film, and have always loved the music in it. I decided to purchase this cd particularly for the song "Ivory Tower". The music accompanying the arrival at the Ivory Tower always enchanted me and I was eager to have it on a CD for regular listening. However, the Ivory Tower song on this soundtrack CD, is not the stirring orchestration from the film, it is a trumped up synthesizer-ridden dance-mix version of the original Ivory Tower song which pales in comparison to the original. Several of the songs on this album have received the same treatment, and have synthesizer beats and electric guitars added to them, which completely alters the mood of the songs. Why these songs were redone for the soundtrack is beyond me, but prepare to be disappointed if you are looking to hear the score as it is in the actual film. Some songs are left unchanged from the film, but to me, the synthesizing of the others spoils the overall mood of the album.   I recently purchased the Germany version of this soundtrack, (Die Unendliche Geschichte) off of iTunes, and I must say that I am MUCH happier with this version of the soundtrack. The lovely "Ivory Tower" song is still missing, but this version of the soundtrack is entirely orchestral, and does not have the horrible souped up synthesized songs of the American version. If you're very fond of the Limahl title song, and can't imagine a soundtrack to The Neverending Story without it, than the American version is right for you, but if you're looking to have a nice copy of the beautiful score of the film, purchasing the German version is definitely the right way to go 
 The only reason this gets one star is because zero stars is not an option.  I will concede that the content is good, but the delivery is so bad that the tapes are almost useless.  My problem is that he simply speaks SO fast it is impossible to follow him.  Then, the breathing is too much.  He is talking throughout, and is completely out of time with the breathing.  Even if he was in time, the breathing is just not right.  In a few places I got the impression he was just providing filler to stretch it out to six tapes.  Your money is much better spent on any of Richard Sutphen's materials. This is garbage by comparison 
 This book offers a very extraordinary group of ideas in the form of sketches, however that is as far as you will get with the 101 projects you can build yourself. Each project has a plan number that requires the  speculative do-it-yourselfer to spend 20 to 85 dollars on a blueprint that  most profesional builders won't even touch. In summary, the plans are too  complicated for the weekend warrior, and the materials needed to build  these elaberate structures will blow any do-it-your-selfers budget. You can  get some good ideas from this book, but that is it 
 Mr. Spenser you are wrong. Look up the Quran on the internet, Google it if you have time and you will see passages and quotes that to be a true muslim is to be respectful and a BELIEVER in all monolithic Abrahimic religions ( Jews and christians). There is a chapter dedicated to the virgin Mary. Idiots use religion sometimes to justify their criminal motivation in order to gain support. Do not take my word LOOK it up.   Mr spenser, shame on you for spewing more ignorance and hate, we had ENOUGH. Where is this going to get us?. But like your other less virtuous colleagues (Roberts, Rush) unfortunately your convictions have been sold to the highest bidder. How many more repetitious books on the same subject are you planning to poison naive people?. Look up whom Spenser works for and things will make sense; a sad addition to journalism. Mover over Chomsky and your boring factual rants, the stage belongs now to Ann culter, Rush limbaigh, rupert murdoch and robert spenser. 
 The  television movie was wonderful; but I guess I forgot how many drums and banging noises were in the background. Loreena McKennitt is wonderful to listen to, but it's not the soothing soundtrack I was hoping for with the Ahhhhhhhhhh singing and clanging of steel 
 I rented this movie because Marguerite Moreau looked hot on the box.  But she didn't look nearly as good in the movie.  Her character was a smoking (gross), bed-hopping slob who looked like she harbored every STD known to man.  And she thinks she has to sleep with every guy she meets in order to find love (silly).  Really no focus in this movie, not enjoyable 
 I had high hopes on this game but I was disapointed. The controls are horrible and definately the voice acting throughout 90% was bad. The story line was basically typical, it really didn't hold my interest for long. I did beat the game because I spent $50 on it the day it came out and I figured I would at least do that. I gave the game to a friend of mine after I beat it and he had the same opinion as I did. It's worth renting but definately not worth buying. Hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controls 
 I was particularly interested in one of the two enclosed disks - 1 CD - same title as the book, and 1 DVD - Primal 3D Anatomy. The disks are highlighted on the cover, and described in intriguing detail on the back cover. BUT WAIT - inside the front cover, the last paragraph on another "highlight" it says "The second CD contains a 45-day free trial". The same note appeared on the disk but it was covered by the Notice to consumer. My conclusion was this misleading presentation WAS INTENTIONAL! Can't return it now because the disk seals are broken. The management at Lippincott Williams & Wilkins should be sent up the river in chains 
 These headphones bang into your head with the music... I guess that might be cool, but the sound fades in and out and you look like a moron with headphones banging into your head. You can turn off the "brain shaking" feature, but the sound quality is still poor and they are really, really uncomfortable 
 I bought this book because I am a Kellerman fan and usually enjoy his work.  This one is far below his usual quality!  The characters are poorly developed and, by the end of the book, I really didn't care what happened to any of them.  There are a bunch of contrived coincidences, which are simply ludicrous and insulting to the reader.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 This season of Angel is beautifully written. It's exciting and it's got a lot of hairpin curves. The problem is the "Ick Factor." The "Ick Factor" shows up in every character. It gets so intense that it takes away all of the good qualities and turns the season into an uncomfortable experience for the viewer. The ending with Connor is particularly depressing. I realize that only something that intense would make Angel go to Wolfram & Hart, but the question that should be asked is: Why would the show WANT to go there?  I know that the actress playing Cordelia got pregnant, but pregnancy doesn't have to be a bad thing - she could have been magically pregnant by Angel himself providing a twin brother for Connor or by something that would have been a "cure" for Angel. After Season Three, there were all sorts of wonderful possibilities that could have occurred. Call me old-fashioned, but I would have liked Cordelia to come back for a romantic time with Angel who would have been saved from the sea to become closer to Connor and make him a partner in the world-saving business.  Unfortunately, nothing positive was explored and the viewer is left with these wonderful characters in a big, depressing mess of circumstances that were just kind of... well... yucky! I probably would never have tuned in again, except that Spike shows up in the last season.  To understand the final season, you have to watch this season. Just realize that it's depressing - if you're having a bad time in your life, skip it and come back later 
 My kids think this is a better toy than our dog.  Wasn't worth the money I paid for it.  Comes apart too easy 
 It would be hard to come up with a more brain-dead characterization of the peoples of the world than to lump them into "us", Americans, and "them", all the other peoples of the world.  Yet Churchill and Chomsky and most others who mistake their anti-Americanism for leftism consistently start from that mindlessly provincial premise.  Are the folks who hate us the Australians?  Well, no.  Our British allies?  Well, not them either.  The Chinese, many of whom are so eager to get green cards to study or live here?  Those I met were often conscious that Chinese prosperity is founded upon US willingness to open its markets to their goods.  In sharp contrast to European protectionism.  How about the Indians, for whom holders of US citizenship or greencard status are almost a new subcaste for marital matchmaking?  The Canadians hate us, do they?  Though it is hard for anyone to tell us apart?  Perhaps the Greeks, Poles, Italians, and Irish hate us, which is why they eagerly tell American tourists about their cousins in Baltimore or Chicago?  Surely the Russians, Ukrainians, and inhabitants of other former Soviet countries hate us?  Except for attributing their freedoms and the beginnings of their new prosperity to our victory over the Soviet Union?  How about the Filipinos - surely they must despise us for ruling them as a colony?  Well no.  They learn in school that the US without violence or even prompting made the Philippines independent in 1935 and rescued them from Japanese occupation during WWII, and they too, often have relatives in the US.  Surely the Thais, must hate us - but no, their story is much the same as the Chinese.  And on and on, around the world.    The Arabs surely must hate us.  Except for the Shi'ite majority of Iraqis who recognize that we have just freed them from decades of bloody Baathist suppression of their religion and folkways.  And the Lebanese must hate us, except for those who love their country and are delighted with American support for driving the decades-old Syrian military occupation out of their country.  But Churchill and Chomsky are right that there are those who do hate us.  Palestinians and Egyptians danced in the streets when they learned that 3,000 Americans died in New York on 9-11.  The attackers themselves were Saudis and products of the Wahhabbi system of religious bigotry and xenophobia which passes for education and news in that country.    The "they" who hate us, when examined, turn out to be not the whole world, not the whole Muslim world, and not even the whole Arab world, but only the most racist, bigoted, and xenophobic portions of it.  And those are the people whom Ward Churchill and Noam Chomsky and their supporters identify with 
 Longman is an unashamed Calvinist.  Those who share his beliefs may find this book very useful; others should take it with a large pinch of salt.  His beliefs have an influence on his choice of books to review; while he does not ban all books by Catholic or Jewish writers, they are under-represented.  More importantly, they affect his reviews.  He classifies books as 1 to 5 stars and as suitable for laymen (L), ministers (M), scholars (S) or LM or MS.  The only books recommended for LMS - and they are given a 5 star rating - are Calvin's commentaries.  How useful these centuries-old works are to contemporary scholars is certainly debatable.  Well-respected books by some authors are given poor ratings.  Finally, just in case you cannot find his own books using the author index, they are helpfully listed on a page by themselves at the end 
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 Narration put me to sleep, too cliche. DVD wasn't quite what I expected.  Some good video work but too much off highway photography. I was expecting more scenery as seen from the highway. 
 Very sorry I wasted the money on this book as well as her others!  ;- 
 The trust a young reader places in a writer is something to appreciate and value. Many young readers have been following this promising series for several years and have paid the writer with their return through a dozen books and waiting for the conclusion to this saga. The writer has commited the ultimate betrayal to his young readers in delivering this last book. The book is poorly written and reveals a very undisciplined writer. Perhaps it was too much success-too soon, or an editor who rushed this last book to publishing which led to this fiasco. It is disappointing that the writer did not value the many young minds who waited for the conclusion. The rambling shows the control of an alcoholic and the shoddy conclusion reveals a lack of creativity. It is clear that he did not give enough time and thought to develop something with more control and imagination. It is sad that many children will approach other serial writers skeptically after this miserable ending to the miserable series 
 The same routine as his HBO special Pimp Chronicles.  Pimp Chronicles has better sound, light, and production.  The jokes in this video was the first time.  The HBO special is the EXACT same jokes but polish and delivered better 
 Half of the book is a history of several value investors.  But this section is quite superficial in how these individuals screened/found the opportunities they did.  Little is told of how they valued the companies and how a wanna-be investor should procede in doing this themselves.  The first half of the book is ok, but again could use more help in terms of how to find prospective value companies.  Chapter 6 is about the only good chapter. It analyses WD-40 (the company).  I recommend instead "The Intelligent Investor" (2003 ed.) by the late Ben Graham and Jason Zweig.  It lives up to Buffett's praise of "...by far the best book about investing ever written. 
 This is one of many serials I saw at the Uptown Theater in Dover, NH, and one of the few I clearly remember.  "Jack Armstrong" was one of my favorite radio serials for years, and I was thrilled when it was announced as the next movie serial at the Uptown.  All I actually remember is the first chapter with that special car, which I thought was extremely cool at the time.  The previews made us think the car was part of the story, but after the first chapter it never appears again.  The rest of the story is disappointing.  It has a weak script and poor production values.  The fights are not well choreographed.  The chapter endings are mediocre.  There's a little too much sci-fi nonsense to make this serial really enjoyable--for example in a late chapter they're going to communicate with "supersonic sound"--that would be sound that's faster than sound, excuse me?  Dr. Grood's rocket ship looks suspiciously like the one in "Atom Man vs. Superman," and some of the weapons are more than faintly reminiscent of Luthor's in that same serial.  Three of the bad guys resemble the Three Stooges.  John Hart looked like a movie star but he wasn't much of an actor.  He played the Lone Ranger on TV from 1952 to 1953 replacing Clayton Moore for a year, after which Moore was brought back by popular demand.  Rosemary LaPlanche was Miss America of 1941, and she toured extensively during the War selling war bonds.  She could have been used to better advantage here, as could Claire James as Princess Alura.  In fact, Miss James looks every bit as much Miss America-like as Rosemary does.  Pierre Watkin makes a fine Uncle Jim, albeit without the hair he sported as Perry White in "Superman."  He may be the best actor in the film.  Joe Brown, Jr. sure isn't--he can't deliver one line convincingly.  As Billy, he's a pain in the arse--as an actor, he's a complete disaster.  Columbia got really weird with the release of this film.  Charles Middleton, as big a name as ever appeared in serials and who plays Dr. Grood, was not even listed in the credits.  Middleton passed away only two years after this serial was made, and he's looking a little worn-out here 
 I got this book mainly to see about the areas up where I live in the San Bernardino Mountains in California.  I have two major complaints.  1.  The so-called "tours" that you would be hard pressed to spend a day doing them, much less a week like the authors claim.  If you really tried, you might be able to stretch it out to two days if you stayed overnight somewhere.  2.  Obviously, the authors have not bothered to visit their own "tours" on a regular basis to make sure they are still valid and not obsolete.  For instance, in Crestline, California, they list the Cliffhanger as a good place to eat and you must stop there.  Well I have news for the authors: this establishment has been out of business for years and years and up for sale even.  So unless they want to buy it and turn it back into a restaurant, it is not a good place to eat, because it is totally empty. :P  Basically, the whole book is laden with information like this.  So even if that is the way it was back in the 1970's, the authors need to update their book and do a complete rewrite which means retraveling all the routes and taking notes of the changes.  This could be a very good book, but it has to be kept current and also to have more options and stops in the "tours" than just a handful of "attractions".  The authors seem like nice people, they just have to be more earnest if they are going to write a traveling book for others, otherwise their readers might end up chasing ghost dogs 
 This book is neither interesting nor educational(regarding Hollyowood, I mean). However, it makes [unintentionally] one excellent point about actors: Brad Davis' life and career show that not only women are treated as  "piece of meat" in Hollywood; it also applies to men, who happen  to be handsome, sexy, etc. Looks can help actors' career and they can also  destroy it, if actors are not allowed "out of their stereotypes"  or if they become too impressed with themselves.  Maybe Davis was not  handsome per se, but there was an undeniable and irresistible  sensuality/mystery about him. You can almost feel it, watching his films  and looking at the photos.  Davis' wife stayed with him, despite of all the  hell he put her through, because she had always been desperately in love  with him. And now she is still angry. She testifies in the book that Davis  was self-destructive, unstable, and careless person, who was a hustler in  his young days and later spent many nights on the town, "cruising and  boozing". Yet, she is still afraid to admit who he really was. Why  write this book, then? This book is very depressing and certainly is very  uninspiring to AIDS-affected people, their families, gay people, and even  young actors, who are starting in the business. I feel for Susan Bluestein  as a woman, who chose a difficult life and a difficult love, but she does  not seem to be a person, who knew Davis best. May be there is somebody  else, or may be noone could ever really know him...In any case, Davis's  made an important contribution to the world of cinema 
 I was expecting a lot more out of this book.  It scratched the surface of a huge topic without enough content 
 I'm not one to enjoy buying a pack of 50 CD's and having to throw half of them away because the drive can no longer read them.  They deteriorate quickly 
 The imagery of focused academia and the discontinuity of John and Carol's conversation can be defined as a constant stop n' go.  You find yourself wondering if the structure of "Oleanna" will transform a change of pattern from interupted dialog to a free flowing comprehensible conversation. You want to talk irritating-its all here.  John the ostentatious Professor is developed into this pompous character and Mamet creates a twisted tone of pathetic sympathy hitched with misappropriated authority. Will John's foolish indoctrination jeopardize his tenure?  If you can get through the continuation of interrupted dialog - lots of credit to you 
 I have watched Emeril and perhaps others using this food processor and ending up with liquid all over the counter.  I just dismissed it as part of Emeril's shtick until I bought this machine for myself.  The first time I tried to use it with any liquid ingredients (making mayonnaise), it blew much of the liquid through the joint between the top and the bowl.  The top is just flawed in its design, as it would seem pretty obvious that the part of the top overlapping the side of the bowl should be on the inside rather than the outside of the bowl.  I suppose it had not occurred to me that anyone would design the top in the way that KA did, much less that such a design flaw would be overlooked in so many reviews (e. g. Consumer Reports and Cook's Illustrated).  In any case, this machine is pretty much useless for wet ingredients and borderline for dry (they blow through the badly designed joint as well) unless you feel that wiping up a large part of your ingredients from the counter, the outside of the bowl, the bottom of the machine, and any items nearby is a reasonable thing to expect to do.  I will probably get rid of the machine in some way and go back to the Cuisinart I have had for some time as it is a much better design in this regard.

  I FOUND THIS BOOK HARD TO UNDERSTAND WITH THE WORDS THE AUTHOR USED, IT WAS NOT A GOOD READ, IT TOOK ALOT FOR ME TO GET THROUGH IT. SHE REPEATED HER SELF SEVERAL TIMES AND SOME THINGS DID NOT MAKE SENSE. I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WOMEN VOLUNTARILY WENT TO THE CONCENTRATION CAMP WITH HER PARENTS AND CHILDREN. IF SHE WANTED TO BE WITH HER HUSBAND WHY DIDN'T SHE GO AND LEAVE HER CHILDREN WITH HER PARENTS. ALSO THE ENTIRE BOOK WAS TO CLINICAL. I HAVE READ SEVERAL  BOOKS ABOUT THE HOLCAUST AND THEY WERE REMARKABLE THIS ONE WAS NOT , I SHOULD HAVE SAVED MY MONEY 
 The author makes a couple of valuable points. First, any long-term investment strategy has to take into account the existence of recurrent "secular" (i.e., indefinitely long) bear markets. Most leading investment advisors recommend a "buy and hold" strategy, but this only works during predominately bull market periods. Most studies of successful investment strategies are biased towards the recent 1982-1999 bull market, which is anomalous in historical terms. The author uses a plethora of graphs and charts to prove that "buy and hold" doesn't always provide the best returns. Obviously, then, it's better to pull out during the bear markets, but that's easier said than done. The author provides a very complete analysis of the characteristics of bear markets, including P/E ratio, interest and inflation rates, and GDP. The problem is that those characteristics don't always correlate with market performance. For example, this book was written in 2004 and the author predicted a bear market. Well, if you heeded his advice, you would have missed the bull market of 2004, 2005 and early 2006, especially in small-mid caps and foreign stocks. Even with high P/E ratios, a bull market can continue for several years: witness the late 90s. It's virtually impossible to time the market even if you monitor the major stock indexes on a daily basis. There is so much volatility on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis that's it's impossible to know when the market has switched directions. By the time that it is apparent, it's too late to profit. Even in the midst of great bull markets, there might be week, month, or even year-long downturns. The author says nothing about individual stock picking, beyond a general value approach. The book is all about big picture, long term trends. Another problem is that the author's predictions are based on his analysis of market trends going back to 1900. But the market (and economy) is a different beast now that it was in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s. As they say, past performance does not predict future returns.   The investment advice provided here is not useful. He suggests a "portfolio of hedge funds," ignoring the fact that most hedge funds require a minimum deposit of 500K. He also recommends a "bond ladder," an approach which can be easily replicated with a good bond mutual fund, and frequent rebalancing of your portfolio asset allocations. I don't need to spend $25 and five hours reading to learn that!  One thing I did learn from this book is the impact of volatility, which is often ignored in investment strategy recommendations. Volatility cuts into returns in ways that most studies do not account for. Most studies just average the returns across years, but that doesn't reflect real returns. Let's say you invest $100k into a stock that returns 35% the first year and -15% the second. Your average return should be 10% a year, right? Wrong. At the end of the first year you have 135k. Minus 15% the second year leaves you with 115k total, equal to 7% a year compounded. If you had received 10% a year compounded, your final total would be over 121k. That's 6k difference in just 2 years, and the volatility costs add up.  The book is very poorly written, plodding, sooooo boring, with tons of repetition. Just as an example, the graph showing the "Y curve" relationship between P/E ratio and inflation is repeated no less than 3 times. 
 I purchased my version of El Hazard from a zShop for 19 bucks and I am SO glad that I did. That said, the first series is worth watching for two main reasons: overt lesbianism and Jinnai. The former is self-explanatory while the latter (Jinnai) is without a doubt the best character in the series (despite the fact that he is the antagonist). You can't say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed, but throughout the first series Jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed-out character, as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature. This superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story's main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging. And this is what makes the second series (all four dismal episodes) so tragic: they nerfed Jinnai. He could never have been called a genius in the first series, but he was decidedly intelligent, cool, pragmatic, supremely self-confident and an effective leader (even though he was also manic and delusional). In El Hazard II, as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain, they have turned Jinnai into a slapstick-idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon. I suggest purchasing El Hazard through...alternate means,... watching the first series and discarding the second. Let's face it: even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty 
 And if you're not into comics, you won't care. What was Ronin Ro on?   Aside from glaring proofreading mistakes (on the same page, we are told that Kirby was stationed at an army base in 1945 and honorably discharged in 1943), this writer decides to take one of the most interesting and argued-about subjects in popular culture and present it as one continuous, here's-what-happened narrative, without ever citing his sources. No pictures, no index, nothing's ever sourced, corroborated or contested. Not only are conflicting versions of events never explored, but neither are the various other books and magazines Ro cribbed from ever cited. Hack-work, through and through.  If I sound angry, it's because this should have been great, at least as absorbing as Gerard Jones's excellent book, Men of Tomorrow. A good version of this book can be done, and I'd gladly shell out hardcover money for it.  Instead, it's like standing in a comics store, listening to some fool blather on, thinking to yourself, "you don't know that. How can anybody know that? Who told you that? You made that up," and finally, "just ring me up and let me out of here. 
 Purely on the merit of hearing one of their fab early singles on the radio, I took a risk and bought this album hoping for more of the same. Save track 5, what I found however was a real horror story of a let down- an atypical sterile eighties sound barely redeemed by the intermittently thought provoking lyrics. A poor mans Smiths, I consider this group to be the most over rated 'under rated' band of the eighties and regard said album as personal insult to a purhaser who spent three hours flipping burgers in a hot sweltering kitchen to pay for it 
 I dont know where they found this joker.  This music is simply not good.  Its like smooth jazz with this guy singing along to these ridiculously simple song structures that simply are repetitive and don't sound good.  This music goes absolutly no where and it is very boring.  A lot of  this guys music is [borrowed] too.  Also their is a song called Donkey Tonkey on here which really made me want to [hit] this guy, its like a kids anthem "Do the Donkey, the Donkey Tonkey" .. 
 After slogging all the way through this book, I came to Amazon, expecting to see a low rating. I am surprised to see that it has 4.5 stars (as of when I'm writing this review) and a lot of positive comments.  On the plus side, the author did take some interesting ideas and combine them in a way that makes sense. I don't mind the hours I spent reading this book because at least it made me think about a couple of things I hadn't realized before.  But on the other hand... there are really only a few important concepts in this book, and you can see what they are by reading a couple of the longer reviews here (like Coert Visser's or the one from "Dr. Professor Hossein Arsham." There's no need to read the whole thing unless you want to hear those same concepts explained over and over again 
 Sure, they look great in the book, but none of the projects in this book will ever come out looking like the examples.  It looks easy, but for little hands the drawings are kinda complicated.  I've seen better drawing books for this age group.  
 If Tom Perrotta meant "Joe College" to be a coming-of-age story, he fell flat on his face.  Danny (the protagonist) comes from a working-class family and struggles and scrapes his way into Yale.  Good for him!  Too bad that's not the story.  By the time we meet Danny, he's already an ivy leaguer.  Despite his proletariat backstory, Danny tends to behave just as selfishly and irresponsibly as any of his silver-spoon, trust-fund classmates who I guess we're supposed to think he's better than.    I don't want to give too much away here, so suffice it to say that Danny makes one of those BIG, life-altering mistakes that any guy can make. You know, the tried and true premise of the young man with everything going for him who suddenly faces something that threatens to screw up his future.  Does he face it like a man, resolve the conflict, and "grow" as a human being?  Nope.  Perrotta lets Danny get away with ignoring the serious consequences of his actions and, instead, focuses on a ridiculous sub-plot (or was it the main plot? I couldn't tell) about the mafia and ruthless bodybuilding snack food vendors.  What's worse, Danny basically gets a free pass.  He ignores his self-created crisis, and it just sort of fades away.  And once it's gone, Danny strolls right out and does the same, stupid thing he did the first time to get himself in serious trouble.  Lessee . . . a self-centered Yale student who makes big mistakes, screws up other people's lives, ignores the consequences, shirks responsibility, lets other people deal with his mistakes for him, and then caps it off by going out partying and acting irresponsibly again. 'Psssst,' Mr. Perrotta -- That's not the kind of character we root for.  That's the kind of character we boo. And occasionally elect President.  Two stars because "Joe College," despite its flawed premise, is pretty readable and provides some insight into the mildly interesting, seedy underworld of mobile snack stand vendors 
 Terrible. Chose some random girl -why? Kids are more advanced at this age if they are interested. Nothing special. Like to see a book on a true young talent early on 
 Some may disagree, and in fact, many have asked me why I disliked this one so much; so, here is why:  - scratch 'plotting'... by this point in the story, 'plodding' is more accurate.   - caracatures over characters. A staple of the series, 2d characters; but by this point, when new characters keep getting introduced this late in the story, it becomes an annoyance, a drag and overkill.   - virtually zero gain.  the entire first half of the book is a rescue mission for a minor character and the mission, once accomplished (or not) is forgotten by the end of the book. The third fourth of the book finally starts to swing thigns back to the original LB premise of end times doom and gloom thanks to the horrific judgments; sadly, it's very boring and slow. However...  -... the book doesn't get good until the last fourth.  And that, my friends, is not good for the overall quality of this entry in the series.   By this point, it's obvious that the authors were REALLY stretching it. However, as I said, things got really good in the last few chapters and led into 'Armageddon', one of the best books in the series. How ironic.   Thumbs way down for Left Behind: The Remnant. It's sad when the best part of the book is a scene involving the antichrist sunbathing on a rooftop. 
 The useful information in this book takes up about ten pages.  The book depicts women as unable to be happy or whole without a man to validate their very existence 
 I spent five months in Europe last year and used the Lonely Planet: Europe on a Shoestring guide. My travel companion brought the 2002 edition of the Rick Steves Europe guide and swore at the beginning of the trip that it had been recommended to him as "the bible of travel". After using both books extensively over the course of the trip, I've concluded that the Rick Steve's guides generally recommend eateries and accomodations that are far too expensive for the mediocre quality you get. Every single place we ate that was noted in the RS guide was disappointing. Some of the places we stayed in were just as shabby as any backpacker's hovel, yet we were paying non-budget prices. The hand-drawn maps are hokey and too specific to very small areas to be of any real use. Also, the hysterical lectures about not being an ugly American are annoying and condescending. The whole premise of the book, that you're being given the back-door "secrets" to smart, efficient travel, are absurd---it just makes sense that if you get to the Louvre 30 minutes before they open, you'll be first in line--no secret there. Anyone with common sense can manage in Europe without this guide. This is basically for people who are getting off a chartered tour bus to spend an hour amongst the natives before going back to the hotel. If you are looking for a thorough, informative guide written for competent adults, buy Lonely Planet instead!! 
 There is much to say about this book, and none of it is good.  I am not well-versed in Aboriginal culture.  However, I can tell when someone is fabricating information.  Marlo Morgan has a fine time making up all kinds of rediculous details about Aboriginal life and culture.  She even seems to frequently confuse Aboriginal culture with North American Native American practices.  In addition, her writing style is clunky and laughably bad in places.  She didn't even take the time to ensure that the "important message" that she was making up was cohesive or followed any internal logic.  She just rambles on about various New Age concepts, presneting a hackneyed and confusing message about the evils of Western Civilization.  The really funny part is that Morgan doesn't seem to be able to shake her ingrained ethnocentrism, as she makes rediculous claims about Aboriginee feet being "hoof like," and claims with a straight face that up until the 1990's, Australians didn't have window screens.  It's just bad all around. 
 ryan and scott from 'desert sons' continue their adventures.  their desert home suddenly seems to be bursting from the seams with homosexuals, each of whom seem to have some wicked agenda.  the boys must deal with all of this while also dealing with stresses on their relationship. i, like another reviewer, made the mistake of buying both 'desert sons' and this book at the same time.  this is a very sloppy work.  the characters are, or become, incredibly two-dimensional.  all the boys seem to only have 'sex' as a hobby.  the reactions of most characters to plot points is either forced or ridiculous.  the time of the story, never really established, is suddenly set as 1990/91 - in quite a jarring fashion, seeing the assumption is that it is occuring in the modern day.  again, the editing is poor to non-existent.  see if you can get by the three or four lines containg about twenty "huffs" without doing a doubletake.  every character seems to have a veritable horn of plenty attached to their bank account.  the finale, as it is, does nothing but wraps everything up like a neat little package.   very disappointing sequel to a very disappointing book 
 I was raised in Virginia and never understood the details of the Battle of Yorktown. Now I see the big picture and how all the regional events in the glorious cause fit together. Immediately after finishing this book I returned to Yorktown with an entirely different understanding. I could relive the battle as if I had been there during the war. It was fascinating! I never learned this from history books.  Male Age 60

 I have hope that someday Wes Craven will return to greatness, that his abilities as a filmmaker will once again outshine his horrible motives for movies like Scream 2, cursed, and Dracula 2000. I have waited patiently for him to make another cinematic cult classic like "A Nightmare on Elm Street" or "The Last House on the Left", but alas "Red Eye" fails to be anywhere near as good as those two previous movies. First of all, the flick is PG-13, which means no blood, no sex, and no good stuff that accounts for a horrible plot. A pair of breasts and a bloody brain splatter can make up for bad plot twists sometimes.  I must admit there are directors that can pull off a PG-13 horror flick but Wes Craven is not one of the chosen few. 	 As soon as the opening credits are over the plot has unfolded in my head, yeah it's that predictable. The main character Lisa is on the phone with her dad while in the airport. Her grandmother just kicked the bucket and she is hopping a red eye flight (creative title, huh) to visit daddy. Immediately you realize the old man has something to do with the story line, and he is obviously more than a destination point. While on the phone with Pops, Lisa puts him on hold to speak with Cynthia, a girl that is taking her place as hotel manager while she engages on her trip. Cynthia has to somehow be a victim.  Next Lisa meets a gentleman that buys her a drink in the airport bar and the two of them just so happen to sit next to each other on the airplane; he is obviously the bad guy. Not just because of the random circumstances, but he has those bad guy eyes. The movie is over from my point of view, besides a few inconsistencies, the viewer already knows that the father will be threatened if Lisa and Cynthia don't work together to make some violent action against a guest at the hotel. Now we all know that this won't happen because all crappy movies have happy endings. That is why seven was a splendid film by the way, the villain was triumphant. The guy that sits next Lisa on the plane will most likely be the only one who dies in the entire movie. It's all expected, and it's all dribble. Which may be why they made the movie PG-13, no one over the age of thirteen should be allowed to see it.  	This movie could have been saved, if the villain had a better plan, if he was more convincing. If the protagonist wouldn't be so heroic if her morals wouldn't be so goody two shoes. If the movie wasn't so black and white good versus evil it would have been tolerable.  
 I find the subject matter of the transition between the middle ages and the renaissance as a fascinating period.  This book focuses on the life and times of John of Gaunt, prince of England and the Duke of Lancaster.  One of the most powerful English Dukes who never became King, he is indeed an interesting figure and there is much of the book that is interesting in that regard.  I found the portrayal by the author of Gaunt as a pragmatist quite convincing in the context of the turbulent times that Gaunt dominated English politics.  His flirtations with the heresies of Wycliff and the patronage of the budding English humanism you find in Chaucer contrasts sharpely with a man devoted to English institutions and the well being of the Plantagenet dynasty.  There is much to recommend in this book that I enjoyed reading.  However, I found the author's writing style labored and difficult.  Some editorial comments meant to sound witty seemed out of place and detracted rather than added to the enjoyment of the book.  There were also some sentences that needed a good editor to correct some structure problems and even correct some spelling errors.  Unsupported assertions were also rife in the book.  Most disturbing was the fact that there were some significant historical inaccuracies in the book.For example, the author mentions a daughter of Gaunt and Catherine Swynford, Margaret Beaufort, who married Edmond Tudor who was the mother of Henry VII.  A little genealogical research shows that Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry VII was the daughter of John Beaufort, who was the son of John "Fairborn" Beaufort who was the son of John of Gaunt.  That makes Margaret Beaufort the great grand-daughter of John of Gaunt, a two generation discrepancy.  He also lists John Duke of Bedford as a grandson correctly since he was the son of Henry IV.  However he then goes on to list Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, the Duke of Bedford's younger brother, as John of Gaunt's great-grandson.  A second pair of eyes and a good editor should have been able to detect these errors and correct them.    The writing style and editing problems detract significantly from the overall historical value of this book.  If the author had remained alive, I would have hoped he would in the future revise the book, correct the problems and perhaps add some more information about Gaunt's Beaufort children and grand-children who were so significant in the political history  of England in the 15th Century.    Some day, I hope a better writer comes along and takes the subject matter Norman Cantor addressed and presents it in a more substantial and substantiated way.   
 We bought this for our three-year-old daughter. I do not even know where to begin to convey my disappointment. This is no better than a plastic toy that lights up as you push buttons.   First, The price of the unit plus the software is ridiculous for what you actually get.  Second, the software is a JOKE. It is not intuitive. It is not challenging. It is hardly interactive. There is nothing to be learned except the word "dummy".  The voices are disturbing and the diaglogue is snippy at some times. Most of the time you just sit there and watch what little content is available on each program, instead of interacting and learning.  It is actually worse than plopping your toddler in front of the TV.   The overall concept and idea is good and we were very excited about it. We were expecting to learn colors, numbers, letters, and a lot more interactivity such as games,puzzles and problem solving.  There is freeware/shareware available on the internet that is far better than this. I'm wondering who was consulted when Comfy designed this stuff. I was an early childhood educator for 10 years and I would never have used this in my class.  The software titles we purchased are Christmas in Comfyland, Joy of Music, Animal World, Your Neighborhood, and World of Colors. All a complete and total waste of money. I am so sick about it. I know I sound harsh, but I don't want anyone to waste their money like we did. 
 Usually I can't put a Niven book down.  This one was hard to pick up.  Very slow going 
 At some point, nearing the end of the novel, someone arrives in the Land of Dead where souls suffer by deteriorating at infinitely slow rates and not having the ability to cease to exist completely.  This is a pretty decent metaphor for how I felt approaching the last 100 pages of this book.    I am someone who absolutely loved both "Name of the Rose" and "Foucault's Pendulum" and I, naturally, expected more of the same.  If you're like me, you will not find it here.  Maybe about 20% of the book is genuinely enjoyable, and it offers some juicy tid-bits thrown in that are only appreciable by people intimately familiar with "The Three Musketeers," which, fortunately, I am.  As for the rest, I often caught myself asking "Why am I still reading this?"  For all my earnest suffering and faith, there was no payoff in the end 
 I LOVED my Timex, at first.  I have had it 6 months and have put 3 batteries in it, I give up!  I guess Timex no longer "takes a licking and keeps on ticking".  I am going back to Fossil brand 
 If any kid music annoys you, this CD is NOT for you.  These are good old classic songs, but almost ruined with strange styles and irrelevant talking to intro the songs.  I'm throwing it away.  I want my two-year-old to know the songs I know and love, but this was a bad buy on my part.  
 As is often the case with this style of music ( elevator , hospital lounges , dentist's offices muzak ), this  is an unfailingly, numbingly pleasant, but unexceptional album that sounds appealing enough when it's on but isn't compelling enough to get excited about. This is the sort of album that is almost anaesthetic, you put it on while peeling potatoes or folding the laundry - in fact, best not to put it on at all.  Absolutely safe , lazy , dull , boring , cheesy and fishy...nothing fresh or new. Flat boredom.   In the same league of the latest albums by Rod Stewart , Selline Dion , Kenny G. , Bette Midler , Carly Simon...you know what I am talking about.... 
 As others have noted, this is NOT the uncut version, but rather the very watered down R-rated version.  I have the R-rated copy, as well as this "director's cut", and they are identical.  This was either a grossly negligent error on the part of the studio, or a deliberate misrepresentation for the sake of increased sales.  Either way, if the real deal is what you seek, be forewarned and stay clear of this disk 
 This is the worst teensploitation film I've ever seen. The jokes are flat and uninspired. There is absolutely no new ground broken here. Not a single memorable moment, with the exception of a slow motion scene in a woman's shower room.  But if it's skin you're looking for, hasn't the internet made movies like this obsolete? Why do I need to sit through 100 minutes of dumb plot and jokes that are all dead on arrival when I can take two minutes to do a google search for Vida Guera 
 I'm a Certified Nurse Midwife who ordered this book with great anticipation.  What a disappointment.  Dr. Wagner presents statistics and research that support his personal agenda rather than giving a balanced, objective analysis.  Some of his examples and anecdotes are so implausible, they're downright absurd.  While I agree that the USA has "a broken maternity system (that) must be fixed,"  this book will only serve to cause further alienation between obstetricians, midwives, and clients.  If you're interested in this topic, read books by Robbie Davis-Floyd or Henci Goer or "Expecting Trouble: The Myth of Prenatal Care in America" by Thomas H. Strong Jr.     
 Had high hopes when I got this book. Sadly letdown. The book gives a tired old treatment of using a black list to check against the header of a mail message. Now not all spammers forge the header. But many do, as known for years. And they don't just forge the From line. They can also forge the Received lines.  When the author wrote the previous review, he mentioned the Received header lines. But, in general, for an ISP, the only valid header info is what the ISP itself writes. Received lines not written by the ISP can also be forged.   So using a black list on a header can easily be defeated by a spammer. And is being done so by many of them.  But Schwartz goes on to say that SA can now apply the black list against the body links. GREAT! Awesome. This is the key difference between 3.0 and the earlier stuff. Yet, when I went thru the book, I did not see any mention of this. Okay, perhaps I missed it. But if the book actually talks about it, it is in a very obscure fashion.  The new ability in 3.0 is seminal. Because while a spammer can forge headers, if he wants users to click through to his site, he has to write a valid address for himself. When AOL implemented this idea [not using SA] earlier this year, they said it led to the first documented decrease in spam they'd seen.  I repeat- if the book didn't mention the new 3.0 ability, it is grossly deficient. If it did mention it, but scantily, ditto. It certainly deserves at least as much space as was given to Mr Bayes.    
 It wasn't a bad movie except for all the killing. How about a nice movie where people just get along? Instead, this crazy michael myers guy runs around killing all the teenie weeners and ruins halloween for everyone. This character totally ruined the movie. Pleasent Donald demonstrated some good acting but I had a hard time telling him apart from that buttugly Jamie Lee Curtis 
 the plot is a little bit superficial and has, like the film industry, not really some depth to think about. it's a discworld book with all this nice highlights of writing style but as the main red line is not a very interesting one to me, i find this book one of the lower quality discworld ones... if you are a discworld fan, then it's of course for you, but if you are looking for a first discworld book, then make sure it's not this but instead e.g. Small Gods or Monstrous Regiment or Pyramid 
 I have an order stuck in limbo that Amazon claims they cannot remove from their system. I ordered two Roomba products together back in Dec-2006. According to Amazon, one of the products is from another supplier, and that supplier still does not have the product in stock. Anyway, the result is that I get email from Amazon every week that the shipment has been delayed, but the email, and repeated phone calls to Amazon, indicate there is no way to get this order stopped, so the emails keep rolling in.  To Amazon's credit, my second phone call did result in a creation of a new order and the shipment of the one product in this order they did have in stock, but the old order (with both products) is still stuck in their system.  This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with Amazon. 
 for non writers who manipulate everything to suit their conceptions.  the FACTS completely debunk this book.  Thankfully, these men will fade; the true mysteries remain unanswered waiting, perhaps, for someone without personal gain to cull through, define and present.  What a nasty book 
 I'll start by saying I know first hand that writing a novel is NOT easy...with that said, I didn't care to much for the author's style with this book...She chose to narrate through the voice of her main character, Ceazia but she often mixed that up by telling what the other characters where thinking and feeling...You can either tell it from one person's perspective or in order to incoporate everyone's thoughts and feelings, tell it from the outside as you the author being the main narrator...That was my biggest pet peeve with this novel...Another one was that certain instances and situations could have and should have been elaborated because after reading them I was like--HUH??? and because I read this one after Married to the Game, it's sequel--I know those situations were not spoke upon ever again.  I think she introduced too many characters and tried to juggle too many story lines...It could have been a better book if she either elaborated or eliminated certain aspects of the story...All in all, I give 2 stars for effort... 
 When you watch commercial children's television, you have to accept the commercials because, after all, the programs are "free". But when you pay to subscribe to Nickelodeon magazine, I don't expect for it so be so full of alluring ads targeting children. These ads appear similar to the editorial content. It seems like 50% of the pages are advertisements!  I was disappointed and won't be renewing our subscription. Better to look at something from the Highlights magazine series. 
 one word.  generic.  terrible.  boring. (well, they are all one word)  people must learn to have a better taste in music.  granted there is at least one good song.  a few others are decent, but only because there are no vocals.  if you have heard any new band for the last 3 years, you have heard pulse ultra.  my friend likes breaking binjaman (another uber generic rock band in my book) and he listened to 2 songs from pulse ultra and said "thats enough".  do yourself a favor and buy a GOOD cd.  when will people learn! 
 If I could I would give this book two and a half stars, but 2 will do.  I am a complete noob when it comes to Linux and got this book for class.  The book is getting really outdated.  I had several different problems installing fedora and it was no hope.  Not a great guide for a true beginner but makes a decent reference.  I like a lot of examples when starting something new and the examples in this book are lacking.  For being 1,000 pages its surprising what is left out 
 I'd give it 0 starts if that was an option!  A total piece of crap! Try cleaning it, and the head falls apart! Try putting it back together, and plan on doing nothing else for a LONG TIME! DO NOT buy this razor 
 Larsen's treatment of spirituality is severely lacking.  In fact, to put "spirituality" in the title of this book is extremely misleading.  The text is simply a concise treatment of basic systematic theology written at about an undergraduate level.  The only thing Larsen includes that might possibly justify the title is a small section at the end of each chapter that asks questions about how the principles he lays out are applicable to life, but that's a far cry from what he set out to his readers.    Now, I suppose if you're looking for a very simple, basic text on Christian systematic theology, this would do the job fairly well, but to state that it is directly related to Christian spirituality is simply false.  For a theological treatment of spirituality, a much better text is Simon Chan's Spiritual Theology 
 This was originally published in 1911 and promulgates the author's task management system.  This was the beginning of the "scientific management" line of research and so is widely credited as being the first management science book.  The essay certainly provides an interesting window into an earlier time.  He also illustrates how implementation of management tools requires leadership for success.  Still, a reader shouldn't plan on taking away a great many lessons not available from other sources.  The book should appeal mainly to those specialists working in the field and to historians rather than most readers 
 I bought this book so I'd have something interesting to read during my son's tonsillectomy last fall.  I was hoping to enjoy the torrid love scenes in it!  I got half-way through the book, and it bothered me so much (my own issues getting in the way?), I put the book away.  I felt Anna was emotionally neglecting her daughter, Molly, while involved in her lustful dysfunctional relationship with Leo.  I didn't like any of the main characters, including Molly---all too unrealistic.  But I picked up the book yesterday and finished it.  The book was too flat!  Though I don't think she was a BAD mom, she certainly exercised poor judgment (and for what?  Like Leo was a good catch?)!  I wasted my time (I don't read books very often) on this story.  Yet I did read the whole book, hoping it would get better, so I'm giving it 2 stars.  I didn't think I'd get any more of Sue Miller's books, but other reviewers said she has better novels 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 Very basic book, only for beginners. Better books available 
 im not sure why i gave this a second star; maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with? directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman (the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious "adaptation"), this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer (john cusack) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz 
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 I do not know who the target audience was here, but it certainly was not me, and I am a big Hayek fan. This book is way over my head. Perhaps a doctorate in economics or philosophy would make this work easier to read, but I don't think the average intelligent, interested reader will want to struggle though this material. It never comes up for air. 
 Easy to see why this book didn't sell very well. Sorry, guys, but the kids in the Metallica t-shirts really did it. No, dem 'der hicks in Arkansas weren't just looking for innocent teenagers to execute 
 I always like to give new authors a chance, so I read "When Death Comes Stealing" hoping for a good mystery.  What I got were 2 characters that I liked a lot, Tamara and Jamal, but very little actual  detection from a supposed private eye.  Try Marcia Muller or Sue Grafton if  you want good mystery and detection from a female writer. I will probably  not read another of Wesley's books.  I love mysteries, and mysteries  without plot are no good 
 This book was OK. I had to read it for school but I agree that it had way too many narrations in it and the only thing that captured the teens' feelings and thoughts were the scant entries from their diaries. This book didn't move me at all. If the author had put more of the kids' entries in it, it might be more effective 
 I have this dispenser in an area where it only gets used once a day.  It takes 3 activations even at the max setting to get enough soap to wash your hands.  If you let it sit without using it for a couple days, it takes 1-2 activations before any soap at all comes out.  Performance degrades further as amount of soap in dispenser decreases.  Soap in it is Dial antibacterial.   A mechanical dispenser would work better than this 
 The quality is not consistant with all the other items I have ordered from Amazon.  The pages of the book fall apart easily. Also, the recemmended age group is 9-12 and the book uses profanity.  It is not necessary to use such profanity or any profanity for this age group.  I have returned the item and will be more cautious in the future 
 I bought this cd because I heard Blood on motorway, in a commercial. I thought it was a hot jig. Will, It wasnt like the commercial. I wasnt expecting Suicide lyrics and empty crys of the synthesizer. It was a waste of my 14.99 and Im resaling it 
 The tao te ching is a great book, I'm not giving that a one star review, I'm giving mitchell's interpretation of it one star.  As many other reviews have stated, he doesn't speak chinese, so this translation is comprised of his reading other peoples' translations and what he thinks it means.  He then tries to modernize it and make it accessible to 21st century americans.  I like the old world feel of this book, you don't need to change swords to nuclear warheads, I know what a sword is.  At least though, this change makes sense, some chapters Mitchell changes so much, that the entire chapter loses its meaning.  A couple chapters made no sense, so I went to the back of the book where he tells what parts he changed, and then I was able to understand exactly what Lao Tzu intended to say.  Don't buy this book.  
 Here is the problem with Sting: his music is too serious to work as simple pop music (most of the time), but not nearly profound enough to work as anything else. This isn't a new thing, it was evident sometimes with the Police, but the coolest rhythm section in the history of rock n' roll grounded his musings from being completely self-absorbed and fanciful. Sting's old lyrics felt intelligent and witty, and even heartbreakingly personal at times, though that could just have been a product of the music that was propping them up; it's hard to tell whether Sting, a working class guy whose talent allowed him an escape from the ills of 1970s Britain, ever quite wanted to think back too hard on them. Synchronicity is one of my favorite albums of the '80s, and one of those rare cases where something kept on selling and selling and actually deserved it. But even as Police songs grew increasingly contemplative, they were kept from, say, U2's ability to move a listener, by their singer's playful refusal to sound like he meant it. Whether he was crying about his girl having left him, the deadness of modern life or writing conceptual songs around Carl Jung, it somehow always felt like he was having too much of a lark. Sting always looks like he's about to wink at you, and in music that tries so hard to be serious, that's a flaw.  Sting left the Police in the mid '80s after only five albums. He was still young, and not a single of the great Police songs had been written by anyone other than Sting, so naturally people expected great things. Left to his own devices, the man formerly known as Gordon Sumner didn't exactly take the Phil Collins route, but he didn't rise to Peter Gabriel's level either. Claiming a middle ground in the adult-pop landscape, he tried to be the cool, laid back intellectual, neither avant garde nor simplistic. Unfortunately, it wasn't the 1940s, and Sting's limited range, which had sold songs full of jagged guitars and loud drums, sounded rather wimpy when backed by strings and saxes. He managed to pander and experiment in equal measures, but the pandering wasn't catchy and the experimentation wasn't exciting. Sting carved a lucrative niche for himself, appealing to musicologists more concerned with "complexity" (a showy jazz progression, time signature or Marsalis guest appearance here) than solid songwriting, and then to the large cadre of people who didn't really care what music they listened to, so long as it was suitably unobtrusive and "classy." I suspect restaurant owners are greatful to Sting as well-- in some ways he's just a more tasteful, and probably less talented, Billy Joel.  But aside from the occasional hit that disappeared from memory as soon as it racked up its Grammy, most people stopped paying attention. In my opinion, he managed one great album, the mostly ignored Soul Cages in 1991, which isn't without faults but is one of the few times you can feel he did really mean it. And some nice singles here and there, before and after. But nothing memorable. "Russians love their children too." Well, okay.  Brand New Day, title aside, is more of the same, a perfectly Sting Sting album, and even more forgettable than previous ones. Perhaps he still appeals to the international market. Sometime in the late '90s, Sting apparently decided lounge-jazz and uillean pipes were a little passe, and met up with North African star Cheb Mami and some Euro-African rappers. They provide what little life there is in this album, but unfortunately they're confined to two tracks. First off, the single "Desert Rose" is possibly the most exciting song in Sting's entire career. (This is just as much a faint compliment as saying "We Didn't Start the Fire" is the most exciting song in Billy Joel's career, but hey, that's true too.)  Beginning with a nice ethnic lounge rhythm... oh whatever, everyone knows "Desert Rose," don't they? It's not earth shattering like "King of Pain" or "Message in a Bottle" (or even "All This Time"), but it's a shatteringly great pop song with some clever lyrics you can make the leap of taking seriously if you want to, the music is so good. I would take this kind of thing over "Fields of Gold" any day.  The other moderately exciting moment is "Perfect Love... Gone Wrong." It's a mess of a song and like Peter Gabriel's recent work, betrays its obvious origins as a lot of little fragments polished over too many years in too many studios with too many collaborators, but at least for a couple minutes, the collaborators create a banging ethnic club rhythm and rap over it more excitingly than Sting will ever sing again, so I'm happy. I'll also give credit where it's due for those who prefer the more sedate Sting stylings-- "A Thousand Years" is a good 6 minute piece of commercially uncommercial ethnic adult pop, plodding along beautifully until the lyrics get too ridiculous (when Sting compares himself to a "common thief" it's time to get out of the building).  I hate posturing. Overt intellectualism is not needed to write intelligent pop songs, good pop songs don't have to be intelligent anyway, and Sting's lyrics are not actually intellectual, they are fancy without being thought provoking. If you're a skeptic but want to see what the fuss is about, get the entire Police catalog and then move onto The Soul Cages. If you basically like Sting in all his phases and played "Moon Over Bourbon Street" at your wedding, break out the wine and get this album, it can't help but be just nondescript enough to appeal. If you're more of a pop fan and expecting an album full of "Desert Rose," get a greatest hits or something, nothing else is remotely that catchy. Most of the songs here do not really have melodies, are not really about anything, would only be interesting to an insurance salesman, and go on forever. "Fill Her Up" is bad enough to actually be memorable, but is it a lame feel-good country tune or an indictment of America's selfish materialism? As with most Sting stuff, if you think too much about it, you'll realize it doesn't really mean anything. Sting is a pinup for people who've long outgrown lockers, and who've forgotten why they started listening to music in the first place 
 The decline of Christianity!  Right.  There aren't too many Christians around anymore.  Besides that obvious, astonishing oversight, I expected worse in regards to a biased perspective Crusades, and was appeased at the author's acknowledgement of the silmultaneous atrocities of Islam.  While attempting Biblical higher criticism assumes massive arrogance on the part of the critic, Johnson remains as balanced as one could expect.  But in the last analysis, Christianity is a lot more than a history, and claiming to be able to explain Christianity as a historical specimen assumes both monstrous egotism and unimaginable naivete 
 I recently lost a lot respect for michael after he said "burn the Mexican flag". How about if we burn the israelie flag. After all it was israel that attacked the USS Liberty and hired that snack Jonathan Pollard to spy on us. But am sure michael would never bring the stuff that I just mention, because in his eyes israel is spotless.   People like him are brainwashing Americans that it is "un-American not to support israel, but has anyone read the talmud says about Jesus. Here's a sample. Read it and ask yourself why are we so blindy supporting israel.    He and his disciples practiced sorcery and black magic, led Jews astray into idolatry, and were sponsored by foreign, gentile powers for the purpose of subverting Jewish worship (Sanhedrin 43a). He was sexually immoral, worshipped statues of stone (a brick is mentioned), was cut off from the Jewish people for his wickedness, and refused to repent (Sanhedrin 107b; Sotah 47a). He learned witchcraft in Egypt and, to perform miracles, used procedures that involved cutting his flesh, which is also explicitly banned in the Bible (Shabbos 104b). Says Jesus ("Yeshu" and in Soncino footnote #6, Yeshu "the Nazarene") was executed because he practiced sorcery: "It is taught that on the eve of Passover Jesus was hung, and forty days before this the proclamation was made: Jesus is to be stoned to death because he has practiced sorcery and has lured the people to idolatry...He was an enticer and of such thou shalt not pity or condone."(Sanhedrin 43a).  Here are two early "Holocaust" tales from the Talmud: Gittin 57b. Claims that four billion Jews were killed by the Romans in the city of Bethar. Gittin 58a claims that 16 million Jewish children were wrapped in scrolls and burned alive by the Romans. (Ancient demography indicates that there were not 16 million Jews in the entire world at that time, much less 16 million Jewish children or four billion Jews).  Pharisaic Rituals. Erubin 21b. "Rabbi Akiba said to him, "Give me some water to wash my hands." "It will not suffice for drinking," the other complained, "will it suffice for washing your hands?" "What can I do?' the former replied, "when for neglecting the words of the Rabbis one deserves death? It is better that I myself should die than that I transgress against the opinion of my colleagues." [This is the ritual hand washing condemned by Jesus in Matthew 15: 1-9].  Rabbi Tovia Singer once said "Jesus in the talmud is neither righteous nor the messiah.  One more thing has anyone heard of the "1919 holocaust that failed". I also recommed reading "the 13th tribe".  (9/7/06)  The anti-black jewish task force once poked fun at Muhammed for getting married to 9 year old girl(I don't agree with that either) But the talmud doesn't seem to think so. Here's what it says.   Sanhedrin 55b. A Jew may marry a three year old girl (specifically, three years "and a day" old.  Sanhedrin 54b. A Jew may have sex with a child as long as the child is less than nine years old.  Kethuboth 11b. "When a grown-up man has intercourse with a little girl it is nothing.    Here's some more Sick and Insane Teachings of the Talmud: Yebamoth 63a. States that Adam had sexual intercourse with all the animals in the Garden of Eden. Yebamoth 63a. Declares that agriculture is the lowest of occupations. (Maybe this is why Ariel Sharon's little brother Glenn Spencer doesn't like Mexicans)  Sanhedrin 106a . Says Jesus' mother was a whore: "She who was the descendant of princes and governors played the harlot with carpenters." Also in footnote #2 to Shabbath 104b of the Soncino edition, it is stated that in the "uncensored" text of the Talmud it is written that Jesus mother, "Miriam the hairdresser," had sex with many men.     
 First of all, this software performs like someones term project.  Why havent these guys been sued yet? Pros:   Nice retail packaging  Cons:   Not tested Doesnt burn all your files NO support Overall a waste of moner  
 Sat down and saw this one on televion.  Only good service was that now I know buying the DVD would be a waste of money.  What was actually achieved by the British is portrayed as an American achievement. Slanders the U-boat men portraying them as heartless marauders. Other than allied Propoganda pieces, There are no incidents of U-boats machinegunning people in lifeboats.   The movie itself I have little respect. Basicly Plotless and  unrealistic. Action scenes unbelievable. Characters Two Dimensional.   This film Awful. 
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing

 The plot development in this book is virtually non-existent. To cap it all off, the ending sucks. You are led to believe that the book might get interesting in the end, but NO! I would not recommend this book to anyone because it is awful. A good ending could have saved it, but the ending was terrible 
 This book is organized into chapter topics such as Cosmic inheritances, Being, Knowing, Society, Polity and so on. The value of the book is the extensive quotations he has assembled from Calvin on each of the chapter topics. In that sense, the book functions almost as an index of Calvin's thought, and it's valuable for scholars looking for quotations from Calvin on specific topics.   The title advertises the book as a biography, but it's not. Bouwsma states that the biographical facts of Calvin's life have been covered elsewhere, and he does not plan to revisit that ground. So we have a biography of Calvin which assumes that you have already read his biography elsewhere! Much of what Bouwsma argues doesn't make much sense without knowledge of Calvin's life and time. Dividing Calvin into arbitrary and abstract topic areas fragments his thought unnecessarily, distorting his life and thought.   Bouwsma sets up a strawman to his position, that Calvin's debt to Renaissance humanism has been ignored. This is not true at all. In fact, Calvin's debt to humanism is virtually a truism of Calvin scholarship. Unfortunately, Bouwsma's approach here is typical of post-modern revisionary historical scholarship.   Bouwsma's interpretation of Calvin is deeply problematic for a number of reasons. First of all, he portrays Calvin's thought as essentially a reaction to the uncertain times in which he lived, and to Calvin's own anxieties and fears. Calvin emerges here as depressed, anxious, and neurotic. That's a very one-sided view, and there's just not enough evidence to support that claim. It seems very reductive to interpret Calvin's theology as just an expression of his personal insecurities. What's missing here is any kind of larger historical perspective that can explore and appreciate the constructive dimension to his thought. Calvin is a hugely influential thinker who contributed to the development of modernity, but to read Bouwsma, one might think Calvin was merely an obscure pastor obsessed with his own anxieties 
 This product had adequate suction while it lasted which was about 4 months.  One day it just stopped working, I can only assume that the motor died 
 I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book 
 I can't beleve that Ritchie Blackmore- the premier guitar virtuoso of Deep Purple and Rainbow would plummet to a style that has no relationship with Rock and Roll.  This is all midevil crap that sounds like it should be in a musical or footstomp or the toilet!  If you are looking for vintage Blackmore don't buy these Blackmore's Knight recordings.  You will be disappointed, shocked, stunned and disillusioned.  [...] 
 I was absolutely thrilled with volumes 1-4 in this series. This was, stylistically, more jazzy than chill. It has been a couple years since they released a chill colection. I think that after the feedback they got on this one, they gave up. Nooooo- Just bring back the producers on 1-4 
 My Collie doesn't like this toy and has only ever had it out of her toy box once and then it just sat on the floor.  Would not recommend it to anyone else 
 the area around the velcro has already started to fray. This was a Christmas gift so she has not had them long. I think that the quality should be better. The knee pads and elbow pads do seem to protect well 
 Oh no! What's happened to one of the best Western writers in romance? This is such a mediocre effort by Thomas. I have loved her books, but I could barely get through this one. It starts off very slowly, but I was willing to keep reading because I know what Thomas is capable of. The story does get interesting as we learn more about the hero and heroine. But, unfortunately, the book then becomes very inconsistent. Certain parts of the plot are page-turningly good, but then chapter after chapter in the middle were dead bores. The inconsistent quality of the drama started wearing me down. I just couldn't keep interested in what happens to these characters. The heroine, in particular, is not very likeable. She dreams of the hero and loves him from a distance and from his letters, but then is mean to him when she sees him again in person. I'm sorry to say that I would not recommend this Thomas book. "Texas Rain" is the start of a new series, and I'm hoping that the next one is better. 
 Christians beware! This book hides dangerous cultic teachings behind the so called spiritual insights from the Ten Commandments. This book gives a cultic (even satanic) twist to the Decalogue (ie.  evil can masquerade as an angel of light).  It is indeed a deceptive Trojan horse filled with "Christian Science" heresies.   According to Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the First Church of Christ, Scientist, universally known as Christian Science, Jesus could not die for Man's sins, because Mankind never sinned; Christ did not really die on the cross therefore He resurrected from non-death. Christian Science also declares that the Scriptures cannot properly be interpreted in a literal way, and thus, the truth of scripture must be spiritually discerned before its message can be applied to our lives.  Therefore, this book is hiding harmful non-Christian (new thought / new age style) metaphysics and psychic interpretations behind the precepts of the Ten Commandments.  Moreover, Fox here promotes a salvation by works and positive thinking that is foreign to the Bible.  For those who wrote positive reviews of this book I want to say that Christianity is not about spirits seeking and deep trances, but it is all about the finding of the only Spirit of God, deep thankfulness in sincere meditation on the Gospel of the Cross, and above all, a relationship with God through His resurrected Son, Jesus Christ who died for our sins, so that we can be saved by the grace of God through faith alone.   Emmet Fox's books can indeed change your life but in a wrong direction.  The teachings and interpretations of the Christian Science are not at all Christian and are also foreign to Judaism.  This cult resembles more eastern mysticism rather than Judeo-Christian doctrines.  Also this is not at all science.    I am amazed by how its people perceive the teachings of Christian science as being enlightened and how they see themselves as being thinkers.  This is complete ignorance.  These people do not even know how to think, much less how to think critically.  They are ignorant about the doctrines of the Bible, ignorant of theological, cultural exegesis, ignorant of historical / textual criticism, and ignorant about real, genuine science.  The religion of (non)Christian (non)science is theologically, philosophically, Biblically and scientifically false; its roads end in eternal damnation 
 This is another book by the comedy duo Schroeder and Ostrander - the gullible pair who were obviously duped into believeing pro-Soviet hype for a "magic" learning system called "Superlearning" that they put together after so called demonstrations of wonderous and effortless learning in communist Bulgaria in the 70's. You only need to read my other reviews to see just what I think of the crap the Superlearning company produces! Anyway, it looks like they also fell for more hype and propaganda from Russia this time! Look at some of the titles in the book "Is it getting crowded on the moon?"!!! Come on! Some of the accounts they give are just so obviously contrived, such as the 8 foot alian who landed in Voronezh and took a stroll through a crowded square with his smaller companion that he called "robot". Robot? You mean he/it said that in English or Russian? Maybe it was Czech, after all "robot"is a word coined by a Czech author! It isn't Star Trek where every life form speaks English for our benefit! How they could be taken in I'll never know...or were they taken in? It's a good money spinner, after all! And just who provided all the statistics and experimental findings? It wasn't the same kind of people who gave them the "facts" about Suggestopedia and those convoluted retention rates, was it? I'm sure the Soviets were totally decent people who wouldn't dream of making things up, would they. Next the'll be saying that the moon landings never took place. I ask you!!! This title is another piece of idiotic fiction to add to your "Superlearning" collection 
 I was actually very impressed by the material in the book and would have undoubtly given it 5 stars. BUT something very fishy made me change my mind. I applied to enroll into the Robert Allen Instiitute mentorship program for real estate investment (details are online). I got a call from the Program and a sales person like sounding gentleman, who threw around his weight and suggested multiple times that it would be an honor for me to be chosen for the mentorship program spoke to me for an hour...And then he and his supervisor suggested that if I trusted Robert Allen, I should give him my credit card number for a charge of 6000-10000$!!!!. 'It takes money to make money' he said. When I told him that he will need to tell me how many perople are actually in the program and how many actually make money, he was caught offguard...at the end of the conversation he was frankly rude and said 'Well, think about it, all you have done in your life so far is made 80000$ a year'...I mean how unclassy can you get!!...well thank you Mr Allen and your sales-people...I sure can tell how you have made your money 
 I'm having a hard time doing this routine through because I can't follow the instructions very well. The camera angles change too quickly and in the middle of movements, so I can't keep oriented and figure out what I'm supposed to be doing. It's very frustrating. 
 The program works fine on Windows XP and is easy to use. It lets you print cards of many sizes. The big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program. The back of the box claims "4500+ Cards and Sentiments, Celebrate life's special moments with cards for all occasions". That's nice. The problem with that is that I counted the total number of cards that come with the program.  It only adds up to 1045! So where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments? Are you supposed to design them yourself? I just don't know. And certainly "cards for all occasions" means just that, doesn't it?  Well there's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind. I guess you just need to buy those on your own 
 After advent of "Orientalism" by Edward Said, the playing field is even. This Book by Romila Thapar is an Outdated Marxist Rhetoric 
 It can indeed be extremely stressful for a Japanese speaking foreigner working at a Japanese company in Japan. I say this from direct personal experience. But my impression is that the author's only skill was the ability to speak Japanese. She had no basic office skills e.g. she was unable to perform simple calculations. And she had neither business training nor business experience. Amelie Nouthomb's degree was in philology not business or economics or finance. This being the case she was unqualified to perform any complex tasks. Little wonder that her brief experience of working in Japan was such a disaster. 
 If you read the outside cover of the CD Audiobook, you get the impression that the volume strongly will deal with the manner in which FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt led the country during World War II.  However, what you get is more often innuendo about FDR's fascination with women other than his wife, whether his prviate secretaries, a visiting princess, or his mistress of many years.  Eleanor is covered in more detail than was expected, but she comes off pretty well, her husband's wandering eye notwithstanding.  Goodwin does provide some insight into the challenges of running the United States during the critical war years, but the amount of time devoted to private pursuits was not what was expected.  I had hoped for a lot more detail on the warimte effects of the economy, and the challenges it served the president.  I had hopes of more on FDR's handling of race and labor issues, but did not get it.  I had hopes of learning more about FDR's partnership with the Congress to achieve the nation's goals, but was disappointed there as well.  This was the first Goodwin book I picked up, and it didn't put me off enough to avoid her amazingly good Team of Rivals, about Lincoln and his cabinet.  Still, I remain disappointed that the book's cover and inside clearly focused on other issues than what was projected 
 This is much better than what used to be written on Hinduism in the West.  But Flood still has to travel some more distance. This book still speaks of  the Aryan invasions although archaeologists have abandoned that racist  theory 
 This doesn't include Rude Mood in either studio or live version, Travis Walk, Riviera Paradise, or any of his other unbelievable instrumental guitar workouts.  This compilation is a serious waste of money.  Virtually any album he put out would be better by itself than this compilation, especially Texas Flood or In Step.  Better yet by far, though, would be to get "The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble."  It's bargain priced, and contains every song you could want or expect, including the excellent, posthumously-released acoustic blues song, "Life By The Drop."  SRV is a guitarist worth discovering, but this compilation won't show you anything 
 I have never put down a book (actually, I have, once) I Have never left a series  unfinished I am leaving my third decade I have read this book one and a half year ago. No one goes anywhere and they go slowly. I Will probably finish the series when i get to be around seventy, so I can say that I've finished it and go in peace with myself and maybe get Mr. Jordan's hidden message, which I seriously doubt.  I am also posting this on book one, so no one goes unwarned, as the series started off pretty well.   Shame 
 I tried this and it didn't work. To this day I still am a smoker 
 The trade paper back was excellent what Marvel did here was take all of the character development, internal struggles, and just about all the debth to the story and threw it out the window and taked on an alien conspiracy to make more action (because pretty explosions is the only thing we need to make a good movie right?). Buy the book, movies like this is what makes comics still look bad. worst adaptation of the year. Quality control people 
 I purchased this camera for my 6 yr old daughter. It isn't even good enough for a child's toy camera!  She had asked for a camera with a flash and screen for viewing what she had taken photos of. This camera looked like it would fit the bill. It was small and "cool" looking, had a dock (great idea), Li-ion battery (great idea) and a skin (great idea.) Unfortunately it lacks the ability to take decent photos in varied environments (We are not always outside in the sun!) If they would put a better camera in the same package it would become very desirable. Save yourself the grief and buy something else. I'm getting a 5MP HP (for less money even! 
 Anyone with educational experience knows that good teachers try to make lessons engaging and meaningful. All this program does (if your district uses it) is create more work for educators with no real support or help, just a lot of demands in time and paper work. If you don't or didn't share and get help from your colleges before this program shame on you! How did you get through your Collage of Education?  Anyone with business experience knows this is just a great example of marketing; it plays on the notion of helping and lets administrators look like they have a plan to the public. If your district administrators needed this program they should have resigned their positions. After a few years of experience you should not have to invest the kind of money and resources this program requires. Who is making the money?  Who gets the kick backs? Not the classroom teacher who works longer hours than paid for already. Don't fall for the hype; this is just the latest educational reform gimmick. Making someone rich? Mark Twain had it figured out when it came to school boards.  Look it up. 
 Had I realized that this book was less about business and more about this man's faith I would not have bothered.  He seems to need constant reassurance that G_D is OK with us making money.  The theme becomes redundant and not terribly helpful.  I doubt that he will ever becoe a billionaire, but please let me know if he does

 20 odd years ago, when all I was reading was SCI-FI and fantasy, my mom insisted I read Ludlum's Bourne Identity. I remember really enjoying it and read several others of his through the years. Looked forward to and enjoyed the movies, but alas the Janson Directive, while fasted paced, offered me nothing new. Maybe it was the two recent movies with the agency's secret program always chasing someone, maybe those intervening 20 odd years of thrillers, suspense and techno thrillers made me an informed consumer.... Close but no cigar. Too many expected and predictable almost caught `yas / barely get-a-ways / one-ups-manships between the master vs. the disciple. I think today's readers have seen more than their fair share of someone being tracked by their best pupil or for that mater dusting off some ancient Obi-won to dispatch their star gone rogue to enjoy this book. 
 The camera case only works if you wear a belt-- there is no clip on. The case itself holds only the camera, not even space for a spare battery or memory card. (I've heard the case will darken your camera, but I didn't end up using the case). The neck strap is not useful, it's too long. At '34 inches, if you're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it. (The Canon Camera rocks, however. 
 Be warned!  This book is not about science!  I don't know know who this Henry Miller fellow is but he doesn't know anything about geography.  Imagine my surprise when I purchased this book--expecting to read about the earth's different latitudal circles--and discovered it has nothing to do with the Tropic of Cancer or any other latitudal lines!  In fact, the so-called "author" can't even seem to WRITE in a linear fashion!  I've heard that this "author" has a book about the Tropic of Capricorn out but I'm willing to bet that that one has nothing to do with latitude either!  
 i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me. nothing ever happens. there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story 
 I would not waste my time with this book.  The author provides you with some home based opportunities but you could find these offers in the back  of any magazine.  At the beginning of the book it states they have  researched the companies but then they go on the say that some offers my  not be current or legitimate 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 I bought this for an Xmas present and it has since been returned. It never "opened up" except in small spots throughout the pad.  It was a lumpy hard pad not more than 1/8 inch thick in most places.  It had yellow stains all over, like it had been left in the sun while rolled up.  Terrible.  I bought another one elsewhere and it was perfect.  Buyer, be aware.  
 The good thing about the book is its abundant information (more than you need, actually).  However, the writing is horrible!  I can't imagine how a person--a college professor in this case--can come up with such a poor job despite a very clear-cut framework.  Redundant and illogical paragraphs are no surprise in this book.  The first edition is bad, but believe me, the second one is even worse! Also, be fully prepared for loads of typographical errors and the mix-up of figures 
 I would like to review it. When are you going to send it to me 
  I'm a nineth grader in a small town and am being told to read this book for my English class. My teacher spent valuable budget money on a class set of this junk and I'm severely appalled.  First thing first, this book is hardly appropriate for a guy to read and is not school suitable, either. It also contains a good deal of profain language.  It appears to have the capability of reverse physcology and is definately dangerous. If you're shallow enough to just take it with a grain of salt and only read enough to write the report....it's great, but if you read into it......it's just strange. It almost encourages anorexia nervosa. Definately plenty of stereotyping as well.  Good punctuation, though....kudos to the editor.   Verdict: Not Suitable for Teenage Girls, Guys of any Age, High School Students, and of-their-rocker English teachers.  Anabelle W., Age 1 
 I thought this book had a lot of potential, but turned out to be a long-winded lament of Scilingo. It lacked a comprehensive historical overview of Argentinian politics, which would have placed the Dirty War in its proper context. Not useful for first time readers to modern Argentinian politics. Its not even a story of Scilingo himself. I found it a  bit clums 
 I am astounded to find out that Mr. Kinkade is even a worse author than he is a painter. This book is a perfect bathroom fit, not to read, but to wipe with 
 This is meant to be a mystery, but one can deduce the entire plot in almost the first couple of chapters.  Then it gets boring waiting and waiting for the rest of the characters to stumble over it!  A couple of the sub-plot characters (Regina & Lucy especially) are nothing more than boring caricatures. I was very disappointed in the whole satan worshiping mumbo jumbo mystery - doesn't seem like something Jane Austen would need to prop up her books. That said, the dialogue and general writing is great.  I really enjoyed the first half of the book that centered on Kitty and Harry's courtship.  I really wish there hadn't been all the aforementioned mumbo jumbo and instead Bebris had concentrated her obvious talents on the excitement of normal life 
 There are many reviews of this book that are on target.  I will keep mine short.  The author of the book is hostile to Christianity and hides behind supposed scholarship.  The book is largely biased opinions.  If one strains, one can find some useful information.  For anyone who wants to see the author's bias most clearly, get a copy of the book and look at the last page of the last chapter.  There, the author puts forth such an absurd anti-Christian, anti-Bible, and anti-American vision that the rest of the book is put clearly into the context from which the author writes.  I read the whole book, looking for a few nuggets, but finding few.  My recommendation is that this book is not worth reading and certainly not worth buying 
 was worthless...was not the correct match for my class book requirement.  Never used it...if someone wants it you can have it for free   
 The story is set up very well but goes nowhere. The world(present day England)from inside the mind of 15/y.o. autistic(or some similar syndrome)boy. Loaded with lots of gimmicks to fill up pages and make it look like a real book--lists, footnotes, sketches, diagrams, puzzles, maps, doodles, graphs and even an appendix. After 15 pages inside Christopher's mind one gets the basic feeling of how he sees the world and reacts to it. I personally don't think one needs 226 pages to get this across. After the first one third of the book the story became repetitive, tedious and boring 
 This is another of those books for me that was very "middle of the road".  It was not terrible and it was not great.  It was a bit slow for my tastes and the characters were very ordinary.  
 It's not that the actual story is nonsense but they guy has included so much 'fluff' that you get board waiting on a paragraph with real content.  This book was so frustrating, I really wish I had saved myself the bother of reading it 
 I purchased the cheese slicer to replace one from the 70's that finally gave out.  I pulled out a block of cheddar cheese and tried the new slicer.  The comfortable handle made holding the slicer a dream, but the dream ended quickly.  The wire broke halfway through the first slice!  Unlike my old slicer, this one does not have a screw on the side to re-attach the existing wire, adjust the tension or replace a broken wire.   Oxo's web site says they guarantee satisfaction, so I am going to see if I can actually get it replaced without paying more in shipping than I saved by buying this slicer rather than the fancier one 
 I just bought this book and I have to be honest that it really disappointed me. All the material inside is already known and has been explained from some other book like "Hyperspace" by Michio Kaku. The book just repeats some fact about kaluza-klein, flatlanders, mobius strip, supergravity or relativity theory of Einstein. It does not even consider explaining in detail the latest advancement in theoretical physics that explore the possibility of higher dimension or theory of everything as its title would suggest.   If you are looking for some introduction to popular science of space-time, matter and the universe in general, MAYBE this book will be suitable for you (even though I would advice you to get it from another book such as "Hyperspace" or "Parallel Worlds" by Michio Kaku). But if you are looking for some "advance" information in these area or the latest advancement in theoretical physics concerning the development of the Superstring, M-Theory, Brane Worlds and so on, this book is definitely NOT for you. 
 Some novelists are known for a pared down, no-nonsense approach to narrative, firmly delineated, plainspoken characters, crackling, lively dialogue, and swiftly moving, engrossing plots.  Lezama-Lima is not one of those authors.  It's hard to recommend a book that I have so many reservations about.  Yes, the writing is occasionally beautiful, and as an historical document of a certain type of artistic and literary milieu in Pre-Castro Cuba, it's worth something.  But I'm afraid that I'm going to have disagree with all of the reviewers here and say that LL's endless aestheticism must be something of an acquired taste.  The problem is that he writes prose too much like a poet--all florid circumlocutions with no feel for the rhythms of everyday life and speech.  No doubt he would have felt the everyday to be beneath his austere heights.  Nobody talks the way his characters do--it's all lengthy, abstruse theorizing on frequently esoteric subjects.  His essentially elitist approach to writing fiction would test the patience of anyone who looks to literature for a more immediate kind of connection.  And, sorry, Mr. White, LL is not the Latin American Proust--Proust is far more readable and speaks to more basic human experiences.          Sometimes some of the worst snobs are those (i.e., homosexuals) who have themselves suffered the most heinous abuse because of their dubious social stature--rather than reject the values of the mainstream, a writer like LL ends up embodying them and perpetuating them to an infuriating degree through his snobbish affectations.  Or else one could view his aesthetic vision as essentially escapist, understandable given the political situation in Cuba at the time.  Still, a more accurate view of what was actually happening might have been of more human interest--it would have been valuable to see how these characters strained to maintain their sensibility in view of what was actually occurring around them.  But, as it is, the book seems to exist in a vacuum with no real connection to the political situation in Cuba--its Eurocentric preoccupations offend.    
 What does it mean when someone gets excessively-defensive? It doesn't express that they have peace or comfort with themselves.  Writing sludge like this just fuels the fire - that I suppose they are trying to put out. If .. there .. WAS .. ever .. a .. fire. 
 I understand the low budget...stuff like that happens, but the voices didnt match. The mothers voice didnt seem real at all. It sounded like it was from a child. No way would an older woman's voice sounds like that. I like it how Devon's character has to understand his new and emerging feelings, and realize that he's not the only one that feels that way. It's nice to know that his soon to be ex-girlfriend is the understanding type. She's even involved in the end when it comes to uncovering the truth about Devon's step-dad. That's a true friend.  I felt so bad seeing Brian in such a bad shape when Devon rescued him after he was beaten up. I was gonna cry. He said that he was raped and that's just one topic that always gets me. My heart just goes out to the victim. I'm glad that earlier in the movie he becomes willing to share his feelings more with Devon, and actually calls him back after they get into their first fight. Brian cried once he hung up the phone and that always shows a more sensitive part of the man and that's such a turn on for me.  Good movie...I've seen better when it comes to acting, but it was still good. I'm glad that I bought it, but would've liked to have seen more of the Devon and Brian relationship. Oh well. Good job.

 As someone who lived through and participated in the events Michener described I was deeply upset by his book which I feel is nothing less than a falsification of history. Clearly Michener, who was on friendly terms  with Nixon and his crowd, had a hidden agenda in trying to discredit  radical student activism and the movement against the War in Vietnam, a war  which Michener supported.  Anyone interested in getting both sides of this  story should read I.F. Stone's book, "How Murder Went Unpunished at  Kent State."  Stone's view is diametrically opposed to that of  Michener whom he denounced in person as a shameless propagandist for the  Nixon Administration on NBC's Today Show in 197 
 Our entire book club disliked this book. We had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters. Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did.   I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable!  It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness.   Aaaargh...must go and re-read Howard's End to dispell the queasy feeling left by On Beauty 
 I remember liking this book as a child and I thought I could get this book for my daughter.  The board book has been so abridged that it lacks a lot of things that I thought were funny.  AND what about that "climatic ending" where the apples all topple - Not there! I wouldn't even recognize the wording in the board book as Dr. Suess's 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 a tired bit of revisionist propaganda out of post-soviet russia which somehow won an oscar as best foreign film.  its fascinating that something so heavy handed can pretend to be an answer to the vile excesses of the stalin era, but what can one expect?  there is (at least one) great movie to be made about that era; dont look for it here. 
 Such an intelligent writer, but one who takes 309 pages to tell a story that could have been told in less than 100. If you're into page after page of ruminating, intellectualizing, ego-centric analyzing, you'll love this book. If you prefer a good story where the plot actually moves, then look elsewhere. Maybe I just don't get the whole New York angst thing.. 
 Was really looking forward to this 2nd installment in the series, but was disappointed for the most part. Check it out at the local library instead of buying, is my advice 
 I never received this magazine so how would I be able to rate it??  I cant even find a way to let them know I never received it 
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 The book is fine, except I had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer.  She's such a boring character.  She's young, but not motivated to work.  In fact, she quited one of her jobs when Macon covered her rent.  The dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men, and get support.  The point is that she doesn't enjoy the job, thus, a detailed description of her dog training job (which she doesn't seem to enjoy) was just a boring digression 
 I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
 The first film was much better than R.E. Apocalypse; more gore, better acting, better presentation overall, and it was done with a lot less money 
 I just don't get it anymore.  I get on amazon and read all these great reviews for albums that are just half assed.  People saying pistolero "was his best work since tromple mode" someone said "this is his best since teenager of the year"  How could you say such things?  I don't like to trash frank black because he is the man, but it seems that the "man" is throwing out albums that don't have much thought or imagination anymore.  Granted, the first catholics album is good and dog in the sand and black letter days are good but they still don't capture the magic of his other work.  and to praise these albums like they're amazing is just crazy.  If his name wasn't printed on the cover of the album and if frank black was never in the pixies people would not like this.  All in all black needs to do some real studio time and stop doing this live to 2-track crap, thats why we see bands live, but on albums i want to here a good well rounded, well thought out studio recording i.e. "teenager of the year"  I fear I will never here work from frank like that again 
 There is nothing sweet,charming, endearing or amusing about this book. Illustrations are nice and large. It's just dry and boring. Yes it is written for tiny ones and one cannot expect too much in such a short book written for a baby. Completely lacking in imagination, in my opinion, this book is blah. There is so much better out there. Don't waste your money 
 Each of the chapters seemed to be unrelated to the others. He either regurgitates other people's ideas or expounds on his own research that had nothing to do with the topic of his book. He is probably a good professor but not a very good writer. He also comes across as an obnoxious person. Don't waste your money 
 Bryson is a pretty good writer. His prose is flowing and very easy to read. This book is 300 pages and I read it in 3 days.   My complaint is his lousy attitude toward people. He made fun of just about everyone but gave his most scathing comments to overweight woman. Plus, this is a book about traveling across America. I don't mind Americans complaining about what's wrong here. I do it myself occasionally. I don't mind people in other countries criticizing the USA. I make judgments about other countries, some unflattering. But there is something grating about Americans living in other countries coming back to travel the USA and taking potshots at our way of life and poking fun at the working poor. Stay in England if it's so bad here

 This product is attractive and works efficiently; however, my unit produced toxic smelling water the first 5 times I tested it out.  I will try a metal electric kettle next 
 I am reading & reading to get over what seemed to be endless story telling without excitement.  King should rewrite the part what Straub had written and relaunch a revision.  Even die-hard fans of King will loose patience 
 High class porn!! No, really has he every seen a woman that you can use as a floatation device?? 
 Worse album Evan has made to date - sad to say given how excited I was for this to be released!!  
 With record or near-record numbers of divorces and unmarried adults, a supposed shortage of available men, dwindling marriage and birth rates, the seeming social acceptance of fatherless "families" and the social pathologies they produce in many of their children, the scary rise of religious fundamentalism, etc., it'll be the last few chapters of this book that most people will be particularly interested in.  Up to those final pages this is mostly a banal if readable partial re-telling of a lot of familiar material.  There's a lot of what I'd consider trivial detail mixed in, which could come in handy if you want to sound mildly interesting and erudite at cocktail parties.  But it obscures a lot of what's really going on, or has gone on in the past.  Any emphasis even on the basic shift from the religious/sacred nature of marriage to its more modern secular/contractual nature (not that it's much of a contract now) is pretty well lost in the noise.  And the origin of marriage gets very much fuzzified.  The roles and activities of men are so nearly absent through much of the book -- except when they're beating their wives -- that the book often slips into being a history of women more than it is of marriage.  It might not be too much to say the book's main accomplishment is in being a feminist-friendly telling of the story which doesn't use virtually any feminist jargon.  And Coontz has an occasional but constantly recurring and therefore annoying tendency to sound like she's got an axe to grind with the religious/wingnut crowd.  If so, she should have taken them on directly and written a different sort of book.  As it is it contaminates the history.  Consequently the ending fizzles and doesn't seem like a very convincing explanation for any of the current puzzling phenomena.  If good history helps us understand the present and how we got here, this book isn't very good.  I think this is basically because Coontz's model is flawed.  Dealing with linear time (and ignoring insignificant zig-zags) she makes the mistake of thinking things are part of a strict progression from A to B.  Hence, there's no going back in her view to "the way things were", which seems to be her real contention -- that whatever recent changes have occurred are permanent, so like-it-or-not we better get used to them.  Don't humans have choice?  Isn't change something of a constant?  Instead, I would recommend the advantages of an entirely different model than her's, one in which there are two distinct and perpetually competing systems (rather than some continuum), and that what we're now doing is *reverting back* to the basic animal/casual/matriarchal system -- the "love marriage" centers around mother/child biology, with men making their various appearances or orbits before exiting -- which prevailed for the tens of thousands of years before the invention of civilization, patriarchal marriage, and stable prosperous families.  But the love marriage is too concerned with the basics of survival and minimal sustenance to have much time for the luxury of intimacy, and it contains very little love.  With "marriage" in the industrial west these days being little more than notorized dating, and conferring no substantive rights whatsoever on men, I'd even contend we've reverted a very long way back: having gone from A to B, and then back to A again.  So there's no real reason why B might not come back in favor again sometime in the future if that's where we decide to go.  It certainly has mountains of misinformation and propaganda heaped up against it currently.  However, its obscure but important advantages could easily be rediscovered and come back in vogue, wearing (of course) slightly different clothes.  It embodies much of what people seem to long for.  But such is outside the range of possibilities in the limited model Coontz presents for us.  This book might be OK if one knows next to nothing about the history of marriage and intends to read several quite different books on it to get a variety of perspectives, but beware anyone regarding it as a bible.  It's merely "a" history, so it's by no means definitive 
 i have never written a review of anything in my entire life, but feel it is my duty to warn you that if you are not extremely experienced in pilates , have incredibly strong abdominal muscles during pregancy and have no issues with balance...then do NOT do this workout.  I am truly horrified. There are absolutely no instructions or modifications given depending on what trimester you are in. The abdominal workout is downright scary at least for someone in their 3rd trimester. The side leg workout is rigorous but good, however there are stretches shown lying flat on your back..an absolute no no for anyone over 20 wks and there are standing stretches on one leg that are NOT even shown using a chair...very dangerous...and by the way, pre pregnancy i was a 5mile a day runner who was very adept and pilates and yoga...all i can say is in my humble opinion, this workout is nowhere near the vicinity of being safe..buyer beware 
 Don't waste your time or money. This was an okay book in its day (though it has zero content about altimeters) but that day is long past. The new edition of the Land Navigation Handbook covers the basics equally well and also educates on altimeters, digital mapping, and GPS. 
 This cd from start to finish is nothing more than tracks he put on mixtapes.I was hoping for an all out cd with maybe two or three songs from his mixtapes..but nope i was wrong...now if you havent heard any of his mixtapes then i highly recommend getting this cd...but if you're a hard core dipset fan who gets all there mixtapes..and is on limewire looking for new songs by them ...then dont get this cd ...its a waste of your money..hopefully hell put something out with some new tracks..and I wont have to hear the same written freestyles i hear from him all the time..like your car will blow up as soon as your key hits the ignition its a knife ta ya kneck as soon as i see you in the prison...im connected everywhere im respected everywhere brooklyns a diease you tryin 2 spread it everywher 
 When you see the words Adobe Master Class you might think you are going to learn something. The book is just a series of paintings the artist has done. No real explanation of how it was done. It might as well be a coffee table book. But hey if that's what your looking for great! 
 Let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie. 1. It is incredibly beautiful animation 2. The music is amazing 3. I happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv series The Things I don't like about the movie: 1. The characters are not developed at all 2. You get the feeling your only skimming the surface, like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread 3. It almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process.  Ok you may have see that I gave this moive a 2 out of 5, well that is becuase of the story line and plot.The story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation. The movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end. I just kept thinking there has to be more. But there wasn't. The best way I could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just couldn't find its parents. This movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff. But if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please don't buy it rent it first. I'm not saying its a bad movie by any means, just a bit empty for me.Just one more thing the Escaflowne series is very very good don't let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series 
 This is not very good book for D50.  The reason that author tries to explain two things at once.  Fist how to take great photographs and second how to use array of custom functions on D50.  He doesn't successes in either.  Writer doesn't explain fully complexities of multiple functions of the camera.  As for "how to take great picture" there are tens of books on that topic which explains art of photography in many details.  Recommend instead to get truly technical book on all D50 functions "Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon D50" by Simon Stafford.  I promise you will get more information from this book as to how use technical abilities of D50 to full potential.  Do you for instance know that D50 doesn't lock simultaneously Exposure and Focus while you half-press release button (It locks only focus), because it's D50's default setting.  You would think AF-AE are locked when you press release button halfway, because it works so in many and many cameras even point and shoot digital, but not for Nikon D50 (though you can make it so, explained in a book).  
 Saw this as an inflight movie. Boy, did I pray for engine trouble, so we'd have to land and I could get away! Sucks or what? I liked Smith in 'I, robot', 'Independence day', etc, but this was awful. It's a one-joke movie. Problem is, the one joke was the one plastered all over the TV spots and trailers (the jet ski incident). The highlights involved the subplot of him teaching a guy to be cool - wish that'd been the main storyline instead - far, far superior! Will not be adding this to my wishlist 
 It's a cute little set - and I mean little.  Wayyyyy over-priced.  (...) Just didn't live up to expectations 
 I think that this is a great book for a middle- or high-school student as introductory material, but it is not appropriate for college or graduate students!   I don't claim to be an expert on education but when a book is so vague (lacks details), quotes out-dated studies, and discusses irrelevant subjects as this book does, I just can't take it. I am sure the author is a nice person and kudos for writing a book, but the fact that professors are having their students read this book as "required" reading makes me re-think my school of choice!   Try it out at the library before you buy it 
 With great anticipation and relish i awaited this accumulation of the works of probably one of the greatest playwrites of the 20th century. Having seen a short promotional film of the project, my eagerness was picqued.But, alas, flash, star-worship and diminished expectations rule once again in this travesty. Having actually not even been able to sit through the Endgame of this set, and having also seen the foolish, punk-flash version of Breath, and the unsympathetic and misunderstood, braindead interpretation of Not I, i am so appalled i nearly whipped this weighty and overly expensive set, frisbee-like,out the window. It never ceases to amaze how so much star power can do so much damage. Remember the Broadway travesty of Godot a few years ago with Robin Williams? So, Engame is a beautiful performance. all the Gaelic colloquial nuance of Beckett's language,perfectly understood and delivered in a heightened naturalism that is a joy to behold. The only problem is, one can NOT behold it because of the hack direction. Done in obsessively Television Direction School multi-camera work, anytime a charecter speaks or moves he is held in extreme talking-head close-up. next actor speaks, close up for him, then back to the other actor and so on and so on until the stomach of the viewer churns from this sea-sick demntia of camera close-ups,reaction shots, two shots and flashing long shots. So you don't have a play, or a film, you end up with a Television show of utter convention and utter unwatchability. i suggest people stay away from this possibly well-intentioned but decadent and unwatchable and expensive lump of Beckett Meets Hollywood by way of London. 
 ...to be something it's not. The only tracks that I found catchy was their song from 8th and Ocean "Beautiful Love" and "You". The rest of the CD is forgetable and bored me. So stay away!!  Not recommended 
 Book itself did not help passing the Exam 70-298.  It is limited to just a theory.  Exam requires a practical knowledge, not a theory.  This book gives a concept of Security which is quite useless for the Exam and an actual configuration 
 This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new "teen speak" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out. 
 I bought the DVD hoping to see one skit -- the funniest one my family had ever seen on SNL. We had it recorded on VHS many MANY years ago and somehow lost it. But we would sit and laugh until we cried watching the skit where Phil played the drill sargeant who came up with nicknames for his new recruits -- "Smiling Laughing Joking Around Man" ... "Man Who Reminds Me Of My Doggie" ... "Hair Head!"  I thought for SURE that THE funniest skit in all of SNL history would be on there, but no...it was just a 20 second clip. I was SO disappointed!!   And it was quite surprising to see some of the skits they chose to show in their entirety...They just weren't funny.   On a positive note, there was a serious song and dance number at the very end of the DVD that was so sweet, it brought me to tears. And the bonus featuring Phil's audition was quite interesting. But overall, I don't recommend it.  
 I read this book as a follow up to Philip Jenkins's "The Next Christendom."  Unfortunately, it does not compare well.  The book reads like a FAQ (frequently asked questions) from a poorly written website as an infomercial promoting the greatness of Africanized Christianity.  The author makes several interesting points however.  One is that Christianity has grown faster than Islam because Christianity has allowed for the Bible to be translated in tens if not hundreds of different vernacular languages.  Christianity has even allowed indigenous population to use their own word for God.  Islam has shown no such flexibility or adaptation as one is not allowed to translate the Qoran.  Another interesting point is that according to the author, Christianity at the onset was a religion of peace meanwhile Islam was a religion of the State and the Sword as Mohammed was both a military and political leader.  The author states that the crusades were an aberration of Christianity's history.  And, that today all Christians feel guilt and shame when remembering the crusades.  Meanwhile, Muslims are proud of all the historical and current Jihads they campaigned for.   But the above are just interesting concepts lost in a sea of directionless questions and answers.  The author is brilliant, highly educated (teacher at both Harvard and Yale).  But, his book is little more than a random collection of his own subjective opinions not supported well  enough by much facts, studies, or reference to other works.  Because of the odd question and answer format, the author never develops a coherent and focused theory tied to the title's subject.   As mentioned, if you want to study this subject more effectively I strongly recommend Philip Jenkins "The Next Christendom" instead.               
 This is honestly one of the worst films I have ever witnessed...gay or straight. I am amazed it actually got made, let alone distributed! I hate to be mean, but it was hard to watch Ms. Lesnick. Her talents must lay elsewhere. She can not act her way out of a box. Oy!! She should have stuck to her Rabbinical Studies. Seriously folks....you should just rent it to see how bad it is...you will be fascinated. I am sure Helen Lesnick is a lovely hard working woman, but what a flat actress. Her heavy black and blue makeup made her look like a Drag Queen and the fact that she says she's 34 in the film is insane! She clearly looked 45 +. I am all for accepting yourself as you age, but the woman had such deep lines in her face, she looked like road map. If you force us to stare at your face for 2 hrs (and tons of annoying Close Ups!! Oy again!)please consider Boxtex next time.  Well she got a film made and out there, starring herself as the lead. I am sure a great accomplishment for her...BUT, PAINFUL for us.   
 There is much wisdom to be gained from Aboriginal culture, but the "wisdom" in this book is NOT Aboriginal, but rather made up by the author.  She should have based her book on real Aborigines and shared their true culture, or based it on a totally fictional population.  That way readers would not believe the lies she tells about Australia.  The book does make one think about the many flaws of our western culture which is good, but to do so while corrupting a native culture is simply appalling.  She should not be profiting from this book 
 I was very disappointed in CD.  Way to hillbilly for me 
 Community Playhouse in Long Beach did the show this August. As it played, the plot didn't come through, but the wit of Shaw did. The playhouse didn't have the costumes of the military men, nor the actors to carry-off the pomp and bravado of these would-be heroes. In a time when G.W. Bush is fighting his own phantasmic enemies this play should have lapooned the whole spectre of military madness. George Bernard Shaw gave us the theme it will take some imagination and talent to make it contemporary and equal to the madness of our times. Ano 
 I wanted to read this book because I was reading mixed reviews and I wanted to see for myself how I would rate it. I am very glad that checked it out from the library because I could not have imaged paying for this book.   I rated this book one star because of the constant stereotyping and bashing of the "bogus" and other women who may not have lived such privileged lives. Being a "Princess" means that you do not put others down for their family's up-bringing, speech patterns, they way someone dresses. However, being a "Princess" does mean being compassionate to others, encouraging others to better themselves through positive methods, not psychologically manipulating someone to get what they want, and being very grateful for the opportunities that they are being blessed with.  There are quite a lot of superficial elements in this book and it seems to also support the stereotype that African-American women are materialistic because they make a point mentioning several name brands and things you must have.   There were also quite a few typos in the book which other reviews have noted. I feel very sorry for the writers because instead of writing about the positive things about their lives and encouraging others to live a more "continuous learning lifestyle" they decided to write a horrible book that continues to put a divide between African-American women by showing that if you can not vacation in Martha's Vineyard then you will never be worthy of a high powered husband.  In conclusion I was wondering, why this book did not focus on establishing good money habits for the four "BAPs" featured? If you want to read a really great book on being a woman why not read "The Art and Power of Being a Lady" by Noelle Cleary and Dini Von Mueffling. 
 Like Hayek's Road to Serfdom, this book was written during the Secon World War when Keynes was busy crafting the post war peace. It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over 
 I'm an engineer and I cannot believe that any company would, in good conscience, fob off such trash onto the consuming public.  The reasons for the faulty performance are all based on fatally flawed design.  A product with this many problems does not reach the market by accident.  They had to have known it was junk, but chose to sell it anyway.  Dirt Devil deserves the strongest form of rebuke and condemnation 
 It is a well known fact among scientists that global warming is REAL and that humans are at least contributing to this planet's rising average temperature.  It is also a fact that the oil cronies are trying to spread misinformation that global warming is either not occurring or that humans are not having any affect on it.  These oil cronies also want everyone to think that if global warming is not a myth, it's a debate among scientists.  Furthermore, many of the scientific research that shows that WE are causing global warming have been suppressed by oil industry special interests.  Bush, who does everything to cater to the oil industry, has suppressed much of this knowledge himself.  This book is just part of this special interest propaganda.  The bottom line is this: GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL AND IS CAUSED BY PEOPLE, AND EVERY TRUE SCIENTIST THAT IS NOT WORKING FOR SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS KNOWS THIS.  If you have any doubt about this, read the original research articles in PEER REVIEWED academic journals, and make sure that they are PEER REVIEWED.  PEER REVIEWED journals are where REAL knowledge and research get published.  This book is hogwash. 
 I have one other Weather Station from La Crosse that seems to work ok, but this thing is a paperweight as far as I am concerned. It shows that it is raining out when the sun is out! It constantly losses contact with the remote sensor and the temp and humidity seems to always be off. I have attempted to contact La Crosse, but as other reviewers have said, that is a lost cause. They never answer any emails regarding product help or issues, and no one seems to answer their phone either. Maybe I have a lemon, but I feel for what they charge for their products, La Crosse should be more responsive to their customers 
 it seems that as long as reguritate the dominate social narrative of an oppressed/underpresented group the work is considered a "masterpiece" and "touching". Well this left me cold. How many times does this novel need to be written? there are many ways to create unforgettable characters and working the hell out of tired stereotypes is not one of them.  Also, read something by Julius Lester if you want to see this kind of thing done well 
 I read this in Jan. of 01 and am just now transcribing my notes.  Here goes:  Trashy, but I couldn't NOT finish it.  Story of best friends who go to a summer house every August with their families.  Secret betrayals of friendship, a hidden illness, a birth and a miscarriage.  What else do you need to make a soap-opera style plot?   I give Thayer credit for her spot on descriptions of feelings one experiences after miscarriage, from envy to despair.  Bottom line: Rich people with too much money and rich people problems. It didn't stay in my short term memory very long 
      This movie could not be pulled off even with Audrey Hepburn. I am an ardent Audrey Hepburn fan but, the script was terrible and so was some of the acting. I hate to say it but this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I have not read the book but, from what I have heard the movie does not do the book justice. By the end of the movie I was actually glad it was over unlike many of Hepburn's other movies. I only gave it 2 stars because it is a Audrey Hepburn film. 
 i like the song of salif that why i look for one of his like les ambassadeurs international with salif keit 
 I have little to add to what's already been said by other reviewers other than I can't believe she seriously holds these views.  I admit that I only read parts of the book while at the bookstore, but no one who is educated, and I presume she is, can really think that evolution is unproven.  You might as well say that the Earth is flat, or square, or whatever.  She writes this drivel because it targets the far-right and gives them what they want.  Apparently this works because she churns out this trash about once a year 
 Three Dog Night was one of my favorites back in my teenage years and still is today.  If you are like me you want to recapture the sounds of your youth.  While this album contains many of their best works it was a huge disappointment to me.  Not re-mastered as many classic albums, this one is a new recording 35 years later with different back ups.  It just doesn't sound the same as the original recordings. 
 I thought that I ordered the textbook and got a type of study guide instead.  The title of the textbook and the title of the 'studyguide' CANNOT be the same on Amazon - that is where I made my mistake!! 
 As curious as I was about this movie it had me dazed. The 'Good Shepherd' always struck me symbol for Christianity. Shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten. What's good about that? Fortunately, sheep don't have the intelligence to be paranoid. With Bourne Identity movies under his belt, Matt Damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies. Is this one a killer or dead on arrival? With a budget of $85m, we've got Oscar-winning actors, writers, cinematographers, and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see. Pet project of actor-turning-director, Robert De Niro, "The Good Shepherd" tells a story of the CIA from its early days, weighing in at just under three hours. The scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around once that's miss you won't get it. This is a shame, because it's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically shot.  This movie is told from Damon's point of view, its scope is epic, and covering the years from 1939 before the CIA was even a speck in President Truman's eye, to 1961 and the Bay of Pigs. We see the founding years, the London Blitz, post-war reconstruction in Berlin, and increasingly intricate machinations as the Cold War gathers pace. Angelina Jolie doesn't feature in much of the movie, but when she does, she' get into character very well. It's enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable.   Robert de Niro (got to love him), in the director's chair, is sadly the weakest link. Although he handles it professionally, almost magisterially, he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum, convey gradual moral decay, or make this the Godfather standard-bearer of CIA films. He's done a fine job - just bitten off a bit more than he can chew. What he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world's most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity; if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to, given that his mentors are people like Francis Ford Coppola (who is the executive producer). With sufficient dedication, it is easy to imagine De Niro pulling off an Oscar for direction in a future film: his grasp is very broad, and all it needs is a little tweaking. 
 I bought this book expecting to see a refinement or elaboration of the strategies explained in, "Getting to Yes!". I was extremely disapointed!  The first step, "Go to the balcony" basically says to take a time-out to get some perspective. Come on! Negotiations happen quickly. How often do we have the luxury of "sleeping on it". I need a strategy that can be used on the fly.  There is too much focus on being congenial: "Acknowledge their point/feelings", "Offer an Apology", "Agree Wherever You Can". Sure it's important to understand their interests, but don't compromise yourself just to make them happy. Getting to yes puts it much better, "Soft on then people, hard on the problem".  Skip this book. If looking for a great negotiation book, then buy "Getting to Yes". 
 "The Sound and The Fury" is reported as one of William Faulkner's early successes.  From this performance I have trouble understanding why.  The book alternates between dialogue and descriptive narration.  I had trouble following the story.  It sounded like a series of barely related scenes.  I did listen to a recording of this book.  I do have more trouble following recordings of fiction than I do with history.  It may be that I would do better reading this book than listening to it.  There was nothing technically wrong with the recording, I am just hopeful that a written version would be more understandable.  I would recommend giving a written version at try 
 What is Wilbur Smith's obsession with the word "escarpment"?!?!  (I stopped count at 37). That aside, this is a pretty hefty adventure.  It caught my eye in the bookstore- the premise of a grand search for an Egyptian tomb really grabbed my interest.  That being said- the author goes a bit overboard with character/scene details, making for a 650+ page read.  Not that it's a negative comment, just a concern about length- there's no economy of words when it comes to Wilbur Smith's writing style.  He's a good storyteller, but it could be so much better with the proper editor involved (getting bogged down in the details slowed the progression of the story's pacing- something I don't appreciate in an adventure novel).  The excitement within the story is a lost a bit due to his slow-detail-oriented writing style.  Don't misunderstand me, I didn't hate it; if the premise of the story didn't interest me from the start, this is a book I would have otherwise put down after the first 100 pages 
 I could not finish the book because I felt as if I could not relate to her snobbery. Her life of privilege. I was only able to seriously read the first fifty pages then skimmed through it to be enlightened as many others  seem to have been.  I was not able to feel any of the emotions she  professed to have, smell or taste any of her food and ultimately, was not  moved by her writing. Could I have just been in a bad mood 
 The written description of this heater led me to believe that it would perform like the 2 5-yr-old Vornado models that are the best electric heaters I've ever had.  The VH2 has major flaws.  It's single fan speed is way too fast, causing heated air to be cool/cold within 10 ft of the heater.  The fan cannot be slowed down.  The thermostat causes the fan to stop and start in ridiculously short intervals; thereby wasting energy I believe.  Finally, the thermostat is set so that when at the highest (hottest) setting it doesn't allow the heater to bring even the immediate area around it to more than 70 degrees F.  I've had the heater <1 mo and will attempt to return it for a full refund in another wk or 2 as soon as I have an alternative brand in my home 
 Not like the picture at all and very cheap looking and didnt form to the head correctly. Must have been stuck in the box too long!....husband said...send it back! Needless to say, we got a refund 
 I knew before I started reading Candice Bushnell's Sex and the City it was not the HBO series, so that wasn't a surprise. What was a surprise is that this so-called "author" is about as literary as a discarded apple core. There's nothing smart nor funny in this book. Bushnell's writing is flat, lifeless, and dull. This book does nothing but cast a spotlight on the empty, materialistic, shallow, insecure lives of New York's wealthy and "beautiful people." She never casts an opinion about these pathetic souls, so you're constantly asking the question, why should I care about any of these characters. Not one character has a redeeming quality, and poor Carrie is portrayed as a self-involved, border-line alcoholic--no wonder no one wants her. Not one character in Sex and the City is interesting, witty, or even identifiable with anyone who doesn't share the same shallow emptiness. The only thing the book imparts is a grateful feeling that you are not one of these pathetic losers. I'm grateful that Darren Star and Michael Patrick King were able to transform this piece of garbage into a witty, vibrant, sexy television series that will be remembered far longer than this wretched piece of effluvium 
 We thought that this book was on the boring side because there should of been more action or excitement. Our favorite part was when her grandmother came over. Our suggestions are to add more excitement and to make the book a little longer 
 If you want an outstanding book on spiritual warefare? This is not what you want.  What you want is "Divine Energy: The Orthodox Path to Christian Victory" by Jon E. Braun. As a matter of fact read both books and deside for yourself 
 Though I do not doubt Michener's writing capabilities, I find that as I continue to trudge through this so called historical novel, two stars is as much as I can give this book without doubting my own taste of literature.  Having recently read amazing works of historical fiction such as: THE BRUCE TRILOGY, by Nigel Tranter, and ALEXANDER, by Valerio Massimo Manfredi, CARIBBEAN simply does not compete.  While the writing can be quite descriptive, any attempts at making the plot remotely interesting fall short.  Just as soon as the reader begins to get interested in the storyline, the chapter ends and within the turn of a page you find yourself at least a hundred years into the future, with yet another dull plot.  In terms of historical accuracy, the book follows the timeline of events in a satisfactory way, yet the chapters, which are essentially short stories, tend to focus on the lives and troubles of fictional characters.  It seems that the book is more like a chore than an enjoyable novel, and attempts at romance and battle description are almost laughable.  Characters react to events in predictable ways.  Influencial thought is absent.  Accurate only half the time.  What am I reading?  This book is a waste of a tree! It is boring and history is followed in a jagged line.  Have I said enough? If you are currently reading this book I advise tou to spare yourself.  If you are looking for a top quality novel, historical or not,or a book with at least a limited amount of inspiration try one of the following, where exciting plot is evident, to say the least:  DON QUIXOTE, by Miguel de Cervantes,  TIDES OF WAR, by Steven Pressfield, THE WALLACE, by Nigel Tranter, THE BRUCE TRILOGY, by Nigel Tranter, ALEXANDER, by Valerio Massimo Manfredi, THE LORD OF THE RINGS, By J.R.R. Tolkien, THE CHARTERHOUSE OF PARMA, by Stendahl, and many more, which I have yet to read, which are most likely better than the one I have thankfully stopped wasting my time with 
 I had such high hopes for this book but it is truly horribly written and Brent Mann seems to have an unusual idea of what the reader would find interesting.   So many of the entries followed a formula that it's as if the author simply populated a database. "[Band name here] was composed of ..." (should be comprises -- the other reviewer was right in calling out the poor editing). Then he talks about what compilation albums the song appears on (why do we care?). If the band or members are still touring, he lists three places where they've played (which anybody can find online). ANY TIME someone died the sentence begins with "Sadly,..."  Don't get me started about the inane sidebars. Who cares about how many songs have had the word "Japanese" in them, or how many musicians hail from Minneapolis or Louisiana (The Pelican State)? Why do several of the entries begin with feigned surprise about how a band hails from one part of the world and yet had a hit song about another part of the world?   A few of the entries end with "Brent's Two Cents." Isn't the whole book Brent's Two Cents? Actually, that is what's missing throughout this book -- some opinions! There are a couple, but a true in-depth analysis is severely lacking -- it's like he got lazy and wrote a term paper by copying facts off the internet.  I was hoping for a book similar to "The Worst Rock n' Roll Records of All Time" by Jimmy Guterman and Owen O'Donnell, which seamlessly blends trivia with criticism and makes you laugh out loud at the same time. (I can't listen to Charlene's "I've Never Been to Me" without thinking of the hilarious review from that book). This doesn't even come close.  I haven't even touched on the most controversial part of the book -- Brent's contention that artists who had a second hit that HE thinks didn't get enough radio airplay, despite chart numbers within the Top 40, constitute one-hit wonders. This list of Brent's includes a-ha, Sinead O'Connor, and Scandal.  The book is trademarked 2002, but seems out of date. Robbie Williams's album, The Ego Has Landed, is from early 1999. Remember the radio hit "Millennium"? Brent contends that Robbie Williams, formerly of Take That, has released a couple of albums but "nary a chart hit." Huh?  I think it's a great topic for a book but it's disappointing that it was handled so poorly 
 This is just a mounting kit...  It needs a 3rd party "cell phone" mount to actually attach to your motorcycle.  Very disappointed that I have to order something *else* in addition to this "kit"  After getting a RAM mount (from somewhere else, I don't think Amazon sells them), this did mount easily and quickly to my bike, just be aware, that you need a RAM mount in addition to this kit, which is really just a connection from a RAM mount to the garmin devic 
 If you're an adoptee or birthmother, don't waste your money on this narrow-minded view of adoption.  Bartholet has little to say about birthmothers!  When she does mention birthmothers, she seems to view them as inconsequential baby machines.  No empathy in this book 
 As a prosecutor, I was very interested in reading this book.  I had seen an interview with the author and read several customer reviews.  I am disappointed.  I understand that the author apparently lived a fairly priveleged life prior to working as an Assistant D.A., and says as much early in the book.  I would assume, however, that her $100,000 education would have helped develop a more grammatically correct writing style.  The errors in grammar and spelling were distracting at times and made for a less than smooth read.  Additionally, though I do not prosecute in the Bronx, and am sure there is a steep learning curve, five years as an Assistant D.A. hardly creates an expertise in any area.  The "cop speak" throughout the book, and the drama with which the stories are told suggest a motive more in line with personal promotion than delivery of insight.  This may explain the numerous T.V. appearances, etc.  The author may be a good lawyer and may have been a good Assistant D.A., but the book does not convey that.  Finally, the stories told are important ones to tell, and all should have some exposure to what man is willing to do to one another, especially the most vulnerable.  I just wish the book's focus was more on them and less on the author's gallant fight for those unable to fight for themselves, at least for five years.         
 First let me say that aside from any of the ideas presented, this book deserves a low rating just because of how horribly it is written.  Skinner has no real style and simply rattles of declarative sentences at such a monotonous pace that I was practically tearing my hair out at the end of the book.  And for all the mechanistic nature of his writing, he's suprisingly inept at conveying a point.  But getting to the ideas contained therein.  This book combines the very shaky "science" of behaviorism with the silliest doomsday rhetoric that was so typical of the decades following the invention of the atomic bomb.  Skinner starts off by talking about how horrible the human race has thus far managed itself, how we are in danger at any second of annihilating ourselves.  This kind of alarmism was probably very convincing in the 70s, but it hardly has any force with reasonable people today, who realize that, despite our flaws, we seem to be pretty good at surviving.  Skinner then goes into the meat of his book, which is pretty much summed up by saying, "There is no circumstance under which humans are not controlled.  It's just a matter of the form the control takes, and there's no such thing as an autonomous agent inside us.  We need to accept that and engineer the perfect society by devising ways of control that are better."  If you read those three sentences, you don't really need to read "Beyond Freedom & Dignity," but for those who are curious, I'll say a few more words, mainly criticism.  The first criticism is that, of course, Skinner just constantly and tediously repeats that it is an established scientific "fact" it is that we are purely products of the environment (whether personally or through evolution) without justifying it very well.  Paradoxically, he admits that the science of human behavior is poorly developed compared to, say, biology and physics, and in fact hasn't progressed much since Aristotle. He is oblivious to this contradiction.  On the one hand, he wants it to be certain and unquestioned that a human can be completely explained by his science.  On the other, his science is underdeveloped (because people have not accepted that it is true yet).  He seems to think that behaviorist science does not need any sophistication or development in order for it's most weighty premise--that humans have no autonomy--to be an accepted fact.  Skinner puts the cart before the horse.  The second criticism is that Skinner never really gets down to any even slightly useful details on what his Utopia will look like.  His excuse is, again, that behaviorist science is still not developed enough, I guess.  But it seems like someone who says, "We must change our culture so that it has the best possible effect on our lives" isn't really saying anything profound.  In other words, his dramatic plan for the human race reduces to nothing more than saying, "Let's do things better."  In a book of 200 pages, Skinner really doesn't give much information at all.  It's worth mentioning that after every chapter he gives a short one-paragraph summary of the ideas in that chapter.  He could have simply published those summaries and retained about 90% of the real content of his book.  Thirdly, Skinner is oblivious to the inherent contradictions in his position.  If man is just a product of his environment, with no real autonomy, no inherent ability to act in and of himself, then how can we even "plan" anything for the future?  If a superior culture does develop, it cannot be considered anything but a happy accident.  It can't even be considered "happy," since that term implies some inner agent who is happy.  I guess we would just say, "It would be favorable for the participants."  There is something just simply idiotic in saying, "We should design a better culture, because none of us have free will and are just products of our culture."  I suppose Skinner only wrote his book due to the stimulus of his environment and thus can't be blamed for the inconsistency... But the point I'm making is that in order to act for positive change, you have to feel like you have some autonomous capacity to change things.  All in all, the book is rather dated.  The idea of man as simply a machine that converts stimulus to response, with emotions and thoughts (if they exist at all) as mere side effects is absurd to anyone who does a little introspection instead of, say, studying figures on how incomes and education relate to robbery convictions.  And the doomsday scenarios that motivate the work are much less compelling (to reasonable people, at least) than they used to be.  I don't recommend this book unless you have some scholarly need to read it.  On final reflection, it appears to me as simply an attempt by Skinner to profit off the anxieties of his times rather than an earnest attempt at offering useful knowledge to mankind 
 Dull and inane come to mind. Consists mostly of Peabody's artificially "catty" - sometimes racist - first-person remarks about everyone she meets (even the cat), fuzzy descriptions of Egyptian "archaeology" (...). The plot is slow moving, cliché and peopled with characters that come across as cardboard cutouts. I found more of pennance than pleasure in this read. Avoid it 
 Darwin's work is groundbreaking, describing inborn emotional expression, including descriptions of animals as well as man. The book itself gets 4 stars for originality of concept and thoroughness of observation. The editing of the digital version leaves a lot to be desired, and gets 2 stars. No illustrations were included. None--and there is no warning about this anywhere. The pages were longer than the original version, so "footnotes" can be found at the bottom, middle, or top of a page. Some footnotes run into text, so if you're trying to read text and skip footnotes, sometimes it makes no sense whatsoever until you read a footnote, determine where the text actually started, and then re-read it including all the parts. Sometimes parts of sentences are just left out. This approach can work for a work of fiction, but I won't be buying any more "illustrated" or footnoted nonfiction digital books 
 I had read this book many years ago and enjoyed it. The book was written 100 years ago, but does hold some truths of the world today. However, it appears to be a reproduction, the book was rather expensive for what I got - a slim paper back full of typo' 
 During the late 1980's and 1990's,The Looney Tunes stayed a float thanks to the brillant writing and direction of Terry Lennon and Greg Ford.That era came to a screeching end with "Space Jam". The only thing funny about this movie is it's laughable plot,why on god's green earth whould the Looney Tunes need Micheal Jordan's help? Most of them are clever enough to fight any sort of enemy on there own, well at least they normaly are. This film made them all look like a collection idiots,the only one that didn't look stupid was Bugs Bunny. Now I know that not all the LT gang was ever as smart or clever as Bugs,but put them all together nad they can all handle themselves.I think the biggest hit was Lola Bunny,who is simply not funny or interesting at all.I suppose she was created just to statisfy the P.C. police. The laughs in the film are few and far in-between. There was one moment during the basket ball game were the Looney Tunes gang actually corporated and were actually funny and in character,but that ended mighty quickly.Avoid this movie like the plaugue. 
 As is the case with so many sitcoms, My Hero started slowly and awkwardly.  I loved this show in its later series, but Series One is a dud.  If you are unsure whether or not this is the My Hero volume you want, consider that PBS rarely shows a series in order.  My recommendation is to wait, I know this show gets better.  
 This review is for the Criterion collection DVD edution of the film.  Bad Timing directed by Nick Roeg is the story of a psychoanalyst played by Art Garfunkel who is having a relationship with another man's wife. The story begins with her being rushed to the hospital after a drug overdose and the previous events are shown in a series of flashbacks. A police inspector attemps to ascertain what has happened as well.  The film contains some graphic sex scenes and is not for the easily offended.  The DVD contains some bonus features which are an interview with director Nick Roeg, producer Jeremy Thomas, and actress Theresa Russell, a theatrical trailer, a slide show of production photos and posters of the film and some of Roeg's other films and deleted scenes 
 I expected a more pure yoga approach to this most serious subject; depression. Some depression is caused by physical problems therefore I expected more YOGA positions; healing the body thus setting the stage to clear the mind. Finding the answers to problems of the mind is difficult enough without diverting the process in non reality based solutions. 
 Two things about Mr. Tower's book are original. The use of menus to drive his narrative, and his food. Unfortunately, reading this book taught me more about James Beard's unmentionables than it did about Jeremiah Tower's food. Some things about Mr. Beard I just didn't want to know.  There was a bit of nostalgia to this book, since I remember Berkeley in the early 70s and can picture Mr. Tower fitting in perfectly with that environment. I am a fan of the Chez Panisse style of cooking and food presentation, and would be more than happy to give much of the credit for popularizing it to Mr. Tower. Unfortunately, he has engaged in a preemptive strike, and claimed it all.  I was not in the restaurant business in 1971. Actually, I was in the fourth grade business about then, so I can't say for certain that you couldn't get your tomatoes flown in from Ecuador back then, but I somehow doubt it. That there were produce markets in the city back then tells me that Mr. Tower wasn't the only one serving fresh produce. Did other restaurants buy their veggies and then sit on them for a week before serving them?  Still, I'll read through 224 pages of self love if I can learn something of the master's art. I learned this about Jeremiah Tower's food: Add salt 
 There are so many reviews saying this is a true story I have to point out that while the war and the deployment were real (obviously), about everything else is dramatized (including the mission objectives: SCUD hunting on foot, which is a joke to anyone who knows how wars are fought today). McNab has essentially written Tom Clancy genre fiction. The book Bravo Two Zero differs in details with another book written by a second member of the patrol, Chris Ryan, called The One That Got Away. However, both are convincingly debunked by a third SAS memeber in a book called The Real Bravo Two Zero, also available on Amazon, though only the UK Amazon site (which you can still order from in the US). In it, an SAS member who can actually speak Arabic retraces the patrol using both books as guides and talks to all the people McNab and Ryan supposedly killed and gets their side of the story. Most importantly, he manages to restore, without a doubt, the reputation of Vince Phillips, blamed by Ryan for getting the patrol discovered by the Iraqis and a couple members eventually killed. Contrary to what you may expect, I would recommend seeing this, in fact I recommend getting and comparing all three books: B20, The One That Got Away, and The Real B20 
 I anticipate this review will not garner too many "helpful" votes (since a majority of people appear to have enjoyed this movie), but it is something I need to say anyway.  I am writing this review because I've read quite a few reviews (written by men and women alike) stating that men will hate this film whereas "women will love it." I am a woman and I absolutely hated this movie, the only reason being that it was absolutely boring, and, for lack of a better word, stupid. I can't tell you why it was so painfully boring, but I'm guessing it had something to do with the plot, which is yawn-inductive to begin with.  It is rare that I give out the one-star rating, but this is one of those movies it actually pained me to sit through. I watched it at a family member's house and I fell asleep 3 times. (Note that I am an insomniac and I do not fall asleep easily.) I can't help but resent it a little when people say that "women will love this movie" because it was quite honestly one of the most boring movies I, as a perfectly legitimate woman, have ever seen. To add insult to injury, the Ya-Yas are terribly annoying. A couple of reviewers have said that "to call this a 'chick flick' is insulting to all chicks," and I vehemently agree. I understand that some women probably will like it; my point is only that not all of us will enjoy this dull, insipid movie just because we're chicks 
 I bought this item thinking I was getting a healthy snack. The fruit is soaked in high fructose corn syrup, and it is extremely sweet. Not healthy. 
 A Moose from California compared Audra's "Bill" with one done by Jane Monheit. I took his advise and listened to both. Audra sounds like a church choir singer making an attempt at jazz. The Moose from California has a tin ear when it comes to quality and soul.This is a sad recording as far as jazz goes. It should be in the cabaret bin. Absolutely!! 
 After using these radios two months I can say that battery life is poor.A full charge doesn't hold three hours.Perhaps my batteries didn't come in good condition. I didn't use them on AAA yet... 10 mile range is not true in a normal environment, open sea or desert perhaps.Product works fine while battery las 
 I found this book useless in respect to history. I was looking for a historical documentary but found a political afterwar pamphlet full of anti-nazi propaganda. I read a few historical reviews, in my opinion this boock is full of lies. Specially taking in concern that this author discredited himself already a few times during his lifetime. He is an unreliable source, the Russians were the first to Berlin, he wasn't fluent in German (had to rely on translators), and his interviewed sources proved to be liars. That book who so many have relied on since it's publishing is best used as a door stop. 
 I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  It read like a poor book report:  "...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."  We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  Yeahsurerightwhatever.  Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  THIS is how men behave and relate to one another?  I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.    I liked the female characters of the book initially.  They all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  But my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  And the conflicts Steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  For instance, Gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the ADULT children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  Nevermind the fact that he's known about the ADULT children since the very beginning.  Nevermind the fact that the ADULT children live in England and Italy, while Gray and Sylvia are New Yorkers.  Nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient ADULTS who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  Evidently Gray can't see beyond the fact that they are "kids" and therefore "family" and therefore not to be tolerated.  Sorry, but whatever sympathy I'd developed for Gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  Dump the weenie, Sylvia.  You can do better.  The other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.    Considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, I have to wonder why Steel even bothered writing this book.  And why I bothered reading i 
 I usually read novels, thick and thin, within a week; but this book took months. I couldn't stand to read more than a few pages at a time because it was just that terribly written. It was probably one of the worst books I've ever read. I'd much rather read a boring textbook on math theory than read this again.  I don't understand how it won the awards it did because I don't think it deserved it.  The progression was dreadfully slow, and many times the author was redundant and appears to be just filling space. Also, I don't think it dealt much with apartheid at all, but more so about a dysfunctional family in general.  And Michael's rage and his driving force (in the end) was really appalling and so fitting with the sensationalism in society and the media today.  This book was rubbish and I wish there was a 0 star rating because it definitely isn't even worth one. Don't waste your time 
 Sorry readers but slogging through this "tribute" to friendship was about as enjoyable as a root canal.  Where to begin? The first thing that comes to mind was "what a sick mess of a relationship".  You can sum it up in a nutshell something like this.  Lucy to Ann .... "You will, pay my bills, clean my pigsty of a house, do all my bidding however outrageous, lavish me with attention, declare your love.., in turn I will, ignore you at will, rarely deliver anything as promised, drop you for a better gig at a moments notice, take no responsibility for anything and use you for everything you've got... Ann to Lucy  "Yes pet!"  Lucy comes off as petty, self-absorbed, spoiled and plain obnoxious minus half a face or not.  Ann is a classic enabler, you can't help but pity her.  Like other reviewers I took issue with the author revealing every sordid detail about her dead friend while telling us nothing of her own shortcomings.  Although ultimately I suppose this novel itself speaks volumes about the author's many flaws 
 I'm on my Mom's Amazon Account just to say my review for this CD. I don't have it, but I have all the songs on my Ipod that I like from it. Here's my ratings- Go The Distance- This freakin rocked so much. It's so emotional and beautiful! Color's Of The Wind- Techno sounds, love it! Find yourself- great. Two worlds- Nice.  Part Of Your World- Liked the beat. Kiss The Girl- I love this Pop Rendition! True to your heart- cool.  blah blah blah. I can't remember the rest only because I don't really like the rest so over all this CD was amazing!!!!! 
 Don't waste your money on this Pooh. My son got him for Christmas and didn't really care anything about him. I know that you can change the songs but our Pooh says Happy Birthday to my son every day. I probably can change that, though. He doesn't keep the time. Every day he got more and more off until he was singing and talking in the MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT and AT NAP TIME! Well, needless to say, he he is no longer with us! He lives in the garage. My husband put him out there after he woke my son up, AGAIN! I will be storing him in the attic soon. I wouldn't recommend for anyone to purchase him. He says my son's name really funny too. I was extremely disappointed with this 
 When I bought this album years ago I would have given it 5 stars, because I laughed my a## off.   Then yesterday I picked up "Relentless" by Bill Hicks, and I am furious. Huge portions of Leary's cd are ripped off almost word-for-word from Bill Hicks' material. I had heard the rumors that there were some similarities, but I liked Dennis Leary, and I didn't want to believe it. Now I wish I'd never bought No Cure for Cancer and contributed money in his direction.   If James Frey can be brow-beaten on national tv for making up elements of his memoir "A Million Little Pieces", Dennis Leary should have gotten similar treatment YEARS ago for being a dirty stinking thief.   Listen to the two comics side-by-side and its undeniable. The only reason Leary got away with it is that Bill Hicks died in 1994 of (how ironic!) CANCER.   Shameless.   
 Once upon a time I was given a vanity-published book to review. It was an illogical mess, full of breathtaking non-sequiturs. While reading "Iron John," I couldn't help thinking of it. The vanity book, however, was at least entertaining.  John Eldredge refers to "Iron John" liberally in his book "Wild at Heart," and because I considered that a ringing endorsement, I purchased a copy. I can't tell you what a chore it has been to finally finish reading it. The hardest part was not flinging it away in disgust about 17 times.  It's one thing to write a rambling tome full of obscure references; it's another to publish it. That people can slog through it and call it "profound" and "important" is baffling; what's even more mind-boggling is that people claim that this book "spoke" to them. I think it's a case of "I'd better say I understand it, or people will think I'm not erudite." Well, let me be erudite about it: "Iron John" is a big, steaming pile of New Age crapola. Don't say I didn't warn you 
 I purchased Thomas' book with high hopes that it would be a reasoned, intelligent review of the history of Mossad, one of the world's most effective intelligence services, along the lines of Israel's Secret War's.  Sadly, such was not the case.  Thomas is a conspiracy theorist who relies on innuendo and rumor to justify mindless theories and meaningless concepts, all in lieu of research and facts to tell what is an incredible story on its own.  From little things, like referring to the Echelon surveillance system operated by the National Security Agency as monitoring every conversation between every individual virtually anywhere in the world (Echelon monitors electronic conversations, not every possible conversation) to secondhand references to the late William Casey, the then-director of the CIA, as suggesting that Mossad supplied arms to Hezbollah in the early 1980's when Israel invaded Lebanon, Thomas studiously avoids anything approaching professionalism or reasoned analysis.  Mossad is a rich topic for investigation, and there are excellent treatments on the subject.  Thomas, unfortunately, is an unprofessional, sloppy and pathetic writer whose book demeans its subject 
 VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE BOOK.  NOT ENOUGH DETAIL FOR KIDS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PARTS OF THEIR BODY CAN NOT AND SHOULD NOT BE TOUCHED BY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS; AND ALSO WHO CAN NOT AND  SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES TO TOUCH THEM.  THE BOOK WAS A WASTE OF MONEY.  WISH I COULD GET A  RFUND ON THE BOOK! 
 Need a quick lesson in intolerance for your child? Try this despicable & poorly written book. Totally inappropriate for this age group. Lacks any nuance, and deals only in hackneyed and offensive stereotypes. It is depressing that parents feel the need to indoctrinate their children in this way, at this age. I am an educator, and I am appalled 
 The songs just did not get me dancing.  I have to say I was disappointed.  But I love Kids Favorite Songs VOl 2 but was never able to buy it as it was not availabl 
 This movie set out to demonize the Weavers and did a great job of it. Far too many inaccuracies to even begin. While I understand the need to condense for the sake of a movie,this was too much. Saying this is based on the book"Every knee shall bow" is about like saying "Ben Hur" is based on the Bible 
 This was a waste.  It does not look like the picture on the bag when it is set up.  The whole thing is flimsy and the sides fold in as soon as my son crawls in then he is in a heap inside of it. I am going to return it 
 This author took what should have been a fascinating subject and turned it into a boring, long-winded and, for the most part, incomprehensible tome. After having read "When Genius Failed" by Roger Lowenstein, I looked forward to reading Dunbar's book, which I thought would be another informative take on the fiasco. Even in the beginning pages, Dunbar jumped around soooo much, from country to country, from financial discovery to mathematical equasions, from era to era AND from subject to subject that is was just TOO DISTRACTING to be enjoyable. Maybe Wall Street traders or mathematicians would be drawn in by this drivel but I don't think the average reader would be. The biggest disappointment was that Dunbar failed to make even these complex, intense traders interesting! "When Genius Failed" is a far better read 
 I had Vol. 3 be Jay-Z's worst. Even though it is a Jay Z album, there are a lot of guest appearances by Memphis Bleek, Talib Kweli, and Amil. Talib Kweli is the best of them and Bleek is an awful lyricist and Amil is a Foxy Brown ripoff.  Jay-Z puts some good material despite, like "I Just Wanna Love U".   Not a good album. Very commercialized. Don't buy it unless you are a huge Rocafella fan 
 I cannot believe they put this on the market.  Once it gets wet, there isn't much you can do about wringing it out.  It's title is true - it is a water magnet.  The problem is it just won't let the water go.  This towel is horrible.  I suggest using the 3-pack microfiber Meguiar's towels sold by Amazon as well under the subject "Meguiar's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber - Pack of 3" 
 Unless you're into spamming folks, who filter out junk mail anyway, you won't find much value in this book. Each chapter has some hypster claiming wild successes from their email (spam) campaign in order to get recognition (and thus advertise to the reader). 
 i gave one star beacuse it is not color this very old movies i want some in color about depression i have the prombleof the derpression   of you have any movies about this please let me kno 
 I bought this fan to use on my desk at work. You literally have to be like 6 inches from the fan to feel any kind of breeze. A few of the reviewers mentioned about two feet but no way. My expectations weren't too high but cmon if your gonna make a fan at least make it function slightly better than this. Especially if your carrying the Vornado name. Like I said I wasn't expecting something powerful just a small fan to provide a slight breeze on my work desk. This does not cut it at all. I'm giving it two stars because its actually a really cool loooking fan and its very quiet. Its a shame it doesn't perform as good as it looks.   UPDATE: I would like to increase my rating to 3.5 stars from 2. However I cant find an option to change it.  After using it at my desk it does an ok job of cooling me off. When i tested it at home for some reason it didnt seem to work as well. Anyway as long as your within two feet you do feel a slight breeze. I guess for 20 bucks you can't complain. If it was a BIT more powerful it would of been great. 
 This movie is complete garbage. I actually like Robert Downey Jr as an actor but hated him in this movie. Please do yourself a favor and don't watch this trash 
 This product offers much to chose from and I really liked the photos. However, I have yet to get this program to work right. I am able to view the photos but when I go into the the Export Wizard to save the photos, the photo has a transparency over the top of it, instead of in the background. I tried bypassing the Export Wizard by right clicking on the selected photo and saving. This also inserts the transparency over the photo. I called Hemera in Canada and they instructed me to call Encore USA in CA for support. Encore USA said they couldn't help me. Encore's technical support is "limited to crashes, error messages and lockups". I also referred to their website hoping to find help in the knowledge base or FAQ's. There was VERY little about this software and no help to be found. I wasted my money on a product I can't use and that offers no support for issues out of my control. 
 My mother-in-law gave me this cookbook and I was anxious to try out some of the recipes to show my appreciation for the gift.  However, many of the recipes seem overly exotic to me - and I am used to a wide variety of international cuisines.  It seems to me that perhaps the author has sacrificed authenticity on the altar of innovation.  I most recently attempted the banana cheese empanadas, despite my initial misgivings at the absence of fat in the dough.  This is the first time I've seen a recipe for empanadas in which the dough consists of only flour and water.  Needless to say, it was tough and flavourless.  I have not had much more luck with the other recipes I tried, either.  What I find especially irritating is the author's decision not to include photographs of finished dishes or diagrams of cooking techniques, but to showcase her own original, and completely irrelevant, artwork 
 the articles are "good" but the articles are wordy and doesnt get to the point. Too many annoying ads. If u want something to "read" this isnt the magazine for yo 
 I'm wondering if the previous reviewers did any online research on the subject before purchasing the book & giving it rave reviews. There's very little information in the book that I can't easily find online. A good/reputable essential oil supplier's website would contain much more information than this book. The descriptions of only a handful essential oils are also extremely lacking. Somtimes she'd say, this oil is usually good for xxx, but I tried just the opposite and it still worked well (paraphrase). But she offers absolutely no explanation why it still worked for her when the oil is typically used for something else. She casually uses her own experience as examples frequently, but offers no detailed explanation. Often she just says, I like this, or I don't like this. Again, no reason why she liked or disliked something. She simply doesn't sound like a professional writer to me (almost airy), and I expected a lot more from the book, especially after reading the other rave reviews. There are many books out there not even specifically focused on the subject of essential oils, but still contain much more useful & detailed information than this book. Total disappointment. Unless you're too lazy to do any online research and only want to touch the surface of what essential oils are, then this may be the book for you. Afterall, it does contain a small amount of information in an organized fashion, but I could've written this book in a week. Otherwise, don't waste your money 
 Waited weeks and still waiting to date for a credit. Very unhappy with return policy.  Wondering if I'll ever get my credit 
 Unfortunately the author did not get the basic premise correct. Ukraine does not mean borderland. The oldest use of the word found in written text is in the 10th century chronicle of Slava o Polke Ihoria. The term Ukraine is used as meaning within the kingdom, at the heart of the kingdom. The opposite of what the author writes. Borderland would mean Okraina, this is the difference between in and out. She also missed that Ukraine has the oldest calendar on the planet now dating to 7039. Another significant fact.  Maybe the next book could be an new history based on  archives from Lutsk and Kyiv that the author did not read. Missing such a basic premise clouds the rest of the book 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Queen's Fool" are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. "The Virgin's Lover" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to Trollope 
 All plastic.  You cannot angle the head. We were not happy with this, overall.  By replacing the low flow washer with a standard, the pressure was good. This shower head's main downfall was the fact is is plastic and you can't angle the head in any direction other than on plane with the pipe 
 While I have learned to steer clear of Oprah Book Club selections over the years (which always seem to be shallow downers), the Today Show Book Club sticker on this one seemed at least a little more encouraging. As a high school English teacher, I am always looking for books that might appeal to teenagers. Like many other books before it, critics have claimed this one has a Holden-esque feel to it. And as with other books that have made this claim, it falls short...way short. This book is listed on amazon as a "grade 9 and up" book, so my expectations were not quite what they would be for an "adult" piece of literature. Even with my lowered expectations, I was disappointed. The author is young, only 23, and his writing is very undeveloped. In fact, I felt like I was reading one of my 10th grader's stories here. So, I suppose on one level, he succeeded: he did create a youthful narrator. But, this compliment is not entirely complimentary. The writing "sounds" young, but not altogether real. The frequent cussing is pretty accurate, as is the struggle to be cool. But, the dialogue is still fairly out of touch with real teens. The partying and drug use were over-the-top, and the story about the pill-computer was pretty lame too. It kind of came together in the end, but not really. I expect to see this brought to the big screen someday and star some cheesy young actors like from Malcolm in the Middle or something. This future movie would likely get an R rating for the inappropriate elements, or get watered down for a PG-13 rating, but the effect would still probably only be popular with immature 14 year-olds. I didn't see anything worthwhile for older teens, or adults, and am frankly surprised this was part of an adult book club. It made a little more sense when I learned that Judy Blume is the one who selected this author. I wish I had known that prior to picking this one up; I may have opted to skip it altogether. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not good. There are other coming-of-age books out there where the writing is better developed, the characters are more endearing, and the plot is more feasible. Keep looking 
 Hundreds of writers have waded into the Arthurian waters and some have come away with great books. This isn't one of those times. The Guinivere in Dragon Queen is so perfect she's just a card board figure. The ruin of Merlin's character isn't even worth talking about. I bought it at 8:15 AM read it, didn't like and by 4 PM I got my money back 
 Reading this book I expected to feel the flavor of ancient Egypt and was very disappointed. As much as Haney loves Egypt she fails to convey this in her book.  The Elizabeth Peters books, written in a completely different time period at least portray some ideas of ancient Egypt.  Haney's characters seem shallow and the dialogue sounds more like modern American than Egyptian.  I had a difficult time "enjoying" the story line as I had to continually fight with the dialogue and lifestyle descriptions 
 The worst book ever written about the Middle East is probably Joan Peters' From Time Immemorial; in this book Alan Dershowitz not only attempts to usurp that dubious honor from Peters, he also heavily plagiarizes half her book in order to do so.  The man who has made a career and a fortune as a lawyer mastering the art of defending and exonerating the guilty turns his gaze onto one of the international community's leading delinquents and most prolific violators of International Human Rights Law, International Humanitarian Law and UN Resolutions.  His defending of nation states, however, is as unconvincing as his knowledge of historical events is laughable.  Joan Peters' book was completely demolished and shown to be a fraud by Norman Finkelstein, and even the most ardent of Zionists have openly admitted the book is worthless.  20 years after that book faded into oblivion, Alan Dershowitz plagiarized much of its nonsensical arguments to masquerade as a book of his own.  For a full documentation of this plagiarism, see Norman Finkelstein's personal website.  By writing this book, Dershowitz has inflicted more damage on Israel than a thousand books criticizing it ever could.  Any neutral who would read this book would realize how shoddy The Case for Israel really is; both the book and the `case' that Dershowitz presents are nothing more than a pathetic assortment of lies, bigoted arguments, idiocies, misrepresentations and highly elaborate intellectual scams. 
 I'm not even going to go into how basic and well... bad this book is. I recommend you go search some free websites on how to buy a business, you will learn everything that's in this book and more. 
 trying to make an exciting context, the author exaggerates and connects dots that are not ther 
 I'm a fan of Janet Evanovich and her Stephanie Plum series, I think it's laugh out loud funny.  I didn't care for this story at all, it seemed sloppily constructed and I agree with other reviewers, lacked a story line or believable characters.  I left off a few chapters into it, there was no point in finishing.  
 You got to be kidding me right? People actually giving this album 5 stars. Wow people are so blind it isn't even funny. This is all commercialized garbage. E-40 is all on this "hyphy" tip now, lmao how wack is that. Hyphy is straight wack, the lyrics have no concept what so ever. All pointless.  Production, well yea all these commercialized albums got production, like this album. But then again where are the lyrics?   This is one of those albums where you sit there and like it ONLY because of the beat/hook lol. People that listen to this type of music dont like real Hip-Hop, as I said theyre blind. People that arent big Hip-Hop fans, I dont criticize you for listening, but all you people that claim to be Hip-Hop fans, f*** outta here, you aint.   This album is for commercial rap listeners only, if you like underground STAY away from this at all costs. Pick up some real HipHop instead.  Peace.  
 movie about 2 women trying to con a pro at seduction. Mediocre dialogue with same acting and plot. The eroticism is wooden and tepid. Shabby treatment even for a French movie. Yuck 
 I was so excited to get this set in the mail for my son, but when I took it out of the package it felt like sandpaper. I have washed it several times but it is still very rough. Also the first time I washed it one seam ripped all the way down the side and frayed. It was very cheaply made, but my son does love it, purely because its Thomas I'm sure. I wouldn't buy this again 
 you'll catch VD from listening to this fag. Esoteric ripped him and you're better off listening to 7l and esoteric becuase they make better music and have got boston locked down. 
 ...and it's staring at you on the video cover.  It's more proof of Jodie Foster's brilliance that she manages to make you care about this character, when absurdity abounds in every scene.  No joke -- watch this with a 6-year old, and have him/her point out all the things in it that don't make sense.  It's a fun game that the whole family can enjoy.  Watch it anyway, because Foster is always worth it.  But please, Hollywood, let's find this woman some projects that deserve her 
 I can truly say that this products doesn't work. I have silky wavy fine hair and I am a hair food junkie so I used a lot of things, but this don't work. Usually anything can tame my hair but all this conditioner do is make it hard, matted, and tangled. Carol Daughter's products may work for some, but it hasn't work for anyone in my family and we all have different hair textures 
 This isn't a terrible album, but when you look at the work of Max's work with Sepultura, this just doesn't really hit a nerve. There are some very good tracks here, but some of the tracks are just plain awful, and Bleed would have been so much better without Fred Durst (hey I don't hate Limp Biskit, I do like a handful of songs, but Fred just doesn't belong with Soulfly) but there things do get better for Soulfly as their music gets better as the albums go on.. 
 Kirsch's revelation (sic) that Judaism has a long history of diversity and myriad interpretations is old news by roughly 3500 years [Note to Jonathan: that is the definition of Midrash in the first place.] Repetetive exclamations! that biblical writers tried to conceal, whitewash, or censor this or that bit of information are presented in a tabloid style as often as not citing sloppy research or questionable scholarship. Newcomers to biblical inquiry may pick up a few nuggests of basic information here, but for my money Mr. Kirsh would be well advised to pay more attention to his serious subject than to selling books to supplement his income.  
 David Thomson thinks he's some kind of superior being and criticizes in a pompous and condescendent manner everything Welles ever did. He's one of those people who think that Welles never achieved anything after Kane. He wonders if he was even really responsible for Kane? He states that Welles did not write any of the script (false), that Greg Toland was director of photography while Robert Wise was responsible for the editing. SO what did Welles do? He directed! Apparently, that's not enough to make Kane his movie, his masterpiece, among others. Well if movies were only based on photography, scripting and editing, then why would directors be needed?  Thomson insults Welles in every paragraph; he hammers him over and over, relentlessly. He focuses on the less successful aspects of his life and exaggerates them. He ridicules him, makes fun of his weight, says he's egotistical, a liar, a misogynist, an unfaithful friend, a machiavellic mischievous man who uses people, cheats on his wives, dates married women, eats like a pig and stuffs his face with anything he could find (he talks a lot about that), a pretend genius or would be genius who thinks he's the victim of evil Hollywood moguls. What other bad things could be said about Welles? Basically, any insult or evil thought you would ever have towards your worse enemy would not match up to the way Thomson writes about Welles.  Welles is not the only target of the author's wrath towards famous people. Any dead actor that was a friend or acquaintance of welles is also treated unkindly, as for the ones who are still alive, Thomson refrains himself from making a judgement. What a coward! Dead celebrities are such easy targets to criticism aren't they?  When Thompson runs out of evil things to say, he talks about his childhood and when he went to see The Third Man with his grand mother who for some reason has a claw instead of a hand. Oh poor little David, he could not hold his grandma's hand, only a claw! Tear. Who cares! Also, he has the annoying habit of interrupting every other chapter with imaginary conversations between the writer (?) and the publisher (?). It's never quite clear and really pointless. It's a way for him to put himself in value and shows how he can also criticize his own work. What a decent man!...  I was not expecting a hagiography, I know Welles was not godlike. Thomson explains at the end of the book that he does not mean to put Welles down, but only attempts to humanize him. Well there's a difference between humanizing someone and destroying the truth. Also, a biography should include anecdotes, facts, it should be detailed and accurate. Thompson writes some kind of very superficial, selective, inaccurate story, with imaginary dialogues about what people could have said to welles or thought of him. You can't assume things in a biography.  The author is too involved with his own thoughts instead of sticking to the facts in an objective manner. If you want to learn about Welles, read "Road to Xanadu' by Simon Callow, which focuses on Welles life up to Kane. Or "This is Orson Welles" which is a series of Welles interviews conducted by Peter Bogdanovich in which Welles tells the story of his life. Sure he had a tendency of lying about his past, but only because he was a story teller. Story Tellers always add a little to the truth. Thomson has no such skill.  Unfortunately I can't give 0 star to this book, or I would. It's really just food for the shredder 
 The book starts out great but then after the pages of ex husband slating and soppy life information I was left wondering whether this book was there to help people or a biography of the author's life? I have found books written by professionals a lot more helpful 
 Although well written, this book has many flaws. It is very pro-union and fails to mention the fact that unions, especially in this town are [bad]. Where else can a slacker maintain his job? The book also is a very hard read and goes on endlistly about dribble 
 I thoroughly enjoy a good sci-fi series, whether it's Azimov's Foundation series, McCaffery's Dragonriders of Pern, or Herbert's Dune books.  I'd heard of the Hitchhiker series for years and when I found it in omnibus form, I was delighted and picked it up forthwith.  But for some strange reason, it didn't happen for me.  Only because I'd spent the money did I manage to get thru the lot. But, with apologies to the Grateful Dead, what a long, strange, and gnarly slog it was.  I suppose  it's one of those things like Peter Sellers (YES!,) Pee Wee Herman (caaREEEPY,) or Barney (gagging sounds).  You love it or not.  There's no middle ground 
 This author has one heck of a writing style. It's all over the place!  He appears to be a well informed guy, but he's very hard to follow. He uses lots of dashes, parentheses, and notes about other chapters. Plus, there are many overuses of words such as "insofar" and "per se," which disrupt the entire flow of reading. It is not what I expected at all and am pretty disappointed 
 Slow,dull and done on the "cheap"....stick with "Zulu" and read your history book's ....far more entertaining 
 The author presents several different "methods" for sharpening a knife. They all boil down to "scrub the knife back and forth on a stone". This will produce an edge of sorts but not a very good one. He dismisses the collected wisdom of millennia of knife sharpening as "bull" without any evidence to support his claim. The author says he has "studied" and tested his methods. This mean he tries shaving with each blade until it feels right. The rest of the book is an ad for his products. Don't waste you money.  If you are interested in the actual science of sharpening with detailed instructions on how to sharpen almost anything then Leonard Lee's The Complete Guide to Sharpening is the book to read.  If you just want to sharpen you kitchen knives, send them out to a sharpening service every couple of years.(Ask at the local Chef supply store) They will use a slack belt or hollow edge sharpener to put a perfect edge on. This is impossible to do at home without a couple hundred dollars of equipment 
 I've got the first edition of this book and it was very good. After looking at the table of contents, I'd like this edition, but not at $150. I'll try at the library and revise my review later, but this is NOT the way to bring potential students into the fold. Two stars for not thinking about marketability, right when the field of Geography needs a boost from the best researchers. Was this book meant to sit on the reference shelf and gather dust? Revised comments: The paperback edition is out and worth every penny, so I'd give this book a 5 star rating. If you're currently studying or have studied geography, you'll probably zero in on the chapters that are of interest. And you may find some thin coverage. For example the Geomorphology chapter failed to give a thorough account of American Geoarchaeology other then to mostly praise K. Butzer. The Medical Geography chapter completely missed the boat on the critical connection between Environmental Health Science and Phy./Cultural Geography as practiced in the states. The few paragraphs covering Land use Planning and Env. Issues in the chapter on Applied Geography did not positively inspire or mention the numerous resources available for the huge number of geographers involved in or considering a career in land planning (see my Amazon review of Marsh's book Landscape Planning). However, taken in its totality the book is an inspiration for the American student of this subject. I look forward to other Amazon reviews 
 Although this book is dated, its republication has been eagerly anticipated. I am sad to report that the new edition does not contain the color plates that appeared in the original. This makes the text at times somewhat difficult to understand 
 This tuner does not function properly.  It jumps all over the board from A to F to G and the dots in the middle in one pluck of the strings.  I have just spent an hour of my time trying to tune the guitar to no evail, and let me tell you I have tuned cellos, violins, violas, and have had vast experince in tuning instruments.  This was absolutly the worst tuner I have ever used 
 This book was very disappointing. I would return it, had I kept the receipt. I was perplexed about why she didn't just focus on making a book about her love life. Maybe that would have been more interesting, but she hardly makes her French boyfriend sound the least bit important to her. I am an American young woman, so maybe I don't understand her humor. Most of the time I felt like the French had to put up with her, and her lack of sophistication,than the other way around. Yet another whiny book about someone living in Paris and complaining about it, which I find completely rude, and sort of seems to justify the French people's animosity towars Americans (though the author is more like the Brits) 
 Copeland's book is basically a collection of some of Turing's original papers, completed with a short introduction for each part of the book. I was disappointed by this book as (1) one can easily find copies of Turing's work on the web, (2) there is very little additional value in Copeland's comments, and (3) the papers are not reproduced in their original typeset and layout. Elsevier's "Collected Works of A. M. Turing" (4 volumes) does a much better job and offers Turing's complete work. 
 A decent primer for a completely inexperienced beginner, but it hardly goes past what anyone with basic perception & common sense would already know.  And the new edition is deceptive, too - the guy still talks about sending "demo cassettes" - it's pretty sad that they can't even update that basic of a detail. I'd STRONGLY recommend opting for 'All you need to know about the music business' by Donald Passman - it's infinitely more detailed & helpful, and is a very easy, yet informative read - you can get as much or as little out of it as you need 
 Nora Roberts's books are my escape, and usually a blissful one.  I love the magic, character development, strong women overcoming obstacles, and romance found in her novels.  Morrigan's Cross disappointed me.  Vampires are a little over the edge for me, but what made me close the book was the 10-year-old vampire with the protaganist.  I spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable, and reading this put me in a bad mood.  King was a comic relief, but he got killed.  That was when I did something I've never done with a N.R. book - closed it, put it in the closet, and later sold it.  I'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy.  Instead, I took out the Three Sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself.   
 This book is taken almost word for word in the intro from the movie "Patton" based on Ladislas' book.  It contains typos such as 'D Day' and also does not give any insight into the man.  Connecting Patton to  Deming seems a bit ridiculous to someone with knowledge of the two  men.  Patton did not consider war 'great', per se', and should not be  idolized.  He enjoyed it and was excellent at it, however he agonized over  the men he lost.  Perhaps that is the analogy that businessmen should make  today 
 I didn't expect great things from this machine, considering the price.But I did expect at least the very minimum. I bought 2 because I knew I was hostessing 3 baby showers this year & thought it would be really nice to have 1 machine flowing milk chocolate & a 2nd flowing white, with a nice tiered arrangment filled with fresh strawberrys & assorted fruit. Maybe a tier of nice cookies...WOW I was so dissapointed the 1st time I used them, what a nightmare! They don't flow smoothly at all,one of them malfunctions badly & the 2nd is not much better! I even tried them at the 2nd baby shower thinking maybe I was being unfair or had done something wrong??? Nope exact same horror! Clean-up is not a good or easy thing either! I have packed them up & they are going back! For that 3rd shower I will dip my own strawberries & make a pretty arrangment, stress & clean-up on that will be much much less! I am so frustrated over the machines I hate that I even have to give them 1 star 
 I bought this book as I was taking undergraduate-level Quantum Mechanics.  While it has a better review and analysis of bra and ket notation than, say, the Griffiths text, and has excellent applications (square well, energy levels, Landau Levels, etc.), it was practically useless until I finished the course.  Additionally, as others have pointed out, the outline is riddled with errors.  It is not as well-written as Murray Spiegel's Vector Analysis or Fourier Series books.  If you're a graduate student or want a refresher course, I'd consider it. Otherwise, this is not the ideal choice. 
 Tony Kushner's liner notes are a chilling foretaste of his Jew-hatred-soaked script for the film "Munich."  A paragon of self-regard, he sneers at the historicity and compelling morality of the Jewish people's attachment through the millenia to its eternal homeland.  Rather, Kushner makes a point of elevating the moral stature of the Islamofascists who have unhesitatingly and unceasingly for a century prosecuted a campaign of genocidal slaughter against any and all Jews who sought to reclaim their stolen patrimony (through aboveboard land-purchase and settlement, prior to wars of justifiable self-defense).  Like his evil Arab idols, Kushner cannot abide the concept of a restored Jewish commonwealth, secured on a foundation of existential legitimacy, political independence, and territorial sovereignty.  Zionism, and its morally necessary outcome the State of Israel, enabled and is continuing to enable the very effloresence of Jewish culture in the US in the post-1948 and certainly post-1967 vineyards where the Klezmatics have been frolicking and where Kushner has gained his fame and fortune.  But Kushner hates the very thought of being liberated, and seeks to sow that hatred throughout world Jewry.  The Klezmatics should feel ashamed for linking themselves to this cruel purveyor of assisted suicide.   
 I had to read this and many other books for a college course.  I am currently writing a critique of the work.  It attempts to offer some insight into the questions of why human beings have such a hard time living in har mony with the environment.  It does a decent job of explaining some of the issues, such as materialism and fear of mortality in modern culture, but is a total failure as a scholarly work.  It is more a freudian leap of the imagination than anything else.  So often the author makes huge sweeping claims about the nature of human beings and about anthropological history, but totally fails to back it up with any evidence.  He has childishly divided the world into two groups : the Givers and Takers.  His metaphors and analogies are all quite flimsy, but presented in a manner as to make you think they are irefutably true.  He uses poor literary devices to try to cover up the fact that he infact has no basis for many of his claims, such as those that the takers imagine that the world was made for human beings, while the leavers do not.  This is totally wrong.  If he has ever studied cultures of the world, especially those of south asia, he would be aware that this is just not true.  The work, besides being devoid of any literary value, and not having evidence to back itself up, is also down right heretical.  He makes rediculous and unverifiable claims about the history of religions and the bible that are evidence that the author is trying to argue for an agnostic or athiestic worldview subconsciously underneith the mask of his cares for the environment.  If you read this book, all i can say is that you should do some homework on the ideas presented here, because the author certainly has not 
 After a year-and-a-half wait for the corrected version (the first run had major technical issues) to be released in the U.S., I finally got to sit down and watch this latest live DVD from The World's Greatest Metal Band Ever. Man, was I ever disappointed. I had heard bits here and there about how people didn't like how (Maiden bassist) Steve Harris had edited the footage, but ordinarily I find it's never as bad as people make it out to be. I was wrong. It's that bad. The whole concert is put together with a rapid-fire pace that might be cool for a video single, but not for an entire live show. No shot is ever held for more than 2 or 3 seconds, except between songs.  If you have the CD's you know this is Iron Maiden in their finest live form, but on the DVD you'd never know to look at them, because you can barely see them.   The bonus stuff on disc 3 is pretty good if you're a Maiden diehard like me, but nothing new, really.  All in all, buy the CD, stay away from the DVD, and join me in waiting not-so-patiently for a DVD release of Live After Death, Maiden England and Live at Donington 
 this was a stupid book hence the name stupid book a boy named cloyd is staying with walter and a new friendship formed it was dumb if you have to do a report that is due in 3 days and you have to choose between a 7,998,654,123 page book on taxes and the 90 page book called bearstone for goodness sake choose the tax book. All the book talks about is an indian sitting there on his butt making kissing faces. 
 I've been a longtime FLA fan since the "Neural Implant" days. I don't know who the guys are on this CD but they sure don't sound like my FLA. This CD sucks. It's slow, boring, and fragmented.  The guys on this CD sound like either new comers or a band that has totally lost it's identity. Goodbye FLA!!!!   
 This book lacks any information about education. Such an essential subject - affecting children and adults alike - should certainly be included.  Nor does it include information about art (visual/performing) or literature pertinent to the people at the time.   It also has no index, so that searching for anything is ridiculously slow.  Visuals are lacking - textual descriptions of hair or various equipment are poor substitutes for an image.  Essentially it is a poorly organized dictionary, and stating that it is "a guide for writers, students and historians" is an overstatement to say the least!  
 I live in an area with no xm repeaters and must rely on good satelite reception.  I have purchased 2 sets of headphones for use with my inno, both of which crapped out after only a few weeks use (check antenna message).  It seems that this has been a common problem with other users.  I won't be buying another set, at least until a different manufacturer produces them 
 This car pictured could be a BASE or First Version defintely not worth 299.00 These are going for 100.00 and less on the web.   If you havent noticed the differences in the packaging it wouldnt suprise me. Lots of people dont notice. Heres the differences below...     On these 5 cars there is TWO versions of each driver(5 different drivers) that were made. First versions or BASE version and Second versions or "Added Features" Version.   The FIRST versions have NO "added features" stickers and you CANNOT race ANY TWO (or more) cars of the 5 different drivers' cars at the same time! Dale Sr. and Dale Jr.,  Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson and Tony Stewart cars of the FIRST versions (no added features) CANNOT race together! Transmitter frequencys cannot be changed. Speed and steering are straight function. (no varilable anything) They either turn right FULL turn or left FULL turn or it goes straight. Speed is either it goes FULL ON or it doesnt. Same for reverse gear.    Again, each of the 5 different drivers' cars made are two different versions of the same car one has more features than the other.    UPDATED or "ADDED FEATURES" versions have "ADDED FEATURES" stickers.     Those "Added Features" are... Digital proportional steering (variable steering), which means you can turn the transmitter wheel slightly and the car turns a little. Turn the transmitter wheel alot and the car turns alot. Variable speed control  this means you pull back on the trigger a little the car moves a little, pull back on the trigger all the way and the car takes off! This also works for reverse gears as well    Now if this isnt cool enough...    Each "Added Features" car has  DIFFERENT Frequencies for different drivers' car.  The transmitters for the cars are different as well. "ADDED FEATURES" version transmitter has two "trim" adjustments on the back of the remote as well as the Frequency Chip on the side of the remote than can be changed, and can also be changed on the chassis of the car. So if you own 2 of the Tony Stewart cars, you would have to have a Frequency pack to race them at the same time. Now, two or more different drivers' cars can race together (or Five people can race 5 different cars). NO TWO ALIKE CARS can race together UNLESS you have the "frequency of another car and transmitter"  to change it, or a "Frequency Pack" from Team Up Inc.    ALL 5 Frequency Chips DO NOT come with the car in the box, off the shelf. This "Frequency pack" is sold seperately!    You can also purchase tires, suspension parts and body hold down clips, fully painted and ready to use new spare OR other drivers' teams bodies, extra rechargeable battery packs seperately!    I have done lots of research on these cars and should you have any questions please ask...nascarnbroncosfans@msn.co 
 Yes, I have to agree with the previous review.  It doesn't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources.  It doesn't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything.  If it was less expensive I wouldn't mind as much, and just chalk it up to extra protection.  But that seems to be all it's good for 
 I purchased this book at Walmart, which rarely carries books regarding Shambala or any other Eastern ideology. It was cheap and on the clearance rack. I should have know better.  When I realized this was part three in a series I decided to read the first two books, The Celestine Prophecy and The Tenth Insight in order to be able to better appreciate the third one. After borrowing and reading the first two, I realized what a sham this series truly is.   First, I realize they are supposed to be fictional. However, when a work of fiction attempts to use historical background for its premise, the author should first do his homework and make sure the historical facts are completely accurate.   Additionally, when usurping a mythical name such as Shambala, one should know what the actual mythology entails, instead of making up one's own notion of what is involed.  Shambala is NOT the same as Shangri-la. Shangri-la was a fictional community in a book written in early 20th century Western culture. Shambala is an ancient Eastern mythical kingdom that is in no way similar to the fictional place in Redfield's imagination.  Also, beware of writers who combine religions and mythologies. As Joseph Campbell said many times in his lectures and books, they all contain the truth as seen by different cultures, but they must never be mixed together. It just doesn't work 
 This book attempts to cover the amount of theory that would require a shelf of books to cover adequately.  As a result, it basically only gives the definitions and results (theorems without proofs) in each topic, something that one could get for free from online encyclopedias.  There are problems with partial solutions, but they are not problems that a student who is exposed to the topics for the first time can solve.  Since there are no proofs of theorems or examples, one cannot solve those problems from studying from this book alone, so why even put those problems in?  To me this seems like a book that the author wrote to summarize the author's knowledge (if the author has really indeed memorized this plethora of information???), while there is no way of understanding what the topics are about if you are reading the topics for the very first time.  To master all the topics in this book would require years of serious studying, so you are better off buy books that specialize in these topics 
 I am a long time fan of le Carre - have read and loved all his books - until this one. I just could not summon the interest to finish it. Yes, I'm sort of curious about why this guy's wife was killed, but not curious enough to wade through all the documents and emails et cetera ad nauseum along with him to get there. I was on vacation and had nothing else to do, yet still, I could not wade through this mind-numbing book. I got about half way through - did I quit reading too soon? Did it suddenly pick up after that?  If you're new to John le Carre, start with an earlier book - seriously. Because he's a wonderful writer, really 
 Meanspirited book by a man who acts like he knows the "real" Martha Stewart.  If he did, his book would be authorized.  I am always amazed by writers who are quick to tear apart a successful person but who could never do anything anywhere what that successful person has done.  Martha Stewart came from modest background and by nothing more than her own brain, guts and hard work, built a huge company that employs thousands of people, provides wonderful products.    If she was a man, no one would call her a B****.    You want someone sweet who will bake cookies for you and coddle you, go visit your grandma.  You want someone who is sharp and expects the best, go work for Omnimedia and let Martha be your CEO.  The author of this book is a weasel 
 Book is very basic and the CD was not shipped with the book.  All the same books here localy have a practice CD included with the book.  So make sure you get what is offered.  Cheers Ji 
 The books that comprise the "Narratives of Empire" series were not written in order, and if you're reading them in order the cracks show up here in the sixth and final volume. In each volume, Vidal includes a preface telling you the story of the book you're about to read, and proudly reminding you that the entire series is the chronicle of a single family, direct in descent from Aaron Burr to himself. Yet when we get to "Washington DC" we learn that it was Blaise Sanford who purchased the Washington Tribune all those years ago and launched his publishing career, not his half-sister Caroline. In fact, Caroline Sanford has utterly ceased to exist, despite having been our main character during the previous two novels, during which she, yes, purchased the Washington Tribune and launched HER publishing career, only allowing Blaise to buy a 48% share years later when he was desperate. What's more, it was Caroline's mother who was descended from Burr, not Blaise's, as readers of volume three know perfectly well, which means that there are no more descendants of Burr left by volume six. Hmph 
 I ordered two copies of this CD, one for me and one for my daughter.  It will not play on my CD player, a Technics model.  We have never had anything like this happen before.  My spouse took the CD to a neighbor's home and was able to play it on his player.  On the strength of that, I gave my daughter her copy.  I have no idea whether she has tried to play it or not.  My guess is that she won't until next Christmas.  She is overworked and that won't be a high priority.  In case you are wondering, our CD player continues to work well, playing all our other CDs 
 After reading and enjoying Tropper's The Book of Joe, I decided to go back in time and read his first novel, Plan B.  A good casual read, no doubt, but certainly not as fully realized as his later novels.  The plan B of the title refers to four college friends, all turning 30. They kidnap a fifth friend to force his detox from a coke habit. This could have been a much edgier, grittier plot, but these characters are from relatively privileged backgrounds. So the cokehead's "prison" is a study in an unused family vaction home in upstate New York. On a lake with geese. And woods. So much for grit.  Tropper's true gift is for the dialog of the semi-disaffected, semi-bitter, late 20-something. Two characters in particular, Ben (new divorce and aspiring writer), and Chuck (desperate playboy and aspiring surgeon) carry the novel's verbal thread to the end, keeping up a steady stream of bitter, witty banter. This is to the detriment of the development of the two female characters, Alison (wealthy attorney with good breeding), and Lindsey (drifting sometime teacher).  Alison and Lindsey come off as relatively two-dimensional characters. I was disappointed by this, as they are in pretty much every scene. (On the other hand, this makes the novel ripe for a screen treatment.) Alison is hopelessly in (unrequited) love with Jack (cokehead action hero actor), and she never really develops beyond that. We do learn that men think she is "hot" (see earlier screen treatment comment) - a not so helpful comment for fleshing out a main character, as the whole kidnapping idea is hers. Lindsey is relatively banal and somewhat meanspirited. She too is described as "hot" (see above parenthetical snark).  Essentially, this is a novel about friendship and the plan b's in life that we all go through around age 30. And I think the book is successful on the friendship level. However, I felt generally let down when I flipped the last page. Lindsey and Alison both solve their problems by falling in love, or out of love, respectively - defining themselves through men, when they both obviously need to finish defining themselves alone. Ben, Chuck and Jack all end up with great career boosting plans as solutions to their problems. I'm not trying to get all feminazi here, but it seems rather facile.  I'm going to attribute plot problems to this being Tropper's first novel. Overall, it wasn't horrible, but I'm glad I read The Book of Joe first, otherwise, I would not have chosen this one 
 I read a favorable review of this book so I got it.  I have been reading obits for a good while and they are a great delight. I thought this book would aid me somehow in this pursuit,  but it did not.  All it did was to puff up  the professional obit writers, about how interesting they are, unappreciated , etc.  I guess I should have gotten a book of actual interesting obits instead. If the author could have cut the book down to 20 pages, it would have been enough.  My advice to people who are interested in obits,....  is to read obits.   
 I order'd this vacuum after reading other reviews.   One hour after placing my order I happened to find the identical vacuum @ a Target store and was extremely disappointed with its quality.  I came home immediately to cancel my order.  I spoke with two customer service reps and was told that I would receive an e-mail within 24 hours to confirm the order was suspended after notification was sent to shipping.    Twenty four hours later, I rec'd an e-mail notifying me that the vacuum had been shipped.  I was very upset at this news, as I had purchased this item as a gift to be sent to someone who is not capable of handling such transactions on her own and I now had to suffer the inconvenience, frustration and embarrasment of handling the mistake with her and the shipping carrier.  Usually, I am thrilled at the speed of service from Amazon with all other transactions.  I just wish there was more than a two hour window for cancellations 
 This book is horrible and chocked full of slanted thinking (?) and outrght lies aimed at dividing this country even further. It's a sad, sad day when this is what American politics have become 
 On disk # 2 some of the tracks "skip" when played and are inaubible.  Have not yet played all of the disks, but was disappointed to find this lack of quality - especially when the book topic stresses the importance of quality. 
 I have almost all the recordings of Neil Diamond since the early 70's and to listen to this is does a poor service to the artist's career as a performer. The audio remastering is poor, the musical arrangements are even worse. Even though this is supposed to be live, make no mistake this is no "Live at the Greek" or "Hot August Night" this sounds more like elevator music. If you are an enthusiast of Neil Diamond's music and passionate performance don't dissapoint yourself with this recording 
 I don't know if this item is for kid's lunch or what. The bag itself is small, and the mug is even smaller! Frankly speaking, I can't think of any use of it with this size, except maybe put in coffee. But then why bother using this mug? A regular mug can be much more convenient to hold.  Anyway, I just returned it. Regardless how much it costs, it has to be at least useful! 
 This is my 3rd Nora Roberts book.  I've read the first 2 in the 3 Sisters trilogy, and decided to read Chesapeake Blue while I (very eagerly) await Face the Fire in the mail.  Perhaps I was spoiled by the characters, the conflicts, and the love stories in 3 Sisters, but this book pales in comparison.  The Quinns are meant to be a family whose perfect and deep love for one another is tempered by a course and affectionate manly banter.  Sort of like 7th Heaven meets a beer commercial.  Anyways, Seth is supremely talented, handsome, kind, and sizzling in the sack; in other words, a stock Nora Roberts male character.  Alas, he is also entirely thick-headed, vain, and has the mental processes of a mule when faced with his "problem", which he only exacerbates over the course of the book.  So he has a floozy of a mother who blackmails him into huge sums of money on pain of, what, her leaking a story to the press which, once she removes all the parts that reflect poorly on her, would be about 2 sentences long?  And, he can't tell his troubles to his family that he loves "so" much?  I mean, I wouldn't tell Cam anything myself, because he seems to deal with every moment of emotion by pitching someone off the end of a pier in a fit of manly love.  But Anna and the rest seem like good candidates for a chat.  Finally, Drusilla.  First, the name makes her sound like a villian in a Disney movie.  Second, she is flat as a pancake, and I would pay for problems like hers.  At the very end, she exhibits a spark of life, and sort of morphs into another stock Nora Roberts stock character: the sassy, smart, no-nonsense, gal who steps up to defend her man.  Which, I like that character.  In my limited experience, Nora Roberts writes female friendships and falling in love brilliantly, but her male friendships need a few less put-downs and jaws clenched to supress brotherly emotion.  And, I agree with the other reviewers who wanted Seth to end up with Aubrey.  
 I love Columbo.  I have seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Season three is the only set on double sided DVDs as far as I can tell. It freezes and locks up on all my DVD players in the house. This needs to be made into a 4 disk set.  Universal should redo this season and give everyone a swap out.  This should be like a recall with no questions asked.  If I had to do it over I would not buy the third season.  With all that said, the episodes are just great 
 Oh how superior are these skeptics, these "Brights."  This book is undoubtedly flashy and clever; and yet it contains blunders of an elementary nature. Take the definition in chapter 11 of the standard scientific theory that, "human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God had no part in this process."  The last phrase is an addition by the Bright to suit his case, and is no more justified than a person of faith claiming that science can prove the existence of God.  Observations of nature are completely silent on the matter of the supernatural.  We may argue that our observations are consistent with the character of God, as a believer; or indeed that they are consistent with the absence of God, as the "skeptics" would hold.  I might find the book a little more tolerable if it was less smug, less certain of itself, indeed a little more skeptical.  As a scientist, and a believer, I am also a skeptic, and thus uncertain of most things, for who knows when new evidence will require a change in approach.  It seems that these "Brights" could exercise a little more humility and a lot more skepticism. 
 Sharks don't get heartburn, athlete's foot or jock itch.  So what?  This book is about bad science at its worst 
 The Tomtom has great features.  But I returned mine.  First, the maps are very dated.  This makes it iffy at best.  It has terrific potential, if it worked.  You can use a PDA stylus on the map sitting at home outside on batteries to plan a trip.  It's amazing.  But I wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it's internal maps and waypoints.  But I tried a local test first.  I used roads as waypoints, main roads.  This way I can force the Tomtom to use MY routes.  I did not like it's choices, since it is a dated map database.  I set up a local route, and started to follow it.  It took me to the first road/waypoint no problem.  But it would not go past the first waypoint.  I would go down the road (first waypoint) then it would tell me to take a u turn!.  I did.  Then it said take another u turn.  It had me going in circles.  Perhaps it's not made to use roads as waypoints, but all indications it gave were that it would.  The manual was no help.  Support was no help.  So it went back.  I have ordered a Garmin i2.  Hope this is ok.  I have taken the same trip from SE FL USA to SC USA with a Garmin C330.  The Garmin has maps that you cannot update, but got me to my destination no problem.  I don't recommend this TomTom.  Do research.  Go to manufactures websites and look at unit manuals.  Hope this helps 
 Wow..What lies.  I NEVER hear any kind of news channel favor the left...NEVER.  The media, especially FOX News, has a right wing bias..its 100% FACT, proven beyond any reasonable doubt.  The republican right wing NUT JOB Wackos INVENTED the concept of a liberal bias in the media for political advantage, and its simply not true.  Republicans are the worst thing that could ever happen to this country, all they know how to do is lie, cheat, steal, and profit off of the suffering of others.  Oh yeah, and these religious wing nuts are delusional bigots who think some guy waved a magic wand and invented the universe.  Give me a break.  This book is 100% lies.  I actually burned the book after I read it...(Notice the lack of credible sources).  Good job republicans...Continue to make up news...the people are catching on!  
 A CRITICAL REVIEW OF RICHARD WHITE'S  THE MIDDLE GROUND  By Jeff Hendricks  Richard White. The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650-1815.  New York: Cambridge University Press, 1991.     Richard White's The Middle Ground is a detailed and extensive study of the inter-relationships between various European colonists and the Native American tribes they encountered in the Great Lakes reigon of the current United States from 1650 to 1815. The study traces the development of what Richard White argues was a "middle ground" of cultural accomodation that was created as a result of  these encounters.  The whole of White's book is dedicated to proving his "middle ground" argument.    At the beginning of White's study, he creates a category that lumps together the Native Americans of the Great Lakes region, known as the pays d'en haut, into a grouping that he refers to as the Algonquins.  The Algonquins were an assortment of tribes from various areas surrounding the pays d'en haut who had been forced together into the region due to warfare in the east.   White's study begins with descriptions of  the brutal and murderous situation taking place in the pays d'en haut as the various factions of the Algonquins engaged in inter-village warfare amongst themselves, as well as war against the Iroquoi federation, which had been attacking the region from the east.  In addition to these inter-tribal wars, the Algonquins living in the region were also forced to deal with the French colonists, who had begun to enter the pays d'en haut in order to profit from the fur trade.  The entrance of the French traders into the region set in motion the events that would eventually lead to the formation of White's "middle ground."    White argues that the middle ground begins to form slowly, as the French colonists insert themselves into the day to day happenings of the pays d'en haut and work to achieve a position in the area that will allow them to carry on trade with the Algonquins.  White shows how, in order to achieve a profitable trade situation, the French quickly realize that they need to bring the inter-tribal warfare to a hault - or at the least reduce it enough to permit trade to occur. In their attempts at building a trading realtionship with the Algonquins, the French realized that the Algonquins' social system differed greatly from their own.  The French were products of a hierarchal society, and from that society they had been conditioned to see obedience and respect as things that were gained through force.  When the French tried to impose their own notions of social order on the Algonquins, who lived in a collective based non-hierarchal society, they soon realized that they would have to accommodate and negotiate with the Algonquins to form a profitable trade relationship with them. Simply brutalizing the Algonquins into submission was not going to work.  For the Algonquins, brutality did not breed submission - it bred resistance.     Another obstacle that the French encountered in their trade with the Algonquins was the differentiation between their respective economic systems.  To put it simply, Algonquin economics were based on need, whereas French economics were based on excess accumulation and profit.  The Algonquins were not accustomed to exploitative economic relations and thus resisted any type of trade that they did not view as meeting the needs of both parties involved.  The French, on the other hand, could not understand an economic system based on mutual aid and cooperation.  In order to push past this cultural/economic barrier to relations, the French had to create a system of trade that the Algonquins could view as a mutual exchange of gifts rather than a purely economic exchange of material for private profit.      The story of the formation of the "middle ground" was based on these and other mutual agreements and accomodations that were developed between the French and the Algonquins.  To facilitate trade, the French singled out individuals from various factions of Algonquins to mold into trade emissaries, whom they referred to as "Cheifs."  The French instituted a system in which they bestowed gifts to these Algonquin Cheifs, who in turn would distribute the gifts amongst their own village population.  In time, these Algonquin Cheifs developed a degree of authority within their villages due to their distribution of goods, as well as their ability to communicate with the French.  The European goods that the Cheifs distributed to members of their village soon became objects of  status in the Algonquin world.  As the Algonquins developed a want of these European goods, they began to spend some of their excess time hunting fur animals for the French which they could then trade in exhange for items such as rum, guns, knives, cloth, and various metalic utensils.  Soon this system became cemented, enabling trade to take place in a somewhat peaceful manner.      Once the French had created Cheifs within the villages who could weild some degree of authority amongst their own people, they began to use their economic control of these Cheifs to press them to pacify the warriors of their respective villages.  In this way, the French were able to help bring about the cessation of hostilities amongst many of the villages of the pays d'en haut.  Soon, according to White, the various Algonquin peoples came to view their relation to the French as one of  a child to its father.  The French became the only people who could bring about an end to the bloody fighting amongst the various tribes that was occuring in the area.  With this positon of negotiated power, the French were able to pacify the pays d'en haut long enough to build a profitable fur trade.    By 1701, the French had managed to help negotiate a peace between the Algonquins and the Iroquoi federation and thus had succeded in creating an atmosphere that would be favorable to their own economic exploitition of the region.  A period of relatively peaceful French / Algonquin interaction existed on the "middle ground" for the next few decades as the French and Algonquins engaged in trading relations.  However by the 1720s, the English had begun to inch in on French economic turf and by 1728 warfare had broken out between the English and the French/Algonquin alliance.  Although White continues with his "middle ground" hypothesis throughout the remainder of his book, the war of 1728 was, in reality, the beginning of the decline of the "middle ground."  Shortly after the  French/Algonquin alliance succeded in driving back the British, the Algonquins broke apart into pro and anti French groupings. By the 1740s, many of the Algonquins had turned against their French-made village cheifs, who preached peace and conciliation, and joined a republic comprised of various Indian nations whose purpose was to disengage from the "middle ground" and regain their traditional pre-European lifestyles. As it became increasingly apparent to the Indian villagers that the the French and English were engaged in their own imperial struggle and were only really interested in using the villages as pawns towards their own ends, the middle ground laid down on its death bed.    From this point on, many tribes, including the Iroquoi, developed an understanding of the true imperial nature of both the French and the English and refused to fight on either side.  Those tribes/villages who did decide to continue to fight on the side of the French in the Seven Years War (1754-1761) were doing so only as a part of their own strategy to rid the pays d'en haut of all European invaders - once the English had been driven out, the tribes had planned to turn on the French and drive them out as well.  Although there were still short lived re-births of  "middle ground" relations between the Algonquins and the French, these were not the norm.  Concerning the English, there was almost never any middle ground of cultural accomodation between themselves and the Algonquins.  After the defeat of French in the Seven Years War, the British occupied French positions in the pays d'en haut (in violation of a promise not to)  and as White himself states, "[the British] vision of the pays d'en haut was a simple one:  the British were conquerors; the Indians were subjects.  It was a view that abolished the middle ground."    The problem for the British was the fact that the Algonquins had never actually been conquered - they still retained village cohesion and the ability to resist British incursions with force.  As the Algonquins began to resist the British with force, the British cynically tried to bring back a policy of cultural accomodation with the Algonquins in order to normalize trade relations.  This transparent attempt to become "fathers" to the Algonquins was quickly scrapped in the face of Algonquin resistance to what they came to realize were British attempts to occupy their lands.  By the 1760s, open warfare had once again broken out amongst the Algonquins and against the British.  This pattern of short lived peace followed by rebellion and war became the norm in the pays d'en haut for the remainder of White's study, as the various factions of Europeans encroached upon Algonquin lands. By the early 19th century, at the conclusion of the book, the French traders and English traders had, for the most part, been replaced by American frontier squatters who, along with the implicit and explicit support of Washington, embarked on a campaign of removal and extermination.    Thus, a major flaw with White's analysis is the fact that the "middle ground" of cultural accomodation, which White describes throughout the book as being of central importance to the relations between the tribes of the pays d'en haut and the European invaders, was in fact already dead before White had even progressed halfway through his study.  Although White's descriptions of the various ways that the French and English developed methods to facilitate cultural understanding with the Algonquins were interesting and insightfull, it really should not have been the central theme around which the book was written.  The over-the-top focus on the "middle ground" argument found throughout White's book also leads one to question what political effect White had intended his study to have on the previous and current historiography on the subject.    White's book has been described by many historians and reviewers as a refreshing and intelligent attempt to tell the story of  Native Americans in a way that it has never been told before.  Colin G. Calloway, upon reviewing, The Middle Ground,  stated that he believed it to be a success because it altered from the established norm:  "most studies of Indian-White relations [are] too simplistic in their story of conquest and assimilation or of cultural persistence in the face of tremendous odds."    This speaks to what seems to be an attempt by White to frame his study as the real story - a story that attempts to avoid taking sides, either by resorting to romanticization of the Algonquins or slander of the Europeans.  However, the overall attempt at fairness and objectivity with which White seems to cloak his study in seems transparent at many points.    A major symptom of this problem lies with White's research materials and his interpretation of them.  White's study relies very heavily on documentation produced by the colonizers themselves.  This reliance may be a result of objective circumstance, as the Algonquins did not leave written documentation of their own activities, however when one is forced to rely on one-sided documentation to make a historical argument, it should be common sense to understand that documents cannot always be accepted as factual interpretations of past events. White runs into deep trouble when he incorporates, sometimes word for word, the writings of those Europeans whose economic and religious intrests rested with the demonization and slander of native populations.    In the case of European/Native American interactions, historians such as David Stannard in his book American Holocaust, have shown that many of the European accounts of interaction with Native Americans were deliberate exaggerations, if not outright fabrications.  Stannard has shown that it was common for European Army officers or Priests to exaggerate accounts concerning  violence, spirituality, and sexuality in order to justify to themselves and their superiors that their conquests and conversions were of necessity.  Continually throughout his book, White relays descriptions from military officers and priests that portrayed the Algonquins as savage, brutal, cannibalistic, drunken savages.  Attacks committed by Algonquins against Europeans are continually described in bloody detail while European attacks against Alqonquins are most often only stated as dry numerical fact.    There are other problamatic factors with White's choice of event descriptions in his study.  Granted, no historian can include everything in one historical study, White makes a few profound ommissions of historical occurances that would have had great impact on the overall cause and effect cycle of his study.  As was stated earlier, White begins his study in the midst of a brutal war beging waged against the Algonquin refugees by the Iroquoi federation.  White takes great time reprinting the descriptions of this warfare written by French colonists such as Allouez and Priests such as Nicolas Perrott. Page after page, White allows descriptions of extreme, bloody and canibalistic brutality being waged by the Iroquoi Federation against the Algonquins to enter his narritive without so much as a single remark about the possibility of exaggeration on the part of the colonizers.  The worst offense of these opening pages is the fact that White fails to even mention at all the fact that the Iroquoi were only in the pays d'en haut because they had been pushed west into Algonquin lands by the British.    White's opening pages paint a picture of the Iroquoi as brutal imperialistic invaders out to steal land and kill off animals for profit - White calls the Iroquoi Federation "an engine of destruction."   All of this in the first few pages really begs the obvious question: what then were the Europeans?  White shows his carelessness, or possibly his sympathy for European conquest, when he continually describes effects without refrence to their origin.  Why were the Iroquoi fighting with the Algonquins?  Why had Indian on Indian violence become endemic within the pays d'en haut region?  Why were Native American village structures falling apart? Why was there rampant alcohol abuse? Why did some of the Native Americans succumb to killing animals for profit?  White is only providing the symptoms while ignoring the root of the problem.      The debate over victimization and agency is one that is needed and correct for historians to involve themselves in and this debate is especially important when writing histories that deal with the European invasion of the Americas.  However, White's The Middle Ground has vastly over-emphasized the agency at the expense of the tragic victimization of the Native American peoples of the pays d'en haut.  White and his supporters are correct in appluading the fact that White's work has moved away from a Turnerian paradigm in which the Native Americans were marginal and inconsequential barriers to progress which were quickly overrun by Manifest Destiny.  To its credit, White's book is an execellent resource for researchers, and his extensive documentation of dates, places and names makes his book important as an encyclopedic refrence.  However, the analysis and arguments contained within The Middle Ground cannot lead to a realistic interpretation of how the events of the pays d'en haut actually played out.     Native American historians such as David Stannard, Ward Churchill, and others of the victimization with agency school, come much closer to a realistic portrayal of what the cirumstances were when it came to the interactions between the European invaders and Native American Tribes.  Their success stems from the fact that they make a concerted effort to get at the Native American perspective on the colonization of the Americas wheras White makes absolutley none.    Although in many ways White's book moves away from the classic Turnerian framework, it remains fully within it in at the same time.  White fails to move away from basing his analysis on primary sources written by the colonists themselves and in doing so he has produced yet another one-sided account, in line with the Turnerian framework.  White's book may not be Eurocentric, as it does involve the Algonquins as central players in the narrative, but it still remains entrenched in European bias and, because of this, it fails in its attempts to make a legitimate argument or to provide a realistic view of the actual events that occurred in the pays d'en haut from 1650-1812.

 The NY Times (Author Howell Raines) says it better than I ever could:  Comes now Robert McNamara with the announcement that he has in the fullness of time grasped realities that seemed readily apparent to millions of Americans throughout the Vietnam War. At the time, he appeared to be helping an obsessed president prosecute a war of no real consequence to the security of the United States. Millions of loyal citizens concluded that the war was a militarily unnecessary and politically futile effort to prop up a corrupt government that could neither reform nor defend itself.  Through all the bloody years, those were the facts as they appeared on the surface. Therefore, only one argument could be advanced to clear President Johnson and Mr. McNamara, his Secretary of Defense, of the charge of wasting lives atrociously. That was the theory that they possessed superior knowledge, not available to the public, that the collapse of South Vietnam would lead to regional and perhaps world domination by the Communists; and moreover, that their superior knowledge was so compelling it rendered unreliable and untrue the apparent facts available to even the most expert opponents of the war.  With a few throwaway lines in his new book, "In Retrospect," Mr. McNamara admits that such knowledge never existed. Indeed, as they made the fateful first steps toward heavier fighting in late 1963 and 1964, Mr. Johnson and his cabinet "had not truly investigated what was essentially at stake and important to us." As for testing their public position that only a wider war would avail in the circumstances, "We never stopped to explore fully whether there were other routes to our destination."  Such sentences break the heart while making clear that Mr. McNamara must not escape the lasting moral condemnation of his countrymen.  Mr. McNamara wants us to know that he, too, realized by 1967 that the dissidents were right, that the war had to be stopped to avoid "a major national disaster." Even so, he wants us to grant that his delicate sense of protocol excused him from any obligation to join the national debate over whether American troops should continue to die at the rate of hundreds per week in a war he knew to be futile. Mr. McNamara believes that retired cabinet members should not criticize the presidents they served no matter how much the American people need to know the truth. In Mr. McNamara's view, the president can never become so steeped in a misguided war that patriotic duty would compel a statement.  Perhaps the only value of "In Retrospect" is to remind us never to forget that these were men who in the full hubristic glow of their power would not listen to logical warning or ethical appeal. When senior figures talked sense to Mr. Johnson and Mr. McNamara, they were ignored or dismissed from government. When young people in the ranks brought that message, they were court-martialed. When young people in the streets shouted, they were hounded from the country.  It is important to remember how fate dispensed rewards and punishment for Mr. McNamara's thousands of days of error. Three million Vietnamese died. Fifty-eight thousand Americans got to come home in body bags. Mr. McNamara, while tormented by his role in the war, got a sinecure at the World Bank and summers at the Vineyard.  So much has changed since those horrendous times. The nation has belatedly recognized the heroism of the American troops who served in good faith because they, in their innocence, could not fathom the mendacity of their elders. But another set of heroes - the thousands of students who returned the nation to sanity by chanting, "Hell, no, we won't go" - is under renewed attack from a band of politicians who sat out the war on student or family deferments. In that sense we are still living in the wreckage created by the cabinet on which Mr. McNamara served.  His regret cannot be huge enough to balance the books for our dead soldiers. The ghosts of those unlived lives circle close around Mr. McNamara. Surely he must in every quiet and prosperous moment hear the ceaseless whispers of those poor boys in the infantry, dying in the tall grass, platoon by platoon, for no purpose. What he took from them cannot be repaid by prime-time apology and stale tears, three decades late.  Mr. McNamara says he weeps easily and has strong feelings when he visits the Vietnam Memorial. But he says he will not speak of those feelings. Yet someone must, for that black wall is wide with the names of people who died in a war that he did not, at first, carefully research or, in the end, believe to be necessary.  God damn Robert Strange McNamara to hell. (My comment 
 I guess I took a shot in the dark with this CD.  I had recently picked up Pendulums "Hold your Colours" CD which was really really good.  I was listening to that CD heavily for a while and then I saw this CD, which was mixed by Pendulum, and I have to say its nothing like "Hold your Colours".  But to be fair I kind of knew that seeing as the cover said "Jungle Sound".  However it just ending up being unbearable D'n'B similiar to that of anything put out buy Renegade Recordings.  Most of the songs have no real melody or a good build-climax-closure.  Plus with all the random screaming of jungle garbage it makes this CD a waste of money in my opinion.  All I can say is dont buy this CD...and incase you are interested in it, see if you can get it used or free, I wouldnt pay full price for this thing 
 I had the TX-SR304.  Everything sounded great.  However, certain times when I played my DVD, the Onyko produced a loud high-pitched ear-piercing sound.  Sounds almost like a record scratching.  The most common times it made this sound was during the DVD menu, when it replays the music theme.  The receiver would transition from Dolby Digital to stereo then back to DD again, then making that loud sound. Everything was great, but this one problem made me return this item, which is a bummer because I would have kept it otherwise 
 I bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys, who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school.  They did not like the narrator's snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words.  This is a great cd for high school or adults but not children.  A bust for us.  
 I'm very disappointed with this book.  Very vague and broad examples and not a lot of the nuts and bolts of success.  Jennifer Kushell is the self crowned princess of the young entrepreneurial spirit.  She claims to have launched successfull business ventures but never elaborates anywhere in her books or websites and instead offers page after page of fluff and filler on how to get ahead.  After wasting my time with this book and two of her other books, I'd be skeptical of allowing her to run a lemonade stand.  Please save your time and money.  There are many better choices by PROVEN success stories.  Multiple streams of Income by Robert Allen and How to Buy a Business: Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition by Richard A. Joseph are two of many that are a much better read for your time and mone 
 It's ok to have an appreciation for the arts. What's NOT ok is the author's message to kids that it's ok to completely cast aside your responsibility to provide for yourself in the pursuit of your dream of being an artist. What would have been a better twist on this story is that in the end the ant was not only a responsible citizen but an artist as well. I don't recommend this version. Stick with the original Aesop's fable version. ART IS WORK but if nobody wants to buy it then you better be able to eat it 
 I was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this, for hawk and bird watching. I had looked at Swarovskis, but they were way out of my budget, nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution.  These binoculars are crystal-clear, with sharp focus. The 42mm lens lets in lots of light, lots more than the 35's I've been using. I wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing. There are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm, nice because I always used to lose them.  For the price, these can't be beat 
 It was irritating to hear the singers butcher Cohen's poetic songs.  Like other reviewers I wonder why Bono had to be there?  It was nice that the singers paid a tribute to the man but it's unfortunate that they took it one step further by singing his songs.  Some of the renditions are simply BAD ... like Bird on a wire!  Please ... 
 I found this book to be horrible. It puzzles me how this book could be a product of a professor of history.  His chief failings are as follows:   (1)	He fails to use footnotes.  I find this to be inexcusable for a serious scholar.  He wrote a number of things, for example, that I found to be unbelievable, but because of his failure to provide proper citations, I was unable to follow up and double check him on his work.  Just one example: he wrote on page 22 that "50 percent of eighteenth-century New England brides .. were pregnant at their wedding[.]"  This is not something that could be known without extensive research.  I'm not aware of any statistical surveys or census information that could verify such a claim.  I don't think this kind of information would be found in church marriage records.  Did someone do an exhaustive study of personal diaries and make a statistical inference?   Academic protocol demands a proper citation, and he provided none. (2)	His organization was lacking.  This is a time period in which I have recently completed a number of readings, and yet I, at times, had a difficult time following where he was going, or ultimately what point he was trying to make.  At least I understood many of the specifics of events he alluded to, but a reader unfamiliar with the events would be lost.  In my opinion, he lumped too many things together, causing the reader to feel at various times like he was jumping all around chronologically and geographically and, at times, topically. (3)	I think the title of the book is misleading.  It is less a history and more an essay on how the author views the interplay between the political events of the day and the social dimensions.  Many of his points were lost on me.  For example, he develops the idea that early Americans lived in a violent world.  Well, so?  Who didn't know this?  Violence pervades most of history.  If I were his editor, I would have tried to get the author to focus more on what he was trying to do with this book.  Did he want the book to be a history book, a social essay, or what?  Anyone wanting to gain a fundamental history of the time period would be well advised to avoid this book.     Finally, I hate to be so negative for there is some good content, but I would only read this book if you are already well read on this time period and have nothing better to do, or if you are a professional academician with interest in this field. And for those of you who teach a history course on the American Revolution, please don't inflict this book on your students. For those who do not fall into those two categories above and you would like to read good history on the American Revolution, I recommend the following:  for the period up to and including 1776, Merrill Jensen's "The Founding of a Nation," for the time period of the Articles of Confederation, Merrill Jensen's "The New Nation," and for the Constitutional Convention, Forrest McDonald's "Novus Ordo Seclorum" and Catherine Drinker Bowen's "Miracle at Philadelphia." I am not well read enough on the war itself to make a good recommendation 
 The difficulty with this disc is that people are naturally overwhelmed when a family of Julliard-trained musicians comes along playing the favorites in an unconventional manner.  I will admit that they are very in sync and that they have a mass-market appeal that people like Pierre Boulez simply will not have.  However, the quality of their music is not consistent to garner the praises of the thousands that they have.  Some of the siblings simply play better than the others. However, some of the arrangements are enjoyable, and some of the pieces had genuine enrergy.   There were only a few outright failures: the arrangement of 'Simple Gifts', the Lutoslawski, and the Danzas Argentinas.  The 'Simple Gifts' just isn't well arranged, and the playing is uninspired and lacks energy.  I don't think that they understood the Paganini variations well, because it doesn't have the sparkle and virtuosity that permeates the piece.  The Ginastera is played far too slowly without any thought about the natural eneregy that the composer took from his homeland and infused into the first and third dances.  Although they will probably still be hugely popular, I would suggest that potential buyers should refrain from purchasing this underperformed disc and wait until another disc comes out that is more musically successful than this one.  For die-hard converts, there is enough good material here to entertain. actual- 3 star 
 To save yourself from taking the time to read the book, I'll sum it up.  Pesticides= Bad.  Buy local, eat organic=Good.  The part about setting up a kitchen for those who don't cook was almost humorous.  It was written by someone who doesn't cook much.  It then prepared you to expect the rest of the book to have simple meals that new cooks could do.  That wasn't the case.  The recipes look good. I haven't tried any yet, but I was hoping to learn something more not buy a cookbook.  I decided the only thing "urban" about the kitchen was access to the unusual ingredients that many of the recipes had 
 these will not work in a dvd recorder to record tv.  it didn't say on the webpage, but on the back of the discs it states that the discs support recording only at 4x and 8x.  my dvd-recorder supports dvd+rw media but to record television 1x recording must be supported.  
 Chapter two is worth reading, and so is chapter three.  The rest of the book is unintelligble.  Capra's cultural and historical analysis and argument are logically inconsistent with "the new physics."  Furthermore, Capra offers no treatment of Chinese civilization and culture aside from exploiting pop Chinese mystical terms.  Most of the book is a grand exercise in equivocation.  I'm sorry to run contrary to so many other readers, but my opinion is that this book will not be remembered well--if at all 
 Some may disagree, and in fact, many have asked me why I disliked this one so much; so, here is why:  - scratch 'plotting'... by this point in the story, 'plodding' is more accurate.   - caracatures over characters. A staple of the series, 2d characters; but by this point, when new characters keep getting introduced this late in the story, it becomes an annoyance, a drag and overkill.   - virtually zero gain.  the entire first half of the book is a rescue mission for a minor character and the mission, once accomplished (or not) is forgotten by the end of the book. The third fourth of the book finally starts to swing thigns back to the original LB premise of end times doom and gloom thanks to the horrific judgments; sadly, it's very boring and slow. However...  -... the book doesn't get good until the last fourth.  And that, my friends, is not good for the overall quality of this entry in the series.   By this point, it's obvious that the authors were REALLY stretching it. However, as I said, things got really good in the last few chapters and led into 'Armageddon', one of the best books in the series. How ironic.   Thumbs way down for Left Behind: The Remnant. It's sad when the best part of the book is a scene involving the antichrist sunbathing on a rooftop. 
 As a die-hard Conrad fan, I was disappointed by The Secret Agent, which seemed to try too hard to be ironic. Conrad is best in character studies, such as Lord Jim, and this plunge into political satire does not suit him. I love to make fun of socialists and anarchists as much as the next person (since, you know, they believe the same things when their ideologies are contradictory), and Conrad really wants us to feel contempt for the characters. Mostly, however, I felt indifference. There are some witticisms in here, and I enjoyed Stevie, the "slow" brother of Mrs. Verloc. Overall, however, Conrad was best at sea. Everyone should read Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim, and if you appreciate those, try Chance and Victory. But don't look to this book for an accurate or flattering representation of Conrad 
 I bought this book. I read this book. Then I put it back on the shelf where it has sat ever since.  I'm a more recent convert to Anne Rice's vampire books, having only read them since Pandora came out in '98 (By the way, thanks for that one Santa!)but I have since bought all the vampire and mayfair witches books. I enjoy the witches and the vampire books in two very different ways, and if I had not realised this before, it was made clear to me by this book. Unfortunately, even those parts I enjoyed were ruined by those I didn't. The introduction was both patronising insulting. Lestat's scene with the Pope, frankly silly, as has his very character become. I think the main problem I had with this book was the romance between my formerly favourite gorgeous fiend and Rowan, which seemed tacked on to the story as an after thought rather than a truely pivotal plot point. The series has been going for a while, and one can't blame the authoress for losing interest in the characters after so long, but one can't help but wish Lestat's final outing had been less... well, bland. I found the typographical errors frustrating, along with the plot holes and continuity errors (which others have gone into in great depth, so I won't bother with them). It's an okay resolution to the Witches series, but leaves the vampire series gasping and flipping around like a dying fish on the carpet. It's hard to say more without giving away the plot, so I wont, however, I will recommend other books by Anne Rice should this one not suit your taste.  DO read: Interview with the Vampire, Pandora, Vittorio the Vampire and Tale of the Body Snatcher.  Pandora, which I read first, remains my own personal favourite.     Now to address all the idiotic controversy:  1) Play the ball, not the man. When you write a review, keep your opinions of authors names to yourself. No-one cares. Nor do they care about your opinions of their private lives or habits.  2) Saying an author writes only for his or herself is not only a hideous cliche, but is undervaluing the work that goes into writing a successful book. If people are parting with their hard earned wodges of folding stuff  to purchase copies, and you are supplying copies, you are no longer writing only for yourself. If you are writing for yourself, it would be scribbled in private diaries.  3) On a public fourm, anyone can express their views, positive or negative. Variety of opinion is a sign of a healthy readership. Deal with it.  4) Don't feed the trolls.  When an author posts a rant, even if you feel it is justified, remember: Trolls who are posting merely for the attention take any response to them as a win and are thrilled. People giving honest reviews and critiques will find the vilification and insults defensive and immature. People who are devoted and loyal readers probably wont read any reviews. And those who make up the majority of the worlds readers, who have no particular affinity for any one author will take away a negative view of all those concerned. If you must reply to reviews (even the very off-topic ones) for goodness sake provide an calm and reasoned explanation do not denigrate, patronise or attack those with differing opinions.  This goes for reviewers as well 
 Not worth your money or time.  The sender was excellent but the quality of the DVD (regarding the content) was very racial.  Very insulting! 
 The story here dosen't matter. The main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending. Scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction, meth. Quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless. Roberts is so gay you want to smack his face. he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity. Rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius, a role he plays better than anyone today in film. BR 
 The book was great, but this version of the audiobook leaves so much out.  I prefer the unabridged versions 
 If you're looking for a presentation skills book, this is the wrong book to buy. It deals mainly with Business Etiquette--how to make an entrance, how to shake hands, how to enter a room invisibly if you're late for a meeting, what to do on a bad hair day, etc.   You won't be shown how to plan your opening, organize your slides, deliver your ideas, or deal with difficult questions at the end of your presentation.  Then there are some other problems that made the author lose this reader's respect. For example, did you know that Lao Tzu--that seminal Chinese philosopher from around 500 BC--was a famous communication and image coach? (It's on p. 19.)  From the number of stars it has received from other reviewers, it is clear that several people found this book helpful. It must fulfill a certain need. However, I was looking for a presentation skills book (I provide training in Taiwan to help Chinese businesspeople present their ideas to Americans and Europeans. [... 
 I really enjoyed Stringer's Grand Center Winter and am a life-long fan of Vonnegut. But I was terribly disappointed by this edited transcript from a couple of conversations between the two writers. Given the great potential  of such gifted writers, this book seems little more than mutual admiration;  it's short on substance or gravity and provides little insight to those of  us who may be interested in the art of writing. I would have probably felt  far better about this if it had been, instead, a magazine piece. But at  this price I expected more substance 
 Why is Danielle Steel so popular? This is the first of her books I read and it will be her last. Horrible writing: high school level 
 I agree with the comment below.  Boring.  I also have read all the books in the series and look forward to each new one.   This one was not up to the standard I expected with the In Death Series. By the end of the first chapter you knew the killer and why.  The conflict with Mira didn't fit either. Maybe the next one will be better 
 I was really surprised at how bad this book was.  It was terribly written and cheesy.  Both of the main characters are completely unbelievable - the author describes Joshua Seigl as though he were an 80 year old man - he is supposed to be in his late 30's.  He wears tweed caps, and calls people "darling"??  Even for a "literary" type, completely off the mark.  His whole persona was like something out of the depression.  As for the Tattooed Girl, this character was also annoyingly unbelievable.  No one under the age of 70 uses the word "Jewess" - EVER.  This book reminded me of a book that an adult wrote for children, completely failing to grasp a certain time and place.   CHEESY and overwritten.  But, naturally, I had to finish it, and I was glad when I did.   
 This book is based on on the opinion of the author and a few male "experts".  He bases his observations about women on his survey of a small group of church women who appear to represent the traditional role of the submissive stay at home wife and mother.  He never gives any other background of who these women are.  Dobson needs to wake up and realize that the traditional role of stay at home housewife is "history", even if the wife has chosen to stay at home and care for children.  Unless you are married with "traditional" roles you will likely be turned off by this book. I was. Some of Dobson's references in this book are so weak, as he seeks to show how men and women are so different from each other.  I believe that he has joined in the destuctive practice of seeking to look for how men and women are different rather than looking at our mutual needs like respect, emotional support, communication and loyalty. I gave this book one star because there are some parts that are interesting, it's just a shame that Dobson put this book out with the title it has.  Women and men should read this book with a very critical mind, if at all 
 I've found Timothy's K-cups to be consistently good, better than the Green Mountain varieties I tried (I haven't found a Green Mountain that I like yet!) But Parisian Night is the first Timothy's offering that didn't impress me. I bought two boxes of it from Amazon and have tried using different brew strengths, but it always tastes bland. It's bold and strong as advertised, but plebeian. To someone who's just bought a Keurig and had this blend as their first cup, it might taste pretty good; but compared with all the other, better K-cup varieties that are available, this one is better off skipped. I think it's just a fancy name for a boring blend that has nothing distinctive about it at all. Their "Midnight" dark roast is definitely more tasty, and even better than that are their Columbian and Italian K-cups, which are very smooth. I think Timothy's has the best Columbian K-cups on the market. But Parisian Night, well...let's just say that everybody makes mistakes 
 I really disliked this book. If it wasn't for Sam & Alyssa's story, the one "true saving grace" of this tired-awful book, I would have given it 1 star.    The plot: Meg's ten year old daughter and grandmother are kidnapped by terrorists. They threaten to kill Meg's daughter and grandmother if she doesn't comply with their wishes. They want her to kill or bring them one of their extremist opposers. She kidnaps this guy and decides to turn him in to the terrorists or kill him herself.    Completely unbelievable. This small, slight woman is able to drug and drag around a grown man? NOT!!  Plus, Meg doesn't care who she kills or hurts to get her daughter back. It was terrible. It gave her some rather unlikable character traits. I found myself not caring what happened to Meg, her grandmother or her daughter. She is completely unpatriotic. I could not figure out what John found so attractive about her. He's a Navy Seal. This is a man who puts his life on the line for his country. Would he really want to be with a woman who is completely nuts? I don't think so.    Plus the World War II story was a drag. Why bother? It was a waste of time and paper. Both Ms. Brockmann's and myself.    I find myself wondering what the hype is about Suzanne Brockmann. I have read four of the Seal Team 16 books, or rather tortured myself to read them. I later realize it is because I am trying to find out more about Sam & Alyssa's history. I first learned about them in "Wildcart Karmody's" story and have been reading the books in reverse sequential order to discover more about them. I have ordered Sam & Alyssa's story and truly believe that this will be my last Suzanne Brockmann book. Her love scenes are drab, her plots disjointed and with three to four storylines running consecutively, usually just plain confusing.    Suzanne, I'm truly disappointed 
 I borrowed Changing Minds from the library looking for a foray into the science of altering opinion. The book is mostly write ups that are not supported.As other reviews say 'where is the proof? 
 I agree with the other reviewer.  The title is just too misleading.  Half the recipes are cooked, thereby destroying all the valuable enzymes.  A Raw foods book should contain all raw recipes.  Maybe she should've called it "Dining with Rita". If all the recipes were raw, then I would've given this book 4 stars 
 The Oral-B is a good product but the refills certainly aren't worth what they charge for them.  I don't know about you but it has always annoyed me when you get held hostage by a company to buy their refills for the item they sold you at a rip-off price.  They could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of $8.50 ea is beyond absurd.  The other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months.  That's a real laugh.  Even brushing just once a day, you're lucky if you get a month out of them.  So not only do they rip you off with their refill cost, they also lie to you to get you locked into their product to begin with 
 I absolutely loved the Left Behind series...some installments more than others, of course, but it will always remain one of my favorite series. At first I was excited to hear that they were going to write prequels...a chance to get to see how the characters in Left Behind became who they were, and all that...but after getting a few chapters into the book, I was struck by how boring it all was. Also, it felt like the authors went a little too into detail about some of the Satanic stuff...but maybe that was just me.  Despite my disappointment with The Rising, I will probably continue to read the prequels; one can only hope that it gets better from here 
 I love the Redsox and have since I can remember, but I had trouble finishing this book.  So we get a diary from the perspective of two diehard fans.  All this does is remind me of what I was thinking during the season before/during/after certain games, but it never provided me with an interesting tidbits.  As for the perspective of a true "diehard" fan, O'Nan acts like an imbecile.  I can imagine him out at the game forcing his way past kids to get balls during batting practice.  Wow, that sure is fun to read about!!!!  And his obsession with his fishing net is scary as well.  He comes across as a whiny kid in an adult body that has fun bragging that he had an "in" during the season.  He provided nothing to the enjoyment of this book.  King was better, and because his mind seems to work differently than the average person, it was fun to see his perspective on certain events.  Some of his passages are the only reason that I gave this book two stars instead of one.  I would suggest that if you followed the season closely either through reading the Globe or Herald, or listened to Boston sports radio, you will get nothing out of this book.  If on the other hand you were caught up in the euphoria of the postseason and want to know some of the feelings Redsox fans went through during the season, you might enjoy some of the book.  Now can I direct my book royalties so that O'Nan doesn't get anything 
 Early on the authors of this book let us know their extreme disdain for Christianity.  This didn't bother me at first, though I am a believer in Yahushua/Jesus.  It is always good to get more than one perspective.  But the constant sarcastic put downs of Christianity, and the presentation of themselves as understanders of the Gospel and it's impetus in history, got to be annoying really fast.  Baigent & Leigh think they are knowledgeable, they present themselves as objective scholars, but they are actually very biased.    It appears to me that their operating principal goes something like this:  "The supernatural stories of Jesus Christ are totally mythological [this belief they cannot resist emphasizing over and over, tiresomely] i.e., lies.  We know this because we assume a priori that the supernatural as it is presented in Scriptures does not exist and because we are beings who have vastly superior intellect to that of Christians. Therefore...we don't have to be too careful about our understanding of the Gospels, and can with impunity present ourselves as if we are experts on it, even though we are not at all - because you see, it's all nonsense and doesn't matter anyway!"  This type of intellectual dishonesty and sloppy thinking - like for example claiming that Paul was the first one to start worshipping Yahushua (hello, how about the first chapter of John, and the Apostle Thomas bowing before His feet and saying, "My Lord/Adonai and my Elohim/God" - duh) made me realize I couldn't take seriously any "scholarship" these two have to offer.  When it comes to the Dead Sea Scrolls there is so much controversy.  Why should I trust these sloppy, dishonest thinkers, to tell me the real truth?  Answer:  I didn't and I don't.  There is some purely objective fact to be found in the book - most of it known very well already.  If you haven't heard those parts already, you can find them on the internet and save the money 
 I am extremely dissapointed with this new edition of the text and have one advise only: If you own 2nd ed., do not indulge in this new edition for even the errors (spellings for one) are xeroxed onto the new edition.  Therefore, for a review of the text itself, you may, without any compunction, refer to 2nd ed.'s comments, of which there are many 
 ...but the movie was just plain stupid. Don't waste your time 
 I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE THIS GROUP A HIGHER GRADE, THEY ARE VERY TALENTED, BUT UNFORTUNALY ONLY THEIR "LOVE" TRACK IS WORTH THE PRICE.  IF THEY COULD PRODUCE MORE LIKE THAT - THEY WOULD BE GOING SOMEWHERE.  AS FOR THE REST OF THE CD, THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD APPRECIATE THAT IS IF YOU WERE ON DRUGS - IN A DARK MOOD 
 After a couple of articles written about the same period of Tarantino's carreer (which was very short so far when this book was published) I got a strogn sense of de-ja-vu. It's basically the same questions and answers all over again, and the book only slowly goes forward to the next film or project.  I guess a book like this would be much more interesting if the filmmaker had done a lot more films and the book could do with only 1 or 2 interviews per period. This one was written too soon, alas 
 I can not imagine anyone, who likes "Traffic" as much as I do, enjoying this crap. Don't expect to see these outstanding musicians doing their magic for more than 10 seconds at a time. Another bunch of losers, who believe that just to show the artist in action is not what music lovers are after, were allowed to screw up ones again. Don't buy this one hour long McDonalds commercial with "Traffic" music as a soundtrack 
 AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN OUT OF THE SPORT FOR 10 YEARS AND LOOKING TO GET BACK IN, I BOUGHT THIS BOOK EXPECTING MORE. THE BOOK STARTS OUT WITH A GOOD HISTORY OF THE 3 WHEELED ATV, BUT DOESN'T ELABORATE TOO MUCH ON QUADS. (WHAT ABOUT THE MID 80'S SUZUKI'S - QUAD SPORT/QUAD RACER?)  ANOTHER DOWN FALL OF THE BOOK  IS THAT IT STRONGLY FOCUSES ON UTILITY ATV'S AND RARELY MENTIONS SPORT MODELS. AS FAR AS THE MAINTENANCE SECTION OF THE BOOK... IT ... 
 Barry Sears' bestselling Zone Diet has helped millions of Americans get off high carb diets,lose weight, balance blood sugar and boost moods and energy levels. He has even dared to tell readers that "no cholesterol lowering diet study has ever decreased total mortality." Right on. But the regular Zone Diet was challenging for vegetarians, particularly vegans, so Sears came up with THE SOY ZONE, billed as "the healthiest Zone diet ever." Sadly most dieters who have gone on this high soy protein diet sooner or later sing the low carb blues. More than 70 years of studies link soy to thyroid damage, manifesting most often as hypothyroidism, a cause of weight gain, fatigue and brain fog -- three ills people enter the Zone to avoid! In addition, soy contributes to many other health problems, including digestive distress, reproductive disorders, infertility, immune system breakdown and even -- health claims to the contrary -- heart disease and cancer. Soy is also widely acknowledged as one of the top 8 allergens. Contrary to popular myth -- and soy industry marketing hype -- Asians use soy in the diet as a condiment, not a staple food.  They not only eat much smaller quantities than found in "The Zone" but different types of soy food.In short, this is a dangerous diet in which possible benefits are far outweighed by known risks 
 Its long winded and boring (it does pick up after the first 150 pages...) If you really really really love the sex pistols, and are obessed with tiny little facts about their manager, and their lifes, then this book is for you. If want to know more about the punk movement, anarchy and beyond  don't read this book 
 I'm the sort of guy who has a bit of trouble adapting to normal life. I'm still bemused and puzzled the mechanics of toilet-flushing. My wife (may she rest in peace) bought me this book as an anniversary present last month before she was tragically torn apart by a rabid pack of alligators at a Wyoming nature preserve. Anyway, life moves on.  Much to my disappointment this book did not teach me everything I should know how to do. "But Fred," you might be saying (and I'll be saying "Fred isn't my name, idiot!"), "how do you know what you should know if you don't know what it is to begin with?"  Ah, well, let me explain. See, if Tchikavoslky taught me one thought, it was this: I know nothing.  So it is with this deep insight into my own mind that I came up with the following Things I Should Know, based on what I currently do NOT know:  1. How to start a hurricane. This is very important.  2. How to kill a man with a toothpick. What if you met a hitman at a fancy restaurant and found out your were his next victim? Scary.  3. How to run a nuclear powerplant with a one-man army. I don't want to be the next Homer Simpson!  4. How to raise children. I've raised ten and still haven't figured out what a diaper is.  5. What a diaper is. I don't know, my wife used to talk about them a lot.  6. How to drive. Sure, technically we're supposed to learn how BEFORE we get our driver's licenses, but like many people, I just got a fake one when I was 12 and have been driving since then. I've been in over three hundred vehicular accidents and been charged with five counts of manslaughter, so I figured it might be good to learn how to drive.  7. How to stalk a celebrity. You just never know.  8. How to put on underwear without leaving stain marks. You fellas know what I'm saying!  9. How to make coffee. People ask me to all the time, and because I don't know how, I just take some warm water and pour mud in. Thankfully no one's noticed my inadequacies yet, but I'm sure soon enough they will, after another person dies of food poisoning and internal infection.  10. How to kill yourself. I don't want the aliens to get anything out of me when I'm taken hostage. I saw it in that Tom Cruise movie, and it was sure scary!  So with these things in mind, I'm severely disappointed by this book, and feel it is mis-marketed and stupid.  Please, Barbet Schroeder (or whoever the author was), write a better book next time 
 "The Skin I'm In" is fabulous, but I don't think this lives up to it at all. The first third of Bang! is an excellent evocation of a family and a neighborhood in decline.   After that, the book itself declines into unbelievable, author-directed silliness. Even if everything that happens to Mann after his father abandons him in the country is taken at face value, I find it impossible to believe that for a whole month no family member and no person in authority thought to look for the boy at the stable where he loved to go daily. A stable that became convienently empty just in time for him to move into it.   And to call the child Mann when the whole book is about rites of passage into manhood is just ludicrous. The final scenes of supposed redemption between Mann and his father are some of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes I have even read in fiction of any type.   The many messages of the novel are worthy, but the novel itself is quite flawed 
 I bought one thinking the larger size and villaware name would yield great results. I presently use 2 small cuisinarts to pump out enough waffles to keep the masses happy. I cannot tell you strongly enough what an utter failure this maker is. Just like the previous reviewer, I had it on high for several minutes and the lower parts ended up dry and burnt and the upper uncooked. Uneven, slow and way too underpowered. The top sits down unevenly and the weight allows for little flexibility in top rising. It is a shame as the manufacturing and materials seems to be very high quality, but the design is horrid. Proof is in the pudding, and after 8 minutes in this thing at high, the waffles still looked like pudding. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! 
 13 Stories, 13 Epitaphs is the second book by William Vollmann that I've read and I still am not quite sure what to make of him. The first was Butterfly Stories, a sordid tale of a journalist and photographer in Thailand chasing hookers, looking for the one with a heart of gold. 13 Stories is somewhat similar with several people who are homeless, jobless, and addicted drugs, as well as several whores. It's hard to judge his writing without considering the content he writes about, which is usually derelicts and people on the fringes of society. It makes me feel uneasy and uncomfortable, I can't relate with the characters and don't find much redeeming about his stories, it doesn't seems like he has an overall plan, it's not necessarily a morality tale.  I think I've had enough of his novels 
 The Corrs are good at what they do..Trad-orientated pop, but on this album, I feel that they have lost their way a little. Always difficult to follow a 'Talk On Corners', but this album is just average,at best. There are some nice tracks here like 'All the Love in the World', 'Radio' and 'Breathless' but apart from these, nothing else really rises to the challenge. Lyrical content is amatuerish with this collection and it sounds like an album that was not as lovingly nourished as the others 
 I came across this book unexpectedly and bought it with great anticipation after having so enjoyed Robert Littell's novel The Company.  While the bar may have been set unreasonably high for The October Circle, I must classify this book as a disappointment.  I enjoyed the insight into life in 1960's Bulgaria, but the storyline was too slow to develop and the characters, including the main protagonist, were entirely undesirable.  I recommend skipping this one 
 I was required to read this for my high school senior Philosophy class, and it is nauseating. Rachels hides behind the ostensibly noble endeavor of writing a book about moral philosophy, and uses it to defend homosexuality, abortion, and disregard for The Bible. He might as well title the book "My Arguments Against Christianity," for that is really what it is. His skepticism when it comes to Christian faith and The Bible are only proofs that he is one of today's "enlightened" philosophers who is too "intelligent" to fall for the ridiculously simplistic beliefs of Christianity.  This book is a terrible anti-Christian screed, a total waste of time, and a sorry attempt at philosophy 
 Some of the articles are well written but others are very repetitious and not rich in analysis.  They are usually very short, and chould have been developed more. @More careful analysis needed.  They also use a lot of  "I's" in their writing.  They emphasize a lot on their own  experience, not what others think.  Not really academically written.   Some  authors just repeat the same thing over and over again, which makes the  whole book dull.  One advantage is that it is easy to read 
 ...if you want to listen to the music with the dialogue.  I personally like to listen to soundtracks that are, well, soundtracks, i.e. music, not the audio track of the movie.  Oh well, the couple of pieces that don't have obnoxious voice over are just fine 
 I have the original Fox and The Hound and have watched it many times. This new sequel does not tug at the heart like the first, therefore, this new storyline seems rather silly.  Do see the original first, otherwise, you may miss a wonderful family film 
 Cruel, horrible story with a typical Barr convoluted plot. The abuse of children, evil ranger poising as a dead ranger, freaky religious sect, dead animals on the bed, and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me. I've read many Barr books, and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters, it's hard to keep them straight. In this book, that was the last of my worries. I didn't even finish it, I was so turned off 
 Shame on me for not reading the reviews on this product!  It is garbage.  A waste of time and money 
 This bookstand, despite the description, is not suitable for heavy books. If you put heavy books on this, the stand that props up the whole unit is likely to snap off. 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 After listening to Symphony of Destruction by Megadeth, I tossed this CD into the garbage.  I can't believe I listened to this trash.  I wanna sex you up?  PLEASE.  That is SO 1980s.  I'm into new stuff now, and Megadeth is as current as it gets.  Oh, and the Color Me Badd CDs are also EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE 
 What a crushing disappointment this book is. I couldn't help but be distracted from Zimbalist's thesis by the all too numerous typos and other errors. Albert Bell, Robb Nenn, Lou Pirini just to name a few misspellings. There are factual errors as well. I don't know whether this book needed a better editor or they just didn't care. Eitherway, this book is one to avoid for the serious baseball fan 
 The illustrations are nice. The instruction consists mostly of showing a drawing with a few general comments thrown in. I learned very little from this book 
 This is literally the ONLY Prince album that gets less than three stars from me, y'all. I love the man an' his eccentric genius, but the material here was just not hittin' for me. It's flawlessly performed as all his work is (the man is the most sheer perfectionist in the biz, which makes his incredibly-prolific output all the more impressive an' mind-blowing), but, in spite of it all, this one jus' left me flat an' uninspired. The stabs at electro-rock an' rap on 'Loose' an' 'Race' respectively jus' don't do it for me on this outing (the latter topic he tackled to much better effect on his next effort in the form of 'We March') an' even a slower ballad like 'Space', while technically well-crafted, lacks the real SOUL to get you enthusiastic about it. This album's definitely dark as others have mentioned an' not for mainstream appeal, but thas' NOT why I don't really like it (y'all should know me by now!). And as I keep stressing its flawlessly-performed. My disappointment is in the sheer BLANDNESS of its perfection. (Yea, so maybe that doesn't make sense, but it sounded good in my head, so I'm stickin' with it!)      There are however two tittilating numbers on here that make this almost worth having. The grandiose epic title track 'Come' for those "18 an' over", is a slinky 10-minute-plus groove with a hypnotic horn-and-rhythm section. The other is the searing story of parental abuse an' neglect he tells on 'Papa'. Prince has the amazing ability to find new ways to sum up life an' mankind in general with jus' a couple lines, an' he does this on jus' about every album, even the lesser ones like this one. Here on 'Papa' he gives us words to live by: "Fair to partly crazy, deep down we're all the same, Every single one of us knows some kind of pain." 
 Its an interesting read, but far from scholarly, and I certainly would never use it as a reference in a scholarly discussion. However, the humor makes it worth the price. But back to criticism...  One of the frequent quotes cited from Harwood is on the physical appearance of a historical Jesus. He paraphrases an impossible to verify 'work' of Josephus. But even the Testimonium Flavianum, which is another Josephus passage of far more credibility has proven itself an unlikely source of extra-biblical Christian evidence, and probably a pious interpolation. Yet in Harwood's mind this and far less compelling conjecture is good as gold. I'd recommend the interested reader find a decent translation of the meagre texts drawn upon by scholars and would-be scholars and make their own judgement. Still, unless some great archaeological discovery is made in the future, there's very little to be added to Abrahamic scholarship that isn't composed as simple polemic. 
 This book was a chore to read, too slow, too cluttered and the love interests weren't even interested in each other much less showing any personality.  The people never came out of the book they were flat and pathetic.  I am an avid reader, and enjoy books that include the supernatural.  It is pretty hard to make a vampire as dull and numbing as this one was.  If you are interested in something interesting with a twist of the supernatural I would recommend that to read Laurell K. Hamilton or Christine Feehan over this particular author 
 I love Linda Howard, but I didn't even finish reading this book because it was so boring and annoying!  The heroine was a whiny martyr--she drove me crazy!  And where was the suspense?  I truly can't believe that people liked this book!  If you want to read a good Linda Howard book, read "Mr. Perfect" or "Dying to Please" 
 The book seems to be more for scoring political points rather than genuine scholarship. The first line in the description says it all - "A book the government of India demands be ritually burned". The BJP led govt. is "demanding" and book to be burned, but "hasn't". While individual members in the BJP govt. are entitled to their own opinion, the govt as a whole hasn't made a policy of banning it. The Allahbad high court (which is totally different than the BJP led govt) has on grounds of hurting public sentiment. Which means this book is banned via the valid legal process.  This book is a publicity stunt and rehash of the work done by other renowned authors/historians previously 
 For the last 2 years I have listened to about 1 audio book per week and this takes first place as the worst of the lot. The exercises in this audio book are trivial and insulting. Save your money 
 Very dissapointed in this outfit, looks really nice in pictures but is very cheaply made frayed the first time put on.  
 Talk to the Polish and South Koreans, and ask them why they do more with less.   
 The title of the book was a bit misleading. The Playboy Mansion was only mentioned in about 10% of the book, and it was not the part of the book where everyone was having most of the wild parties. It was the part where she sought refuge from the crummy life she was living with her father, who was Hugh Hefner's doctor.  Her father was a mess.   The rest of the book was repetitious- how many times can you tell about parties which all sound the same-- sex, drugs, more sex, etc.  Actually, since she was so young, the whole book was pathetic and pitiful.  What a life for a teenager.  This book is very sad. 
 This book is unfortunately not up to par for Kay Hooper.  Her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is (there isn't a single clue at any point in time).  The heroine keeps loosing her memory, so you don't even have the usual good characterizations of hero & heroine (since she can't even remember much about herself, much less him).  If you like Kay go ahead and read it, but I hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard 
 This book is way overated.  Its way-out, wacky treament of electronics could definitely not be that of any well thought-of engineer.  It's frankly just a bunch of goofy unsystematic mumbo-jumbo by some over-educated self-proclaimed "physicists."   So imagine my surprise when I read a translation of this in Russian.  I think the whole world must have been duped.  Do yourself a favor.  Go read the Smith book (see my other reviews) and avoid this one like the plague 
 I am an Oil professional - 30 years in drilling and production. This book is very timely - we are running out of oil - All the major oilfields are in decline. New (significant) oilfields are not being found. As this progresses it will be a very big change of life.  The author repeats and repeats the same ideas with few facts. Saudi keeps it technical information private. I was disappointed with this book. : 
 There is not one reason to purchase this DVD.  Neither kids or adults will enjoy it.  I was hoping for something along the lines of America's Funniest Home Videos (WITHOUT Bob Saget) but it did not even live up to that weak standard.  A total disappointment.  Avoid at all costs unless you enjoy watching overweight folks perform pig calls at a county fair.  That is the type of material (I kid you not) that is on this DVD.  I only hope I can get rid of it on eBay so I don't have to look at it in my DVD collection 
 I found this woman to be a bit crazy.  One minute she's saying that you should never ever criticize someone's writing, next minute she's telling us which sample of writing is better than the other and which we should emulate.  She actually says that her students' writing was better than someone who's already been published, which was alright at first but after about 10 different examples of her bashing the published writer, I found her to be quite pompous. All writing is subjective, and I don't see what gives her the right to tell us which writing is BETTER than another, based on HER point of view.  I felt like I was being yanked around by a leash.  She also says we should just sit around being lazy and idle, and that it's a good thing.  I'm sorry, I just don't see it her way.  It's like a recipe for disaster.  Anyway, that's just my take on it.  Take from it what you will 
 I can't tell you what a great soporific this singer is.  No heart, no commitment, no real variation and shading.  A computer program that can "sing pretty" would do the same.  The Linda Eder of jazz. Next 
 I debated whether to give this book 1 or 2 stars. At first I was going to give it 2 stars as I thought LKH did a better job with this book than she did with the ABVH book Danse Macabre. I settled on 1 star after thinking about all of the things that bothered and/or disappointed me about this book.   My biggest problem were the scenes with Sholto. I hated what she did to him which I'm not going to say because I don't want to give anything away. However, to me it seemed like LKH was taking the easy way out. She took away any "specialness" and made it "ordinary". The scenes between Merry and Sholto could have been Merry and AnyGuy.   There were many other disappointments for me in this book. I'm not sure if the deficiencies of Mistral's Kiss were magnified for me as I had just finished reading a number of books (the latest from Kim Harrison, JR Ward and Lynsay Sands to start) which, IMO, were head and shoulders above anything coming from LKH lately. 
 Sometimes I've enjoyed books by David Baldacci (WISH YOU WELL and THE WINNER come to mind); others, such as THE LAST MAN STANDING did little for me . . . add SPLIT SECOND, which I just heard, to that latter list . . . it was a disappointing mystery thriller about two disgraced Secret Service agents who come together to solve two campaign-trail crimes . . . I cared little about any of the characters, and there were far too many subplots floating around for my taste . . . the ending also didn't do much for me, as it brought too many separate threads together in too quick a fashion . . . lastly, I did not particularly "buy" the man behind the crimes; he just wasn't  all that believable. 
 Ehrenreich is the kind of journalist I despise. One who thinks her insights are so important that it doesn't matter how much she inconveniences others to make her point. She constantly drones about how difficult it is to find housing on the wages blue color workers earn.  The market is to tight, that oftentimes one has to use a huge percentage of one's pay to stay in hotels while looking for apartments.  Does that stop Ehrenreich from competing for those coveted apartments?  Of course not.  She has to do her research, and she is the only reliable subject she can find to satisfy her curiousity.  If jobs and apartments are so hard to come by, then leave those jobs and digs for the people who so desparately need them.  There is nothing one learns from Ehrenreich's experiences that one couldn't have learned from professional interviews of blue color workers.  But that would have taken away Ehrenreich's righteous indignation.   Don't encourage this kind of writing.  See it for what it is. Gratuitous research that could have been easily conducted without firsthand experience.  And that while doing it, some very needy people were out of work and living in substandard housing conditions 
 This is a horrible failure of a book. It depends totally on its ending, and at the end, delivers nothing. It is the sort of book you throw at the wall.   It starts well. Fraught with potential, it captures your imagination,leads you along an interwoven tale full of incidents and detail. Little of substance happens, no characters develop, and no real story is built. But it carries you because it promises, again and again, that all that transpires is a part of the mystery that will be resolved at the end.   Surprise ! There is no resolution at the end. A character annouces that everything was made up (for reasons that make no sense). The tale descends into farce. There is a deluge, flooding, drowning. I could only think of the Poseidon Adventure. Everything is washed away except the bad taste left in your mouth.  The book does not offer enough to survive such a nonsensical ending. There are a score of books in this genre (Eco, Peares). Your time would be much better spent with one of those.  
 As opposed to many of the other reviewers we tried to use this process in a strategic marketing session with four teams in our company. THis was a frustrating and disappointing process!  First, the book is a trite misrepresentation of an ex post facto process that has been dismissed by professional researchers and analysts. You do NOT prove your theory by fitting the past into your "model of the future". They did NOT work with Southwest Airlines to make them successful. They looked for examples that fit their thesis and applied it to ones they knew were succssful. This is not academically honest nor is it a good way to predict the future. It is like using Neural Networks to make predictions - they are 100% accurate in predicting the past. Second, our team got to the point that we "believe" we found an underserved market area and we have three options and a full list of targeted areas for discussion. Now, how in the world can this book or anyone else on my team or in our company give me any insight into which one of these will be accepted by a prospect? This book promotes the worst form of pedantic navel gazing and raises self-reference to an absurd level. If we held the answer we would not need the strategic marketing exercise. Continuing this charade does us all a disservice. I worked with and managed product marketers for years in high tech companies who had companies like IBM and Intel as our customers. They did not do pencil whipping exercises. They went out and talked to prospects and asked them what they needed. This is not a novel approach but this Blue Ocean strategy seems to think that validation comes at the end after lots of silly charting and analysis.  This book will send you on a fools' errand. Buy it for your competition and hope that they follow it 
 Like so many others, this movie struck a raw nerve with me regarding the graphic detail that was enacted by then 12 year old Jena Malone.  Although the movie has a point to make about child abuse and sexual abuse, I, as the mother of a 13 year old, can not understand how another mother could stand by and watch her child being filmed in such graphic detail.  I could not watch the whole movie as the car scene was so disturbing I turned it off.  What is the difference between a child being molested, and a child actor who is sitting in the lap of a grown man?  Why are the laws different for Jena?  Yes, these types of movies have a point to make, but sacrificing the innocence of another child is not the way to do it 
 This book came highly recommended and got some great blurbs, but in my opinion is quite overrated. The writing isn't particularly good, and there really isn't much meat. There are actually no REAL descriptions of most of the action. For instance, we know she and her two pals hated turning to cannibalism, but that's all (compare/contrast to "Life of Pi" by Yann Martel, which if full of gory detail of being stranded at sea, but that's what makes it real!). By the way, when one starving animal eats another starving animal, they still starve to death, because of the lack of essential fatty acids. Most mainstream fiction editors appear to have little if any knowledge of science, unfortunately. I came away from this read with very little in the way of vicarious experience and only a few (repetitive) visual images. It reads like a pretentious but untalented teenager's diary 
 OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty.  They also have a burnt flavor.  You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order.  On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good.  This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags).  Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 I will never purchase another Neutrogena product, again.  There products are dangerous!!!  It burned my face.  My face is all red, swollen, red, irritated, and itchy.  My new best friend is Cortizone 10, the anti itch cream.  It's been a week since I stopped using Netrogena, and I still look horrifying!!!!  Perfect for Halloween, right?  But, Halloween is over, and I still look scary.  This product has aged me!!!  It has caused a ton of wrinkles from where the skin is puffy and swollen.  NEVER, AGAIN, NEUTROGENA!!! 
 I Love the Mag, but sister never recieved the order I gave her as a gift!!! 
 This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime.   There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead. 
 This film is an absolute piece of garbage, but according to the Academy, this was the finest film of 1951.  I would rather watch Strangers on a Train, A Streetcar Named Desire, The African Queen, A Place in the Sun--I'd rather watch myself drive off a cliff.  Gershwin may have rhythm.  Gene Kelly definitely has rhythm when he dances.  But whoever threw this film together had no sense of cinematic rhythm.  Here's a basic rule of thumb:  when you're making a narrative film, don't take leave of the story--especially at the end--for a 17 minute (no joke) dance number that is only nominally related to the plot.  I don't care how good you might think Gene Kelly danced and choreographed that number.  You know Kurosawa directed a hell of a fight scene at the end of Seven Samurai.  Why don't we throw that in this movie too?  Because it would be stupid and make the film uneven, right?  That's right.  And that's exactly what this 17 minute dance number does to An American in Paris.  An unfair comparison?  Okay let's take the Karate Kid.  It's the end of the movie.  Daniel-san is hurt bad.  But instead of having Mr. Miyagi do that voodoo hand slap and rub combo to fix Daniel-san's leg, Daniel just stares in thought.  We now understand what we are seeing is what he is thinking about.  And what do we see?  Seventeen minutes of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai battle sequence.  Then when that's done, we fade back to Daniel-san staring at  nothing.  He stands up and his leg is fine and the karate tournament is over and he's won the thing!  You would think that movie was pretty stupid right?  That's essentially how the 17 minute Gene Kelly dance sequence feels.  Seventeen minutes of talent, to be sure, but what the devil is it doing the middle of the film?  No wait not the middle.  It's at the end.  It's replaced the climax of the film--and doing a poor job of it I might add.  Then it ends, Gene Kelly's daydream is over, and everything is okay.  The end.  Lame.  And don't try to tell me that the dance sequence was the climax--that it resolves the film if you interpret the symbolic dancing right.  Whatever.  A film with such an amateurish plot hasn't earned the right to suddenly become cerebral.  An American in Paris is like our Karate Kid with Kurosawa tacked onto it--a cheesy average film with a chunk of talent thrown in the mix without much rhyme or reason--or rhythm.  Would our Karate Kid-Seven Samurai hybrid deserve the Oscar for best picture?  Neither did An American in Paris.  Just because it's got Gene Kelly and some Gershwin tunes doesn't make it a great, or even a good, film.  Remember, Mike Nichols made The Graduate and Birdcage 
 This book was extremely disappointing.  There is so little valuable and insightful information about the Tsarina, and what information there is is simply fluff.  This book barely skims the surface and leaves so much out, takes so little time to actually analyze information that it leaves more questions than it answers.  If you are looking for a quick read, or an introductory book to Tsarina Alexandra this is it.  Otherwise, I highly recommend "Nicholas and Alexandra" by Massie.  
 Well, you all know the basic premise by now: Arnold Strine can stop time, but instead of stealing loads of cash or exacting petty revenge of folks who've done him wrong (I'll admit it - that's what I'd do), Arnold likes to take women's clothes off and describe their nudity in exhaustive detail.   I read through a bunch of the reviews here, and it looks like the consensus is that "the Fermata" has a terrible premise but the prose is interesting. I'm actually the opposite: I think the premise is fantastic, but the story is boring.   What's brilliant about "the Fermata" is that every horny teenage boy has had this fantasy, but no other writer (to my knowledge) has been willing to dedicate 300 pages to this premise. Whenever I've seen characters halt time in TV, movies, etc. it's generally used for crime. I've always wondered why those characters don't go around taking people's clothes off, and what would happen if they did? Well, Nicholon Baker sure answered the latter question here.   The problem is that once you get over the outrageousnes of the premise, there isn't much to like here. Arnold Strine is an interesting character. He has an odd sense of morality that I found strangely endeering - not easy to do when you're basically talking about a rapist. The book is also well-written and descriptive - sometimes to a fault. There are only so many ways that a writer can describe a muff without losing my patience...  The bigger problem is that there's really no plot. None. This truly is 300 pages of Arnold stopping time, removing ladies' clothing, and then talking about it in exhaustive detail. Baker's verbal wordplay and overactive imagination get a few laughs, but ultimately "the Fermata" is a well-written but seriously overlong character sketch that wears out its welcome before the halfway point. 
 Hyatt has canned another ham for his pantry. The Iraqi Information Minister is more credible. Unfortunately associating yourself with 'Cool' people isn't enough to convince people you are likewise 'Cool.' Ignorance is luminous. So remember, if you hear a quiet 'Aye' in the dark side of your mind, it might not be the Fonz. It could be this guy trying to sell you another sad book 
 The picture on the advertisement for these earmuffs is a different product than that supplied.  If the postage cost less I would probably return them.  The picture shows a fluffy set of earmuffs with a large, thick strap that is surrounded with leather or sheepskin.  The product mailed to me is a generic set of earmuffs with a cheap-looking, coiled plastic band connecting the earmuffs.  Given this misrepresentation, the price is too high and the advertisement is very deceptive 
 This book is full of excuses and manipulated data that ignores the ultimate moral responsibility of a society.  We can correlate joblessness with the number of innercity households that contain black ink pens if we want to.  While Wilson presents an argument in an attempt to educate, his words are slanted in such a way that we are left feeling "sorry for them" 
 This started to fail with the first few games on Christmas morning.  By "fail," I mean, cards wouldn't shoot out, and would instead be audibly heard slipping.  We tried using rubbing alcohol, and that would literally only work for a throw of cards or two.  This is a GREAT concept for a game, but it's leaving a lot to be desired in craftsmanship 
 Not very scary, too long, and poor character development.  There are a lot of good reviews about the book.  Maybe I missed something 
 This book tells some very interesting stories about the crazy life of being in such a popular band and all the usuals that go along with it: groupies, drugs, etc.  The thing that annoyed me about this book is Marilyn Manson's belief that society somehow molded him into becoming the person that he is or that he is a product of extreme circumstances (he references always being reminded that he was different).  While his childhood was definitely not what most people think of as normal, I got the impression that he is who he is by personal choice and nothing else.  This does give a sense of empowerment in the way that it says to people, you can be as different as you want to be without having to have an excuse for it.  However, this isn't the message this book tries to deliver; this book claims that it's not about choice it's about cause and effect (at least in my opinion).  So if you're just looking for an entertaining look into a different world, then this book will deliver.  But if you're looking for some insight into the human personality that some of the other reviewers seem to think is here, keep looking 
 The first Dead Can Dance song I heard was "Towards the Within", which absolutely mesmerized me. So when I got Spleen and Ideal for Christmas last year, I was thrilled (having previously gotten Aion from the library and enoying that)...until I put it into my CD player. This is so different from the DCD music I enjoy. Personally, I can't get enough of Lisa Gerrad's soaring glossolalia, but this CD mostly contained depressing drones in Brendan Perry's depressing, unemotional voice. It either puts m to sleep or gives me a headache. I highly recommend Spiritchaser (my favourite to date) or Into the Labyrinth 
 I bow to my colleagues who have observed Manchester's acquired taste for the MacArthurian mystique and the apparent failures of historians (not just Willam M.) on getting it right regarding The General's ego and its fallout in combat. Yes this stuff is significant, but all this overlooks one outstanding reality, that Manchester includes but does give the proper emphasis: Doug MacArthur wanted to be president, very, very badly.  He truly saw himself as a caesar-like figure in history and positioned himself in returning to the Philipines, administering post-war Japan, and taking the baton in Korea (at the age of 70) for a return to the US in "triumph."  Instead he bowed out after being fired by Truman, who had nothing to lose by relieving him. This book is an enormous achievement, necessary for a student of modern history, but Manchester misses a golden opportunity to build a dramatic effect when giving the account of the final years of MacArthur's public life by passing over these events and not leaning on their true meaning 
 This book is nothing more than a marketing tool for the author to get you to buy more of his books, seminars and products.  Each chapter gives a taste of a marketing concept and then ends the chapter with a website to go to for more information. Of course these websites want you to purchase the information in the form of more books, newsletters, seminars, etc. I also purchased 2 other marketing books at the time I bought this one, "How To Become A Marketing Superstar" by Jeffrey J. Fox and "Your Marketing Sucks" by Mark Stevens.  Both offered complete, sound marketing concepts that I've already put to use and are showing results. And best of all...they didnt' try to sell me anything 
 The charming 1977 musical is not the subject of this note.  The show is great and the liner notes are superb. However, consumers should note that there is a critical flaw in the mastering (at least on the disc version that I obtained). It is very unfortunate that the manufacturers did not pull this mis-mastered version from the market. As noted elsewhere (and absolutely correct), an entire track of sound is lost and can only be heard distantly in the background.   If the problem is corrected and later discs are OK, it just compounds the problem with no way to know if you have a flawed disc or an OK disc. A most unfortunate problem for what should be a joyous recording 
 I brought this tea thinking it was a great deal. Then while steeping my tea I noticed something in the bag. At first I thought it was a rock, but it looked like a garden snail. I cut the bag open and it was a garden snail! YUCK! I checked several bags and approx 50% of them had snails in them.  This is the worst tea experience I've had 
 Just purchased this toaster and it is being sent back.  Even on maximum setting, it hardly toasts.  We tried different breads, different settings and it just doesn't work right.  We even tried toasting (on maximum) one lot of bread (not good) and followed it by another lot of bread (better, but not adequate)on the theory that it was warmed up after the first lot of bread.  Forget it.  On the up side, the toaster looks good.  But for $80 it should toast better than my old $9.99 Black and Decker!! 
 My husband and I purchased this set with my first son, but are going to choose another bottle manufacturer for our second son.  The difficultly we experienced was securing the nipple ring onto the base - it had to be in perfect alignment or there were definately leaks, sometimes more than that.  It is quite frustrating when you are conducting late night feedings or traveling.  I hope a new second chose will brings easier bottle feedings 
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 This book is a perfect example of an OK idea presented in a bad medium.    Had the author chosen to make this a web site or a magazine article, I don't think anyone would object to the rudimentary information provided within.  Instead, the author presents 100 "hacks" comprised entirely of overviews on quickly-dating shareware and freeware downloads, as well as step by step instructions on how to use the intrinsic Windows dialogs to change properties and settings.  Little presented here could not be as easily discovered by Googling "Windows XP tips tricks",  browsing popular computer magazines, or using the internal Help 
 If you've got a subscribtion to any teenage magazine out there, have friends or watch TV, you've probably know all "tips" this book offered. All of it is very common knowledge. Drink 8 glasses of water a day? Check. Set concealor with powder? Check. Line lips with lipliner to make lipstick last longer? Check. However, its good for those who aren't feeling great about their look. It's got that "You're GREAT the way you are!" vibe. For the rest of us teens who want to know actual makeup advice such as how to do smokey eyes or even contouring, look elsewhere. If you're curious, check this out of the library like I did 
 Don't buy this at all!  I bought this to use on my media center.  All that happens when I plug it in is black and white lines across the screen.  I've tried restarting and everything.  I'll try for a refund 
 Mr. Auster's Trilogy is strong in stylistic innovation but sadly lacking in imagination. His themes, plots and characters reveal a writer with a broad exposure to European literature, but the sum total of the work feels repetitive, impoverished and too smart for his own good. I lost patience for his empty characters devoid of specificity. At times, it seemed like endless, nonproductive navel gazing on the life of being an artist/sleuth. It reminds me of a much weak version of Martin Amis' Times Arrow, which I rather liked, for all its flaws. 
 What a slog it is trying to get through this book. I'm nearly there (I've read 3 or 4 other books since starting this)... the reason for my stubbornness in finishing it is that it came so highly recommended by friends, and the mostly rave reviews it's got here. Ignatius Reilly, the main character is interesting enough (that's why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star) but that has a lot to do with the fact that the rest of the cast and plot is so boring, I find myself flicking on the pages to see how far I have to go before the story gets back to Ignatius again. I keep thinking "OK, the side splitting stuff must be coming up soon"...there are humourous passages here and there but nothing to merit the accolades it has received here nor winning the Pulitzer Prize. I'm at a loss to explain its popularity 
 I used to think of regressions as harmless pursuits, but have since learned that "memories" created by the mind are virtually indistinquishable from real memories and that people who seek to create them tend to believe them, even when those memories later turn out to be demonstrably false.  In his opening paragraph, Andrews notes: "We many never be able to prove that we lived before. Even if we are able to produce names, dates and places, it still does not proved that we lived at that time and place."   So why the book?  "Because, even without conclusive proof, the benefits for personal empowerment, healing and enlightenment are tremendous."  The "theology" of reincarnation comes from unsure sources, one of which is the primitive African Zulus. As explained in this book the souls of people depart and go to sleep until notified that another learning experience awaits it. Then it returns as a human or as an animal.   My own personal view is that man should seek God for spiritual knowledge. Once one begins trusting in "suggestions" of unsure memories, the foundation becomes more than a little shakey. Three different people claiming to be the same historical figure is something that should cause anyone to reexamine this belief in past lives, and this is something that's not difficult to find. False memories seem real but aren't. That's why books like this don't sound dangerous, but are.    
 i've read this book completely a couple of times. and i reject the idea of the only way of geting chicks is to get chicks is a lie. I feel that john alexander  has the right to publish a book on his views of women and dating but him assuming him self to the authority on women is a lie. Like comment about treating a women like a friend on date getting you laid. If you treat a women like a friend on a first date and spend as little money as possible  she gonna put you in the friend zone. In chapter about gromming, I found the comment where j alexander said its ok to shave your balls and armpits but not your legs weird. its fine if john a. wants have hiary legs but to say that guys shaving or waxing their legs is gay is  dumb. Its 2006 and pro athletes do it and a lot of other guys because its a nice grooming look. leg hair isnt even mascaline since both  men and women can grow it unlike facial hair and chest hair. i was foolish enough to shave my balls later realizing it look weird. and the thing is  ball and and armpit hair take a lot longer to grow then leg hair so i dont recomend that you do this guys even if J alexander says so. Overall i recommend how to suceed with women by ron louis aover this book.      
 If you read this expecting the humor and fast pace of a Stephanie Plum novel, you'll be disappointed.  It doesn't seem like JE did any more than wave a magic wand over these books 
 I was really looking forward to getting this tool and saving some time.  It sorely disappointed me.  It was very hard to adjust to the right depth of cut, and instead of using a razor to cut the paper, it uses a pair of  very cheap star wheels to perforate. Even when finally set to the right  depth of cut, the wheels wobbled all over the place, leaving a wavy cut.   It seems like a good idea, but I guess I'll have to make my own to get it  to work right 
 if you are into dancing, clubs, partying, etc this album is for you if you are into old school r and b this is not for you because these lyrics and tunes have been played before in different variations so its kind of old this is for the new generation who has never heard the old songs 
 Like many others, I began reading this book with a view toward learning more about the Mormon history and their religious claims. As a psychologist, I tend to examine works I read somewhat different than the average reader.  I find it interesting, especially when reading reviews of this type of work, how varied the reviewer's comments are.  I'm sure mine may not be totally objective either but I'll give it a try.  I first try to understand the author's interest in the subject.  By doing this, it becomes easier to identify objectivity or the lack there of.  Next, I generally examine the context of the resource material from which the author presents the information.  Was it disclosed in context or was it presented in such a way that may distort the meaning from when the resource was originally published.  Finally, I read with an eye toward rationality.  By this I mean that when I read something that is presented toward making a point, I look at the original reference material as a source document and apply the first two principles.  The idea is to see if the contemporary author is consistent in disclosure and intent to the source documents.   Unfortunately, as is the case with many "religious historical works" ONUG is a thinly veiled attempt to discredit rather than to inform.  There is some good lesser-known reference material in this book.  From that perspective it was somewhat interesting but the out of context presentation of information and the obvious effort to cast dispersion is wearing on the reader looking for an objective presentation.    If you are looking for material to throw at the Mormons, you may find some here, if you are looking for an honest, objective presentation of historical information look elsewhere.  This is not an effort, as it claims, to help one understand the real history of the church.  There are many other reviews with some great objective authors and works recommendations so I will not reduplicate the list here. Just note please, this is not one of them.    I gave ONUG two stars rather than one only because of some of the reference material.  It is reasonably good.  Unfortunately, it is presented with a negative purpose rather than from a perspective of historical and contextual accuracy.  This one took a lot of reading source material to really come to an understanding of the true context of the historical material being presented.  Not what one wants to do when reading a  "historical portrayal".  It is easy to create an impression. Likewise, it is equally easy to accept an impression.  When we are willing, we often find what we are looking for when we read a book.  If we are in agreement with an authors ideas, weather we are knowledgeable or not, we tend to lend support and credibility to the author.  It does not make the work any more accurate.  The converse is also true.  In this case, those who will cast dispersions on the Mormon faith will fuel there desire, unfortunately, those who wish to learn from and understand a historical and objective presentation will be at best left wanting, and at worst be misguided by this poorly veiled attempt to cast a negative cloud over a most interesting and important part of American history.  
 Note: If you don't want to know how the movie ends, don't read this. (I'm giving you fair warning now, so don't complain about spoilers later). The only reason I'm mentioning the ending and the "big secret" is because I'd like to spare you from the huge disappointment I experienced when watching this movie.                        When I first walked into the theatre to see this, I couldn't have been more excited; after months of waiting, I'd finally get to see the movie whose preview had given me chills every time I saw it! The movie started out wonderfully: great acting, scenery that could go from gorgeous to terrifying in a matter of seconds, and, at times, almost unbearable suspense (that Shyamalan really knows how to scare!)The story takes place in a small town in the 1800's. At first this town seems like the perfect place to live: the people are friendly, the houses are cozy, and the scenery is beautiful. Despite the peaceful setting, however, we get the feeling that something sinister lies beneath the surface of this sweet little community, something that frightens the villagers and keeps them from  being completely at ease. Every now and then, they glance fearfully at the forest surrounding the village; nobody ever ventures into it, and a guard is stationed every night to watch over it. Pretty soon, we find out why: according to the village elders, there are dangerous, hostile creatures lurking in the woods that will kill anyone who dares enter their domain. These creatures are supposedly unidentified monsters who are so bloodthirsty that the color red is forbidden in the village (it attracts them). For years, the villagers and the monsters have had an understanding: as long as the villagers stay out of the forest, the monsters will not harm them. At one point,however, one of the creatures enters the village at night, leaving the villagers to believe that their uneasy truce may soon come to an end and more of the creatures will attack. While all this is happening, we (the audience) still don't know what the creatures look like and half the suspense comes from wondering what they really are. It was halfway through the movie when all my hopes for the story came crashing to an end: There are NO MONSTERS IN THE WOODS.  When one of the villagers revealed a monster costume and said the shocking words "It's all a farce", I still couldn't believe what I was hearing; it was all I could do to keep myself from screaming right there in the theatre! After months of anticipating this film, of expecting a truly scary thriller, and of trying to guess what the monsters really are, THERE ARE NO MONSTERS! Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe it. It got worse, though. The next big surprise was the reason the villagers created the story of the "monsters". The villagers aren't really living in the 1840's; they're living in a modern-day wildlife reserve. Supposedly, the leaders of the village used to live like normal modern people, but when tragedy struck their families, they decided the real world was too much for them and moved into a wildlife reserve to start a new (if extremely delusional) life. The story of the monsters in the forest was created to terrify their children and keep them from wandering too far and discovering the truth. They even had the village retard dress in a costume and wander around occasionally to scare the other children and make them believe the monsters were real! When the retarded boy died in the woods (still wearing the stupid costume), the leaders, rather than mourning him, remorselessly saw it as another opportunity to lie to their children by telling them he was killed by one of the creatures. I basically went from sympathizing with the characters to being repulsed by them. What parents could lie to their children and deliberately terrify them like that? I don't think I've ever been this disappointed in a movie before; not only was it completely misleading, but the plot was pitiful and the adult characters were pathetic (I'm sorry, but I have no other word for people who are perfectly happy to live a lie and deliberately frighten and traumatize their children to continue living it). Many fans of this movie have said that those of us who didn't like it "don't get it". I assure you, I did get it, and I didn't like it anyway. I'm no fan of slasher films and I didn't expect this to be one, but I also don't appreciate false advertising or almost totally unsympathetic characters. The two stars are for the cast and the filming. Better luck next time, guys 
 this is a wonderful value. full of fact filled fun. my 10 yr old grandson has every year. he waits until christmas when he knows he will get the new one. he compares it to the other records from years back. this is a wonderful gift for anyone and is great when also bought with the ripley series. it is fasinating what records people accomplish. c 
 I think that 1976's "The Enforcer" is where the Dirty Harry series quit trying to be about something.  Part one was about how inadequate the law can be in some extream cases.  Part two was about the police vigilantes.  But this is not really about anything.  The story is about extream radicals who are terrorizing the San Francisco area, not for any lofty ideals, but for money.  Clint Eastwood was by this time a major action star, and all of a sudden it was not impotant for him to be in a good movie, just in a profitable one.  And it really shows.  The acting is wooden, the camera work is nothing special, just point and shoot.  If there was any good sequences it was the last showdown in Alcatraz Island; that was fast paced and exciting.  All though Eastwood was going through the motions, his new partner was really good.  Tyne Daily plays Callahan's most resiliant and memorable partner.  She is a good cop, just promoted past her abilities.  If given time, she could have been a good police officer.  All in all this was pretty poor entry, the weakest of the series 
 Being a huge fan of Golden Age mystery fiction and also an admirer of Gypsy Rose Lee, I was very eager to read this book.  I also have the film "Lady of Burlesque" with Barbara Stanwyck, which follows the book fairly closely and which I thorougly enjoy.  However, although Gypsy Rose Lee "stars" in the story which involves murders among the striptease acts in an Opera House, the writing is rather uninvolving and I who read voraciously had trouble staying interested.  I also confess to being rather annoyed at the petty squabbling between the women which fails to capture the friendships that also develop between women.  In fact, the characterizations remain on an extremely superficial level and the few colorful instances (almost "pre-code" sort of moments) do not rescue the story or make it any more compelling.  I found myself bored and wanting to read something else.  It's a pity, because I truly did want to like it and the premise was promising.  My conclusion:  Gypsy Rose Lee was a very beautiful woman and I imagine a powerful and provocative performer with some class to boot, but she is not a great writer by any stretch of the imagination.  Being a great performer or leading a colorful life does not necessarily mean that you can write; writing is a whole other art form and too many people think it requires no particular skill since one is not required to do eye-high kicks or hit high notes.  They're absolutely wrong, as misfires such as this demonstrate (although I've read far worse).    A disappointment, but may fill the bill for someone looking for a light read.  To use an apt cliche:  mediocre fare.  
 I never quit reading books. I could see how this story would be confusing and hard to understand. I was able to keep up with the reading and understand it, but it was just plain boring. This book I just wasn't into. I didn't look foward to reading it. So I didn't finish it. Morrison jumped around to much.. once I started getting familiar with characters, she would switch it up. I don't know how it ever ended, but I wasn't patient with the book to find out 
 English is obviously not the native language of Mr.Goswami.  There is no flow to his writings.  He also has a knack of making simple concepts seem complicated.  Although there is good content and direction in his book, the considerable energy needed to complete it, may make it not worth the effort.  This book is best suited for a retired person with unending time and patience, and a knack for converting Sanskrit into English 
 I really liked her "Nickel and dimed" book, enough so that I bought this one just on the strength of it. I'm sorry to say I was disappointed.  Most of the book is not really about working in corporate America, or being laid off, or even about job-seraching. Most of the book is about *preparing* to job search - and going about it pretty badly.  More than 50% of the book relates the author's experience with a series of Carreer coaches, resume polishers, etc.  who were selected seemingly at random, and who run the gamut from out-and-out charlatans to useless incompetents with no discernible qualifications. What's more, this is typically clear immediately, but the author sticks with them for a long time - and tells us in details about it.  Another point is that she is looking for most of the book for a Director or even VP level job, while her resume has basically zero previous same-type jobs. Her resume DOES show she has the subject-matter skill (as a consultant), but these are Management/executive positions. To get one, you have to have relevant experience in running a similar but smaller team, doing a similar job in a smaller organization, or at least working in such a team and showing you deserve a promotion. So, from the start the author has made the chance of getting a job, or even an interview, very small, by seeming to be very basically not qualified, regradless of subject-matter experience.   Another large piece of the book, and a constant theme is that job searching is mostly a matter of "networking". This is implemented mostly in the form of meeting other unemployed people, who also are either going to the same (useless) carreer coaches/resume rewriters etc. In rare instances, "networking" is taken to be brief meetings with total strangers and being able to get them to take your card, or your resume, and maybe hear your 30-second self-description (The "elevator pitch").  Common sense shows this is a waste of time. "networking" can get you a job opening when a person knows you enough to recommend you to an opening he knows about. But a stranger? why would he recommend you, and what will  the recommendation be like? "Here's the card of someone I have met yesterday for 5 minutes. I know nothing about her, but she says she is good. I think we should make her our next VP" - Come on.  yes, in many corporations the best candidate is brought in by personal recommendation of an insider. This assume the "insider" knows the candidate enough to recommend them, and that the insider has enough standing in the organization for the recommendation to be an advantage.  So - by all means networking is good - but only with people who already know you, and are in some position of influence. Meeting total strangers, espcially ones also unemployed, and even more especially ones who pay the obvious charlatans for Career/job-search advice is probabaly not going to cut it.   I respect the author's intelligence enough to assume she knows this, or realized it after a short while - so why go on, and on, and on, doing it and describing it?  Finally, when she does get to send her resume and even talk (during job-fairs) to corporate people, the approach she describes is to figure out something the company is doing wrong (in her opinion), tell the recruiter about it, and claim she can help. For one thing, the people she is meting are HR recruiters, and usualy junior ones. They are not in a position to hire company-fixing-level people, even if they agreed the company needs fixing. They have a specific job with some job-description,and are looking to find someone who can do THAT, and preferably one with demonstratable experience in doing the same exact thing in a very similar setting very recently. Everything out of this track is noise - and rightly so.   But more seriously, I am amazed this sounds reasonable to the author, or indeed to anyone. let's see: if I walked up to the author during some book signing tour, handed her my card ("networking, networking"), cited the review elswhere on this page that faults her writing style and told her I can help her fix that, if she just hires me, whow likely am I to get a job?   I'd rate the book lower, but the last two chapters are good in my opinion. Worth the read - but wait for the paperback, by a used one, or go to the library. 
 AFTER SEEING HOW ENTERTAINING THE ORIGINAL ''SHAFT'' WAS, I WAS DISSAPOINTED BY THIS SEQUEL. THIS TIME, SHAFT INVESTIGATES THE MURDER OF AN OLD FRIEND. SOMETHING THAT MADE THE FIRST FILM SO ENJOYABLE IS SIMPLY JUST MISSING FROM THIS ONE. THIS FILM IS MEDIOCRE AT TIMES, BUT THANKS TO RICHARD ROUNDTREE'S LIKABLE PERFORMANCE, AND THANKS TO THE EXPLOSIVE FINAL HALF HOUR, THIS FILM IS WATCHABLE. ONCE AGAIN, THE THEME SONG IS A HIGHLIGHT. FOLLOWED BY SHAFT IN AFRICA 
 I don't think Mountain's studio work ever approached their live performances. This just sounds thin, with the high point being Pappalardi's vocals in the title track. Leslie West plays much better on Leslie West Live. His guitar is the real star of this show, and his vocals get better all the time. This album doesn't capture the overwhelming sound the big guy generated. It seems like he was trying to be just another member of the band, and that's a waste. For a great kick, check out his acoustic versions of The Animals and Bob Dylan on You Tube. Mountain was just his warm-up act. He's better not than he was then 
 Let me save you some money right now.  You can access the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance for Free at  http://12.46.245.173/cfda/cfda.html  This listing is a lot more up-to-date, and the full version is nearly 2000 pages long.  Gee, I guess the government has enough "free money" to publish its own book 
 I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world 
 I found this more confusing than helpful. It had me looking for screens that did not exist and it jumped around a lot. I finally put the book down and figured it out myself using the XP wizard and help screens. I feel like I wasted my money on this book 
 This must be a joke. Writing yet another book on creativity that is simply a rehash of the original book with a slightly different twist. Not an example of creative thinking in my estimation. Don't waste your money 
 While I jumped into the character sporadically (I think this is the second one I read with him as the main character) it flowed fast and his smart remarks I always find humorous.  While the plot is quite weak and I actually guessed part of it, it was a fun read.  It went quick and should have built more into the red herring that the cover leads you to believe.  Even the school principal lacked some Ooommmph if you know what I mean.  The grandmother was a good role, but the parents coud have been much more important.  So overall, let's call it a quick read, funny and enjoyable, but not one of his best.  I picked it up at the airport and read it on the very same trip.  Not one I would keep, so back it went with the 50% return offer the airport here has 
 I was notified that a new book was avalible, so like with all the other books, I preordered this. Imagine my disapointment when I opened it and it was a BLANK JOURNAL!  I was sorry to pay so much for this. I thought it would have more info on each book. I was not expecting a blank journal to write my own thoughts in, and was upset that was not in the review that it was nothing more then a blank journal. Dissapointed. Wanted more from the book then what it actually was. will be returning it. 
 To describe Three Kings as absurdly comic is to describe a war as such.  This film is filled with an excess of gratuitous violence and unnatural foul language.  While greed & cruelty may be rampant in the region, Three Kings is simply absurd.  At best, it is nerve wracking entertainment and does (handsome) George Clooney's reputation no favors whatsoever.  Any Indiana Jones episode would run circles around this thin and preposterous plot.  I would rate this "B" movie a miss on all fronts 
 If you're like me, you got into Boo Radleys during the shoegazer era.  I loved the discs preceding Wake Up!, especially Giant Steps.  This is as far away from shoegazer as you can get.  The first reviewer here is right on as now Carr is totally doing the Beach Boys sunny harmony thing.  Sorry, no my thing.  They could have evolved more like Catherine Wheel whom I recommend highly.  Also try Ride (of course) and Slowdive 
 How can you publish a book about movie flubs and include so few photos? "Roman soldiers" would have been a lot more fun if instead of telling us about the supposed mistakes in films, it showed us. If ever there was a need for a companion DVD, this book was it.  Aside from a few really interesting flubs, the book is actually quite repetitious. Scars and bloodstains appear and disappear or switch places. Bodies appear and disappear. But after a few dozen pages of this, I had had enough. I would have like to have heard from the film editors who use various techniques -- like film reversal -- that give rise to these flubs. It's not enough, for instance, to tell me that in a particular shot in the movie, "The Birds," that the attacking creatures cast no shadows. Why not? Were they included via double exposure? The book does not say.  Too, a number of the book's items were not flubs. In a James Bond film, a house appears to explode twice. Is this a flub, or a movie technique to allow the audience to experience the same event from multiple angles? And is it really a flub when a couple seems to switch sides while walking down the street -- or are we to assume that we are not witnessing every second of their perambulation? And is it a flub when a filmmaker deliberately includes material that he/she expects the moviegoer not to perceive?  That said, there were a few flubs that rose to the level of worthwhile -- the Invisible Man's footprints should have been barefoot, not shod. The book did include a few descriptions of near-flubs, in which directors repaired errors before they hit the theaters. The story of how Cecil B DeMille managed to have Jesus write in the sand while standing in a tiled Temple was ingenious and interesting. More stories along thse lines would have made the book worthwhile.  As a whole, the book was a disappointment and a bore. The flubs were mostly small and of interest only to the geekiest cineaste. A missed opportunity to expose the film-making process 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 Pro's  It's really roomy.... ample room for my old brick of a computer Dell 15" inspiron 6800 and my tiny HP NC6230.  Good sized for overnight.  Con's  No compression straps when you have a smaller load to carry. I ended up ripping the nylon on the bag accidently as it got hooked on the side of a gym locker.  not as good as ripstop nylon. The zipper "teeths" aren't secure/strong enough... the bag would separate at the zippers numerous times.  Eventually, the zippers all broke loose in one night, even the separate zipper for the laptop.    
 Well, I should have known.  I guess I'm always looking for magic, always looking for the new thing - so I bought this book, and there is no magic, no real new thing. I've never been less engaged by a diet book.  There wasn't even inspiration here! Now I have to wonder if the reviews previously submitted were written by people known by one of the authors, and were submitted to try to give the book a boost out of friendship, or family loyalty, or whatever.    
 After only 2 months this toy fell apart. My daughter loves the toys on it but the turtle fell off and a metal screw was popping out and the snail's threads came out and the stuffing our of the side started to come out of the seams. $20 is not cheap for this toy and I think the quality should have been alot better 
 I loved "A Walk in the Woods" and "In a Sunburned Country".  They were funny and witty, and made me want to hike the Trail and visit Australia.  I am about to travel to Great Britain, so I read this book with much anticipation.  I found it ill-spirited and mostly humorless.  I started skimming as it was so repetitive that any chapter could have been about any town he visited.  It almost made me NOT want to go to Great Britain.  I don't understand the reviews that say he talks fondly of England.  In my opinion, he bad-mouthed almost everything, and came out looking like an often foul-mouthed old curmudgeon.  If you're still interested in this book, check it out of a library and decide for yourself.  I'm sorry I spent any time on it, but glad I didn't waste any money. I gave it 2 stars to be charitable 
 Yuck! After the first chapter of non-stop cliches and stereotypes I stopped to check Stormie's credentials. There are none, unless selling lots of books makes your books great. If you believe that logic, keep eating the healthy food at your favorite fast food joint. With the high rate of divorce in this country, advice from an amateur is not welcome.   Stormie's use of the Bible as a reference is also disturbing. I have found that no matter how crazy a person's idea, they can always find a verse out of context to support it. In this case, Stormie had to search several different Bibles.   The use of the Old Testament is questionable. There is some very bad advice there. For example, what should you do if your daughter comes home pregnant? The Old Testament might suprise you.  I don't doubt the power of prayer. I believe there are two fundamental parts that Stormie missed. One - you have to tell the person you are praying for. Studies in hospitals show repeatedly that patients oblivious to the prayers don't get better. Two - you have to work like hell for the things you want while you wait for God to give them to you.   Stormie claims that God talks to her. Boy is that a red flag! I guess we can all throw away our bibles and sing kum-bye-yah in a circle around her house, for she is the voice God.  I would end with a summary, but just like Stormie's book, you don't get one.  
 I rented this movie from Netflix recently, expecting a wonderfully campy, cheesy horror film. WRONG. Its just an hour and a half of boring film.  The plot is lacking, the characters are annoying, especially Duane.  Its simply a ridiculous film 
 First of all, this is not really a book about fraud in science. The analysis of specific cases of scientific fraud is thin and focused mostly on procedural matters; actual science behind each case is almost completely missing from Judson's analysis. His analysis of fraud as a phenomenon is even more superficial. For all the 400-plus pages of pomp, he fails to look at the obvious: what drives scientists to work in science? A quick look at a randomly selected group of postgraduate students would have revealed that there is a very broad distribution of reasons, ranging from the very global (desire to better understand the surrounding reality) to practical (making a living), to idiosyncratic personal reasons (e.g., looking smart in the eyes of the opposite sex). Where there is a distribution of motivations, there will be a distribution of rules by which people play - including some people bending the rules unacceptably far. Sociology of science is probably as complex as of the society at large; and as in any complex group, fraud is unavoidable.   Which brings us to the second point. Judson's real reason for writing this book seems to be the critique of the ways by which science is funded and by which scientific publishing works. He uses the existence of fraud to attack the existing system of scientific publishing (formal, peer-reviewed, commercially run journals) and claims that a transition to an arXiv-style system will all but eliminate scientific fraud. Unfortunately, his arguments are thouroughly unconvincing. The way scientific results are reported and published may well have a second-order effect on the incidence of fraud, but it is hardly the determining factor of the latter. Risk-vs-benefit factors - what one has to gain by publishing high-profile papers - seems to have much more to do with the occurence of fraud. Because the scientific establishment is not a uniform, Mertonian-type system, there will always be cheaters. The only reason they have not used arXiv so far is that currently one has nothing to gain by submitting a fraudulent publication there. This would change as soon as arXiv became the primary mode of scientific publishing.   Judson's recipe seems to be based on an over-simplified, neo-positivist philosophy of science, with its inherent assumption that scientific community is an ideal, uniform collection of people without agendas, personal ambitions, or theories to prove - what one might call an "ideal-gas approximation" of the scientific community. This might be to a limited degree applicable to biomedical research, which consists largely of data mining, but it completely breaks down in natural sciences. His arguments for open publishing are thus largely ideologically driven, and in his push for the desired conclusion he contradicts both the logic and himself. Of known cases of fraud, how many were caught by people scrutinizing someone else's published papers? Perhaps 10%? Most were discovered by chance - by a postdoc digging up old lab books; a technician noticing dodgy practises; by historians going through old raw data; by an author accidentally coming across an article identical to his own. This seems to be Judson's conclusion as well. Why does he think that community-scrutinized arXiv publishing would be more self-correcting than peer-reviewed traditional publishing? Both logic and experience suggest otherwise. Peer review may be costly, awkward, and inefficient, but it does keep junk science in journals with impact factors <1 - which noone reads. Without it, scientific publishing will quickly become awash with self-posted garbage (for a proof, look at the percentage of garbage on the Internet - it's hardly lower than in published journals!) Judson evades this obvious fact by saying that even garbage papers eventually get published in peer-reviewed journals, conveniently omitting that in most cases they get published in journals which have no impact.   To be sure, the book does contain a few fresh ideas. The first couple of chapters provide a good discourse in the philosophy of science. Some ideas regarding ArXiv are also quite nice, as long as they are not presented as some magic bullet which will miraculously eliminate scientific fraud. But were these worth reading through 400 pages of naive populism written by someone who, by own admission, has never been a practising scientist? I'd say no. 
    Well first off, I did not like the book nor the movie, both have enough plot holes to make a swiss cheese look like art.     On the other hand, I take excption to some of the neagtive reviews listed here, as some sound very anti-american in their reviews.  We being good Americans are intelligent enough to read good books and tell what stories make good patriotism and what does not.   We do not have to justify this to anyone who lives outside of the American experience for that.  If you do not understand this, TNEN BE QUIET ABOUT THINGS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND 
 From its misleading title--this volume is rather slender given its claim for being "complete"--to its lack of bibliographic notes and historical and factual unreliability, Ashley's tome is an utter mess. Poorly written and organized, with only a three-page index, this is a book that cannot be taken seriously. "Devils and Demons," in fact, seems like a haphazard collection of the author's notes on interesting trivia he happened to bounce  on, without bothering to reexamine his sources or concern himself with the formalities of English grammar. For example, in his brief discussion of C.S. Lewis's "Screwtape Letters," Ashley describes Lewis's book as "a delightful collection of business communications between a minor devil called Screwtape and his boss," evidently forgetting that Screwtape was a "major" devil corresponding to his underling nephew, Wormwood, as anyone even slightly familiar with the literature of fictional demonology knows. Such sloppy errors that are sprinkled through Ashley's work brings the subject down to the level of tabloid journalism, and with the same level of reliability. The reader would best be served by searching for other, more scholarly books which are abundant in this peculiar area of study, such as the "Compendium Maleficarum" or Robbins' "Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology." But "The Complete Book of Devils and Demons" is a complete waste of dead trees 
 This book goes on my list of the worst books I have ever read.  It took me 3 tries and a five days to get through the introduction. I had to read it for my Ap US History class, and sure, it was very educational. (I have a test on it tomorrow, so let's see how much I retained) It just took FOREVER!  I spend 7 days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful Smokey Mountains. Those 5 days it took me to read the intro are not included. I read all day every day and it bored me to death.  I constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those 7 days.  I liked the last chapter... because it was the last. 
 "I have received your new book against the human race, and thank you for it. Never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid. One longs, in reading your book, to walk on all fours. But as I have lost that habit for more than sixty years, I feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it. Nor can I embark in search of the savages of Canada, because the maladies to which I am condemned render a European surgeon necessary to me; because war is going on in those regions; and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves." Voltaire (1755 
 My 7 year old saw the ads for DigiDraw and drove me absolutely crazy until Christmas rolled around last year. The look of excitement and happiness on his face as he unwrapped this toy was short-lived. It was nearly impossible to assemble. The time and patience it required to 'trace' just a straight line was too much for an adult let alone a 7 year old. The only useable item from this entire toy were the colored pencils 
 The guys have nice voices and the ladies will love their squeaky good looks. But don't take them seriously. They are a money machine 
 i have read 5 graham greene books and this is by far the lamest of them. this was conceived of first as a hollywood movie, and it shows. the book is not much more that a silly, corny thriller (just what hollywood orders over and over and over). there is very little character development involved, & the the sense of place (vienna after world war ii) could have been given much greater depth, as well. this is simply a plot being rushed onto the big screen ( a half-baked, lame plot, at that) to make some cash. pass this one by. 
 You've got to be kidding me. There is no English translation, just pictures and Mandarin phrases.  How are people suppose to figure it out without a straight forward english definitions or explanation for each phrase?  They're suppose to be teaching Mandarin to an English speaker, not some boy raised by wolves who never knew any language.  This is retarded. Worst product ever.  
 I was very disappointed with this book.  I was hoping for a clear and concise overview of world history in order to gain a general understanding of major world events and trends.  The author had only 513 pages to cover the entire span of world history, so why does he waste space rambling about vague sociological trends, or how one country might possibly have affected another?  The writing itself is incredibly clunky and unclear, and the organization is somewhat confusing.  I only ever had a vague grasp of the details of a specific civilization before the author jumped to another geographic area and back 1 or 2 thousand years.  I couldn't even finish the book ... I'd rather spend my time doing something (anything) else than spend it muddling through this mess 
 This was a gift that was going to go in the white elephant pile, but after sitting in a closet for a year, I took off the packaging and decided to give it a try. The very first avocado I planned to use it on was smaller than the implement and so it simply could not be used. I tossed it back in the drawer and grabbed my handy paring knife - which was quick and convenient to find and perfectly acceptable. I have never used it again.  
 The only great thing about "The Great Fire" is its name.  This is one of those books that as you read it, you find yourself lost in thoughts about the morning commute, the long ago expired and still unpaid decal on your front windshield, about the dog, that you forgot to feed and you now know it repaid you by doing its business on the one spot of the carpet, which you fiercely guarded and hoped to protect before the weekend party with your boss and his pricy wife who for some time now has been...but then you collect your thoughts and try again to refocus your attention on this story of post war Japan and the Australian soldier who fell in love with a teenager, or was the chap British...and the she, the bosses wife, who strangely winked at you during the last Christmas party and you felt like choking...he must have been Australian since in the end he decided to stay with the girl in Australia...but now you know that the spot in the carpet would forever remain brownish with its if not putrid then at least nagging reminder of the day you forgot to feed the damn dog because the book you were tying to read...but who really cares whether the Australian and the teenager remained faithful to each other, after all the world really changed since 1947...and so you hope that the next paycheck would be enough for you to make a call to `Stanley Steamer' and have them fix the memory of your immoral transgression...But back to the book! If you love British style novels of the kind where old ladies and younger chaps (with names like Bertram and Aldred) get together to have some tea, then in their spare time write long romantic letters, and from time to time remind each other of the horrid world war 2, this is the book for you. If you are like me, meaning you have so much on your mind that it'd take a much stronger novel to keep your attention pinned to its pages, then I highly recommend you withhold the urge to read this one.   - by Simon Cleveland 
 Between the lame wisecracks and puns, there seemed to be some useful information.  I don't know if it adds up to a book's worth.  Much of the information provided seemed to be the kind of stuff you'd simply learn by doing.  If I had it to do over again, I'd have spent the money on a Cocoa programming book.  As it turned out, the bad jokes got to be too much and I had to set the book aside.  This book is just too affected 
 Teri Hatcher is one of my favorite actresses. I think she is honest, and charming. But this book reveals too much about her insecurities and inadequacies at age 40. It has funny life stories mixed in, but the rest is just an account of how inadqeuate she feels and has always felt. Its sad. I think those thoughts would be better shared with a therapist. 
 I have read Mr. Train's earlier books The Money Masters and The New Money Masters and found them informative and interesting, gaining insights from some of the worlds most sucessful investors. Mr. Train's research seemed to rely heavily on personal interviews of these Masters often providing the reader with unique investment philosophies  not readily available elsewhere. I especially recommend Mr. Train's first book in this series The Money Masters because this book moved me away from the trading of stocks and futures as practiced by Robert Wilson the short seller and Stanly Kroll the great commodity speculator. The techniques they employed seemed too elusive and fraught with risk and if this was the basis of the trading game it was not the game for me. I was instead attracted to the similer philosophies of mentor and student Ben Grahman and Warren Buffett. Looking at a stock as a share of a business not a piece of paper with a number on it. This   was the first time I had been exposed to the wisdom of these two investors and I am grateful to Mr. Train for revealing to the public their methods. The problem I have with the current rendition is that it really adds nothing new. In fact Mr. Train seems to have copied parts of the first Money Masters and spliced them into this version. I may be wrong but it doesn't seem that the effort or creativity that went into the original went into this work. Another sort of irritating quality in this instance thankfully not present in the first book is Mr. Train's need to psychoanalyze some of his subjects especially Mr. Buffett. This adds an edge to the book that is not worthy of Mr. Train 
  Lorna is pretty, and her suitor is devoted. The story holds your attention. For many that is enough. Some auspicious beginnings, without depth. So maybe 3-stars for some people. I give 2-stars, if I do not keep it to watch again in later years.   I found the romance unfulfilling, and so the movie. Romance movies that I liked better are: "North & South", "Pride & Prejudice"-1940, & 1996 & 2006, "Wives and Daughters", and "A Walk to Remember". Adventure with romance: "The Scarlet Pimpernel". 
 In a land where the cops have to run away from gun toting street gangs because the so-called law won't let them do anything about the problem, how can you consider the government anything but extraordinarily liberal (read socialist)?   If our nation's government today, or in the 1980s, had any hint of fascism in it, why does it, and why did it, encourage immigration from third world nations en masse?   And, of course, one must wonder how a nation whose foreign policy is so often determined...err...influenced by the State of Israel can be anything like a fascist dictatorship. Surely AIPAC, not to mention the SPLC/ADL/ACLU, haven't allowed us to stray from their chosen (socialist) path? 
 When I was 15 and first discovering guitar, I loved this album. Listening to it now, it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.Vai is technically very impressive, but the man can't write a decent song to save his life. Vai's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians, lay down a generic rhythm track, and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album.  Technique on your instrument is never a bad thing, however, technique should be just a means to an end, not the end itself. And that's what no shred guitarist seems to understand. The fact that shred guitarists like Vai aren't more popular is due to one thing: they're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs. There's a GOOD REASON why non-guitarists hate this stuff.  Basically, once you get past the "Gee, that's neat" factor, this album, and nearly all of Vai's music, feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.To be blunt, this is what John Tesh or Yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards. Not only that, his guitar tone is absolutely awful. Very thin, high pitched, and brittle sounding.  The best thing on here is the blatant Van Halen rip-off "The Audience is Listening": the rest is just masturbation. Vai's best work has always been as a sideman, especially the stuff he did with David Lee Roth, because then he's forced to play actual SONGS, rather than 5 minute long, tedious guitar solos. On his own, he's just unbearable. I considered giving this one star, but I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that Vai CAN play, it's just WHAT he's playing that's the problem. 
 The essence of the book is "corporations behave badly".  I happen to agree but I don't need 339 pages to tell me this.  I was hoping to learn something here.  I was hoping for some history of how corporations developed.  Nothing of the kind.  Just a comparison to the gilded age (late 1800s) repeated throughout the book that is obvious to anyone who knows American history.  Those liberals who love to read long winded tirades that support their point of view may enjoy this book.  But if you aren't a liberal or if you are a liberal with a brain, this book will bore you to tears 
 Hi, I received this item twice, both times they were packaged improperly, causing the boxes to have dents. They were bought for my daughter who "collects" them.  I specified extra packing on the second item, to no avail.   Since I now have to file a dispute through my Credit Card company, to get my refund, I will no longer shop with Amazon 
 I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BROKEN, BUT THE MACHINE DOES NOT STEAM THE MILK AT ALL. IT ONLY GIVES ME A FEW SECINDS OF STEAM BEFORE STOOPING. I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS, BUT STILL NOTHING. THE THE REST IS OK I GUESS, JUST THE STEAM. I EXPECTED MORE 
 Evidently the people at Krups didn't try this coffeemaker before they put it on the market. The caraffe is hard to take out and put back in. It scrapes the lid every time. They say it keeps the coffee warm if you preheat the thermos but why then have a timer? You need a microwave handy if you want a hot cup of coffee. You never know how much coffee is left in the caraffe. Also you need to turn the caraffe upside down for the last few cups. I'm sure this is the last Krup's product I will buy. 
 Sorry, but I would not recommend this book.  As a "reference guide" I really expected more.  Probably a good buy at $19.95, but I'll sell you mine for $85.00 
 Although the illustrations are lovely and we both love unicorns, the story was just not good.  It was also too descriptive in places for the age range listed.  The story is about mankind destroying the forests and a lot of dialogue between the unicorn and the little girl.  It was really just plain boring 
 IMHO...Here's one of those times when the movie was much better realized and much more suspenseful than the book.  The DVD is available for purchase or rent.  The work is, however, original, and if one likes "coming of age" stories, this one is okay.  But if you WATCH it, you won't need popcorn!      
 Luckily you dont have to invest to much time to finish this book. There is really only about 20 pages of actual story the rest are descriptions of visual effects. Its as if Clevenger is pleading with Terry Gilliam to turn this into a movie. This story is in the wrong medium. On the plus side I would love to watch this if it was a movie it would be a trip. 
 Once again Gary Null "Phd" recycles information into another GN book with his one size fits all vegeterian diet and vits and supplements. Gary Null is probably the only author that carries a Phd and fails to reveal where he got his BA, MA and Phd. A quick reading of Quakwatch.com shows that Gary Null has  "nontraditional" credentials and owns a multi-million dollar supplement company. He also sells everything from magnets to water and air filters.   The confusing thing is why someone consuming a nutrient dense diet of organic vegetables, fruit and legumes would need supplements at all. The only reason I could think of is it is a bait and switch technique since most people unable to continue any diet that is restrictive, time consuming and costly give up. So GN conveniently has dozens of vits, supplements, and food replacement products to fill in the gap. I estimate the cost of following GN recommendations in full it would cost about $600 per person a month. To prove my point GN for decades has been against chocolate but recently he has added a GN "healthy" chocolate bar to his portfolio. Gary hooks people in by promising the fountain of youth and eternal life. Interestingly this 60 plus year old finds it necessary to put a old stock photo of himself in his books. 
 Having read some of Gregory Benford's work, I was greatly disapointed by "Beyond the Fall Of Night." His attempt to spin an addition on Clarke's short novel was a blunder. It's astonishing that he didn't pick up on an essential point of Clarke's original story, and proceeded to write himself into the ground, like an aircraft with no Glide Path. More surprising was that Clarke allowed this to be published. I wondered if he even reviewed works like this 
 I read Kathryn Davis' book The Thin Place and fell in love with her writing style, wanting more of her work. When I received Labrador in hardback, I could not wait to dive back into her writing style. As much as I enjoy the so-called "intellectual fiction", this novel was too much of that style. I tried to read at least the first 50 pages but felt myself drowning in her too in-depth work. I know that this was her first novel, so I am willing to overlook it and read her other work. However, I was deeply disappointed in this novel. I still think she is one hell of a writer and as stated before, I will be reading her other works very soon 
 The prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again.  I was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.  I mean Graceland for a first date?  I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the mayor in Northern Lights, and Logan and Nate from that same book.  None of them can talk in complete sentences.  And Stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years.  There is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it. Unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which I didn't bother to read because I just couldn't torture myself any longer.  And I'm a big fan of Roberts.  I love her Quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work.  But this just stunk because I could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be.  I'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out. 
 The shaver is fantastic, as most of the reviewers agree.  However, after two months of gentle use, the cleaning stand stopped working.  Braun is telling me to send it to a repair shop but, as luck would have it, I can't find my receipt so I can't get it repaired under warrantee.  Even if I could find the receipt, I would have to send the stand in at my expense.  I bought this shaver because I felt I would be buying quality.  I am a product designer by profession and I feel that this product is not worth the money, especially in light of their repair policy.  If they were to stand behind their products, I would be fine with this failure, but, as it stands, I regret buying this shaver and I doubt I will purchase anything else from Braun 
 Most military histories of the American Revolution focus on the "great" battles, and give scant attention to recounting other, lesser engagements. However, those lesser engagements are often the best way of depicting the harsh and divisive nature of the war. In the Carolinas, for example, the war took on many aspects of a civil war within a war, as Loyalist militias, stiffened by British soldiers, took on Rebel militias in a brutal, back-country partisan conflict.   This book attempts to describe that slice of the war by highlighting one engagement within it. That small battle, prosaically named "Huck's Defeat" (after Captain Christian Huck, the Loyalist officer who lost his life in the fight), was the first Rebel victory in the aftermath of the fall of the city of Charleston, and it is the opinion of the author that the importance small militia engagements like this one are overlooked. Huck's Defeat, and several subsequent victories by partisans and militia units, convinced most locals to side with the Rebel forces and oppose the English. This, in turn, kept South Carolina in the war, and ultimately led to the Rebel victories of King's Mountain and the Cowpens. The rest, as they say, is history: the British were forced to leave the state, marching down a path that led to Lord Cornwallis's surrender at Yorktown.   While making a good point - that these lesser back-country battles were important and are often neglected - Edgar overstates his case. "Huck's Defeat" was a very small battle indeed: 115 Loyalist and British soldiers vs. ca. 250 Rebels, and lasting no more than an hour. The loyalists were massacred, but unless the Revolutionary cause in South Carolina truly hinged on this one engagement (i.e. defeat would have meant the end of resistance in the colony), then it was simply one particularly bloody skirmish among many 
 This worked fine at first but after a few months, the charger could not hold the AAA batteries in place. The spring mechanisms failed for 3 out of the 4 positions that would hold the AAA batteries. Thus, I could no longer charge the AAA batteries. Then after a while, the charger just quit working all together 
 This book is a perfect example of a reigning culture ( in this case Western Caucasian ) dressing up it's post-Slavery Era losses and expanding Colonialism as benevolent towards the "child-like" races that only need simple things to be happy in their subordination to the superior white people and their culture.  It stunk of racism to me when I was a child in the 1960s. And stinks of racism now. In a post-Civil Rights era, where we should all know better than excuse this smiling little culturally "unconscience" evil, there is no excuse for this propaganda 
 This thermometer is totally worthless. It doesn't read the correct temp. on myself, husband or baby. When my little one was sick at 3 months old, this thing read 96.7 degrees on all three of us. I picked up a digital 'under the tongue' type and simply used it under his arm. Works great--cost me $3.       I can't GIVE this one away 
 Well I am a collector of zombie movies and I do own some real stinkers such as Zombie Lake, Revenge of the Dead, to name a few, but boy this one was a huge disappointement.  All of the other reviews are true, it is so bad you will find yoursef hitting the chapter skip button.  I knew not to expect much going into it, but I didn't think it would be this horrible.  If you are looking for zombies, you will not find satisfactions here.  There are a few scenes where you see these ultra lame zombie wannabes, very weak.  If you get the unrated edition and want it for the porn you will find a lot, but you will find yourself getting tired of it quick.  There are so many porn scenes that it seems they were just trying to add them in, made me lose interest in the movie immedeately as it got old.  I would not recommend buying this.  Buy something else and steer clear off of this one 
 Ms. Hooks--her affected name which she writes in lower case for reasons left unexplained to readers--shouldn't complain so much about feeling "marginalized" in the "white male academy": this book shows she is deeply embedded in it. She has mastered the old academic game: heavily criticizing "the system" while at the smae time extracting a comfortable living from it. She is indeed "insurgent" if you definite insurgency as holding a job in a prestigious liberal arts college. She is "progressive" if that progress involves studious avoidance of any involvement in organized efforts to change things (she lionizes "theory" in one typically rambling chapter, no doubt seeing her passive, shallow intellectualism as some kind of powerful political movement). All of us who are REALLY interested in political change should abandon the writing of people like Ms. Hooks and listen to people who, rather than simply thinking for a living, actually DO something 
 This was the worst CD I have ever received.  It did not have a case at all and the CD did not even play.  I returned the CD and did not receive my money back 
 michael moore is a lying jealous hypocrite riding around in limos,owning stock in companies he despises and collecting accolades he doesn't deserve. I think he should move to Iran or Saudi Arabia so he can wear a robe over his "working class"uniform he seems to fool so many people with 
 I found The Whole Woman more antagonistic and needlessly controversial than enlightening. Greer makes it quite clear that there is exactly one feminist left on the planet, and she is it.  I'm hard-pressed to think of any third-wave feminists who live up to her standards. To do so, you would have to be an earth-mother living in a separatist commune with her lesbian lover. There's nothing wrong with that lifestyle, but it's not one to which most feminists would aspire. It's not one to which I aspire.  Also, it's as limiting a construction of womanhood as the patriarchal one she deplores. What do you do if you are heterosexual? It's all very well for her to say that you can reconstruct yourself as a lesbian, but that's as insulting as the implication that homosexuals just need to try hard enough and they can be heterosexual.   In a similar vein, I found her views of men particularly unpleasant. She suggests in no uncertain terms that they're all potential adulterers, rapists, child-abusers, wife-beaters, misogynists, etc . . . etc . . ., and that any woman who wants an equal, non-exploitative relationship had better become a lesbian. It's hard to see it as anything but pure slander, backed up by the flimsiest of anecdotal evidence. Just because you can cite a few cases of sickos who get turned on by their baby daughters in their nightgowns does not mean that all fathers will inevitably turn to abuse.   The rest of the book is no better. It's very poorly researched and argued, and parts of it verge into the insane. She seems particularly taken with the idea of "primitive" women as whole women, because they aren't bound by Western concepts of femininity. What she doesn't mention is that those women experience the same oppression that Western feminists fought long and hard to overcome. They might not wear bras or high-heels, but that doesn't make them any less oppressed by patriarchy. It seems obvious to me that women from tribal societies do not generally have much real political power, but are doomed to bear lots of children and die young. When she does look at the appalling aspects of those societies, she puts a positive spin on them. There's even a section where she seems to defend female genital mutilation.   Also, I can imagine that some of her ill-informed views are extremely offensive to people in those situations. She describes IVF as patriarchal appropriation of and interference into the process of reproduction. Similarly, she suggests that women who don't opt for natural childbirth (without anaesthetic, of course) are allowing men to remove them from the process. It's utterly disrespectful of the choices women may choose to make, not because they've internalised their oppression but because inseminating themselves with a turkey-baster seems vaguely ludicrous or because they don't want to experience agonising pain.  It's been a while since I read a feminist book that made me angry and this one does so for all the wrong reasons. It makes me embarrassed to call myself a feminist. 
 I found this album a little dissapointing. And the sensation increase in comparation with "mi tierra". The main thing on this is the track selection, wich makes the whole a very downtempo album. Althought there's a couple of up & high beat pieces, the sensation I percive it's like if there were a down for gloria and she wanted to put it in the album. That's no bad. The bad thing comes up when I heard it and I can't get down, Just a little bored. There's no feeling, no emotion, no heart, no music. If you are planning to buy a gloria's CD, don't get this one. Mi tierra would do it best 
 The first problem with this book is the cover. It depict the two names of God and the prophet intertwined together, like two equal entities, creating a sense of unity.  This design tells a lot about Sufi thought, which  elaborates on man's journey towards his Creator until he reaches the final  state of unity, at which point he becomes at the highest state of being.   And thus he is looked up to by others in 'subordinate' stages as a person  through which God communicates with them.  To any devout Muslim, this is  pure heresy. One of the main objectives of Islam was to purify faith from  the 'other' in man's relationship with his Creator.      The second problem  with this book is its preset assumption that Sufism is an Islamic concept.   For anyone familiar with the everyday life of the prophet and his  companions, it is clear that they had no time to sit and meditate over  which 'station' of knowledge or literal advancement towards God they were  at (in fact, they never viewed themselves as being the best or the most  knowledgeable, knowing that whoever thought of himself as such had probably  claimed authority over matters known only to God).  There were more  important things set down from God for them and subsequently, for all  muslims.  Those were clearly set out and, to find out about them, all you  have to do is just read the Quran.  The prophet had a mission to humanity  and his companions followed in his footsteps.  They were to accomplish it  exactly as God had ordered them, there was neither the desire, nor the  room, to come up with man made ideologies and to distract themselves from  God's clearly defined commands.       Those people were NOT saints, for  Islam does not acknowledge sainthood.  If they were all a group of mystics,  their minds would have been too clouded with problems of knowledge and  existence that no civilization would have been built in the first place.       As the case is with most Sufi readings, reference is hardly to the  companions of the prophet or to names like Ibn Qayyim, Ibn Taymiya, Malek,  Abu Hanifa, or Shafei.  It is in the writings of those that a reader will  find the fulfilling spiritual aspect of Islam.  All that readers find,  however, is 'saints,' or mystic scholars whose writings, as known to all  Muslim scholars, sharply deviate from the teachings of Orthodox Islam found  in the Quran and in the sayings of the prophet (pbuh).      Finally, it is  important to note that the often praised Sheikh Ghazali, considered by  Sufis as the founder of Sufism and, to whom reference is indeed abundant in  many Sufi texts, had himself changed much of his ideas near the end of his  life and had in fact complied more closely to the teachings of Orthodox  Islam 
 the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book.  the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were.  this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it 
 only Noam Chomsky could be more anti-American.  go on, all you Death to America wackos, keep hating the greatest country in the world.  Answer me this: if were so terrible, how come everyone one and their mother literally risk their lives trying to get to our shores?    every single story in this book takes an anti-US slant.  Its so one sided its ridiculous.  You almost wonder, is he living in the same country that we are?  His distorted views, re-written history, and "facts" are so skewed that only a naive imbecile would believe it, or those already drinking the kool-aid would welcome it.  unless you hate this country, do yourself a favor and stay away 
 This book's description sparked my interest and led me to think that it would fill a gap in Eliot scholarship. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The book does not quite achieve what it sets out to do 
 Yes, Rifkin's descriptions of the cultural differences between Americans and Europeans make interesting reading, but the vast majority of what he says is anecdotal, if not inaccurate.  I found it amusing to read his praise of Europe's assimilation of immigrants when riots were occurring all over France.  And the idea that the popularity of subscription services and auto leasing means companies are now in the business of selling "time" rather than material products is absurd 
 I'm glad I found this book in the library and didn't buy it! After hearing the good reviews here I was shocked at how poor this book really was. I'm a fan of the paranormal and have studied it for a long time, I am always looking for new views and info whether it be pro or con. But this book is obviously a debunking manuscript. And a poor one at that! It tackles only the weakest of cases, ignores REAL evidence, and brings forth "rational" explanations that are even more far out than the paranormal explanation. The section on crop circles was horrible, dismissing it as a hoax without even LOOKING AT ANY of the fascinating evidence that this is a real occurance. Pass 
 Two main comments.  Firstly, the book is mistitled or I misread the meaning of the title and I would be delighted to return it.  This is a book devoted primarily on how to make your dog perform "tricks" with much on showmanship.  I have no interest in that but I do have an acute interest in dog obedience relative to the master's care of their puppy and mature dog.  Problems handlers encounter in "greeting" of your dog with other dogs and people.   Secondly, the book, as written, talks down to the reader and unless you have had some professional experience with dogs, you feel very unqualified to read on.  I felt intimidated by it.  
 I want to congratulate Mr. Fisk for crafting perhaps the most anti-semitic (by this I mean anti-Israel) and biased piece of journalism in a very distinguished field (2nd place goes to daily coverage of the conflict to the BBC).  To his credit, and it is the only positive thing I can say about the book, Mr. Fisk clearly states that his editors, or I should say his increasingly "right wing" editors, were not pleased with his coverage but continued it due to the conditions in the war-torn region.  You know when a "journalist" will only write terrorist as "terrorist", (similarly, Reuters refuses to use the word.  Instead, they use the word militants to describe the beheaders in Iraq) the tone for the rest of the book is set.  Sadly, but revealingly, Mr. Fisk makes it appear that most of the journalists covering the conflict share his anti-Israel pro-"freedom fighers" views (the eventually kidnapped Terry Anderson said all the parties should be called terrorists).  Amazingly, at least in the copy I received, there were no pictures at all.    Mr. Fisk at every opportunity diminishes the threat Israel faced with the UN/Arab backed PLO operating in Beirut.    A truly horrific case of biased journalism from a writer from the country that brought us "sexed-up" lies and other media (MSM) distortions 
   I, along with the majority of justice League Fans, am disappointed. The cartoons themselves are great; action packed, good art, great storylines, but the context is terrible. They release 2-3 episodes a disk, when there are about twenty to a season, and the majority of the limited number of disks they've produced repeat episodes. I've seen "Enemies of the Deep" on more than two Justice League DVDs, so in reality you're paying 20 dollars for an episode you already have, and only two new ones out of fourty. Buy the time you've bought the whole two seasons, you'll have spent over four hundred dollars.     Save yourself some money and tape the repeats that come on television. If they've discontinued it, buy the entire series collection on ebay for about twenty bucks that also include cross-over episodes not included on official dvds.  Lastly, just a personal opinion, Paco is absolutley right! Cartoons should be made for children! There are only a million adult movies out, let's leave SOMETHING for the kids to watch! I'm not a kid, but I certainly enjoy a well done, clean cartoon with a good plot. Some things are just added in but really not needed. Some parents find some things morally wrong, or feel there child shouldn't be knowing about "certain things" yet. The parent would be forced to tell their kids "sorry kids, you can't watch your favorite children's show because it's not suitable for children." What was once "Flash beats up the monster and gets the key to the city" is now "Flash beats up a monster then hangs with some scantily clad girls in a hot tub" And if WB does decide to have that stuff included, they should at least put it in "Adult Swim" or something 
 I loved it when I purchased it online and it met every expections I had with this slide. Great slide and just as great design BUT when slide is in upright postion and locked it is VERY UNSTABLE and UNSAFE. It can be easily be knoked over even by an infant or it can just easily tip over when child tries to climb it or slide it. You have to physically hold both carrots by your hands to keep it stable while child is trying to play. Just one oversight incidence by the parents, child will get hurt. Since, I do like the product otherwise, I am trying to figure out a way to mount the legs on ground before I can allow this to be used. Please do not buy this unless you have a way to mount the base on the ground somehow. 
 My goodness, where do I begin...TYPOS, GRAMMATICAL ERRORS AND A TON OF NONSENSE about life on "the Street". I spent 5 years on Wall Street in various areas of the industry at 2 of the top 5 firms and another one of the top 10 firms. I bought the book because I thought it might give me a basic overview of other areas I might be able to move into and plan a stategy to do. Geez, I was awestruck at the amount of poor writing and overinflated depictions of life in I-Banking. Spare me! I was shocked that the authors made it out of high school much less college and prestigious business program. (I should apply to the school and tell them you can't tell me "no" because you said "yes" to this guy, and look how he writes and openly acknowledges he's an alumni member.) Spend your money elsewhere. Find folks in the business. You will fare much better. This should get negative stars for a poor attempt at a marketing/advertising book attempting to be substantive 
 I have dyed red hair, a lot of dyed red hair. this product made no noticable difference in the shine of my hair. WIll not purchase again 
 This review is for the Spanish edition ONLY which I recently purchased (ISBN:8498160162, publisher: Linkgua).  Note, that this is an ABRIDGED EDITION (edición abreviada) and is not true to the original text, this is evident commencing with the first sentence of the book. The reader will get the general idea of the novel, but will not read the words as written be the author.  I submit here an example of the above-mentioned sentence:  ABRIDGED EDITION (ISBN 8498160162): A fines de octubre, don Santiago de los Santos, conocido vulgarmente con el nombre de Capitán Tiago, daba una cena, que era el tema de todas las conversaciones en Binondo, en los demás arrabales y hasta dentro de la ciudad.  ORIGINAL TEXT: A fines de octubre, don Santiago de los Santos, conocido popularmente bajo el nombre de Capitán Tiago, daba una cena, que, sin embargo de haberlo anunciado aquella tarde tan sólo, contra su costumbre, era ya el tema de todas las conversaciones en Binondo, en otros arrabales y hasta en Intramuros.  This editing is consistent throughout every paragraph in the book.   If you just want a good read, then this edition will suffice. It is an excellent novel. However, if you are an admirer of the Spanish language, please get your hands on the original version.  
 The second CD was scratched and hence I cannot play it. I would appreciate it if you would send me another one and also include the information needed to return the damaged one sent to me.  Thanks.  Jeann 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 I was very disappointed to find that most of chapter 5 "Genetic Engineering" was incomplete. The chapter was cut off (on page 80) and was followed by a repetition of page 49-80. Chapter 6 "Why we should Worry" had been left out and the beginning of chapter 7 "Human Rights" (page 105-113) was missing as well. It was very important for me to work on precisely these (missing) chapters at exactly this moment in time, so I am of course quite dissatisfied with the quality of this particular product.  
 Mr. Lozowick, along with all the hundreds (if not thousands) of other pundits, pols, propagandists, spinmeisters, and other assorted demagogues, can slice his particular form of baloney as thick or as thin as he wants, but after all the countless millions of words on the topic of modern Israel and Zionism have been poured forth, three simple facts remain:  1. The original Zionist Jews came from (mostly) Europe to Palestine with the stated aim of dispossessing the people who were already living there and establishing a Jewish state on the land.  2. The people who were already there refused to quietly go away and let the Zionist Jews have what they wanted without a fight.  3. The British, French and Americans have all been heavily complicit in furthering the aims of the Zionist Jews. For almost a century, major Western nations have helped to sell the Palestinian Arabs down the river - and we still expect the Arabs to LOVE us for doing it!  All else is mere commentary and window dressing.  Mr. Lozowick fails to convince me that Israel has any more right to exist than does any other artificially constructed modern nation such as Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia or Taiwan. And two of these three are already gone from the Atlas in the forms in which they were created.  Just as I refuse to shed any tears over the Spanish Conquistadores or American settlers who came to the New World to dispossess and oppress the natives and who got themselves seriously dead for their temerity, so, too, do I refuse to shed any tears over any of the Zionist Jews who have become defunct while squatting on lands they have wrested from others by force and/or legalistic mumbo-jumbo.  And I equally refuse to demonize the Palestinians for fighting the foreign invaders with whatever means they have at their disposal. Wars for home and hearth are never pretty things.  There is NO moral high ground to be found under either side in this conflict 
 So I love Bill Bryson - and have bought many of his books and Cds - however I was dismayed to see something marked as "Audio CD" shipped out which is a weird Ipod nano sized MP3 device with the whole book on it. (appears to be a non-rewriteable MP3 device) Not that that's not a neat idea - but it demands you listen via headphones - I listen at work or while I drive and was expecting a CD - I am returning this item - and looking forward to getting a real CD.  Buyer beware!! But Bill Bryson is a great reader and storyteller 
 Hard to believe this product is still being sold when it's not even friendly with the current hot selling ipods.  Also the claims of good design I feel are overstated.  Finally the speakers are weak and sound like it won't be long until they're shaking, this may influence what music you'll end up playing through the system.  All said, though, I'd be happy with it for the price if only they'd update it to fully handle my ipod 
 First, I hardly ever write reviews...but after this story, I needed to state something.  Second, I am not considered a conservative and relatively open minded. Third, I always appreciate history and culture...and understand this story was handed down through generations.  However, never reading this story myself and reading it to my three and a half year old for the first time - I had to stop half way through the book after realizing the heart of the story surrounds a monkey killing a baby owl and the jungle searches for the killer while the mother owl grieves.  To complement the story, there is an illustration of the monkey (snarl showing sharp teeth) hitting the baby owl over the head with a branch...not a bedtime story for this family.  It was given as a gift, and will be returned shortly.. 
 I have to agree with those who are disappointed with this 3rd volume.  Highlights for me were "Ragtime", and "How Now, Dow Jones?"   My favourite item in the 3 volumes would have to be "Let's take a glass" from DVD 2.  I love the Original Cast CD of "Grand Hotel", but never saw it on stage, so seeing this number alone was worth the all the bad items on the discs.   Let's hope they continue to show truly great performances from both old shows and new.  I look forward to reliving the amazing Tommy Tune choreography from "Will Rogers Follies" that hopefully will be seen in a future collection.    
 I thought the dialogue was awkward and overly dramatic, and the whole storyline was unrealistic.  Many times, the author repeated herself, as if she forgot that a particular point had already been made just a few pages before.  There wasn't enough character development, either 
 Knowing that the photographs would be evocative and interesting, I purchased this book for my nephew.  But after reading the captions which accompany many of the photos, I have reconsidered my decision.  To start with, the language used in the captions is hardly appropriate for the young reader.  No effort seems to have been made by the editors to contextualize, politically or historically, the images selected.  Often there is a loose "thematic" arrangement which sets images in opposition without a clear statement of the connections, chronological or otherwise, between them.  The captions read as if the editors haphazardly, and hurriedly, chopped up the narrative from the "adult" version of the text to create a text thoughtlessly marketed to younger readers.   Worse still is the glaring editorial bias, bordering on jingoism, with which the text treats the Cold War and the former Soviet Union.  While I hardly expected the editors at Life magazine to present a balanced narrative about the clash of ideas that defined so much of the last century, I was shocked to see the Soviets repeatedly referred to as "Reds", a term that very few of the children born after the collapse of the Soviet Union would even understand, and in a page dedicated to the  McCarthy hearings, Communism was referenced as a "disease" (news to more than one medical professional I am sure) and the young reader is reminded that McCarthy was attacking a very real "communist threat" but lamentably had gone too far.  It is understandable that in a Post-Communist world we can see the projects of the Soviet Union and its allies as failures, and there is no harm in naming them as such, but the anachronistic and, frankly, stupid "slang" used by the writers reflects the degree to which they were NOT creating an educational text, but rather an out-dated propagandistic tract.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants to foment thoughtful analysis in the minds of the young people they know.  A total dud 
 I thought I was getting a SET of forks NOT one fork. The picture and description are deceptive. The picture depicts a set(s) I am sure the ONE fork I got is great but I have 5 other hands that need a fork as well 
 The West Wing is my favorite television show of all time.  Period.  Nothing else comes even close.  I could go on and on about the show, but others are doing an excellent job on that score, and that's not my point here.  My point is the awful, awful DVD.  No English-language subtitles (for the second year in a row).  Only two special features, both about the debate episode.  No insight from the actors about their take on seven years of ground-breaking television.  No tribute to John Spencer.  I feel as if the folks at Warner Brothers Television knew they had their market well in hand, so the quality of the product really didn't matter.  "No bother, we'll sell enough anyway."  I'm one of those that bought it anyway, but I feel as if I got ripped off.  
 Now, I love to read. It's extremely RARE for me to pick up a book and not finish it. I'm not a picky reader, either. I like just about anything that I get my hands on. But this book--this book was an exception.  It's not so much of the cute cover (I really liked it) or the initial plot of the book. It's the bland writing and how unrealistic everything is. I only got through about half of the book, but I had to put it down. The way the writers (it's two people using one pseudonym) wrote the story, it had me thinking about other things. I had to go back and reread passages because even though I had "read" them, my mind had wandered.   I'm all one for romance, and I have read a lot of these types of books. But Cy and Morgan's romance... it just happened out of nowhere. There was no build up. Also, I felt the characters lacked any dimension whatsoever and the whole book had me feeling like, "So what?"  A book is only good if it makes its readers care, one way or another. And I honestly didn't care. Which is why I gave this book 1 star 
 I just purchased a glass top stove and bought this because of the protective bottom. However, after using it several times, I would choose a different grill because of the following reasons: #1 The spatter mess - there is virutally no way to prevent splatter when using this pan creating an unneccessary amount of post-cooking clean-up. #2 There is no option of purchasing a lid #3 The pan itself has an odd rectangular shape that does not fit on one burner or two for that matter. Thus, somewhere while cooking you have a cool spot 
 It's hard to believe that the same scholar who wrote The American Century and Imagining the Law is the same expert that Anne Rice claims as her foremost source of medieval history. Norman Cantor's breadth of knowledge (and the varying degrees of it, covering everything from sweeping historical movements to epicurean minutiae) is truly incredible, and I find myself amazed by his attention to detail time and time again, whether he is dealing with the relationship between Einstein's theories and Cubism or the origin of the popularity of Madeira port in England.    Encyclopedic knowledge, however, does not necessarily yield an interesting biography.  Cantor attempts to do so in this book about John of Gaunt, the first Duke of Lancaster.  On the surface, it seems that it would be almost impossible to write a dull biography of John of Gaunt. The richest man in Europe who was not a king, a commander in the Hundred Years War, the father of Henry IV, the grandfather of Henry the Navigator, the benefactor of Geoffrey Chaucer and, briefly, John Wyclif - John of Gaunt appears as the apex of the high medieval era, a thinking man's warrior who lived life extravagantly and yet strictly abided by the chivalric code.  In William Manchester's hands, John of Gaunt would have been a sensational character indeed.  What deadens the presentation of such a colorful figure here, however, is that Cantor chooses to tell his story by using what he calls the "sociological approach."  I'm not exactly sure what that means, but it seems to be an appropriate description of the way in which Cantor uses the figure of Gaunt to illuminate different sectors of society.  Thus, by setting the military, financial, and romantic activities of Gaunt within their proper context, Cantor feels free to discuss the economic and political activities of the serfs and knights whose lives were circumscribed by Gaunt's power and influence.  We are also introduced to the royal families of England, Spain and Portugal, all of which included at least one member of Gaunt's immediate family.  However, despite the fact that Gaunt plays a key role in the war with France, the Peasant's Revolt, Richard II's fall from power, and, unwittingly, the institutionalization of racism (through the ideology constructed by Henry the Navigator), Cantor's Gaunt comes across as a typical billionaire, whose interests and occasional forays into philanthropy suggest a life as lavish and boring as today's CEOs who catch the public's attention only when their infidelities or swindles rise to the surface.     Furthermore, Cantor has an unsettling habit of numbering his points ("first of all...second of all...") which can give the narrative the feel of a textbook.  The only really interesting bits occur when Cantor suddenly slips into strange flights of fancy, such as when he composes an unintentionally hilarious imaginary love letter that Gaunt might have sent to his mistress, Catherine Swynford.  By the end of the book, John of Gaunt, poised at the edge of an era and facing the rumblings of social change with growing trepidation, fossilizes into the "aged, doddering" man of Shakespeare's play Richard II - the very representation that Cantor wanted to subvert when he decided to bring this man to life 
 If you got Elvis Presley and Dodie Marshall and put them in the same film you will have Easy Come Easy Go, an Elvis Presley that people who like boats or sailing or both will love. But anybody that hates boats or sailing and is an Elvis Presley fan will be un-happy. And Elvis' leading lady in this film is Dodie Marshall which I guess is a re-make of a film with the same name came out in 1947. And this is one of final films that Elvis sings the same song with somebody else, and the song is Yoga Is As Yoga Goes. He sings that with Elsa Lanchester who plays a not very nice yoga teacher. If you are an Elvis Presley fan, then buy or rent Jailhouse Rock on video or dvd 
 I almost got into an argument with a cashier when purchasing this album.  He mentioned it was the best thing he'd ever heard by Anita in years.  I had to disagree based on airplay so far but was giving the album a chance.  I had already noticed that the phrasing, improvisation and clearly - the voice we know - was not there. I gave the album a chance, hoping for more, but it didn't happen.  This CD has been on my living room table for quite a long time now.  I've listened to it in it's entirety about three times just knowing it will hit me at some point but it doesn't.  Yes, I've been a fan of Anita's too.  I was ecstatic the day The Songstress was re-issued on CD many years ago.  I have the Chapter 8 album on the original vinyl release.  I'm from Detroit too and have every reason to plug Anita.  Anyway, very disappointing.  Of about 650 CD's and 600 more vinyl LP's, I was sifting through them all about a week ago and hate to say it but I picked about 20 to sell and Anita's latest will be one of them going to the cut-out bin.  The "work" was obviously not put in to this album.  I was just listening to "My Everything" on the radio prompting me to write this.  The vocals almost seem amateuristic and a forced attempt to rekindle past masterpieces.    Times are hard around here although I've heard better things about other parts of the country but paying $16-$20 for something you have confidence that you'll get your $$$ worth and you don't is rather tiring.     I think Amazon's offer to purchase her latest effort for a penny when opening a credit card sums it all up.  Sorry Anita but do give me credit for introducing your work to a whole new audience when inviting co-workers and friends to your concert at Pine Knob way back in the 80's.  
  Reading Dark Harbor is like watching a mediocre TV show that you can't be bothered to turn off. I listened to Dark Harbor as an audio book, so I don't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because I `read it' while I was doing other things that had to be done anyway, like driving.   If you are looking for something that feels fresh and new - Dark Harbor is not for you. This novel is about as innovative as an episode of Murder She Wrote. To illustrate: Stone Barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim's wrong hand. (I think I actually saw that one on Murder She Wrote) Woods either can't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply doesn't care.   It is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in Dark Harbor. This isn't because the clues come together in any logical way, but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel. You can just tell. This doesn't mean that the solution makes sense. In fact, there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced.   It is as if Woods couldn't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through. Woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do (except of course, to have sex with Stone). Holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island. On her second trip she has an obligatory romp with Stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel.   Why was she kidnapped? I don't think anyone - including Woods - can answer that question in any plausible way. My theory is that Woods needed to work Holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages. It also allowed him to include Holly's dad (another regular character) in her search. Wood's motive seems obvious. The kidnapper's motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense. But clearly this was something Woods didn't think was worth worrying about.   The best I can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read (of course, in my case it was read to me). It may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read (and certainly not to buy) - but as an audio book from the library (with a limited selection of audio books to choose from) it helped me pass the time in traffic.   
 Alright, for those of you who say Rand is criticizing works for false ideals, or lacking in substance, I say this: who is Rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are?  Who is Rand to say what substance is?  You've got to look at her bias, first.  Realize that Rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom.  As if outside factors never matter; and maybe they don't, for her.  Maybe her life in an oppressive Russia did nothing to form who she is today.  But I doubt it.  Though I believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live, outside influences do affect a person.  But she doesn't.  Thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap.  All books that are not driven solely by the individual's sense of reason: don't read, cause it will lessen your IQ.    Any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she doesn't find worthwhile or cannot understand, she condemns.  Rand, at least as portrayed in what I've read of her work, is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants.  And this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes.  They cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality, they are either good or worthless.   The pieces of art she says are empty ARE empty, absolutely.  They don't fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer.  Nothing to offer her, that is.    How is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history's best books, telling OTHER people (with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual) What they should read?  Truthfully any criticism in this form, like a list I saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world, is elitist crap trying to close people's minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others.  They have their bias like anyone else.  I say read in variety.  Observe art outside of Rand's choice of art.  Take in all you can, with an open mind, then start pondering whether you agree or not.  If you then agree because YOU agree, then I say great.  Its the basic individualistic response that Rand seems to forget to address.  She says question society, but by my line of inquiry.  She says be an individual, but only I know the basis of who you want to be 
 The plot sort of tumbles out of the story rather than unfolds. Ms. Zukas is the sterotype of what people perceive librarians to be, she also seems to have some obsessive-compulsive traits. Ms. Zukas should have been the third victim, since the only compelling character in the story was Ruth 
 Dr. Dolittle has fallen afoul of the PC police, well before they were so named.  This edition is heavily adulterated to maintain political correctness.  Unfortunately, you must read the afterword to understand this.  A great story, a bad edition 
 I thought this book is drivel.  Itis nothing more than a series of badly written, rambling articles written in the breathlessly enthusiastic style that is typical of body building mags.  It does contain some suggestions for interesting excercises and tips on how to make equipment, but you can find all that for free by doing a Google on "grip strenth training"  There is not one diagram or word of explanation for the muscles in the hand and forearm and what movements they control.  Not one!  Other than suggesting ideas for the exercises themselves, there is no real discussion about an actual exercise program.  Should one do 5 reps or 50 reps? Is it best to exercise every day?  Twice a week?  The book is no help.  If you cant get enough of the magazine article and you want to read a bunch of badly written accounts of who squoze what and when then this book is for you - otherwise save your $ 
  After the excitement of THE WOLVES OF CALLA, SONG OF SUSANNAH is more than a little disappointing. Susannah and her demon possessor, Mia, are off to give birth to whatever, Roland, Eddie, Jake and Callahan are in hot, well, lukewarm pursuit, and for many pages nothing happens. Many, Many pages. This book plays to the worst parts of the series, overly mannered speeches, cryptic messages, 19's all over the place and page upon page of meaningless dialogue that will interest only fans of minutia. There are a few moments where things pickup, like when King himself makes an appearance, and while it proves  interesting for King to take such a hard look at his 70's self, it's not exactly Kilgore Trout meeting Vonnegut in BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS. Another problem I had was that unlike the clear and horrifying creations of Wrightson and Whalen, Anderson's blurry impresionistic images left me cold and did nothing to enhance this volume of THE DARK TOWER. For the second to last book in the series I had hoped for some real resolutions to some of the problems, but I guess King decided to save everything for the last book.   P.S. Man, if I heard that baby called "the chap" one more time... 
 I HATED this movie.  And I am a big "PHC" fan.  This has none of the charm, emotional and spiritual depth, or clever humor of the radio program.  It feels like some well-known Hollywood actors and actresses trying to pretend they're real people and not Hollywood actors and actresses.  It doesn't work!  Amazingly bad.  You don't care which of the characters are going to die at the end.  I was wishing they ALL would.  Contrived and manipulative writing.  Insulting to real people of faith.  Lily Tomlin can't sing.  Garrison Keillor should stick to what he does best, RADIO.  And we don't need to be subjected to his socio-political angle on the plot, what little there was of one.  I am insulted that critics seem to all be saying that fans of the radio show will love this movie.  It doesn't at all resemble the radio show.  I don't get people who think it does.  God rest his soul, but thank goodness Robert Altman won't be making any more movies THIS bad.  
 Old fan as I am, this one (and quite a few of the later ones) was a huge disappointment. Badly written, obvious plot, even more cartoonish characters than usual. Time for Cussler to retire methinks.... 
 Buyers beware, the Bible commentaries are written by liberal theologians.  They tend to disbelieve miracles and try explaining away Devine prophecy by assigning late dates for the books.  When I was reading the commentaries, I couldn't help but get the feeling that the writers were trying to destroy my faith.  Also, while it is not a bad translation, the NRSV does have some gender-neutrality inserted into it.  All in all, I cannot recommend this study Bible.  It reads like skeptics and non-believers wrote it 
 This is without a doubt the worste game I have ever purchased. It is basiclly one big empty landscape with about 16 or so bosses that you have to climb on to beat.  They could have made this a decent game so easily just by puting in some minions and some characters to talk to and buy stuff from. As it is right now it's just a really, really, really, crappy version of Zelda: Orcarina of Time.  If you have any respect for decent video games you will not buy this video game unless it is for the sole purpose of setting it on fire and stomping on it 
 "The Heart is a Lonely Hunter" is simply a compilation of character sketches loosely strung together.  If you are a student of literary characterization and the methods authors use to bring a character to life, you might enjoy this book. The charcters are indeed animated.  However, if you are searching for a book that combines vivid characters with any sort of plot, this book is not for you.  By the time I was half-way through the book I was seriously wondering when a coherant plot would develop.  One never materialized.  This book does not adhere to the standard beginning-middle-end, protagonist-antagonist-plot-resolution formula by which most novels abide.   As I was reading this book as a book club assignment, I trudged through to its completion.  Now all I wish is that I could recapture the hours of life wasted on its pages.  
 I hated this book.  I kept reading, hoping to have that "aha" moment where I finally put all the pieces together... but there was not one.  I did not think there was anything remarkable about Alison, and I never really  liked her.  She was wishy-washy, spineless, and settled way too many times during the story.  I felt so sorry for every character in the book.... except for Alison's friends.. Nola and Jess - who were poorly developed.  I found myself flipping back pages/chapters to see if I'd missed something about these random people.  The middle part of the story dragged on and on.... and then in a matter of one or two chapters.. everything was resolved ... but I still felt unresolved since the resolutions were so weak.  
 Michael Gray should be commended for taking on such a daunting task as cross referencing all things of interest related to Bob Dylan.  However, where good detective work and thorough research is required for factual articles, Gray reverts to general knowledge and his own interpretations.  I was looking less for essays on Dylan's songs, which weight down this compendium, and more on, say, Dylan's connections/interactions with artists that influenced him, or background on the scores of former members of Dylan's band.  Unfortunately, Gray's approach does not follow this vein.  This book seems to be a rehashing of his previously released essays and articles on Dylan.  I was also surprised and disappointed that Gray felt it necessary to put down most of the artists who have been influenced by Dylan (Springsteen, Bono, even Santana).  Rather than explore the connections Dylan has with other artists, Gray either approves of them as worthy matches for Dylan (usually the older blues muscicians) or ridicules them as rock demi-gods who could never measure up to Bobby D.  I won't be getting rid of my copy anytime soon, but I found that the Bob Dylan Encyclopedia offered nothing new and plenty that I didn't want 
 The setting of this film is in the late 70s, just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the VCR and the subsequent explosion of pornographic VHS tapes.  Burt Reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be "artistic" in his craft.  Heather Graham plays his psycho-starlet, and Mark Wahlberg plays a porn star who is....well.....let's just say, endowed.  Wahlberg's character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of. Wahlberg's character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to John Holmes, although I don't know if the film-makers would admit as much.   At any rate, he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his "package."  This hubris leads to his un-doing as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and LOTS of shady characters.  This sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie.  Well, it could have been, but all the way through there seems to be something missing.  There are times the film "seems" to try and convey a message, but I'm not really sure.     One thing I do know is that I quickly remembered why I've never cared for Wahlberg.  He has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt.   Also, I was expecting a LOT more skin than what the film delivered.  Given the context of the film, one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women.  That's simply not the case.  In the end, however, the biggest problem of this movie isn't Wahlberg or the lack of nudity.  The difficulty is that it's just plain boring.  I have more than a passing interest in the history of porn, and yet this flick failed to grab me 
 At the time this movie was made it was probably a great gimmick to release the third film in the series in 3-D (as with Jaws 3 and Friday the 13th Part 3). Also in order to make the film more 'kid-friendly', the producers shot for a PG rating totally going against the well earned R of the second film. Ok ok thats fine. I can live with the 3-D and the PG rating, but what about the film. The film itself is the real problem as it is so hum drum and mediocre. The story has a reporter who is stubborn and "refused to believe the stories" and buys the historic haunted house. Everyone else sees the spooks except him and predictable outcomes occur. The plot is just tame and predictable. There are many sub-plots that don't work too hot either, like that re-occuring "demon" thing. A lady developes a picture to find a "demon" head in it and the same demon comes out of a demonic well at the end. With the stale story and limp directing, its no wonder Amityville 3-D put the final nail in the coffin for further Amityville films not to be released theatrically.  What I found curious is that the MGM box set I got this film in states on the bottom of the box in tiny writting that "This is not a sequel to The Amityville Horror or Amityville II: The Possession". Urghh? Uh, yes it is. Just cause its the first not be based on a 'true' story doesn't make it not a sequel. It even mentions the events of the first films! Amityville 3-D was released overseas as Amityville III: The Demon and it was followed by Amityville 4: The Evil Escapes. Sounds like a sequel in my book.. 
 I do not see how reviewers can rate this guy 5 stars.   His voice is so mediocre that I am suprised he manages to sell many cd's at all.   I wouldn't waste my hard earned cash on this guy.  Stick with Sinatra and get the best.  If not, and you want someone who can sing Sinatra style, then I would recommend you listen to the young Canadian, Michael Buble. In my opinion Michael Buble is a much better singer that Tyrell.  He can swing and do justice to that genre of music 
 All you people who think this work accurately represents the historical context of the "Red Scare" really need to join the rest of us in the 21st century.  Earth to readers - the Communists were invading our government.  All this hysteria against those who sought to keep that invasion from happening is so misplaced it would be funny if it weren't so dangerous.  Try catching up with what has been learned since the 1950's.  A good place to start would be learning what the Venona Intercepts were and what they showed.  They proved conclusively that the Communists were highly infiltrated into the US State Department and that many knew they were at the time the so called "Red Scare" was taking place.  That was the reason there was so much effort put in to rooting out these influences.    Then you could read up on what was learned from the KGB archives after the fall of the Soviet Union.  All the heroes of the left like Alger Hiss and the Rosenbergs were guilty as all get out.  There is concrete evidence to back this up.   If you are one of the people still railing against the "Red Scare" you are proving you haven't learned a thing in the last 50 years.  The left in the US has so much credibility staked on these issues that many refuse to admit the obvious truth but it is the truth anyway.  Anyone who continues the hysterical crusade against those who sought to root out communism from the US government might as well be screaming that the earth really is flat.  You would be just as wrong as the members of the Flat Earth Society were when they were ignoring mountains of evidence 
 me and my partner are both real open minded people who enjoy a huge range of films. And we do really like The Thin Red Line. But this was a real boring piece of film making.....The whole film was just one huge poetry reading and I prefer to read poetry from a book.....It just doesn't goe anywhere and we found the love scenes even worse than those directed by George Lucas.Even the battle scenes were just poetry readings..........Watch Thin Red Line instead if you are interested in this director's work...That film is a masterpiece....This isn't 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 Kissing Kate was a book I could relate to. In fact, the only reason that I gave it so many stars (2) is due to the fact that I had the same experiences in my own life that the main character is this book has. The problems with this book are from cover to cover. The writing is amateur when it's at its very best. The two girls in the story need much more character development in order for their friendship to be believable and validated, which is probably the books biggest flaw. The author of the story, Lauren Myracle, did not convince me that these two girls were important to each other, although she does make a weak attempt to do just that. I found myself feeling apathetic toward the girls in this story and their inner conflicts. The final disappointment in this book came at the end, where half of my questions were left unanswered. Sometimes things are better left to one's imagination, but not EVERYTHING. Kissing Kate is a depressing book that leaves the reader feeling frusterated. Anyone who wishes to enlighten me with their review of my review may do so. Anyone else who is looking for a great story in this same genre will find one in the pages of Keeping You a Secret by Julie Ann Peters. As for Miss Myracle and her book, she should be thrown in jail for writing it, not paid. Myracle fails, miserably. 
 Now let me begin by saying I understood this book. I read it for my freshman english class, and really didn't have much trouble understanding it.   That being said, I still hated this book. It was tedious, boring, and extremely conceited. I found myself not at all caring about these characters. Homer's idea for a story was a great one, but it comes out poorly. I know it's hard to argue with classics, but I just cannot explain how awful this book really is. The author doesn't get into the charcter's minds, leaving you to fill gaps in their personality.  The explaination of travels and fight scenes is extremely boring and long. He does nothing to spice up the descriptions to make us interested. Many times I could turn three more pages and still be in the same spot. Frusterating expierence 
 Well what can I say. It is a pretty good book although she is an ultra-leftwing political conspiracy theorist. People seem to forget the Fascism is an ultra-leftist ideology while anarchism would be an ultra-right. She places too much emphesis, with distorted facts about Zionism and this "Jewish" conspiracy. If anything from the manipulation and continual twisting of facts today concerning Israel would prove exactly opposite to her position. There is more of an International Socialism/Communism or even one could argue "Theosophy" and its ideological cohorts are determined to undermined Judaism. This arguement is holds much water due to the fact that all subversive movements are based on previous Gnostic Pagan ideologies while Judaism is the only sole faith based on monotheism. Debase Judaism, the debasement of Christianity is a very easy task. I would deffinately suggest "The Rainbow Swastika"-H.Newman or "Hitler's Preistess" for a well rounded background to understand where Webster attained her vast, and contorted hatred for the Jews. As a Christian I found many of her facts in the sections "Ancient Secret Traditions","The Cabalists", "Jewish Peril" as well the section on the Talmud to be held from a traditional anti-Jewish Catholic point of view. I believe, and advocate, that if anyone truly wish to understand Cabbalah or the Talmud to walk into your local Orthodox Synagogue and ask all your questions to a learned Rabbi. In the Jewish Culture Education and teaching others, like in Christianity, is considered a blessing.  Therefor when it comes to the specifities of Jewish Theology one must go to the source, the Rabbi and the Bible. Webster bases no fact that the Jew is the only people on this planet that practice the faith Pharasee Jesus Christ had worshipped, nor does she give any account whatsoever that the entire ethical, values and moral system and the belief in one G0d in the Christian West is solely due to the Jew. I believe that any individual above  the mere minimum level of intellect would knowledge themselves to the long history of anti-semitism. This World Jewish Conspiracy is a fraud. Israel is a State therefor Zionism is technically no more. The book is very interesting although it is very clear that she dismisses Communism and the Power Elite in Britian and America: Round Table Group and the forerunners to the Council on Foreign Relations (see "Fabian Freeway" - R. Martin.  Looking back one can accurately see that Webster's insight was misguided but I must admit that for her day, one might actually believe her work, due to the 1920's the Protocols were in full swing, Pogroms, the Dreyfus Affair, Revolutions. It is too bad that Carnagee, Ford, Rockefeller (CFR) and most of the elite are not Jews. Nor are they Christians or even Muslims. A Christian believes in Jesus, A Jew believes in G0d, A Muslim believes in Mohammed and their god Allah. These power elites are gnostic or G-dless at best. It is a very interesting read but very obvious written with an agenda to further the Jew as the traditional evil in a Protocolist, anti-Semitic Europe 
 This book starts out pretty good, with interesting illustrations to the concepts and ideas put forth (the milestone concept is very good), but pretty soon it becomes no more than a directed Bible study with Scriptural quotations trying to relate friendship with the church and how we all should be united. Very VERY disappointing. I was looking for some analysis of the importance of masculine friendship through an educated Christian perspective, and while some stories he uses are great, all I got was another glorified Bible study. Big let down.. 
 If you just read the lines a Devil Regiment responsible for killing millions. This is not an history book, is written in with words and qualifications that the writer has not a clue about. A good historian cant classify something without putting a single proof on the book. Its the same someone publishes a book about the US Air Force and puts, the devil US army killed millions with the Atom Bomb or how the RAF bombed german cities. Thats not history. If someone wants to put his personal ideas on a book then he should put the same comments for both the winner and losers of a war.Its doesnt mention a single good point of the SS and its full of errors. This isnt the best guide for the SS since it left tons of info outside the book 
 This is a piece of junk!!!! The beater inside broke while making the first batch of ice cream and the ice cream hadn't even frozen totally 
 A dear friend recommended this book to us. Upon receipt I immediately turned to the section on pregnancy and birth control as I am an avid supporter of the protection of the unborn babies in our world. I was HORRIBLY dissapointed at the presentaiton of the material in this section. This is supposed to be a 'Christian' book yet they used terms like 'fertilized egg' instead of baby to explain the way that birth control pills can prevent the implantation of a baby into the womans womb. They even say that if that occured it wouldn't be an abortion of a baby. Any basic sex ed class teaches that fertilization occurs BEFORE the egg reaches the womb; actually occuring in the fallopian tubes. Needless to say I CANNOT recommend this book for any person seeking Biblical teaching on planning a family. "Children are a reward from the Lord" and "Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them" Psalms 
 Pastoralia is only a forgettable book when compared to the vast majority of works being published nowadays, but is a huge disappointment when compared with Saunders' debut novel, Civilwarland in Bad Decline. Only one short story from Pastoralia -- Sea Oak -- lives up to the Civilwarland's originative creativity. Those who build Pastorlia up into something of an esteemed work are followers of hero-worship, not followers of good satire 
 I've seen a number of books that make all sorts of preposterous claims in order to promote some arbitrary agenda. However, this silly and absurd book doesn't even do that.  It has nothing to offer anyone.  I didn't have any preconceived demands on this book.  I didn't need it to say something like:  ... We Women hold up our half of the sky.  And more.  But in monotheistic society, we've been doing two thirds of the work.  And having only one third of the fun.  Moreover, this unnatural, patriarchal monotheism has made tyrannical religious demands upon us.  That's not how we lived in the past.  We can and should return to Paganism and a more natural and cooperative society which cherishes and values everyone. ...  Of course, had it said that and defended it with a modicum of clarity, I'd have applauded it and given it five stars.  But suppose it had merely looked at the overall problem of the role of Women in human society.  Something like:  ... There are differences between the roles of Women and Men.  The Women bear the children.  The Women nurse the children.  While both Women and Men have a big role in raising children, these roles are not exactly the same.  In addition, the Men are generally stronger than the Women.  One major societal problem is that Women tend to work harder to help their own children than they do to help the children of others.  And Men tend to work harder to help their children than they do to help the children of others.  But Women generally know which children are theirs while Men aren't always so sure.  Here's how some societies have dealt with these issues, and how a few societies, including our own, have gone astray.  And here is how we can make things better.  ...  Well, that would have been okay too.  And it would have been heading for five stars as well.  But this book didn't do anything of the sort.  Instead, it simply wandered all over the map.  There were plenty of factually dubious statements and poor logic that obliterated any possible flow of argument.  And there never seemed to be a point to it: almost nothing in the book seemed relevant to any possible thesis.  It was frustrating.  I doubt that I have ever read a less coherent book.  If you must read "The Chalice and the Blade," try the one by Glenna McReynolds 
 I have been reading this book out loud to my BF, who now worships Dr. Gray as it should be titled, "Why women should give men sex all the time".   Dr. Gray actually lists why we should give our man a quickie when we really don't want to, don't have time or are tired. He even says we should give a hand job when we have a bad headache!!! Men, if your woman has a headache, run her a warm bubble bath, light some candles, give her a massage and you'll increase your chances of getting some!   He also states that at certain times of the month many women don't feel the need to have an orgasm. I know LOTS of women and none of them will tell you orgasms are not important! Yes, sometime I will give my man a quickie and not worry about my orgasm, but that is totally up to me, NOT DR. GRAY.  He also states it's ok to look at other women in front of us as long as our men tell us they love us. Gee, not enough beautiful women on TV, billboards and magazines to look at when we're not around? I don't drool over other men when my man is around because I RESPECT him. If more couples respected each other they would have less trouble.  He has some good tips like men need to spend more time on foreplay, complimenting your woman, but I am on page 88 out of 206 and it has been overwhelmingly biased toward giving men what they want all the time and apparently at all costs 
 Captain Alatriste is the first in a series and, like a lot of series, you're really rooting for it to be a barnburner so you can go right out and buy the next one and then wait breathlessly for the one after that.  Unfortunately, this is not the case with Captain Alatriste.  The problem is that there isn't enough of Captain Alatriste in Captain Alatriste.  It's told through his own Sancho Panza, Inigo, his steady sidekick, who has stories of his own to tell.  But those stories only distract from the main story, which is paper thin to begin with.  Throw in a lot of songs and poems and you've got a sleepy reader 
 Fukuyama trots out stereotypes that he must have picked up at his Japanese-Protestant father's knee, under a thick veneer of impenetrable sociological jargon that can fool the occasional reader into believing that this is an impartial scientist at work. Like all stereotypes, Fukuyama's are a blend of breathtaking overgeneralizations, and huge blind spots. And, like all stereotypes, they are utter nonsense.  The book attempts to update Max Weber's "Protestant ethic" story to include some non-Christian societies. The basic argument of the book is that Catholics are unable to trust people outside their immediate family, and so unable to form associations that are not based on family ties. The same is true of the Chinese, claims Fukuyama. These are the Catholics of the Orient.   The Japanese and Protestants are able to transcend family ties and therefore form a vast range of associations that do not have a genetic basis, especially large professionally managed corporations.   The feckless Catholics and Chinese however are doomed to form business enterprises that can never be more than over-grown Mom and Pop operations. Fukuyama therefore has a gloomy prognosis for the economic miracles of China or Taiwan or Singapore--however brilliant a businessman Pop may be, sooner or later descendants like Paris Hilton will be running the show.  There is an interesting chapter on Korea, where Fukuyama is at pains to show that however like wannabe Japanese/Protestants Korean business organizations may seem, they are really Chinese/Catholic at heart.  The book's thesis is obvious nonsense. Dramatic counter-examples exist, such as the Chinese Communist Party or the Jesuits. Also, the broad idea that Catholicism or Chinese-ness contributes to poverty lacks a statistical basis.   I saw a recent article about thousands of Japanese orphans in China who were taken in and looked after by Chinese families after Japan's World War II defeat. Rather surprising behavior in this "low-trust" society! Perhaps these Chinese had been somewhat civilized by the high-trust ways of the occupying Japanese 
 Wheatley taps into an interesting view regarding the way organizations should be run. The ideas and concepts are interesting but the writing style is close to unbearable. It took days to read because I was constantly  falling asleep 
 This is the worst movie that was ever made. I'd rather move to Paris and hang out in cafes debating French politics than watch this movie again. It is so bad that it's not worth watching just out of a sense of morbid curiosity-- it is disappointing from every angle. In this case the word bad means world-class egregious waste of otherwise perfectly good blank film. I can't even force myself to describe the movie, it's not worth the effort. I don't like thinking about the movie as I write this. What I'm really concerned about are the people here who somehow found any kind of entertainment value from this movie. Are they nuts, or just the products of our modern, mindless universities? Someone needs to tell them it's time for their medicine and to stay off the Internet 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 The premise was unbelievable.   I could care less about the characters. It was a hard, long slog to finish.  It was as if the author was filling space by looking at a map to give us some place names to sound authentic.  Fred mailed this one in. (American slang.)  "The Faithful Spy" is close to the same premise and about ten times better 
 I had expected an insightful analysis of the motivations behind modern terrorism. Instead I got a diatribe against western liberalism. Lee Harris is the poster child for the modern John Birchers, people who believe our way is not only the best way, its the only way. In an increasingly global economic and political system, his view of the world can be said to be outmoded, at best quaint, at worst pathological for if we are truely to address the problems facing humanity over the next 100 years, we will need tolerance and inclusivness. 
 I can usually enjoy Diana Palmer's stories but why do they always have to include the innocent virgin and the arrogant male?  This makes it a little too unrealistic.  As the other reviewers stated, this book has way too much going on and not enough interaction with the main characters 
 Ms. Mayes puts her nose in the air about tourists - and what does she think she is except a tourist with a little more time for her travels than most of the rest of us?  Got news for you, Ms. Mayes - just because you can spend a month in a country when most of the rest of us have a week or 10 days doesn't make you any less a tourist.  And your sneers at your fellow/sister Americans aren't going to win you any more readers in the long run.  On second thought, this level of snotty self-satisfaction and loathing for America and Americans is what I guess I expect from academics these days. 
 This movie was AWESOME!  Ben Stiller is a comic GENIUS, he's the new Jerry Lewis!  DeNiro, AWESOME!  Hoffman, AWESOME!  Streisand, AWESOME and still very sexy for an old liberal ho!  I thought the sight gags were priceless, and the plot line serene!  This was Hollywood movie watching heaven!  This film should have won some Academy Awards!  I mean if Marisa Torme can win for My Cousin Vinnie, these A-1 actors should've at least been nominated!  This is a highly entertaining film, and I recommend it to every and anyone to see, but wear your Depends, because you might pee yourself from laughing so hard!  Dubya 99, you don't know what in the FRIGGIN' H E L L you're talking about!  Yeah like we're suppose to take the opinion of an anti-social loser, that complains about going out to the movies?  Stay home, I'm sure Dateline NBC will be calling soon about that episode they had recently

 I have long been hoping to find the ONE career book that will point me in the write direction of finding the career that I want out of life.  I'm coming to believe that these books are mostly a waste of money.  This book contains a personality test that is not unlike any other career assessment test that you can take online, for FREE.  It then contains a boat load of charts...50 highest paying jobs for this personality type....50 jobs for this personality type with the highest amount of women/men employed...ect ect.  If this sort of thing interests you then by all means this book might be for you.  Most of the book however is a list of different jobs for the different personality types that contains descriptions, experience/education needed, related job, ect but it is all on a VERY BASIC level.  Save your money and speak with a career counsler 
 I replaced the antenna on my DI-624 router. I am able to extend the antenna 4-5 ft from the base. But I don't see any signal improvement on my laptop or desktop that's on wifi 
 I recommend you not buy this book or cd.  I listened to the CD and it was too elementary 
 Any book by Damodaran is far better for business managers and portfolio managers.  For portfolio managers, estimating the cash-flows is a small part of the valuation process, the easiest. As the financial field and practice is becoming more and more quantitative, the cutting edge of asset pricing is to estimate time-varying risk premiums. Actually, almost 90% of variation in stock prices come from risk shifts, not from news on company cash-flows.   If you are interested in asset pricing i would suggest a mix of damodaran (20%) and "Asset Pricing" by John Cochrane (80%) 
 Despite what T. Smith (another reviewer) states, Jesus was under no vegetarian obligation.  God has made multiple covenants with his followers, and in each covenant the previous one was replaced.  Thus post-Noah followers could eat meat, and post-Jesus followers had no obligation to be kosher.  Which brings me to my main point: why should one feel any significance in eating what Jesus ate?  He was still obligated to follow the kosher rules of Deuteronomy, while modern day Christians are not.  If the book is kosher, it need not be, and if it isn't, it can't possibly contain what Jesus ate.  Jesus was kosher.  Basically, this is a pretty stupid premise for a book.  Eat what you want - God won't care

 I purchased Eldredge's "Wild at Heart", and I didn't think it was scripturally sound. I was given "Waking the Dead" as a present, so I tried to read it as well. I finally gave it up.   John Eldredge's writing is typical of today's movement to bring the world into the church. Trying to show a young Christian the religious aspects of movies like "The Matrix" may work, but to my 48 year old ears it rings very hollow. Perhaps it boils down to how much you will dilute Christ's message to get people to listen. For better or worse, I have little patience for it.   The author also presents the image of God as "my friend". To me this is nothing but another watering down of the Gospel message to get the world to accept it. Giving the Creator human attributes brings Him down to a level where we can work things out between us. I can't find that kind of relationship in any legitimate Bible translation. After all, my friend wouldn't let my saintly mother die, and save a worthless drug addict now would he? God my friend probably wouldn't have sent His Son to die for my worthless self anyway.   This is exactly the same theology as building the largest "Christian" church in the United States, and not putting any crosses in it so as not to "offend anyone". It's the same as getting on a nationally televised program, and stuttering about whether you believe those who don't accept Christ are doomed to hell. When you profess to be a Christian minister or author and you can't speak correctly of what Christianity teaches, it's time to examine just what you really believe. God's word is not always easy to swallow. Either it's the truth or it isn't.   Mr. Eldredge also speaks often of "setting hearts free". While I do believe hearts are free when released from sin, a Christian is bought and paid for with Christ's blood and not "free" at all. Titus 1 (KJ) begins, "Paul, a servant of God,and an apostle of Jesus Christ"...Christians ARE freed, but to begin a life of service.   For a more accurate and fulfilling study, I recommend "The Way of the Master" books and videos by Ray Comfort/Kirk Cameron.  
 I recently read "I", "K", and "L" in succession.  Compared to "Innocent" and "Killer", I found Lawless to be slow paced (even though this edition finds Kinsey spontaneously traveling across the country) and the plot twists less surprising.  With others I've read in the series, I am usually hooked relatively early in the story line.  I was 1/3 of the way through this iteration before becoming mildly interested in the outcome.  Even the subplots were not overly attention grabbing (Kinsey has little contact with immediate family, ergo she substitutes others in her life--Henry, Rosie, Pitt family, the criminal elements in this book--as her family...).  I also found it hard to believe that some of the characters that appear in "L" could be so dim-witted on one page, and great possessors of vast knowledge with incredible powers of deduction on the next.  Anyway, there are others in this series I would recommend more highly ("M" being one of them) 
 I've had other digital cameras but this is the first one I've had problems with. I started getting a Zoom lens error shortly after I bought it but it would clear if I turned it off then back on. It is now unusable as the lens can not be retracted at all. It lasted 18 months 
 This book stinks. It's filled with a little of everything but not enough of the right information. Pass... if you really want to see the book check it out of the library and save the money 
 The message of this book is simple: if you want to run better, simply run like Haile Gebr. Of course, there's no hint as to how to run like Gebr, but there are pretty pictures and oodles of "ideas" which totally lack any sort of flesh. The book is sporadic, repetitive and offers no useful examples. The concept of a new, almost holistic approach to running is interesting, but almost completely unexplored after the introduction.  I've attempted many of the techniques and found my running to quickly become less enjoyable, more labored and a lot slower. I'm an advanced runner and found only a handful of quotes to be useful. I see almost no purpose at all for a novice runner to read between these covers 
 Wow- Laughable.  What's funny is that some of the things they say are true- but they make them sound so bad. LOL  For example we are setting up to take over the government.  The true belief is that someday Christ is going to come again and create his own perfect government.  That's not the "mormon's" government- that's Christ's government.  There is also the worry about so many LDS people involved in the CIA and FBI.  Do you know why that is?  It's because LDS people are honest and have good language skills (Often from serving as missionaries in foreign countries).  The government knows that if they want to hire people who are the most moral and honest- then they should hire a good LDS person.   As far as the money is concerned- do you know what it is used for?  People involved in the LDS church do not get paid for their services.  The Bishop of your local LDS church does not get a salary or any kind of bonuses.  The money goes to build up the church by putting chapels in places where there are none, to providing food for the poor and clothing for the needy, for helping people in catastrophes (such as Hurricane Katrina and the tsunami in Asia), and for building religious buildings (such as temples) and providing a religious education (like for the students at BYU).   If I am wrong for loving my fellow-man, keeping my body clean (no alcohol, tobacco or pre-marital sex), and loving Christ and God, then I don't want to be right. If Hell is full of "Mormons" then it's probably not too bad of a place- because most of the Mormons I know are pretty darn nice people and have pretty darn good values.  LOL Read this book for it's ridiculousness, not for it's true content.   Someone commented that it doesn't make sense to ask someone about their own beliefs because they will give a biased review.  Well if I want to know the truth about my neighbor- should I ask their enemy?  It goes both ways.  I say read this book if you want to- but you should also read a pro-'Mormon' book and then judge for yourself what is truth and what is fiction. As an LDS woman I do not feel repressed, I do not feel like I have been brain-washed, and I do not feel like I am missing out on "truth."  I know that I have the truth in my life and I could not be happier.  I know I will be with my family forever in paradise if I live the word of the Lord and I know that God loves each of us with all of his heart- even the author of this book who is very misguided 
 I was waiting to get into ths book...then I realized I was halfway thru it.  I always stick with Berg...you never know when you'll get hooked.  But this one did not have it...I was relieved when it ended 
 It may be inspirational and it brings tears of joy to my eyes, but hey, what about the "what's" and "how's"? Empty 
 Although I found the magazine itself to be interesting and colorful, with a good series of articles on marriage and relationships, I found that customer service was very dissapointing. I missed an issue back in October, and have contacted customer service 3 times to have them resend the issue I missed. It is now March, and I still haven't received my replacement. Just a heads up! 
 This book would be more for pretty inexperienced horse people just starting out.  I was hoping to find more on arenas and footing and things like that since I already have a barn and horse property and have had horses all my life but never built my own arena.  It was too basic for me 
 (...)  Tarentino's films are universally and fundamentally boring for anyone who has ever lived a real life and not just fantasized about having one.  His dipictions of violence eminate from his own personal lack of sexual energy.  Sadly, teenage males without girlfriends seem to like these slammed together video games that are being called brilliant, and continue to support the trash factory that generates this type of hyper garbage.  (... 
 This book was published back in the 70s, before the advent of LaTeX. And it shows. In particular, it is no good as a reference for this reason: each time you try to look something up, the page is too overcrowded with symbols to find what you're looking for. In addition, to use this book to learn stochastic processes puts you through a whole lot more trouble than you'll probably need. Each deduction in the book is long, boring, and hard. Since I've read other books which are not, I'm going to assume it's the fault of the authors and their lack of LaTeX.  This book, not unlike quite a few in probability and statistics (e.g. Billingsley), is popular because old professors used it and don't bother to find a new one 
 I think this book was probably very helpful a couple years ago. And there's still some good information here. But the web is changing so fast that a lot of their guidelines and "patterns" just don't apply (i.e. they encourage you to use popup windows).  Wait until they revise the book before you spend the dough. Oh, and the website they refer you to for updates is an embarrasment 
 Here is another example of a good Commodities writer attempting to write about Day Trading Stocks. No only does he fail in this attempt but he has the nerve to criticize other writers. It is clear from the time periods of the charts (ten minuets) and the lack of discussion of NASDAQ level 2 that Jake is way out of his field. When will the pure commodity writers learn not to try and cash in on the interest in stocks? Fools rush in. Save your money.I returned the book 
 Peter David's latest New Frontier novel is sadly the worst of the series.  Like DS9's only hardcover "Warped", this much-  anticipated tome was very poor both in prose style and plot. It was actually painful to read for its many fannish and cutesy phrases. I was an avid follower of the New Frontier  series and even created the web's most elaborate New Frontier website, but after this latest book I may remove the site. The characters of Shelby and Calhoun are supposed to be senior Starfleet officers, but they act like regular folks "just like you and me." If a book were written in which the captain of a modern Naval vessel talked and acted like Shelby does in this book, it would be high-camp. That example is exactly what Gene Roddenberry encouraged prospective Trek writers to do in 1966 - imagine the story and dialogue in modern times. Also, the words spoken by all of the characters in this latest New Frontier novel are so colloquial, that it is hard to believe that the adventures are supposedly happening in the future.  If the distracting prose weren't enough, the book's two plots were far too thin and uninteresting to warrant a full novel, yet alone a hardcover. I am also tired of every other chapter flipping back and forth between the two sub-stories. This clever little device to force some suspense only irritates. The Calhoun "western" sub-plot, rather than being akin to "High Noon" is more in the vein of a bad episode of television's "The Rifleman." Finally, the "big" enemy that Calhoun must face is a petty bureaucrat and an out-of-town gunslinger whose desire to kill Calhoun is painted in such broad strokes that one recalls the days of watching Saturday morning western serials - the bad ones, I mean. I sure hope the next book is better.  I suggest you save your money and I recommend instead any Star Trek book by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, William Shatner  and also the excellent DS9 novel "A Stitch in Time" by Andrew (Garak) Robinson 
 A monster book of 641 pages. Proof that Eco's editor was already dead, or the book killed him. It is filled with lots of esoteric knowledge and history. Be advised that the translator, William Weaver, does not translate the chapter headings, nor the majority of foreign dialogue. Is he assuming that we read French, or would want to? The inclusion of 8 drawings does not advance the story and you wonder why they were included. They are there possibly solely to annoy the reader. Eco makes the reader feel uneducated by using words and terms no one ever heard before, let alone want to use. And the story suddenly becomes the Italian version of John Knowles' "A Separate Peace." And with this transformation: The hunt for "The Plan" or the Templars' Secret," is just a red herring, the story is not about these long dead French knights. As Eco uses 1960-70's LSD induced stream of consciousness writing style for the last 60 pages, he leads his main character to the Zen-Tao-I Ching conclusion that watching his friend be murdered is all for the best. Perhaps Eco should take his own character's advice and "Ma gavte la nata," and take the cork out 
 I was surprised to find this book not only still in print, but enthusiastically reviewed by so many who obviously take it seriously.  For those willing to do a little background research into Casteneda and his subject matter it will quickly become apparent that the events detailed in 'The Teachings' did not, and could not have occurred as described.  Space prevents me going into detail here, but I have a review on my website at:  http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/redcrow/CTOMBS/Articles/Castanedax.ht 
 If you just read the lines a Devil Regiment responsible for killing millions. This is not an history book, is written in with words and qualifications that the writer has not a clue about. A good historian cant classify something without putting a single proof on the book. Its the same someone publishes a book about the US Air Force and puts, the devil US army killed millions with the Atom Bomb or how the RAF bombed german cities. Thats not history. If someone wants to put his personal ideas on a book then he should put the same comments for both the winner and losers of a war.Its doesnt mention a single good point of the SS and its full of errors. This isnt the best guide for the SS since it left tons of info outside the book 
 As a coach myself, I was interested in Michael Lewis's thoughts and feelings about his former youth baseball coach, Coach Fitz.   Was Fitz a positive impact on his life?  Michael says so, but I struggled to understand why.  Here was a coach who apparently believed in him by putting him in the game to pitch in a crucial situation.  Or maybe the only reason he entered the game was because Fitz accidentally visited the star pitcher twice in the same inning and so was compelled to take the star out and put Michael in.    Fitz was an intense coach and apparently was able to convince his team (at least back in the 70's) that hard work could pay off.  I guess this was one of the "Lessons on the Game of Life".  Coach Fitz said he cared about the kids but it wasn't clear from any of the stories that any of the kids thought the coach cared about them.   Maybe the truth is that Coach Fitz was most concerned about winning.  The author remembers most clearly all the things Fitz broke in the locker room after losses.  Coach Fitz would walk home after losses to punish himself for the players sins.  The players were not allowed to wash their jerseys until they won.  I guess they weren't being the best they could be until they scored more runs than their opponent.  Winning was also more important to Coach Fitz than following the rules, as he apparently encouraged the author to throw illegal "spitballs".    For coaches looking for coaching models, I recommend NFHS Coaches' Quarterly 
 This doll highchair is junk. It has been put together less than 24 hours and had one dolly in it and it is no longer useable. The tray has fallen off from both sides. The seat fabric is just that a piece of fabric stapled on and it looks tacky, but never mind that the lace trim is shredding into shambles. It has come unsewn. It was only six inches of sewing and that couldn't last. I did give it two stars for education value. I have learned that I probably won't purchase this brand of doll toys. I tried to get my daughter and each grand daughter a different kind of series of dolly thing but I think I will stick with Zapf brand and some will just have duplicates. My poor grand daughter got the short end of the stick her birthday present was a flop. Sheril 
 This book was not at all what I was expecting. I decided to read it because the popular economist, John Mauldin, kept praising it in his weekly "Thoughts From the Frontline" column. I imagine many other readers have stumbled upon Bonner's book via Mauldin's column.  However, in my humble opinion, this book doesn't deliver. Another book Mauldin has recommended is Gave-Kal's "Brave New World," but where "Brave New World" uses statistics and charts and logic to make a point, this one use flowery rhetoric, demagoguery, and historical comparisons to assert that the US is headed for a fall.  While I'm in the bearish camp and I would tend to agree that the reckless political and fiscal policies of the US have gotten the country into a pickle, this is not the book to explain how or why that is happening. (Unless, perhaps, you're the type of person who enjoys trying to extract meaning from tea leaves at the bottom of a cup.) Where I was looking for cold hard facts, statistics, charts and real data to help me peer under the hood of the mighty US economy, this book gave me flowery language and dramatic rhetoric. Economics can be dry stuff, so maybe some readers will find this style of writing to be a "breath of fresh air," but I, for one, was disappointed 
 You can waste your time reading this book, sure. Go ahead. Or, you can pick up Henry Hazlitt's "The Failure of the New Economics: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies" and watch as an infinitely more talented writer debunks and destroys Keynes and his faulty logic. Not only does he translate the thoroughly unreadable Keynes, he shows the reader multiple instances where Keynes simply contradicts himself, yet keeps right on chuggin' (savings = investments; somehow in his General Theory, Keynes manages to both prove and disprove this). He explains in lucid terms that Keynes "General Theory" isn't "General" at all; in fact, it can only be applied correctly in static situations. In most cases it can't account at all for dynamics. Don't waste your time on this piece of socialist garbage 
 ...this book is very poorly written.  The author seems to be trying to capitalize on the success of Dava Sobel's "Galileo's Daughter," trying to interweave the personal life, scientific work, and the political and religious aspects of Kepler.  Instead, each of these aspects are discussed, but they seem to have very little interconnection.  Many reviewers complain, rightly, that the writing is repetitive and chaotic; it seems like two books interspliced: one about the political and religious history of Germany and Austria (over the period of Kepler's life), and another about Kepler.  But other than covering the same time period, these stories are unrelated.  In addition to being poorly contructed, the book features prose that is often distractingly awkward.  Although I got a lot out of this book, there seems to be little, if any, original scholarship.  The notes are also fairly sparse, and it is tough to tell the pure speculation from the loosely-documented conjecture from the established history.  I would dearly like to read a book that tackles the connections between Kepler's religious views, his personal life, the politics of the Counter-Reformation, and his work.  This book simply talks about each of these, without relating them.  This is most unfortunate, as the publication of this will probably make any future books about the same subject much more difficult to publish.  On the plus side, the book has nice illustrations, a beautiful cover, and is well-bound 
 these clubs are a waste of money.  The graphite shafts from cougar in a senior flex that is way uncontrollable unless u are 75.  My 8 iron broke the first time i hit it.  The bag is falling apart.  Save ur money and buy a quality set of clubs.  U can get some clone clubs that will last years and u'll play twice as better for just a tad more 
  Reading Dark Harbor is like watching a mediocre TV show that you can't be bothered to turn off. I listened to Dark Harbor as an audio book, so I don't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because I `read it' while I was doing other things that had to be done anyway, like driving.   If you are looking for something that feels fresh and new - Dark Harbor is not for you. This novel is about as innovative as an episode of Murder She Wrote. To illustrate: Stone Barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim's wrong hand. (I think I actually saw that one on Murder She Wrote) Woods either can't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply doesn't care.   It is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in Dark Harbor. This isn't because the clues come together in any logical way, but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel. You can just tell. This doesn't mean that the solution makes sense. In fact, there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced.   It is as if Woods couldn't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through. Woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do (except of course, to have sex with Stone). Holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island. On her second trip she has an obligatory romp with Stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel.   Why was she kidnapped? I don't think anyone - including Woods - can answer that question in any plausible way. My theory is that Woods needed to work Holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages. It also allowed him to include Holly's dad (another regular character) in her search. Wood's motive seems obvious. The kidnapper's motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense. But clearly this was something Woods didn't think was worth worrying about.   The best I can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read (of course, in my case it was read to me). It may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read (and certainly not to buy) - but as an audio book from the library (with a limited selection of audio books to choose from) it helped me pass the time in traffic.   
 Good book. However,  it can be a lot better.   Pros:  Good recommendation on posing and lighting. He also talks about things you have to look for when shooting a wedding. He provides you a list of all the important shoots you must take for a wedding.   Cons: Today you may find this book out of date. He talks about film photography and shooting Polaroid's to make sure the image is in correct exposure.  There are some pictures that are great samples and other ones that are terrible and embarrassing to show it on a photo book. there are some recommendations that I don't I agree with. For example he recommends using 1000 ISO. if so, pictures will look grainy in film and high color noise in digital. He recommends no to shoot with flash at churches even if they let you use a flash. NO WAY!!.  His sample pictures looks grainy and terrible because he didn't use a flash.    The bottom line is:  Intermediate and professionals may want to avoid this one.  Beginners good to have it for posing recommendations, lighting, and a shooting list 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 Without doubt the book is well written and the authors do an amazing job of using "smoke and mirrors" to convince readers that their analysis of the criminal justice system is true and factual. However, I have never seen a more perfect example of an author intentionally manipulating data and statistics to support his or her opinion.   Besides the clear political bias of the author, there are even a number of blatant factual errors. For example, look hard enough and you will find that the same exact bar graph is erroneously used twice in the book for two entirely different studies.   This is NOT a history book. Nor should it be used as such. It has a very clear purpose and that is to demonize conservatives and those who are "tough on crime" 
 Oh Helen Gibb...what happened? I would highly recommend all 3 of her other books. I use them all the time for ideas and inspiration and they all teach something different. But this book didn't teach me anything I didn't already know. The front cover is the only design that I hadn't seen in any other Helen Gibb books. And of course this book shows you how to do that technique. But my first and best ribbon flower book is The Artful Ribbon, and it has the same technique in it only more variations of it. This book has a few bridal type ideas and other projects but it is seriously lacking all those beautiful vintage examples of fabulous creations that all the other Helen Gibb books have. It has some but not what I'm used to with the other books. It just seems to me that this book was cranked out in a hurry and I was very disappointed with it. I'm really considering sending it back. 
 I bought this book the day it came out.  Dennis Lehane is one of my top 5 favorite authors.  What a letdown.  He is so talented I will buy his next book the day that it comes out, however this one does not showcase his talent.  
 Unlike most others who have posted here, I didn't like Ian's Walk. I found that the story spent a lot of time highlighting how different Ian was from other kids and completely ignored anything he might have in common with his sisters. I was uncomfortable with the author's decision to state Ian's autistic tendencies in such an outright way, since clearly everyone's experience with autism is difference. I walked away from this book, thinking we could have another Rain Man catastrophe on our hands. Everyone watched that movie and figured that they understood autism, when they really just knew about one fictional man with autism 
 Sullum attempts to "demolish" the argument that second-hand smoke is dangerous.  Unfortunately, he must have been too lazy to take a ten minute look at medline and the abstracts from over twenty papers that  have been published over the past five years explicitly showing that  second-hand smoke increases tumor prevalence 2-3 fold in mice, drastically  increases asthma in children of smokers, increases the risk of stroke to  non-smokers by as much as 80%, etc.  I am a libertarian on almost every  issue myself, but I draw the line on issues where one free individual's  actions directly harm another free individual, whether that be with a gun,  a baseball bat, or a lit cigarette 
 I love Dr. Rosenfield, but this is a useless book. Sorry, doc 
 I bought this book hoping for a Christian perspective on the Christian-themed The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown.  What I paid for is unabashed preaching on how the Gospel can be spread through never re-interpretting or revisiting the collection of stories called the Bible.    These two theological scholars don't add any additional light to Brown's story nor do they actually show proof that the DaVinci Code couldn't have been true (which, in fact, I agree that most of Brown's work is fictional interpretation.)   It seems like another opportunity for Christians to talk to themselves and reinforce a narrow viewpoint through villianizing the "mass media" and the general population.  Pure back-patting fluff 
 In today's world, various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism. These forms of parochialism may be ethnic, "cultural," religious, nationalistic, etc., depending on where you look. On one hand, ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups; on the other hand, multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace.  Example: the Turks and the Armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict ("Jihad" is Barber's label for this); yet they see the same Pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local Pepsi bottling plants ("McWorld" is Barber's label for this).  That's the book.   This might be a useful resource for writers of term papers who need to endnote something fairly obvious. Outside of that, it would take an observer from another planet to find this book's insights novel or pointed. If you're new to planet Earth, by all means pick up a copy. It will catch you up on a few useful truisms.  As others have pointed out, the "terrorism's challenge to democracy" subtitle seems intended to capitalize on 9/11, but doesn't accurately reflect the book's content. "Jihad" is deployed as a synecdoche in this book; Muslim extremism is just one of the book's many examples of parochialism

Sun Myung Moon was dubbed the king of peace at a coronation ceremony in the Dirksen Senate Office Building attended by several members of Congress.   Moon is the founder of the Unification Church - currently known as The Family Federation for World Peace and Unification.

 Don't play this CD on your PC, it does something that screws up the operating system.  I had to re-install Windows  :-( 
 That should have been the title of the book. I was really disappointed. There was very little about Grace O'Mally, and more about what she did on her vacation.  I really didn't care why she changed her name or where she stayed or that she got sick and couldn't go row-boating. I just wanted to know about women's roles at sea, which she did cover a bit, but she could have done in a 100 page paperback instead 
 Altough Yafa does include a few useful tidbits of information, his malice for and bias against the cotton industry ultimately precludes this book as a good source for useful information. Yafa's bias renders his judgement suspect, and what could have been a fascinating tale becomes yet another piece of propaganda. 
 Jethro Creighton is living in the time of the Civil war.  It is just about to start and he is excited.  Jethro and his family live in southern Illinois.  So they live in a union state and have a union family.  All of Jethro's brothers go into the war, and also his cousin.  His brother John and Tom, and also his cousin Eb, go to fight for the union.  However, his brother Bill makes a decision to fight with the confederacy.  Jethro respects his decision and still loves him.  While a lot of his family is out at war, Jethro is still at home and expected to work even harder out on the farm.  All day he works in the heat, but he doesn't mind it so much.  But things start going wrong.  His brother Tom is killed in battle, it is very sad.  While that happened, some of the men in the down are very angry that Bill went to the confederacy.  They call him a traitor and said he deserted the union.  Then they start taking action for it and start tormenting the Creighton's.  After countless things they end up burning the Creighton's house down.  Then Jethro finds Eb, he had deserted the union army.  Jethro wrote a letter to President Lincoln to see what he needs to do.  Jethro doesn't tell the family cause he doesn't want anyone to get in trouble.  Later the war ends and Jethro gets his education.  This book was ok, not the greatest I have ever read.  There were things about it that I liked and there were things that I didn't like so much.  I liked how it showed what war is really like. It showed that enemies aren't always your enemies. What I didn't like is that it was sort of boring.  This book showed what war is really like.  Sometimes people actually want to go into war.  They do not see what it is really like. It's really hard to imagine what it is really like.  At the begging of the book Jethro is excited about it, he thinks that it will be fun, cool, and interesting.  Later on in the book he figures out that it is none of those.  He realizes that war is horror, filled with pain and sorrow.  His brother dies; he doesn't even know how any of the other ones are doing.  This portrays the way war is in a great way.   This book showed that your enemies aren't always really your enemies.  A lot of them can actually be your friend, even if you don't know it.  In this book there is a family that has a bad reputation.  The son of the man who started the bad reputation killed Jethro's sister accidentally.  But then Jethro goes on a ride with the father.  He is frightened but then the man saves Jethro from people that want to hurt him, so really he is his friend.  Also, even though some of Jethro's brothers are fighting each other, they aren't really enemies; they all still love each other.  	This book was sort of boring.  Though many things happen in it it's hard to stay with it.  There isn't too much action that you actually read about.  You hear about things that happen but you never get to read like you were there.  Such as all the battles, you just read about what happened, not as if you were there.  This book was alright.  I'm not sure I would read a sequel if it had one.  There were just things about it that were good and some bad features also.  I would recommend this book to people who like reading a lot and don't care if there is action or suspense in a book.  -J. Hamilto 
 I found out that there isn't any difference with Adkins for Life from the first book.  Disappointing,  I tried both with a group of folks from work and we all have had the same results.  However, I never support anything unless I have been convinced it truly does what it says and I found that with "the average joes diet."  A friend told me about it and I was always considered the fat girl.  No longer! and it's stayed off. 
 A man who should be tried for war crimes is not the right person to be writing a book on diplomacy. If anyone wants to know why the U.S. gets such a bad rep from the rest of the world, they should study the crimes committed by this self-named diplomat. On September 11th, 1973 Kissinger had the democratically elected President of Chile assassinated and the Chilean people had to endure the rule of Augusto Pinochet. Pinochet now faces corruption charges, is responsible for--at a conservative estimate-- 3,000 deaths (according to BBC), and tortured many more during his brutal regime. The fact that the Twin Towers were targeted on September 11th is not a coincidence. Thank you, Mr. Kissinger. We can see how far your diplomacy has improved the state of the world 
 I love Tye Tribbett & GA.  They did a wonderful job on Victory.  Not sure about much of the material on here, but you did bless me with I Still Have Joy.  Can't wait for the next cd, wish this cd had more on it that worked with the vein of Victory.  
 I was disappointed with this work. It is more about Elie Weisel then about chassidic stories. Many of the stories are familiar to me, and in all cases they appear distorted and many times the point of the story is missing. To summarize, as one of the stories said, He didn't hear what was said, and didn't write what he heard 
 ZERO stars. If you live in Europe, forget about it. This thing only works on PC's with an all American time & date system. Unless you want to americanize your computer, it's not usable. Americans could also have some complaints, for instance that the "book" (real paper) that's included is unreadable because it's glued to the carton - and all the selected articles are unreadable anyway because it's only one page, continued on a following page which is NOT included in the book. Furthermore you have to insert DVD's all the time: you can't copy them to your hard drive, no no, INSERT DVD, that's the way. It's EIGHT dvd's: whenever you click an article, you have to insert this or that dvd... This thing has an impractible, arrogant, snobbish and non-cosmopolite air about it - and reading a few articles, one thinks: what's the fuss about anyway? Famous names, sometimes, but not the best those famous names ever wrote, and the rest of the articles (99%) is trash. Chic, expensive but empty magazine fodder, nothing else. Best thing is the old ads, but they tire very quick. Back issues of Vogue and Cosmo would be much more entertaining. This is the first time I will return an item to Amazon 
 Lawrence Otis Graham has a tremendously rich vein of material here in his study of the preferred social and educational venues of the African-American upper crust, from their history with traditionally black colleges (Howard, Morehouse, Spelman and Fisk), social clubs (the Links, Boulé, AKA), and even their children's groups (Jack and Jill). Graham relates many fascinating anecdotes about this social set that are often extremely telling both their pride in their achievements and the cruel snobbery they inflict upon one another and others excluded from their set: his story about asking his brother and his bride to "jump the broom" (an old wedding tradition dating back to slave days), and the horrified fury it inspires in the DC social set, is particularly remarkable. But Graham seems almost entirely unwilling to do any actual analysis of his rich sociological material, or follow up on the many questions it seems to provoke about why such communities have been formed, what and whom they exclude, and what has been the effect of such studied exclusion among Americans of all classes and races. Unwilling to be a Thorstein Veblen for this social set, he instead becomes its Ward McAllister, making list after list of names of prominent African-Americans both living and deceased who belong to this set. (There is, of course, a helpful and extensive index, so anyone who might wish to see their inclusion in these lists might easily find the correct page.) The richness of the material makes you mostly sad for what an opportunity Graham has thrown away by refusing to analyze the causes and effects of the set from which he comes 
 Despite its promising title, this book is a bust.  It has no real unity.  It is poorly written, and poorly organized.  And the ideas are just so-so.  I got it on sale and was sorry, even so, to have spent the money.   Update: 12/14/05--Lakeland's positive review is obviously a mistake, since it is about another book (by Cuzzins) 
 This is junk. Since the end of the Soviet Union, it appears that "swarthy" Arabs are the new evil which the - guess what? - handsome, dedicated, sensitive-because-his-true love-died, intelligent, military-minded white guy has to single-handedly defeat and, of course, save Western Civilization from the narrow, evil-yes, "evil" again-tentacles of Islamic terrorism. And, as is the case these days in this whole genre of trashy spy novels, "Islamic" MEANS "terrorist."  And our Golden Boy does what we expect him to. This is so trashy and predictable, I feel Ludlum ought to pay us all back. Don't waste your time. 
 I found this to be a really annoying, and - in the audio format - annoyingly-told story. It sounds like a screenplay, with symbolism, mystery, and trivia that are so mediocre... how best to describe it? Here, read the book if you think this is fascinating: the orange is a symbol of the divine feminine because it's round like a mother's womb. If that doesn't blow you away, read something else.   The two leads are so stereotypical, it hurts. Lastly, the guy reading the audio version puts on these heavy nasal French accents that actually impede understanding of what's being said, and then he has French people speak to each other in these accents - way overdone. Then, layered on that, they are explaining things to each other that any French person would already know (cle de voute, for example) for the reader's benefit.   Taking in the many supposedly intriguing objects and situations in this book was exactly like watching the movie Van Helsing for me - I'm watching that thinking "a werewolf, and vampires? and frankenstein? and hot chicks? why, it's got everything! what next?" Short attention span theater. The fact that this book is so popular makes me sad 
 Read this book real careful and check out the facts for yourself.  I've heard this writer say stuff in the classroom like the epidemics that killed off so many Indians were an accident because the Indians didn't have immunities, and that there was no jenocide of Indians by white people.  I don't know if what's in his book is impartial.  I also thought the writing was real hard to get into.  I couldn't even get finished with the book 
 This film is a documentary, not a movie.  For those of you who admire European films with honest, casual nudity, this film may not be for you.  European films with honest, casual nudity usually are non-pornographic in content.  This film brings the anatomy down to a degrading level.  If you want to view this film, fine, but be prepared for some tears and nausea.  This film is not for the faint-hearted.  Though here in America we do need to let loose our prudishness when it comes to casual nudity, yet, to Europeans who tolerate young children being victims of sexual exploitation I ask, where are your child protection agents, your social workers, your law-enforcement agents, your religious leaders and, for crying out loud, the parents?  I admire Europe's easy-going ways when it comes to casual nudity, whether on the screen or on their beaches, but when you view this film, you might think that a lot has to be said for the way we protect our children in America against sexual exploitation.  I cannot think of a more vicious, sinister crime.  I believe the body has a soul, only these young lads were cheated out of a healthy outlook on the body, let alone a normal, healthy childhood.  My poor heart just cries out to them.  I practically saw the devil through that pornographer in question. I was going to rent "Angels, But Not Angels," but this film, and "Mandragora", were enough for me 
 Eleanor Roosevelt is truly a fascinating character, but this book is absolutely painful to read.  Cook makes references to topics before addressing them, makes characters difficult to follow, and generally botches what could be a great subject.  Look elsewhere for Eleanor Roosevelt 
 How could a great director like Tim Burton take a concept that is slam dunk good and change it so much as to kill it this bad. While it does have some good points most of this mess is just wrong. Allowing the humans to talk makes the hunting of them more cruel than in the first films when men were seen as cattle and pest. Talking humans did in the series and this movie as well. The apes come across as just cruel hunting and killing speaking animals and this sinks this turkey fast. A real let down and waste of tim 
 I expected a more informative text, but most of the book was filler -- old, simple lesson ideas, re-printed fairy tale stories and book lists.  The information about elementary school and kindergarten subject matter was interesting, but very brief.  I haven't picked the book up since the day I got it - which was all the time I needed to decide that it wasn't as useful as I expected it to be 
 Right now, I'm listening to the Slayer EP "Haunting the Chapel," and I feel like bash some s**tty nu-metal.  Don't listen to cretins like Korn Kidz, he says Rage Against the Machine has whinny teen-angst lyrics, boy thats hilarious!!  Yet he gloats the fact that he loves Korn, Slipknot, limp bizkit, and this awful band, I'm gonna loose a kidney from all of this laughing!!  Papa Roach is no different from those bands I mentioned above, this band also has the whinny outcasted kid for a frontman, a talentless guitarist who says soloing is for showoffs (you can figure out he can't do it), a sloppy bassist who adores Flea but can't play like him, and a drummer too slow to play double bass.  This album is nothing but a pointless noise fest for stupid wiggers living off welfare checks and "pimping" out their s**tty 1987 Toyota Carollas and are too scared to listen to Slayer, Morbid Angel, or Sodom.  If you want good rap-metal, listen to Rage Against the Machine and Faith No More.  For real metal, listen to Slayer, Nevermore, Kreator, and Exodus.  I'm glad this band is done for 
 As an engineer who both uses hydrogen and can work the math, I'm astonished that no one has corrected Peavey.  He mixes units, get equations wrong and just plain can't spell.  A decelerating engine is  "braking" not "breaking", for example.  His  thermodynamic computations are often wrong once you work them out, his  "borrowing" of other sources is painful where "propane"  was not changed to "hydrogen" is all cases in a paragraph.   Incredible.  This text is very nearly the "Anarchist's Cookbook"  of renewable energy -- there's a lot of words, some of it correct, but  someone's going to get badly hurt if they actually follow this guide.  All  that, and a decade out of date to boot. If Amazon would take the book back,  I'd gladly send them the ashes from the woodstove 
 This book is a horrific let down.  While admittedly no one expects to it be the next Lord of the Rings, I have rarely read a novel as poorly written and unbelievable as this.  I found the entire book felt like it was written by a grade 9 student.  Medically, it was accurate, but english wise, it was atrocious.  While reading this, I felt like it was a glorified Nancy Drew books, you know, the ones we all loved when we were 6 or 7 years old.  the characters are superficial and unbelieavle, the scenerios and plot are even more artificial.  The character of Tony is one of the most unrealistic fictional characters I have ever come across.  It was pretty obvious the author knew absolutely zip about organized crime when he wrote this book.  Overal, a very poorly written and unbelievable book.  No one is expecting Shakespeare, but we're at least hopeing for some entertainment.  This was painful to read

 Shaw, who more than any of his contemporaries dealt provocatively with the crucial issues of his day, has not worn well.  In a 1971 encyclopaedia I had as a child, the entry on GBS called him the greatest dramatist since  Shakespeare.  That's better than Moliere, Sheridan, Strindberg, Ibsen,  Wilde, Jarry, Chekhov, Brecht, Ionesco, Beckett!  Such a laughable  proposition is untenable today, and we can now see Shaw for what he is - a  superficially amusing farceur, who squandered this modest gift on deadly  social comment, deadly because he reduced issues that effected real people  to theorems, and reduced those people to mere mouthpieces.  There is no  subtext in Shaw - everything is expounded tediously and teeth-grindingly on  the surface.   ARMS AND THE MAN is one of his better efforts, and, after an  uncertain start, settles into some nice old-style farce - hidden  identities, buffoonish heroes, scheming servants, crusty old majors; when,  though, the puppets start lecturing us on war, idealism, class, gender  etc., one's heart sinks, not because what Shaw says isn't true, but because  a letter to the Times would have been a better place to say it.  While  Wilde's plays grow with the years, seeming richer, more meaningful,  brutally satiric, bursting with complex and fluid themes, Shaw's work, in  their steadfast refusal of mystery and ambiguity, seem chilly and remote 
 Then buy this book!  One, maybe two decent images in my opinion  Although art is subjective there are just too many flaws with these images to warrant publication, I just cant with good concious tell anyone to buy this book.   He seems to be very talented with other types of subjects, but his work with flowers, a favorite subject of mine, just left me totally cold.   Check out Sue Bishop or Kay Dammagard or even Tony Sweet they may not hob nob with the rich and famous but they know how to bring out the Beauty of nature.  
 The book is full of self-important drivel.  As a result, it lacks clarity and coherence 
 I expected that these would be fullscreen video similar to what came with the concert DVD of Fallen. This video quality is worse then whats available on most web sites 
 I took all the advice given in this book and put it into immediate practice.  One year later, I can barely put food on my table.  Be very careful if you try to start your own store.  Keep your day job.  Most people lose money in this venture!  Be warned 
 I loved Girl's Guide and have to agree with most of the reviewers below.  I was so looking forward to another fun, interesting read and for once could not actually finish a book, unusual for me as I will stick with anything unless it's terrible.  This book is just so boring, no spunk or humor; it just fell flat.  I am also finding the Jewish thing to be getting a bit old and overdone in novels these days...aren't there any other ethnic groups to be written about 
 Yes, this book is put out by the "Research" unit for political economy, in Bombay, India.  But these folks did not do much research!  Instead, they simply ascribe the most outrageous motives to the United States any time we take action.  It is no surprise that in 1991, the United States took part in a multinational effort against Iraq in 1991.  After all, Iraq did invade Kuwait.  Now, Kuwait was hardly our ally.  In fact, Kuwait had sided with us in the United Nations less often than any other nation on Earth.  Still, the invasion by Iraq certainly provoked and merited this sort of response.  Of course, that's not the way this book puts it.  In this book, the entire liberation of Kuwait was simply an American, British, and Israeli plot!  Israel has never been able to get the United States to so much as put our embassy to that nation in Jerusalem (in the Western portion of the city, no less).  But in this book, we Americans are in a conspiracy with Israel to let Jews "colonize" what it implies is Arab land, and maybe to massively evict Arabs from this land as well.  That's not quite what is happening, of course.  The only systematic and thorough evictions we've seen have been of Jews, from Gaza.  And there may be more such evictions, of Jews, from parts of the disputed West Bank.  The authors say that it was plain to the world that Iraq was about to invade Kuwait when April Glaspie talked with Saddam Hussein shortly before the invasion.  But it seems clear to me that we Americans were genuinely surprised by the invasion.  Was it really plain to the world?  If so, to which world?  Was it really to this one, which happens to include India?  I think it is telling that the authors boast of a French plan to avoid attacking Iraq and instead have a conference at which it would be agreed that Iraq would get out of Kuwait in return for us (in effect) giving permission for Arabs to swipe some Israeli land.  Um, why would that have been a good "trade" for anyone?   There is a section about sanctions against Iraq.  These sanctions may indeed have been a dubious idea, but they were hardly deliberate genocide!  And Iraq could have avoided these sanctions by complying with the demands on it.  In addition, Iraq could have made things much easier on its population even with the sanctions in place.  It's outrageous for this book to imply that these sanctions were simply a genocidal American scam.  The authors come up with even more nonsense when they discuss Arafat, a notorious thug.  Arafat's gang of thugs is considered to be the true representatives of a whole nation, or at least of all the local Arab population.  But that's simply false.  That gang existed primarily to fight against Jewish rights in the region, and that's not the same as being genuine representatives of the Arab people and promoters of the welfare of those Arabs.  And what does the book say about the aggression of Arafat and his gang against Israel?  Oh, to the authors, it is just an Israeli trick to try to delegitimize Arafat!  Once again, I wonder which world the authors think they live in.  Does America want to be an imperialist, colonialist, and genocidal nation?  Obviously not.  In a world at peace, our nation will do extremely well.  The authors of this book ought to have considered the possibility that America's people and Congress (and even our administration) are anything but imperialist, colonialist, and genocidal.  If the authors had wanted to do some real research on our reaction to aggression, they could have.  They could have determined some standards by which to judge what we did.  And they could have pointed out when we did things pretty much properly, when we made mistakes, when we reacted too strongly, and when we reacted too mildly.  But they did nothing of the sort.  Instead, they wrote some cheap and useless anti-American propaganda 
 I read tons and tons of reviews of this product and decided to take a chance on it.  Well that chance did not pay off.  Even in combination with the spray model my cat continued to spray everywhere.  If anyone else has ideas for something that does work i would really appreciate it.  
 I read The Last Tycoon, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and I thought that it was really bad. All it was about was the incredibly boring life a movie producer, the affairs of the same man and his partner, and I felt that all  of the events in the book were ludicrous. Nothing like that happens in real  life. I could not stand the book 
 It seems that whenever Israelis get killed, the author taunts them and calls them colonial.  He starts right out by quoting some Israelis who complain that Levantine Arabs are being very unreasonable and counterproductive by adopting a philosophy of violence and destruction.  And then he quotes Albert Memmi to say that the colonizer often fails to appreciate the humanity of the colonized, and thus regards the colonized folks as unpredictable!  Of course, that taunt could equally well be misapplied to the Germans and the Jews from 1942, and he could just as well taunt the Jews of 1942 who complained about what the Germans were doing to them.  Presumably, one could equally well say that the Jews in Europe in 1942 were simply colonizers as well, and those who helped eradicate them were heroes.  One would be wrong to say that, of course.  And Veracini is wrong to say what he does about the Jews of the Levant today.  By the way, Albert Memmi is a strange person for Veracini to refer to.  Memmi wrote at length about Arab anti-Israeli myths.  About how the Arab Muslims traditionally persecuted the Arab Jews, and about how Israel has given the Jews the right to exist.  And about how the Arab Muslims now wish to destroy Israel to punish the Jews for attempting to gain their independence.  Israel is small.  It has few natural resources.  Its Jews are bottled up in a small nation: Jews are not particularly welcome in the nations neighboring Israel.  So it does look a little like a Bantustan.  But Veracini turns this around and suggests that we ought to regard the Arabs as the ones confined to Bantustans.    We see some boasts that the French were indeed kicked out of Algeria.  And maybe the Israelis can be kicked out of Israel as well, of course.  But the latter would indeed be a little different from the former.  Kicking all the Israelis out of Israel (and Asia) would be more like kicking all the French out of France (and Europe).  Or, considering Israel's size, it might be more like kicking all the Dutch out of the Netherlands (and Europe).  It would not be easy, and it would be extremely counterproductive.    Having blamed the victims in Israel, the author then tries to compare Israel with ... Australia!  Well, Australia is a rather lightly-populated nation, but let's see what he comes up with.  Hmm, he says that "both countries have witnessed a marked public reluctance to receive some of the conclusions the `new historians' were proposing, especially when an appraisal of `founding violence' was involved.  Master narratives are rarely replaced without a fight."  This is outrageous.  There are plenty of histories of Australia and Israel.  Most folks are more than happy to accept truth: what they dislike are lies, especially vicious lies by those who refuse to abide human rights.  And a bunch of lies rarely replaces truth without a fight.  Let's hope that the lies will indeed be defeated, and that the arbitrary untruths the "new historians" spew will be discarded.  We see some lies from Veracini about the extent to which Israelis had a plan to expel Arabs from their state, and we see him misuse the fact that some people died at Deir Yassin as evidence that the Israelis had some master plan to expel the Arabs.  And in Australia, we see a reference to Windschuttle, who has argued that we all ought to take truth more seriously in the field of history.  But Veracini simply implies that Windschuttle is doing all this simply to avoid accepting reality!    Veracini doesn't mention the fact that unless the Jews are slaughtered, there will still be millions of Jews on this planet.  And that a few million people will, on the average, tend to dominate considerably more land than Israel now has (probably with more natural resources, too).  There is no good reason to steal such land from the Jews: such an act would be a terrible precedent, as well as a serious crime.  I think we all ought to reject the idea of attacking and destroying small nations such as Israel.  That sort of attitude, in my opinion, leads to a rejection of the right of people to exist at all.  It would be far better for all of us to put up with the fact that there are other people on this planet and work together to make the world a better place for all humans. 
 MUST READ REVIEW: The Free Speech Haters (lefties) have deleted this review Twice.  Robert Reich, was Bill Clintons scariest appointment. His ideology, ergo his politics has been the of the most extreme left of any Bill Clinton's appointments. And some may argue that he some of the most extreme viewpoints of ANY high level appointment.   Robert Reich and his ilk were very happy when from the 1940's - 1980, radical lefties was setting the public agenda. All items were in play, courts were stacked and extremist's legislatures abdicated their law making ability to the courts. The executive branch simply turned a blind eye when radical lefties created a false impression that they were supporting the constitution when in fact they were and still are systematically undermining it. Left-Wing views that were on the fringe of the Democratic Party in the Sixties and Seventies are now center stage. These views, being forwarded by people like Reich, Dean, Kerry and Feingold, seem accepted as normal.   Left Wingers - control the media, academia, the sciences, think-tanks, and for most of the last century the executive, judicial and legislative branch. Republicans were demoralized, but the pendulum has finally begun to swing the other way. People are finally getting fed up with the extremist left who is arrogantly opposed to honest intellectual debate for they are fervently certain that they are correct in all matters. Their disdain for discourse and for anybody who challenges them is extant.  But the worst part is that radical lefties are uncivil to the extreme. They fill the public airwaves and bookstores with nastiness. Listen to Air America or watch a Michael Moore DVD. Read their editorials and you will find vicious vituperative attacks. Open a leftist political best-seller and you find more mean spirited screeds. Extremist lefties, RAD-COMS (Radical Communists) typically reduce political debate to nonsensical statements that seem to be making point but are nothing but vague and angry assertions, unsupported by facts.  But what we're now witnessing is something far more corrosive of civic life than normal political vitriol: It's viciousness directed toward anyone holding a view other than the prevailing elitist left-wing propaganda. Insults also calculated to belittle and ridicule entire groups or judged to be different are part of the divisive wedge that lefties like to play in hurting the cohesiveness of the nation.  The Conservative tradition values free speech and debate. No one should be deterred from speaking his or her mind for fear of offending some group. Lefties are opposed to this idea, the shouting down of Ann Coulter the attacks on Christians, etc, etc. Are all handiworks of the left. It is their mean-spirited trash talk that fills their protge's with this HATE and ANGER of anybody not like them.  I'm sorry Mr. Reich, I used to be one of these lefties, and I know the condescension with which I was taught to look at people on the right. The attacking of American Citizens rather than ideas, the smearing of whole segments of society for some perceived ills against our ideology. This is leftism at its base. Fear and Hate driven. No. Mr. Reich it will be a sad day when you and your type WIN America. People are waking up, they are realizing that the great Democratic Party of yesteryear has been hijacked by Radicals.   Your book speaks about morals but you never discuss where the morals come from. Conservative position comes from a bedrock of factual and historical facts. They are a clear-eyed view of where America is and where we need to go. Your left wing morals come from a modernist philosophy, blown by the wind and proven to be a disaster. You biggest moral imperative is to BLAME others but that is what happens when you are ideologically based rather than historically and fact based.  I could go on and on, but MR. Reich, I used to be on the left. But the divisiveness, hate, anger, name-calling, utter compliance with leadership, no dissention, no debate, and supreme arrogance drove me away. Once one is away and in the middle you look at the two competing political thoughts and it is scary, very scary to see what you once were.   Mr. Reich, I am not an automaton, and that is what you need to usher in your America. What the conservatives need, is open honest debate, free speech, and equal time. You have a fight on your hands, one that I am hoping for my children's sake that you lose. 
 I missed the book club meeting that discussed this book but thought I would read the book anyway because everyone seems so enamoured with Ms. Cleage.  I read the first 150 pages of this book and I am bored to tears.   All of the reviews call this book astonishing; did the reviewers read the 1st 150 pages--nothing, absolutely NOTHING interesting happens in these pages.  Even if the author made up for it in the last 150 pages, this book could not be an astonishing book.  I will not be reading anymore Cleage books.  I, however, will try to finish reading this one since I started it.  My hopes for some excitement in the book,however, has been shattered by the other reviewers who state that the book doesn't even have excitement at the end of the book 
 Kuiper calls himself a reformer but he does a carefully worded job of making the Reformation look like a mistake.  According to him both Romanists and Protestants are linked by the Creeds.  He calls the Latin Vulgate "Jerome's noblest achievement".  Martin Luther attributed much of the errors in the Roman Catholic Church to Jerome and Origen, but Kuiper leaves such "tidbits" of important information out.  If you want to return to Rome and have "historical precedent" from the RC perspective for doing so, this is the book for you 
 This book was really a waste of time. When I was done reading, I was no better off than when I started. The beginning is really interesting in that it describes what kind of feelings go on inside the mind of a shy person. I thought I was the only one in the world who felt these things, and it was interesting to see them expressed by someone else in a book. So I continued to read on to the parts where they tell you how to get better. It said to try stuff like writing in a journal every day and to "think positive", "be assertive", and "practice making small talk". Like I didn't consider that on my own! This book really did not need to be written. What they could have done was just take the beginning of the book and sell it on its own as a short story or something, since it is the only useful or interesting part. After the first part of the book, it's basically telling you to go see a psychiatrist or get medication or both. It starts to get repetitive and is basically filled with the same useless suggestions that any person could have thought of, but they keep re-wording them throughout the book. So save yourself some money and don't buy this book. If you're interested in reading the opening part of the book, see if you can find it in a library 
 Using this book and CD-ROM depends upon being able to download the customized settings, so that the reader's PhotoShop, for example, behaves the same way as the author's PhotoShop. However, my system repeatedly hung up on that section of the download from the CD-ROM. Furthermore, this author doesn't start at a "dummies" level by defining the terms that he uses throughout the lessons, so I had trouble following along. Overall, this wasn't much help for me in my quest to learn PhotoShop from a baseline of complete ignorance 
 First of all, lets get this out the way, I'm not giving this album one star, I'm giving Ron White one star. I love this album, but only because its the first thing I ever saw or heard him do. He uses the same exact material that he used for "They Call Me Tater Salad", "Truckstop Comedy", "The Blue Collar Comedy Tour", and "The Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again." On a comedy central presents show he did the same material. The first time I heard the words "Take off the hat!" come from Ron's mouth I was in tears, but now I've heard it so much I'm sick of it. Carlin, Pryor, and even Foxworthy have different material for televison specials. Please Ron, get new stuff. 
 Ok maybe it was in the fine print or something but this alarm clock is TINY! I didn't realize it would be so small. It can pretty much fit in te palm of my hand 
 USELESS ITEM.  DO NOT PURCHASE. ITEM IS A WASTE OF MONEY. COMPANY WILL NOT ACCEPT A RETURN YOU CANNOT GET YOUR MONEY BACK IF YOU ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.  COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.  THE MOTORIZED VERSION PERFORMS AS ADVERTISED 
 I love a good pulp-action book, but this book is just insulting. I will give him credit for his aviation knowledge, it seems pretty complete.  However he clearly knows little about real life in the military.  I'm guessing he was in a few years at best.  His mistakes are about the only thing fun about this book.  What this really comes down to though is the guy can't write, and the book is boring.  Don't waste your money 
 Here's an example of a book that should never have been produced. The author is obviously misinformed and quite frankly, ignorant, regarding watches. The book is riddled with incorrect information regarding watch descriptions, including blatantly wrong jewel counts, movement descriptions, and the repititious "very fine and rare", "fine and lovely", "very fine and very rare", ad nauseum. The author constantly includes "micrometric regulator" in descriptions of pocket watches, that have NO micrometric regulators! The book is attractive, and has some excellent photographs, but, at best, this is a book that needed an author with some watch "smarts" 
 This being the first book I read by Danielle Steel I expected more than what I got since I love the moive verisons of her book. The start gives it hope but near the end you can sense the direction that the book is taking and I like alittle unpredicatable stuff 
 Of all the Anna Pigion books I have read, this is the worst. The charecters are shallow and stiff, the dialog stillted and meaningless, and the park is not well described and in no way seems like a place one would like to visit. This mystery seems to be a big "so what". Not nearly up to Ms Barr's best efforts 
 This movie is typical Hollywood anti-war, anti-military, anti-American trash.  The "show biz" liberals, aided and abetted by their ideological cousins, the left-wing TV news moguls, have always sought to portray American soldiers in Viet Nam as baby-killing, drug-crazed monsters.  This movie is typical of that ilk. If you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war, buy the DVD of "We Were Soldiers."--a much better, and far more honest, film 
 There is one word to describe Ayaan Hirsi Ali's work: Rubbish or for the American audience that would translate into "Garbage."  Please excuse my lack of creativity and eloquence in tailoring an adequate response that may cater to the aristocrats out there.  Here is a recipe to quick fame:  Every John Doe writes a book bashing Islam and instantly shoots to fame but moreover by writing a book is considered by the Western media to be an "expert" in that particular field of study - this is a mockery of the institutionalized form of intellectual discourse.  Ayaan Hirsi has had some hardships in his life and is blaming Islam at their expense.  He is not a scholar nor does he understand what Islam stands for.  In fact this doesn't even deserve my 1 star rating.  Had there been an option for "0 stars" that would have been more suitable.  As for my own credibility, though I'm not a scholar, I happen to be in the "academic circle" so-to-speak.  Oh, one last thing, I happen to go to an Ivy League School too (not trying to brag but just shedding light on my background).  I recommend reading Martin Lings book on the biography on the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).  This book is entitled "Muhammad" by Martin Lings.  You will certainly gain a lot more by reading that than this load of gibberish.  Other good books are by authors like Karen Armstrong.  
 This apologia for empire reads like an extended version of a first year university student's paper which has attempted to be controversial by rejecting decades of careful scholarship so that it could take the most counter-intuitive position imaginable.    It may indeed be some large-scale, subtle prank inspired by Alan Bennett's play The History Boys.  In that play, the history teacher instructs his pupils that in order to stand out, they should start by taking the position directly contrary to the conventional wisdom and work backwards from there to support this thesis.  One might think of it as the Niall Ferguson/David Cannadine school of British history.   Mr Johnson may have the desire to be as contrarian as Ferguson or Cannadine, but he has neither the skill nor the breadth of scholarship to carry it off.  Where they come off as cheeky and clever, Johnson appears ill-prepared and out of his league.  His evidentiary base is shockingly thin, little more than a standard reading list for a comprehensive exam in a British history graduate program.     Finally, not only hasn't Johnson read widely, he has not read well either.  He consistently mischaracterizes arguments of those with whom he thinks he disagrees.  Likewise, he uniformly paints every British imperial action in the best possible light and any criticism of imperialism in the worst possible one.   This book is a complete failure. 
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 but then again, what other kind of user wld attempt such a big book?  it's very very vague, even for a beginner

 I bought this crock pot because it didn't look like a traditional country style crock pot. Unfortunately the handle broke off with the slightest bump. You can't even buy a new liner on their parts web site. This thing is a flimsy piece of crap. 
 I watched both "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" and its documentary "Making of ..." and was impressed by the dancing and the dancers (particulary the incredible Tommy Rall).  Looking for a film that showcased any of the dancers in that film I came across this and after having read the reviews of the dance sequences both on this website and on imdb, I decided to purchase the film.  Then I noticed the cover.  I thought "Is this what I think it is?", and clicked on 'see larger image'.  YIKES!  It is!  I have children at home and thought that this is not an illustration that is positive or educational, to say the least (after just having placed "Hands Are Not For Hitting" on my wish list!).  If Warner Bros decides to change the illustration on the cover, then I'll consider buying it.  Until then, for those of you who are concerned with the images your children see, I suggest you view the 'see larger image' of the cover before you decide to buy 
 When I found "Hour Game" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt.  But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as "The Winner" and "Absolute Power" could turn out such a dog.  Long, boring, and confusing.  I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an "aspiring young writer" to "help" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them.  It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin.  What a waste.  What a shame. 
 Although the book, with its illustrations, sidebars and accompanying cd, seemed so promising, in the end this is a disappointing compilation.  The book and cd waste a lot of space with some of the most commonplace forms of poetry - Mother Goose rhymes and limericks - to which many parents will have already introduced their children. The book veers from nursery rhymes to multiple poems involving death to Shakespearean sonnets. The choices of poems within each form introduced could have been improved upon - many are downright uninteresting.  Finally, I reached for the CD, hoping the purchase could be saved by the careful, luscious reading of selected excellent examples on it.  Alas, alack.  Two "professional" actors read - neither, unfortunately, possessing either the gravitas or the tonal depth to make the poems ring.  And again, the cd is littered with limericks and nursery rhymes 
 I was hoping it would show colored pictures of the different breeds of cows. The inside, unlike the cover, was not in color and showed parts of the cow more than breeds.  Guessed wrong on what I wanted to buy.  My husband and I really like Amazon though 
 The preceding two reviews are each from opposite camps, and are both equally useless.  One says the book is completely bad because of its religious bias, which I don't think is fair or accurate.  The other review says that the first reviewer is wrong good without any discussion of why.  This book is not useless, even to those outside it's target audience; neither is it particularly good even for that audience, and I dispute the implied claim that being written from a Christian perspective makes it inherently better than a similar secular book.    What this book suffers from is not bad writing; it's a bad title and description.  This is NOT a secular book.  While it's an exaggeration to say that God or Jesus are mentioned in every line, this is quite clearly written by a Christian, for other Christians, and the entire work is steeped in biblical references.    However, that doesn't make it a "piece of crap."  What it does make it is a poorly-titled and (at least here on Amazon) -marketed book.  This work should state its bias, if not in the title, then at least in the subtitle.  It is NOT a general guide on storytelling, which is what both its title and ad blurb appear to indicate.  It contains enough Christian references to distract even most Christians I know, never mind someone not from that religious tradition.  And that is exactly what Christianity is; a religious tradition.  It is NOT the one and only source of grace or divinity.  So, that statement ought to help you determine whether you can get any use from this book.  If you read that and said, "blasphemy," or regarded the statement as a one-way ticket south for my soul, this is probably right up your alley.  If you said, "hmmm. he may have a point," be wary of this book.  And if you said, "right on," or any permutation thereof, steer clear.  That said, it's not badly written, although there's nothing here you won't find in a half-dozen other books on storytelling.  In fact, unless non-biblical stories are patently offensive to you, I would say many of the others would probably serve you better (Ramon Ross' "Storyteller" is particularly good, as is Jack Maguire's "Creative Storytelling").  They contain more in the way of actual advice.  Basically, what this book has going for it is precisely what the marketing of it seems to have ignored; it's storytelling advice told from a Christian (and, while I don't know the author's background, I would guess somewhere far right at that; you know, the kind of folks who use the word "grace" regularly, and they're serious) perspective.  If that sounds like your cup of tea, you'll probably enjoy this book.  
 This book's attemps at being a novel distract from the weak historical aspect of the book.  This book is obviously not written by a scholar, and thus, reads like a newspaper article written by a reporter who did not  understand is material fully.  I suggest, if you want to learn what the  world was like a 1000, read The Oxford History of Medival Europe, a real  book of history 
 this was the same literature but not the book that was pictured on amazon website.  very old version and took forever to get here 
 I'm very disappointed with this shredder. I got it back in October 2006, and I have only used it about 3 or 4 times.  First of all, although the product is supposed to shred up to 5 sheets at a time - IT DOES NOT. It will get jammed, so I only shred 1 or 2 sheets at a time. Tonight I used it again, and it became completely jammed from a few sheets. I cannot get it to work again.  It is very loud and a bit slow, but I can live with that, I just don't like the fact that it jams after only using it a few times. I recommend others spend a few extra dollars and get a reliable shredder, unlike the Royal "5-sheet" Crosscut Shredder HT500x 
 "Paul Scofield: An Actor for All Seasons" would seem to be an excellent argument that just because someone has had a successful career doesn't make them a prime candidate for a biography. For despite Scofield's acting triumphs in such roles as Thomas More, Solieri, King Lear, Hamlet, and John Gabriel Borkman, he is depicted in Garry O'Connor's relatively slim volume as a quiet, modest and rather shy man.  This is not in any way meant as a criticism of Scofield, and indeed it is refreshing to encounter such an unassuming personality compared with such personally unpleasant Shakespearean Titans as Laurence Olivier or Donald Wolfit. But that is the major problem with the book: with such a demure central figure as Scofield, the narrative is primarily a bland chronology of the actor's various stage roles.  Had O'Connor anything profoundly interesting to say about Scofield as an actor, the verdict might have been different, but he primarily offers up tired hyperbole of the actor's "greatness" without ever really putting his finger on what set Scofield apart from his contemporaries. Even his chronology is inaccurate, writing, for instance, that Scofield filmed his role in "The Train" from summer into Autumn of 1966 (after he had appeared in the Oscar winning film of "A Man for All Seasons"), whereas "The Train" was actually released in Europe in the autumn of 1964 (more than two years before "A Man for All Seasons").  If this sounds like harsh criticism of O'Connor's book, it isn't meant to be. Scofield is simply a quiet, dignified man whose life doesn't lend itself to the kind of larger-than-life biography of an Olivier or a John Gielgud. This is likely to be as good a biography as we'll ever see of Scofield, a fine actor and a good man whose life isn't really all that interesting when recounted in print 
 I was able to go cover to cover in about 5 minutes.  If you manage people that use their brains to do their work and you have no idea how to understand, manage and motivate them then this book might help you out a bit.  I found it to be off-topic for me as I was hoping that it was going to be written for the people who Think for a Living rather than their managers. 
 I am an MBA student and had hoped to gain some insights  before an interview at an investment bank. I bought the book, misled by the author's credentials  and the many 5 star reviews. However, this book is a DUD. It is facile, poorly written and a waste of time and money. Fortunately I  also bought Applied Mergers and Acquisitions by  Robert F. Bruner ( listed under "the buy this book with" button). The later saved the day!  Skip this - get the Bruner book 
 Evolution is supported by mountains and mountains of documented, irrefutable evidence from educated, professional, intelligent people who have simply followed the course of where their research took them.  It's no longer about one guy who wrote one book in the mid-1800's.  Not any more.  Inform yourselves, people.  I challenge anyone reading this to actually investigate how much supporting research there is out there for evolution in science, in astronomy, biology geology and physics.  It's overwhelming.  Check out some web sites from some universities and research institutes to get an idea of how research is being done on evolution all over the world.  Do you think they're all in a conspiracy, and that they're just making it all up 
 While the underlying plot had potential, the story dies under its own weight.  There are too many characters (the first hint of trouble is the multi-page listing of characters at the front of the book).  This leads to too little time devoted to character development and too much bouncing around as we follow the many characters around the globe.  The dialog, is terse, contrived, choppy and generally devoid of emotion.  Having loved the Dirk Pitt and Brad Austin line of books from Cussler, I had wanted to like the Oregon Files as well.  Unfortunately, I found Sacred Stone and Golden Buddha to both be underwhelming.  
 This is a very problematic book, as others have already pointed out.  Instead of clearly looking at the things that separate Mormonism from historic orthodox Christianity, it tends to ignore or gloss over the crucial points and instead focus in on superficial resemblances between the two faiths.    Perhaps the biggest difference between Christianity and Mormonism is that the former is a historical religion and the latter is not.  Mormonism makes its claims based on a "translation" of supposed golden plates that cannot now nor never have been able to be produced.  Nor has the translation mechanism, the Urim and Thumim, ever been produced.  Mormons like to talk about Mormon "prophets," such as "Nephi," but these prophets, who supposedly prophesied thousands of years ago, cannot be shown to have ever existed.  Christianity, on the other hand, has been subjected to more than three hundred years of the most intense critical scrutiny by antagonistic scholars, scientists, and historians.  It has come out of that period of scrutiny with it having been unequivocally established as a historical religion, with its basic outlines acknowledged to be historical by even the most skeptical person.  Another huge difference between Mormonism and Christianity is that it can be demonstrated that the events described in the Old Testament and New Testament were recorded fairly close in time to the actual occurrence of the events described, whereas many of the purported events described in the Book of Mormon took place thousands of years before they ever came to light.  Thus, we have no way of knowing whether or not they actually occurred, except on the testimony of the Book of Mormon itself.  A third significant difficulty with Mormonism over against Judaism and Christianity is that both of these latter arose within a covenantal context in relation to a community called into existence by God himself, whereas Mormonism arose out of vastly different circumstances.  The Bible describes the calling by God of Abraham, His making a covenant with him, His establishing him as a clan, a tribe, and finally a nation, and His promise to bless all nations through him.  Christianity came about in a similar fashion.  It arose out of a pre-existing community, Israel, and its founder, Jesus, was himself a Jew, who fulfilled the covenant promises of His Father to Israel.  At the Last Supper, using sacrificial, covenantal language, soon to be effectuated by his death on the Cross and His resurrection, He fulfilled God's promises to Israel to be a light to all nations by doing what Israel could not do--that is, be faithful to her calling.  Thus, Christianity saw itself, and continues to see itself, as a continuation of the salvation history God the Father initiated with Israel and brought to completion in the person of His Son, Jesus.  The origins of Mormonism have little or nothing in common with the way God called into existence Israel and brought forth Christianity as a result of the atoning death of His Son.  There are no comparable salvation-history events connected with the founding of Mormonism.  The supposed translation of golden plates, which cannot be demonstrated to even have existed, is in no way comparable to God's call of Abraham, or the rise of the Christian Church following Jesus' life, death, and resurrection.  Unlike Christianity, Mormonism did not come out of a pre-existent community, nor is it in any significant continuity with any pre-existent community related to God or Jesus.  There is simply no record of God ever having acted to establish a people in the way Mormons claim they have been established by God, that is, by a private revelation of God to a single man.  Finally, there are very great and significant differences between Mormon understandings about who God and Jesus are and Christian understandings, despite what Mormons may say to the contrary for apologetic or ecumenical purposes.  These differences, once again, have to do with history.  Very early on, the Christian Church began to closely resemble the shape it presently exhibits, especially as expressed among Catholics and the Orthodox.  By the end of the first century, about 65 years after the death of Jesus, the three-fold ministry is already in place, and the bishops are seen to be the successors of the Apostles.  People are still alive who knew Jesus and the Apostles.  By the middle of the second century, we begin to get fairly complete written descriptions of Christian worship, which is universally Eucharistic.  Around the same time, we begin to see written descriptions of Trinitarian understandings, as well as a nascent two-natures Christology.  All of this is arising out of the Church's practice of living the life, worship, ministry, and teaching handed from Jesus to the Apostles to the bishops.  This process of an unfolding understanding of who God is and who Jesus is continues without interruption from the time of the Apostles to the time when the major doctrines of Christianity are firmly in place, around the middle of the fourth century.  The apostolic understanding is faithfully preserved, unfolded, and developed under the auspices of the bishops, who are the successors of the Apostles and the custodians of the Faith.    The question arises:  Which process is more likely to produce a correct understanding about Jesus and God, one that arises immediately after direct contact with and witness to Jesus and is preserved, unfolded, and developed by those uniquely entrusted to its preservation, unfolding, and development, that is, historic orthodox Christianity, or one that arises 1900 years after Jesus, has no demonstrable historical or communal connection with Jesus, and is derived from a supposed translation of plates that cannot be demonstrated to have ever existed, that is, Mormonism?    The crucial issues delineated above, which provide the proper starting point for a discussion about Mormonism and Christianity, are scarcely touched on in this book, let alone carefully looked at.  Thus, the book has extremely limited value, as it fails to come to grips with what really divides these two rather radically different faiths 
 This alleged "sequel" makes the Nic Cage original look like 'The Godfather'...or at least like a decent movie. I'm serious. I was actually longing for the not-so-great yet disturbing first installment. At least that had a decent cast to overcome it's incompetence in certain areas. This has nothing going for it. This movie is like a really bad TV film loaded with sex and nudity just so it can be called an "Unrated and Exposed" edition.  The premise involves an aspiring politician who has a threesome with his wife and some random party girl. It turns out, however, that their escapade has been taped and could be in the hands of someone who could ruin his reputation. So what does he and his wife decide to do? Why ruin his reputation more by publicly searching for the tape in the not-so-erotic underground world of sex and more sex. They waltz around going from porn store to orgy club looking for random people who may or may not have a connection to the threesome woman who allegedy gave the tape away. That's all the movie is. The actors are terrible, the story not much better, and the title having nothing to do with the story. There's also a "twist" ending that makes absolutely no sense.  This is only the second in a long line of unnecessary Sony sequels, including 'The Net 2.0', and 'Single White Female 2'. Avoid this heap of garbage. Don't encourage Sony 
 Is "Ladykillers" a buddy-caper movie? Is it a religious metaphor? Is it a quirky comedy with supernatural overtones? Is it "Reservoir Dogs"? Is it a star-making turn about an unforgettable character?  It apparently tries to be all these things.   What it ACTUALLY is is an unfunny, schizophrenic, mean-spirited mess.   The movie starts out with great promise. Tom Hanks stars as what appears to be a somewhat-pompous, Edgar Allan Poe-quoting, Colonel Sanders vest-wearing, over-educated, genteel Southern professor of Renaissance music. What he actually is is a (still-likable) con-man and swindler. At least, that's what he starts out as at the beginning of the film. His dialogue is supurb, his accent and portrayal spot-on.   He decides he wants to rob a casino. In order to do this he devises a scheme to tunnel into the casino's counting room from underground. To fascilitate his plan, he lets a room in an old woman's house close to the casino, and convinces his landlady that he actually needs her basement to practice with his band of musicians. He cobbles together an unlikely assemblage of partners in crime, which include a Chinese general who has a Hitler complex (he even has a Hitler mustache), a strange jack-of-all-trades and explosives expert who can't stop farting, a stupid football player to do the digging, and Marlon Wayans, who plays the beyond-stereotypical black thug who loves rap music and constantly threatens to shoot people with his gun while yelling expletives. The Chinese general has a total dialogue of four words the entire movie (I'm not kidding, I counted!) and the football player about 12. What the point of those two characters was I'm not really sure.  Now, you'd think that with such a motley crew, there would be slapstick humor galore. Well, nope. There are "incidents" which often revolve around farting, one scene where a guy blows his finger off with explosives (I THINK that was supposed to be funny---it's tough to tell) and a lot of scenes with Mr Wayans saying "F-this" and "F-that" while waving his gun around.   Still, for the first 75% of the movie, I was still fascinated--simply because Tom Hanks' character is so unique and so memorable. His genteel humor and dialogue (which seems to come directly out of PhD theses on esoteric medieval literature, Rococo music theory and Edgar Allan Poe) and his portrayal of such is fascinating. Unfortunately, even that is not enough to carry the movie, as it loses focus and becomes mean-spirited about 3/4 though the movie.  After what appears to be an attempt at a quirky buddy-caper flick, about 3/4 through the robbers decide that it is necessary to kill their landlady. They are very serious about this. Suddenly things aren't funny anymore. Marlon Wayans' character gets killed in a struggle with the farting explosives expert after he attempts to kill the landlady. This is not funny. He is not killed in a funny way--- and why is there suddenly killing anyway, when the tone of the movie up to that point had been slapstick humor? They dump his body off a bridge onto a garbage barge going down the river. Not long afterwards, the Chinese general kills the explosives expert by choking him graphically with piano wire while he is farting. Apparently this is also supposed to be funny --- but is actually extremely not funny. It is sick and disturbing. They dump his body off the bridge onto a garbage barge going down a river. Soon after the Chinese general tries to kill the landlady and kills himself by accidentally falling down the stairs. Body to garbage barge. Tom Hanks tries to convince the football player to kill the landlady. He refuses, but accidentally shoots himself in the face with the gun while on the bridge. His body falls of it's own volition onto the garbage barge. This is extremely graphic, violent and not funny. Finally, a head of a gargoyle falls off the bridge and hits Tom Hanks on the head, and his body falls into the garbarge barge, too. Everyone's dead. The landlady keeps the money.   What's the point?  If it wasn't for the quirky performance Tom Hanks gave, this would have been a one-star for me.   Avoid it unless you're stuck on an airplane or are a big Tom Hanks fan. 
 Amazing how a second read can change one's original opinion.  The first time I read it I thought the author was insulting and condescending to black women. Just a lot of malarkey. Then I read it again, and realized that it was satire, and had some terrific dialogue and interactions between the characters.  I began to wish I knew people myself who I could have those types of constructive dialogues with.  The relationship between the two sisters was enlightening and fun. Gingersnaps is deceptive and I definitely recommend  to anyone who has read it, to give it a second read.  You might be surprised! 
 I enjoy the initial season of Murder She Wrote very much.  My wife and I are getting pretty good at discovering new clues to Who Dun IT.  Frequently, though, it gets very frustrating to have the picture freeze or scramble up.  Often the audio gets out of synch with the video.  Terrible!  We surely wanted to go ahead and order the second seasons, but now -- about 3/4 the way through, I think we'll just skip on buying these cheap double sided DVD's 
 The contempt the author has for writers and the contempt so many of the agents have for writers is the real theme of this book. If you want names and addresses, use the internet. If you want a book that can actually help you get published, read The Square Guide to Publishing Your Non-fiction Book by Rudy Shur 
 First, it's only fair to say that I found this book interesting in many aspects.  It does add some knowledge and understanding to the field of hypnosis, however, the author is not very effective at illuminating his ideas.  On the one hand, he writes as though his audiance all have PhD's, because he does not do very well at defining his terms, or elaborating on his concepts.  On the other hand, he does not provide any information of the efficacy of the questionaires he provides that an individual with a professional degree would find useful in vetting his theoretical views. He points to Mesmer and Braid as being the the seminal hypnotists, but comepletely skips Milton Erikson who he borrows heavily from, perhaps without being aware of it -- I don't know. This book needs to be rewritten and greatly expanded upon to deserve the title "'Professional' Hypnotism 'Manual'."  In my opinion, it is neither professional, nor a manual. Nevertheless, I probably am underrating this book by giving it two stars 
 Big disappointment.  I expected this book to be hysterical.  Her sense of humor is certainly different!  Very shallow material. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 I have read "Open House" and enjoyed it but this was very disappointing. Not only did I not identify with Betta - I actually disliked her, and like many other reviewers I found most of her actions completely implausible - a 55 year old woman renting a room in a house with two 20-year-olds for occasions when she was scared to sleep at home?  They must have been laughing at her behind her back!  There were so many storylines started that never went anywhere - for example the love story behind the letters written to the old lady during the war.  
 If anyone would visit Dallas, Texas and the location where JFK was shot, you realize just how much disinformation has been written on this subject, especially this screen play. I found the entire screen play just a fatasy  of paranoid exploitation by a profiteer claiming to sell the truth! For  example, the grassy knoll is less than 30 feet from the road way, with an  easy 10 second slow jog, up a knoll about 3 feet high from the road way, to  the fence on the Grassy Knoll. If shots came from there it was easy for any  policeman to run to that area, let alone see anyone tryimg to shoot from  such an open area. Even a quick getaway is not as easy as this screen play  makes it out to be, since you can preview the entire parking lot for over  100 yards. Also, the distance from the sixth floor to the road is far  closer by observation that anyone can imagine, except for Oliver Stone.  These easy observable locations makes the Warren Report much more accurate  than this screen play. Also, the people who benefited by JFK's death was  the Democratic Party and its leadership not any right wing Republican  radicals? Johnson won overwhelmingly and the Democrats took even a stronger  positions in the House and Senate. Moreover, to support such a screen play  based upon the past reliability of the author in biographies that are  suppose to be real stories about real people is another reason to doubt its  integrity. Again, another example I can cite here is "On The Fourth Of  July" where Ron Kovic was beaten and thrown out of the 1968 Democratic  Convention, not the Republican Convention. What few know is that Oliver  Stone was a delegate to the Democratic Convention but this fact permits him  to change facts in this film based on poetic license. So be it, but such  behavior cannot be construed for the truth by a truth teller. The same for  this screen play, it is a great work of intentioanl fiction meant to poison  the minds of the reader to reasonable, objective and available facts, and  does it very well indeed, If the public prefers to remain blind, so be it!  Some will say these are stupid stories for stupid people, others will say  it is a great tale but please remember it is just entertainment. Well, this  screen play is a very entertaining story but please don't call it a book of  facts, truth and accuracy. It is a very good fable as well as the film 
 I preordered this book in hardback, as I have all the author's books since they first started coming out in hardback, but I am just now barely getting through it.  I loved the earlier dog training oriented books in the series and sometimes reread them.  But I must confess the later books seem to be less and less interested in dogs.  And even though the mystery aspect of the novels have always taken second place to the dogs, these later novels are even less interested in crafting a mystery.  What substitutes are more pages of trivia and rambling introspection that seem unrelated to dogs or the plot of the novel.    In this one, I found the mystery incomprehensible. Why would Mac, who seemed to be well off and relatively easygoing if a philanderer, whose kids liked him, and who was reported as begging his wife to forgive him, ever give a wife an ultimatum that she could have no more dogs? Perhaps I missed something -- I was skimming through the book a lot. But the murderer's -- and even the philandering husband's -- motives and actions weren't believable.  Their resolution was also handled "off stage",  in a rush, and left me feeling still more unconvinced as to why the characters acted as they did.  This book, which was a "finale" of sorts in that it involved the marriage of Steve and Holly deserved more attention to producing a believable mystery and more effort in the final resolution of it.  Regarding the trivia, it seems to serve as a way of providing exposition as opposed to dialogue. Whatever happened to bringing characters into the story, to Holly sleuthing and searching to give us some of the information in dialogue instead of having Holly searching the web and giving us a precis of her finds, or having us read emails?  Dialogue, as opposed to narrative exposition would have forwarded the story better.  This novel also seemed disjointed in a lack of real connection between characters and the two main plots.  It would have been better if the mystery and the wedding had been constructed to dovetail, instead of two relatively unrelated plots jogging along, uncoordinated.  Have the murder involve the characters at some wedding planning shop run by some dog lover with a philandering husband.  Or a murder between some patrons of a wedding shop or wedding related business.  Or at a dog training club where Holly went to give her dogs practice in not eating the flower collars (given malamutes eat everything, it was puzzling they should be indifferent to those and that we were given so little info on training for the wedding. That seemed an opportunity lost).  If the murder was more related to the wedding,  some of the information could have been more easily relayed in dialogue even without Holly having to do much sleuthing, as well as tying the mystery to the wedding, instead of so much narrative. The murder and wedding could have proceeded more naturally together.    It would have been nice too, if the familiar characters had more than walk on parts in the novel.  Keven could have spent some time solving the murder while Holly and the rest had their wedding planning around it and him.  Rita could have come in for dispensing some shrink advice on pre wedding jitters, given Holly's resistance to marriage before.  The subplot involving Rita and her philandering boyfriend in some respects had even more attention paid to it than the actual murder mystery, but did nothing to further the two main plots of wedding and murder.  Rita could have had other more relevant roles.  And Steve needed to be much less than a cipher through this.  He seems to show up to bring dinner and take Holly to bed and that's pretty much it for him. Instead, Rita had her own subplot, Kevin's involvement in the mystery was perfunctory, at best, and Steve didn't seem to have much to do at all.  I would have liked to have seen more relation between the characters (these are after all, cozy mysteries) more coordinated plots, more dialogue with each other and much less of the pages of filler.  It would have resulted in a better, tighter mystery.  I'm hoping the promise of the first few books gets renewed by the author putting a little more effort into the nuts and bolts of writing.  In the meantime, I probably am going to hold back on preordering the hardbacks -- which I regret -- and wait to see. I keep hoping some editor is going to take this author by the hand a little.  To put it in words Holly might understand, this was a good writer who -- like a formerly well trained dog whose owner has lapsed on training sessions -- needs to return, reinforce and work on those basics that were practiced in the first books of the series.  
 As an avid fan and owner of every book she's published I was VERY disappointed in the storyline, plot, sub-plot, character development (actually lack there of), dialog, I can go on.  When the story moves into dream sequences it's disjointed, choppy and is like flipping channels and watching a movie that has been on for over an hour.  I haven't finished the book, I have no desire, inclination or motivation to.  I stopped reading the book a week ago and haven't felt the urge to pick it up again. I am barely 1/2 way through the book.  I feel like I wasted money.  I feel robbed 
 Ms. Mayes puts her nose in the air about tourists - and what does she think she is except a tourist with a little more time for her travels than most of the rest of us?  Got news for you, Ms. Mayes - just because you can spend a month in a country when most of the rest of us have a week or 10 days doesn't make you any less a tourist.  And your sneers at your fellow/sister Americans aren't going to win you any more readers in the long run.  On second thought, this level of snotty self-satisfaction and loathing for America and Americans is what I guess I expect from academics these days. 
 The fact that a book like this is popular in academic circles is a sure sign that the Computer Science Academics are corrupt beyond redemption. If there are corporations who allow this book in as a tutorial for their workers those corps are wasting their money. This is a dictionary not a textbook... and its not even a good dictionary at that.  Reading this book on a subject so amusingly simple like methodology is like trying to eat with your nose. The fact that Mr. Pressman over complicates, obfuscates and ambiguates the subject matter is proof that he is terribly insecure about the simplicity of the subject or he is just not good at explaining things. Then to have this book be touted as a standard is a shame.   If anyone wants to see mastery of subject matter coupled with references to specs. and clear explanations they should try the Head First Series (on design patterns). Mr. Pressman should follow some of his own advices when giving guidance to his students about writing design/requirements docs. This book is worse than a use case document scrawled in Tahitian 
 THIS PRODUCT FLAT OUT SUCKS  IVE BEEN SHAVING MY HEAD FOR YEARS AND NEVER HAD ISSUES WITH CLIPPERS HAD A BASIC REMINGTON BEFORE   THIS PRODUCT GIVES ME NOTHING BUT TROUBLE 
 Apparently,their last work with frontman Steve Perry and quite the let down.'Trial...' was the band's '96 comeback attempt,but if I remember correctly this CD was a stiff from the get-go.I tried SO hard to get into this fifteen track disc,but even with a duration of 68 minutes,I just couldn't.The songs don't completely suck,they just don't appear to have much life.Fantastic cover,don't you agree?If you're an old school Journey fan,I encourage you to check out their new 2005 release,'Generations' with vocalist Steve Augeri,who's been with the band for awhile now.That CD is surprisingly good,as I'd give it 3 1/2,maybe 4 stars.Keep in mind that guitarist Neal Schon is their 'key' player 
 Readers who are interested in finding out why the West has been targeted by some extremist Muslims as well as why so much anti-western sentiment exists in not only the Islamic world but the developing world at large (and more recently almost the entire world) would be better off reading the works of Edward Said - an Arab Christian who was a true scholar of Middle Eastern and European/American history and documented in several of his works many of the reasons the West is not held in high esteem - and with good reason as anyone would understand if they were on the receiving end (if you are not on the receiving end thank God or your lucky stars whatever works for you).   Mark Gabriel's book is a sad story about a man who experienced persecution that should never have happened, however, it does nothing to help the reader understand the true roots of anti-western sentiment, or the violence perpetrated by a small number of Muslim extremists. I can understand his bitterness given his experiences. However, given his negative experiences and his rejection of Islam personally it is reasonable to infer (as the book demonstrates) that his views of Islam and its history are quite tainted. This book provides the reader with nothing but a very biased and stereotypical account of Islam and its history - IT WILL NOT HELP ANY WESTERNER UNDERSTAND THE REALITIES THAT EXIST IN THE MIDDLE EAST TODAY.  By the way I believe you if you read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States" you will see that there is no civiliation, Islamic, American, or otherwise that does not have violent blemishes in its past and present. However, these violent blemishes should not be used to characterize entire civiliations in their entirety which Gabriel's book unfortunately does.    If you want to truly understand the roots of violence perpetrated by a very small group of Muslims (remember there are 1 billion Muslims in the world and those committing acts of violence are drop in the bucket compared to the immense size of the total population - also let's not forget that plenty of violence has been perpetrated by some groups of Christians and Jews both in contemporary times and in the past) than read books by scholars who understand the pain and suffering of the Palestinians, the Iraqis, the Afghanis, and the ongoing humiliation, torture, and death, these people have suffered at the hands of the West, not to mention the humiliating history of European colonization and imperialism that has left its mark on the region. Also be reminded that the U.S.'s support of oppressive dictators in the region is not lost on the people who live and suffer under those oppressive regimes such as Bush's good friends the Saudi royal family. And of course Sadam Hussain, a current villian in the U.S., was once highly favored by the U.S. government who supplied him with arms and other types of aid during the eight year Iran-Iraq war. He lost his popularity with the U.S. government after he decided he no longer liked being a puppet.   For a more accurate in-depth view of the history of the influence of the West on the East read Edward Said's foundational book "Orientalism," "the Question of Palestine," or Arhandati Roy's "An Ordinary Persons Guide to Empire."  Here you will read words and truths from scholars who come from colonized peoples, scholars who are/were not only great writers and scholars but who also write/wrote from a non-western perspective. If you want to understand the perspectives of Arabs and Muslims than reading books written by biased Westerners such as Gabriel is not the way to go. On the other hand if your true motive in reading about Islam is to reinforce your existing hatreds, biases, and stereotypes, by all means read his book with relish - it will serve your intended purpose well.  
 I received this book as a gift, and I am so glad I did not buy it.  It is a 137 page book, of which over 50 pages (FIFTY PAGES) are blank, or have bad line-art of a siamese cat.  The remaining pages are large type, double spaced, half of which are just rehashes of previous books.  I figure there are probably 30 pages of original material.  It's obvious that Ms. Braun (or the publishers using a ghostwriter) are just trying to milk the fan base for more money.  Avoid this book, even if you are a Cat Who completist 
 I don't know why this is, but when I put on the Dale Sr. shell for this car it started to understeer on left turns and would always crash into walls 
 I have to admit it.  This book left me scratching my head wondering exactly what the other reviewers saw in it.      The Story:  The koalas at the zoo have become disenchanted with one another.  No one remembers why, but the end result is that they are not speaking to one another.  The wisest koala decides that if they have a great costume ball that all will again become copacetic.   Well, the rest of the less-wise koalas love the idea.  They soon gather in their many costumes and dance their many dances.  At sundown, they happily obey the suggestion of the wise old Koala to take their costumes off.   (The wise old koala believes that once the costumes are off that they will behave more civilly.)   So what happens?    It turns out all the anger isn't gone.   Despite having such a fine party, the bears can't let go of their crankiness because they can't tell who is who.  We are told by the author that "Koala bears are famous for looking very much alike...." and so  they go back to being angry.  The Hunting Bear didn't know the Nurse Bear.  The Indian Bear didn't know the Chinese Bear.  They started to get angry all over again and some low growling  was heard.  The wise old bear is not flummoxed by this turn of events.  Mustering up his wisdom, he suggests they all put their costumes back on and go on with the dance.  This they do and the Koala's dance the night away.  And   The next day, it turns out that the bears had such a good time that they decide to wear parts of their costumes... and so [drum roll] they learn to differentiate themselves once again.  And... the book concludes with: "He scratched his head and thought:  "From now on, in Koala Park, there must be many, many more BEAR PARTIES!"  Huh?  Perhaps the point is that we need differences to get along.  Or perhaps there is no point.  [Or perhaps I could be more creative about finding one if I had more sleep and more coffee.]    I can only explain the Caldecott Honor by way of the 1951 publication date.  The 50's are not particularly well know for great children's writing.  But then again... the other 2 reviewers seem to love this book.  In any case, hope this helps.  TwoStars.  Intriguing artwork.  Story leaves this mom feeling like years of college were wasted.  And if the point is this hard for an adult to grasp, what chance have young children got 
 During my pregnancy, I rushed out and bought two of these bras after having them recommended by several people.  All I can say is I don't understand what all the fuss is about.  It's basically a very tight sports bra with snaps.  My daughter is now three months old and I find that I wear the Bravados only when my $12 Motherhood Maternity sleep bras are dirty.  I love the Motherhood bras (though I wear the sleep bra all day long).  They are much softer, easier to get on and off and the cups just pull down instead of snapping.  Even with the Bravado, I just pull the cup down instead of snapping it because it is so cumbersome to re-snap.  I won't be buying anymore Bravados.  I'll stick with the Motherhood bras or a cheap regular sports bra from now on 
 There's no denying that the music on these discs is fabulous (although Ishman Bracey is hardly of the same caliber as Skip James or Son House).  No, the problem with these discs (and JSP discs generally) is that the sound quality is terrible.  Obviously any CDs made from old 78s are going to have loud hiss and pops.  That's to be expected.  What's terrible here is that JSP's solution has, from the sound of it, been to lop off the higher end of the sound, with the result that everything sounds muffled and distant.  It's as though they'd put a heavy blanket over your speakers.  I prefer Yazoo's method, which has more hiss and other noise, but infinitely more clarity and presence.  The difference between JSP's version of Booker T. ("Bukka") White and Yazoo's is like night and day: you'd never know what a subtle vocalist and guitarist he actually was if all you heard were the versions on these discs.  It's even worse with the great Skip James, since in his case the originals are in really bad shape: if you're not careful (and JSP is not), you end up with mud instead of genius.  In short, the remastering has real consequences for what you can hear of the music.  All the nuance is absent on these discs.  Get the Yazoo or the Biograph or the Roots-n-Blues ones instead: you'll have more background noise, but you'll also know why people rave over these musicians in the first place 
 The first two short stories seem to have nothing to do with the main story. I couldn't stand Harriman. If an enginneer says it is impossible or the plan needs to be changed, he should agree with them and change it. The story itself is boring because you never learn much about the main characters 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 I read some raving reviews about this book, but I admit, I was quite disappointed.  Factual, I'm sure, but it lacks details and tries to touch on too much without going into any depth.  Many other pregnancy books go into further detail 
 Very disappointing. The only interesting bits are the correspondence section and the chapter written by a survivor of an late 60s-early 70s Canadian experimental psychiatric unit. The rest I found to be an unstructured shambles. The author seems to be have over-stretched himself and there's no kind of any narrative thread. He also seems to be a bit paranoid, making statements like "By definition, all intelligence agents are liars." Also, he seems to dismiss the work of Peter Duesberg by claiming that the publisher of one of Duesberg's books is an "Ultracon".  For what it's worth, I thought that the book Duesberg co-wrote, "Why We Will Never Win the War on AIDS" was excellent, so I guess that may make me an "Ultracon" too?! Also, there's very little about what it says the subject matter is on the cover: "CIA Mind Control Operations in America" and there's no proper bibliography and no index. I would recommend books such as The Search for the Manchurian Candidate or The Men Who Stare at Goats instead, or maybe even just enter "ELF waves" into a search engine 
 bought this machine, based on the reviews on Amazon. It was okay at first. I workout regularly with tapes, outdoors activities and started using the machine twice a week. By the 3rd week it started to make noises as if the wheel was rubbing against the plastic cover of the chain. We tried to see if we can fix it, but it didn't work. I can't use it anymore, mainly because the wheel is not rotating properly and rubber/plastic is rubbing against each other somewhere. You get what you paid for!!! Now I'm looking to invest in something more sturdy. If you exercise once every month this is the machine for you! 
 Be advised, this Software is for a SINGLE USER, only licensed for one computer. I bought this for Home use after using SS% for 2 years and V-Com said it would no longer be supported of 03/06. I installed it on 2 home computers, it worked fine for 4 weeks, then it popped up a Box on my second computer that I couls not use it because it was licensed on another computer, I needed to buy additional license for each computer. When I tried to use it on my Main computer, it popped up the same message. So now it will not work on either computer. I uninstalled it and sent it back. Just because it's Cheap does not mean it's any good 
 I couldn't finish it. I was shocked to find how sad this book was compared to her other books. I mean all the books deal with the Walsh sisters going through a tough time in their life and dealing with difficult times but this was TOO MUCH!!! Seems Keys's dark side came out writing this book. The Walsh family is funny and I like reading about the dynamics within the family but this book was just too dark and dreary. 
 The book is 10% about Jefferson and 90% about the author's far-left political agenda.  I also lost trust in him after reading his criticism of American voters' low turn outs in comparison to Austalia, while failing to mention that in Australia, voting is compulsory.  It makes me wonder how many other self-serving "facts" he used.(? 
 Sort of an odd stew satirizing porn novels and English political extremists featuring an antihero skinhead as the catalyst for many things. Loads of over-the-top sex, violence and ideological debate make for a  somewhat tiresome book. Not likely to appeal to many people 
 There is some decent info, but the worst part is how outdated the numbers and addresses are! You go to call a company and they're gone! Same with addresses--I had many queries returned to me because the company was no longer there. So then, what's the point of the book if you can't get ahold of the people 
 I don't expect Aiken to fool me into thinking that this is Austen's work, but I do expect a competent novel.   This was initially promising, but it begins to descend into melodrama.   The ending is very perfunctory; the heroine finds her "true love" with almost magically with little development of their relationship.   What is there is quite good, it is just not substantial enough for me to believe that the moment Emma catches sight of him, she knows that they are going to be married.  After reading this and Lady Catherine's necklace, Aiken's sequel to Pride and Prejudice, it appears to me that the author is rather bored with romances - I strongly recommend that she try writing something else.   It is possible to write a historical novel of this period without leeching off of Austen.  I strongly recommend John Coates' finishing of this fragment, The Watsons. 
 If the demented 13-year-old offspring of the unholy union between David Lynch and William S. Burroughs were given pen and paper and told to write a trippy story splattered (and I don't choose that word lightly) with blood, gore, zombies and sex, Baby Jesus Butt Plug is what you'd get.  Unfortunately the outcome will still suffer from the story telling of a hormone laden 13-year-old boy.  To illustrate, imagine a depraved pre-pube making up a wild sex-fi story on the fly, while his wide-eyed buddies eat up his every absurd word.  It's stream-of-consciousness story telling with all manner of shock and awe thrown in for effect.  On the other hand, the beginning and end of the story contain flashes of satirical brilliance, biting humor and quirky sci-fi-esque fun to offset the crude writing and story line.  One passage that I found particularly clever and amusing is when the narrator talks of getting a free Baby Jesus Butt Plug from a couple who just want to make sure the BJBP goes to a good home.  He says, "And when they said `a good home' all they really meant was they didn't want to give them to anyone who would stick them in their butts".  I wish Mellick had pursued the socio-religious angle of owning a BJBP that began to take form in the first third of the book.  Or he could have explored the conundrum of losing oneself physically and mentally in a sea of one's own clones.  Either way would have made for a much more powerful and coherent statement.  As it stands, the story begins to provoke and stimulate but quickly deteriorates into a menage-a-bizarre story of teen male angst, desire and fear.  I've read other Mellick works and know that in a lengthier format he can make you blush, throw-up and ponder in the matter of one short paragraph.  So I am comfortable in saying that this is not his best.  However, if you want a unique insight into the stuff of which adolescent boys wet dreams are made, then Baby Jesus Butt Plug will take you there. 
 i bought the book, cause i thought i'd find in it the suday morning messages of Joel Osteen; however it's not that. I am trying to saythe book is not good, but me, i needed the Sunday messages instead. 
 Hendrik Olaerts is 100% correct in his review (19 May 2006), when he describes this book as "outdated." But I feel more needs to be said, and my opinion of this book differs greatly from most of the earlier reviewers. What I fear is that someone might be looking for a good technical book on legacy PCs. Gilster's book would NOT be a good choice!  I've spent most of the last eleven years traveling in third world countries, after leaving a long-term job running and maintaining a PC lab at a community college. I fear that someone working in these more remote places might want to buy this book as a technical introduction to legacy PCs, because such PCs are common in much of the world outside the U.S. and a few other industrialized countries. One can still find PC ATs and even XTs.  Having read the whole book, I feel the author has made a number of technical errors, used misleading and confused explanations for many technical subjects, glossed over numerous important nitty-gritty configuration topics, and dwelt much too often on unnecessarily detailed treatment of relatively trivial matters. For anyone new to PC technology (i.e., anyone without enough technical knowledge to be able to recognize the mistakes and misconceptions), this book would be a very poor choice.  For only about $6 more, you can buy the latest edition (currently 17th) of Scott Mueller's excellent book: Upgrading & Repairing PCs, which I highly recommend. For those interested in legacy systems, Mueller's book has always included a CD with earlier editions in PDF format. You can go as far back in PC history as you like.  Let the uninitiated be forewarned. There's probably a good reason why Wiley Publishing, Inc., has never issued a second edition of this book. I'm used to expecting better than this from Wiley. 
 I was really looking forward to these pods based on the reviews.  Starbucks is good, but I prefer bolder taste.... imagine my surprise when I ordered 2 boxes - both were expired! One expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes.  I admit that Amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping, but geez, 2 years expired!!!  I'm hoping to find local San Diego area shoppe that carries pods so that I can try something different than starbucks 
 Batman Begins is soooo much better than this or any other of the batman movies. Nicholson SUCKED as the Joker. Joker is a comedian who had an accident trying to pull a robbery to help his pregnant wife. HE IS NOT A GANGSTER OR THE ONE WHO KILLED BATMAN'S PARENTS!!!! HE IS A PSYCHO AND BATMAN'S NEMESIS!!! YOU CAN'T KILL HIM OFF!!! HOW STUPID IS THAT?!!! Who came up with that one. Keaton is a sissy, Christian Bale could beat him down!!! Keaton DID NOT have the physical prescence to play Batman. All in all, a joke of a comic movie..But it is better than Daredevil!!!!:- 
 The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great.  Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape.  An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette 
 There seemed to be no beginning or middle.  No idea if there was an end because I couldn't finish it.  I kept nodding off until one of those "cybernotes" numbers popped up, the ones us gentle readers were superciliously instructed to download early in the book, or have "a friend" download them if we didn't have internet access nor particularly cared.  I got no real sense of time and place despite all the references to clothing, food and what came over Mr. Kane's short-wave.  There was little real content and way too many bloated words. I couldn't like any of the characters at all-- the ones that had any development.  Ruby LaPointe is a self-centered, vain whiner and Jean-Luc is an insufferable know-it-all stuck parenting her.  Anne-Marie barely exists unless she's taking tap-dance lessons or Ruby gets aggravated at her for having the nerve to be sleepy at midnight because Ruby just had to drag the kids to a "dish night" movie on a school night.  Does Anne-Marie even go to school and if so, where?  I probably missed that somewhere in the cloud of bloated words that showed me little.  I glanced at the cybernotes.  I don't recommend reading them unless you want to be textually condescended to and don't mind multiple spelling errors (H.L. Menkin and the Barring Land Bridge?) 
 Mr. Dietrich, whatever his academic credentials, joins the ranks of many a China scholar that so romantasizes China that careful research and balance are rejected.  This book is so hopelessly simplistic and over-generalized  that its almost useless; documentation is almost non-existent, and his  analysis of the events of modern China are reduced to a 6th grade level  with scant detail and almost no evidence.  The "achievements" of  the communists in China are very romanticized and if one wishes to really  understand the last 50 years of China's history, this book is not the way.   Save your money 
 Unable to get a message to Amazon any other way.  The last two cds are bad, can't play them on my cd player.  I have sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure, but no one has contacted me.  Very disappointed in the Customer relations of this cd compan 
 I am usually enthralled by Maire Brennan's vocals. This time, I just can't get through the album without losing interest. She has several interesting, very beautiful solo albums.  "Perfect time" comes to mind as an example.  Get that one instead 
 I have read nearly all of Philip Roth's works over the last four months, and this very early work is the only book of his that I didn't like at all. There are NO JEWS in the whole book, and Newark is a thousand miles away! Phil, don't be a shmegeggy, come back to the neighborhood! In "The Facts, a Novelist's Autobiography", Roth reveals that Lucy is modeled after his psychotic first wife, who is much more interestingly rendered in "My Life as a Man". For the best of Roth, try "American Pastoral", "Portnoy's Complaint", any of the Zuckerman series, "Operation Shylock", or "The Counterlife". Just a humble opinion from a Roth Fanatic 
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 I did not realize that this book was based on a television show because I do not watch television. I thought it was about debunking urban legends such as alligators in New York sewers and such; I was not expecting a lot of scientific proofs of how balloons fly and so on. I definitely wasted my money on this one 
 This story starts out pretty successfully. We are shown the life of the brothers in the abbey and their daily routines. This seems to set the tone for a dull plot. Then, the reader experiences the sickness of a brother of the abbey and the mood of the story changes from the placidity of the abbey life to the chaos of trying to help the brother. This livens the book up some, but not enough. Very few exciting events happen between that point until the death of Rhisiart. After Rhsisiart's death, we are thrown back into that state of low-action; only this time, with the added commotion of trying to figure out the murderer's identity. The ending wasn't a huge shocker. It was almost too predictable from the beginning. So, all in all, I would not recommend this book unless you wanted to be easily put to sleep 
 I got this puzzle for my  1 1/2 yr old.  The sound does not work so I'm basically considering this toy as defective.  I likely won't return it b/c I don't want to deal with the hassle 
 Year 1 was good.  Can't complain too much about it considering the price.  Then started year two.  I have to unplug the darn thing at least 10 times a day since the router just dies all of a sudden.  I don't know what to think.  I blame myself for buying the cheapest thing on the shelf but then for every person that raves about the Linksys there is another person that says its garbage.  I think a company out there needs to be build a solid router and not really worry about price because if it'll work and continue to work I think we'll all pay the higher price.  In short I wouldn't buy this router.  Pay more and buy the Linksys, I guess, but its a toss-up on what your experience will be with any wireless router *sigh* I just want a product that works 
 This book is a rip off.  It gives recipes for foods that are already low in carbohydrates, and tells you very little about how to use alternative ingredients to make low carb dishes out of foods that would otherwise be high carb.  The worst thing about the book is that the low carb ingredients recommended are all made by the Atkins company.  Atkins emerged from bankruptcy in February of '06 with a new product line of 60 shakes and bars, and dropped the other 280 products they sold.  Most of the recipes in this book are based on products that are no longer made or sold.  It is, of course, possible to find or create other recipes.  But to do that, you wouldn't need this book 
 I have used System Works on my computer since 2000. The 2007 version is nowhere as good as the older ones. They have deleted many of the "real" diagnostic features (Registry Optomizer), dummed down the rest, and added (rather forced) an auto-load Norton Protection Center that takes over the Windows Security Center and cannot be easily unloaded. Software should be made to be user-friendly ... this version is nothing like the previous ones 
 this was certainly not one of Cornwell's best works.  IT was almost like a couple of possible novels rolled into one.  It read like a draft for a novel rather tahn a complete novel 
 This book is disappointing. I don't think Broderick understands the technology or its social impact, which is a major problem considering the book is an attempt to explain the causes, and effect on our lives, of "the spike." He quotes a lot of people who are smarter than he is and basically regurgitates their ideas without interesting analysis. And it's a lazy author who quotes paragraphs and long passages from articles and lectures instead of writing his own description and citing the source. Also, the author seems strangely arrogant for someone who almost gets it. He explains that everyone else calls nanotechnology "nanotechnology or nano-tech, but I call it minting." Hunh? Maybe everyone else calls this book good or interesting, but I call it boring (which, given the subject matter, it shouldn't be) and a waste of time for anyone who has thought about this stuff for more than a nanosecond. Or a minto-second. Or what I call speck-time 
 This collection of short essays he published in an English paper (and meant for an English audience) seem to miss the mark for American readers.  It's as if he published this because he needed money.  There was nothing original in this book, nothing really funny and what few authentically funny parts there were seemd trite and at times exaggerated.  I got tired of this book half-way through and gave up 
 I would just like all readers to be aware of the fact that in RURAL areas of Pakistan are practices with such early marriages. People who are uneducated and change the face of Islam make up the rules in these provinces. I wish that the author could have acknowledged the fact that a strewed picture of Islam was shown because of the way it was misused. Women aren't treated like meat in Islam, and not all of Pakistan has such old-style rules. It is only the rural areas as I mentioned; the areas where the majority of people are illiterate. As a female of Pakistani descent, it bothered me to read a review saying that 'the real islam' was shown. I hope this reaches the author and shows her how disturbing it is to all Pakistani Muslims when characters who don't know the real beliefs and teachings of Islam are called 'religious.' Thank you 
 Sometimes it works ok. Sometimes it stops swinging for no reason. sometimes turning on the mobile will instead turn on the music. it always makes a gringing noise when swinging. if it worked like it should it would be a great product. i like the stars projected below- when they work 
 For a reason that completely eludes me, the manufacturer decided to go against the mainstream and glue the flaps on the inside of the envelope.  All other brands are glued on the outside.  The main disadvantage is that CDs are harder to insert into the envelopes: they tend to get stuck between the imperfectly glued flaps and the back of the envelope.  This design also offers less protection to the CD, as the flaps rub harder against it when sliding it in or out, and may even scratch it a bit.  Other than that, the envelopes are okay, but the only reason why you'd buy these instead of the cheaper Fellowes product is the shipping cost 
 We have watched others follow this advice and then with all their good efforts still lose. We need more input into the process. Finding and trusting a good attorney just isn't enough. We are going to keep looking 
 Intensely homophobic, heterosexist, and hateful, this film represents the twisted fears and logic of the early panic stage of the disease in the 1980s. It was a time when the public was eager to pin the epidemic squarely on the shoulders of gay men, blaming antisocial "AIDS carriers" for carelessly or intentionally infecting chaste wives and innocent babies. It was a time when the public blamed AIDS on lust-driven, irresponsible gay men and cheating husbands. The film is pretentious and overbearing in its failed attempt to masquerade as a sophisticated inquiry into moral responsibility in the age of HIV. It reinforces the simplistic outdated idea that those who are infected with HIV can be neatly separated into the categories of "deserving" or "undeserving" - immoral monsters and their innocent victims sitting together on death row. Twenty years ago, perhaps this film would have its place as a document reflecting our social ignorance and failures in coping with a new epidemic. We did not know then that HIV was a predominantly heterosexual global pandemic. Today this film is a sophomoric attempt to assign blame and reinforce old prejudices about HIV and HIV+ people. Most importantly, HIV is no longer a death sentence to Americans who discover their status and enter medical treatment early. As someone who counsels and tests hundreds of people for HIV infection every year, I would not recommend this film to anyone seeking knowledge or entertainment 
 This product is not for the heavy handed  after 2 weeks of use one of the slots was non functional because spring leaf to hold the card against the contacts some how managed to get bent into the path of the card, and seeing that the slot is for a flash card it is almost impossible to get any tool to fit to do any 'repairs'. on the bright side it did work with the stated flash types 
 Let me preface this very negative review with this: I love Kafka.  He's a great author and the shortcomings of this book, this book in particular, are not his.  That said, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!  Whatever archaic methods the publisher, Schocken, uses to bind its books is in desperate need of revitalization.  Within 1 week of purchasing this book it was threatening to fall to pieces.  Within 2 weeks it became 4 volumes--it yet threatens to break into a weekly series.  If you enjoy breaking the binding on your paperbacks for easy reading beware, this book is poorly bound and breaking the binding, or even opening it much past 180 degrees, will cause the book to break asunder.    Buy these stories, just don't buy them in this book.  Look elsewhere even if you must buy 2 or 3 other books to get everything 
 This book is a BIG disappointment and not at all user friendly.  The first 90 pages are the author's observations and opinions on weight loss.  The calorie count portion is difficult, if not impossible to use.....instead of being individually alphabetically listed, items are classified and then alphabetized and the classification is not noted at the top of the page.  "Ultimate"....I don't think so 
 This is a children's book written by Lance Armstrong's first wife.  I did not know this when I bought it for my adult son.  My fault--I should have done more research 
 I found this book quite tedious, since the author makes the fundamental mistake of thinking the subject of the book should be herself instead of her work.  There is almost no information on forensic anthropology; her descriptions of cases are very short and center mainly on how she felt about them, rather than what the actual details were.  From the cover and the blurbs I expected actual case histories; the book doesn't deliver.  The book as written would really only be interesting to people who know the author personally 
 This wanna be director obviously tries every cliche in the book and tries to gain credibility by using over the hill non talents like Ryan Oneal. Plain and simple....just pass this one up 
 Although I enjoyed the story itself, this deluxe edition really didn't do anything for me. The book is 9.5 x 13 which makes it awkward to handle, hard to read and difficult to store. Fernando Duval did the illustrations and are alright at best. Supposed to be limited to 1000 copies. The book is autographed by Duval but not numbered. Not that it would make any difference. Overpriced, stick to the regular hardbound edition unless you are into odd-sized books. 
 I didn't really like this one. In a way its worth reading as a coming out story and the writing was good enough to keep me reading. But the story...not so much. I found alot of the stuff that happened wierd at best and ridiculous at worst. And the end {bites}. I mean I got to the end and was like...um...ok...? I can't say I regretted reading it but at the same time its not something I need to remember. It jumps around alot, and it lacks valid plot points as far as I'm concerned. But I think its the kind of book you need to make up your own mind about 
 ...Or the other reviews.  Those reviews probably came from someone in their camp.  When I first saw these two, I said "no they did not!"  If you go to a music  store it n the rap section and look through it, you will find knock-offs of known and real rappers.  These guys have their names for the simple reason of trying to confuse a would be buyer of Mobb Deep.  These two clowns are nothing more than sucker MC's trying to get a dollar off of someone else's hard earned names.  If you are new to hip-hop or just young, there IS a reason rappers used to talk about something called a sucker MC(a fake rapper, someone without skills, someone you hear and you know they should not be rapping) and these clowns are it 
 This one has none of the charm of its predecessor, and the central conceit of the book -- that humans are populating the galaxy with designer cultures concocted by scholarly fanatics -- here seems much less believable. Our heroes, Giraut and Margaret, are assigned to an inhospitable planet to defuse a cultural war, but they mostly just kill time while events take place around them, and their marital problems make a dreary subplot, hinging as they do on a "surprise" that most readers will see coming a long way off 
 This is a book worth buying only if you are a singer looking for melody and text to jazz/dixie tunes. The chord progressions are weak, with many faults and flaws. The lineup is poor as well, as the compilation process has forced the songs to be typed with no concern to form etc. No four-bars-per-line here. No book to bring along to the gig, but a great resource for old-and-nearly forgotten tunes 
 This book, like many such collections (especially those that bring together papers from a conference), is tremendously uneven in quality.  There are a few good essays here--and they are by persons who have written illuminating and substantial pieces in the past.  And then there are a lot of weak essays here--pieces which do not get de Beauvoir right or which attempt without success to advance certain themes that are supposed present in her work.  The volume's introduction is especially flawed in this respect--as a piece of intellectual history or contextualization it is not bad (though not original either), but as a piece of philosophy it is . . . well, not philosophical.  Volumes by Arp, Berghoffen, and Bauer measure up very well to this collection 
 The magazine is not bad, marginal at best. To my surprise, I am now a member of a club. I also was surprised to receive the first of a series of gardening books (mine to keep for a small fee). Needless to say, the description for the magazine was not forthcoming with the additional items and obligations (mailing the book back, etc).  All I wanted was the magazine. I don't like to feel like I was taken advantage of. Please pass on this one. THere are plenty of other good gardening magazines to order. 
 While I find it exciting to see the possibilities of this new frontier in art, I was disappointed with this book. It is packed with techniques that require expensive printers, hard-to-find art products and the use of outside service bureaus. Even with my experience in printmaking, painting and Photoshop, there is little here of practical benefit to my own collage and mixed media art 
 With so many of my favorite artists I really wanted to like this.  I'm glad I spent the money as I believe in the cause and I really appreciate artists who are politically active.  However, this is really just not that good.  APC's cover of "Peace, Love and Understanding" is so much stronger, Serj sounds soooo bad on "Where the streets have no name", I could go on...  This is really all over the map.  
 First of all, the writing style. Larson's writing style is easy to follow, but the book itself is badly edited, with lots of padding. For example, we learn on P.69 about the 25 day DMA and two pages later the 200 DMA is presented. I had hoped for a better discussion of TC2000's proprietary indicators, MS, TSV and BOP, but the book presents a rehash of the documentation supplied with the software.  More important is the book's target audience. Don't even bother buying this book uless you intend to use Worden's TC2000 charting software. All discussions, indicators and charts are explained using this software as reference. On the other hand, if you have this software, you presumably already have a good understanding of the standard and proprietary indicators supplied with the package, and don't need lengthy tutorials on moving averages and relative strength. In this respect, the book's audience is unclear.  For me, what the book missed was material for the advanced TC2000 user, such as using the software's scanning and programming language capabilities. I assume that Larson himself is an advanced TC2000 user, it would have been nice if he had included some trading strategies making use of the software's advanced capabilities. Sadly, all this is missing 
 i should have previewed the selections on this collection more closely.  the quality of the recordings is fair to poor and the actual selections are uninspiring, considering the wealth of classics generated during this period of history.  in sum, there are much better anthologies out there than this one 
 Look, I'm a Tom Waits fan, but most of this album was pretty inaccessible to me.   When you get to a certain level as a musician and song writer you get to do an album like this because your recording label probably has to let you.   Tom has probably wanted to do this for a long time,  but I think he is mostly talking  (muttering actually) to himself here.  If you are really, really, really into his work this may be signature stuff, but I think most people will not be able to get much from this.  I don't regret buying it, because I like to look into his pretty amazing head, and if you have a copy it will no doubt be a collector's item in 20 years---but it will be because you will be one of only a few dozen owners 
 In WPF, Plantinga tries to provide an account of warrant that is superior to rivals such as Goldman's process reliabilism.  The work suffers from the following defects.  First, he is too quick in dismissing rival accounts.  Second, his arguments against evolutionary-naturalism will only convince those who already think that evolutionary naturalism is false.  Third, while he is quick to dismiss rival views, his own positive answers to philosophical problems are entirely unsatisfactory.  Consider his 'solution' to the Benacerraf problem.  It seems that mathematical statements refer to abstract objects.  It also seems that there must be a causal connection between our belief forming processes and the objects of belief if those beliefs are to be thought of as viable candidates for knowledge.  Plantinga says that this is not a problem for the theist who is willing to say that mathematical principles are structures of the divine mind since surely the connection between God and God's subjects is not problematic.  How one could think that Benacerraf's problem is a genuine one and that this is an adequate solution is beyond me.  While his WCD is to be recommended to those wanting an introduction to epistemology, this book is of limited merit 
 This book is a major disappointment. The images are too dark, the style is overly contrived and the subjects are likely to please only those who are who like their women to look like men and vice versa.  The only reason I  rated it one star is because there is no lower rating 
 I came to this book with an open mind on the prompting of an offhand remark from George Harrison about the author knowing more about him (Harrison) than he knew himself.  I was quickly disabused of any notion I may have harboured about theis being a more authoritative book than most when I discovered that the early pages were very reminiscent of the Hunter Davies biography. Things looked a little brighter upon consideration of the years that followed after the last concert that the Beatles, as such, played in San Francisco, rather than the rooftop performance in Saville Row in London of which this author says very little.  Doubts began to creep in as the story (I wanted to say action but given the nature of what followed that was not a good choice of words) developed in the depths of Oxfordshire at George's little place nestling to the rear of Henley Town Hall.  I cannot vouch for the authenticity of much of the description of the secret world of George Harrison but therein lies the main problem with this biography. It is almost the construction of a straw man with the intention of pulling him down shortly afterwards. It reads almost as if the author claims friendship and loyalty to the central figure in the book while at the same time doing him down for apparent breaches of his own ethical code. He makes much of Harrison's Hindu beliefs yet appears so judgemental about the use of drugs or repeated tales of secret relationships which may or may not have any basis in fact.  A great deal of prose in the later chapters is devoted to the relationship of George Harrison and the devotees of the Radha Krishna Temple but one wonders why the focus shifts really away from Harrison to this particular group.  The sources which are acknowledged in the end are quite extensive which aroused suspicion in my own mind over the degree of closeness to his subject that the author really had. After examining them it does seem that the author did not have as much access as one might think.  At the end of it all it was like one feels like one has had a Chines meal - the feeling of being full has already gone and one is feeling hungry again.  I must admit it was an easy read where the prose flows well. It has all the ingredients of a soap opera, constructed characters who we learn more about as we proceed through the book, a good sprinkling of titllation and salacious moments to keep our interest and dramatic events at frequent intervals. I was more disturbed by the inadequate treatment of Harrison's throat problems which are mentioned but which one would have expected a more serious in-depth and sympathetic treatment,  All in all if it is titillation you want and you have a long bus ride to undertake, you could do a lot worse than read this. If, on the other hand you want to learn more about the quiet one, then you should look elsewhere 
 Nobody ever wants to talk about the Serbs' point of view. If you watch a movie by a Hungarian film-maker name "Children of Kosovo: 2000" you get a real sense of what happened in Kosovo. This movie gives the view of both Albanian and Serbian children that live in the city of Kosovska Mitrovica 
 not very helpful compared to the textbook I have. It has a lot of problems and worked out solutions sure, but not a whole lot on explaining the concepts behind them in words 
 This is an order I have been waiting to get since I order it on 1/23/07.  I ordered other items with this, I have received them all except this order of Pike Flannel full sheet set, forest green. I have been e-mail that they make take as long as the end of March or the 1st of April. They are already paid for and I would like to know if they are being sent soon. I'am an employee at the Chambersburg, Pa. Amazon.com I know we like to make are cumtomers # 1. Thank-You Lisa Barnhar 
 This book is certainly not for amatures.  This book was so full of technical mumbo jumbo and wiring diagrams that I thought I needed a degree in electrical enginering to understand.  This book is NOT for beginers.  The true content of the book is there but it's garbled and hard to, for an amature to understand and I personally have installed a stereo in my own car and was very confused.  If you can interpret electrical diagrams and can deal with the lack of color, pictures, common language, clearly defined definition,  you may enjoy this book but if you dont then definetly look elsewher 
 I give this doll 2 stars because at least she was very well presented in the box and she brought delight to my 7 year old for a day.  After the 1st day, Suzie no longer worked. We tried replacing the batteries but to no avail. We should have heeded the advice of some of the other reviewers.  If you want Suzie for her looks, great. But if you actually want a doll that works, consider a different purchase 
 I got this toaster cause it was a good brand and on sale. I thought it looked really nice and it does go well with the other appliances in my kitchen, but it doesn't work worth a damn. SInce day one my toast has been unevenly toasted. And even at the highest setting, my bread is more slightly warm and over-dry than actually toasted. I like the bagel setting, but don't use it because I always forget which direction to put the bagel in... Pretty much, I really wish I had not bought this toaster. I am amazed that the company still sells it actually. 
 I've had this coffeemaker for two weeks. I bought it because I had an old Mr. Coffee that worked fine, but was white and stained.  I liked that this was black and looked sleek.  The very second time I used it, the off button stuck, so you can no longer turn off the machine, but have to wait for it to turn itself off.  Also, EVERY pot has grounds in it.  I'm using the filters that came with it, and have never even filled it to capacity, and I can't figure out why there are ALWAYS grounds in my coffee.  Piece of junk.  Don't buy it 
 This is completely junk.  Don't buy it.  It colapsed in a 5 mph wind (with out the sides attached) 
 I bought this book because it was advertised as Bob Harpers book.  Needless to say, it's not.  It isn't Jillian Michaels book either.    The book is fun and there are lots of pictures of Bob, but no real weight loss advice that amounts to a program of any kind.  I like the book because I am a fan of the show and it does have some motivational anecdotes, but I wouldn't recommend it as a weight loss plan.  
 We were very unhappy with this toy. The speakers were distored and the music sounded awfu 
 Irma in the 1960s [2 and half stars]   This compilation, an updated and expanded version of a 1983 LP compilation (tracks 1-16), features 24 songs recorded 1962-1966 on Imperial, Brandy, and Minit labels.  This is a slightly superior compilation to Razor & Tie's 1996 compilation "Sweet Soul Queen of New Orleans: The Irma Thomas Collection".   TIME IS ON MY SIDE consists of 24 songs from 1963-1966; songs are not in chronological order.  Disc packaged in black jewel case; total running time: 65:50.  Booklet includes an essay by Clive Richardson, two b&w photos, and songwriting credits (recording years provided on back cover; chart positions, albums of origin, producer credits, and musician personnel are not included).  Sound quality is decent.    The disc closes with "It's a Man's-Woman's World Parts 1 & 2", which is the same recording as "It's a Man's Woman's World (Pt. 1)", the latter appearing on the "Sweet Soul Queen of New Orleans" disc.  Both are the same length and include the last note of another song at the beginning of the track.   For her Soul recordings, and I would contend best work, get "A Woman's Viewpoint: Essential 70s Recordings" [2006].   
 If your main objective, is the study of human relationships, social rapports between humans, and conquering and seducing other people, this movie is for you.  Not an embarrassing movie, at all, for any of the actors. Just, a nutty story, and enfatuation of the author of the script with people, relationships, seduction, etc.   This is not to say that the above aspects are unimportant. Not true. Just that, perhaps a movie about such a theme might be more fun for some people than others 
 I read this collection of life stories and events with an admitedly negative attitude toward it because of my dislike of the first book of this collection.  Nevertheless, I thought that this volume was even worse than it's predicessor.  I don't believe that this book has any literary value to it at all.  It most certainly didn't make me feel better about my life.  Personally I believe that these events are things that happen to everyone in their lifetime.  Merely reading about them AGAIN had even less appeal to me than it did the first time 
 That should have been the title of this movie as it describes the use that the talents of a high-profile cast & normally respectable director are put to.  Another possible title is "It's All About the Groceries", 'cause I'm hard-pressed to think of a reason, other than money, why anybody involved would've signed on to this project.  It starts promisingly, with atmospheric shots of the Golden Gate Bridge rising through fog over San Francisco.  The camera plunges through the fog to hone in on the image of a knife being held to a woman's throat. Once again, Ashley Judd is a victim in jeopardy . . .so it seems.  Then the 'victim' proceeds to open a can of whoop-a** all over the perpetrator and beats him to a bloody pulp.  One starts to think that this might be getting good, especially after Ashley's apparently super-competent police detective is revealed to have anger issues, a pretty hefty drinking problem, a propensity for picking up strangers in bars & having rough sex with them . . .and some grisly skeletons in her closet.  I was interested to see what Judd would do with this opportunity to play a character with a dark side instead of her usual noble victim.  Unfortunately, not enough.  Ms. Judd is a luminously beautiful actress, even with a severe short haircut meant to make her look tough, I suppose. It is not hard to believe that men would be drawn to her like bugs to a flame.  She has not developed the range of emotion to really carry a complex character like Jessica, though, playing it distressingly one-note.  Is she ecstatic?  Depressed?  In a drug-induced stupor?  The way Judd plays it, it could be any, or all, of the above.  I like Ashley Judd, but she is in danger of turning into the female version of Richard Gere--a performer with real potential who keeps choosing flashy junk-food roles that do not challenge her talent.  "Kiss the Girls" was the high-water mark & each subsequent film has been weaker than the last.  This movie is worth the price of a rental, but I'd take a pass on purchasing it.  For a better treatment of female-cop-with-dark-secrets-and-Issues, & a stronger movie all-around, I recommend "Murder by Numbers" with Sandra Bullock 
 This book has lots of platitudes and little substance.  The author frequently refers to various seminars and coaching that she provides, which is distracting and self-serving.  The book is poorly organized and doesn't have much concrete advice.  Don't waste your time on it 
 Elizabeth Berg has written several humane, touching, so real they hurt novels about relationships: patient/nurse (the affecting "Never Change"), families ("Say When"): and she's  written them with uncommon grace, knowledge and understanding of what makes Us tick. The genesis of "We are All Welcome Here" was a letter from a fan, Marianne Raming asking Berg to write about her Mother who was stricken with Polio before Marianne was born. In the prologue to this novel, Berg at first recoils then warms to the idea, telling her fan: "(your) Mother's circumstances will serve only as inspiration for a different story that I will make up...if you want her real story to be told, contact a non-fiction writer." Unfortunately, Berg may have had better luck writing this book in the non-fiction form for as it is "WAAWH" is mostly flat and uninvolving except that the central story: a Mother trying everything that she can to raise her child despite being incapacitated by Polio and living in an Iron Lung, is without a doubt rife with drama and tension. Berg's novel isn't.  What it is, is flat and oddly enough very much like reportage.Berg, in her quest to avoid the trappings of non-fiction, falls victim to them nonetheless with the "just the facts" style of prose she adopts here. And then I read this gorgeous scene at the very end of the novel: "It's everywhere, she said and those were the last words I heard her speak. She meant redemptive beauty, I think. Despite her many obstacles, what my mother succeeded best in doing was appreciating the many forms of beauty in life...as well as its possibilities. And she relished perhaps more than any other mother could the growth of her daughter, seeing in me a part of herself set free." If only this novel as a whole could have been as elegant, as perceptive, as intelligent as these last few words on the last page of this book. 
 while not one of his best novels, tommyknockers was much better than this waste of time! jimmy smits does his best,but the underwritten screenplay does him and this movie about dead aliens and the thought control they have over a small new england town is just not worth the trouble!! SKIP IT!!!! 
 I like ATL i think there album Uncle Samz Curze is a underated classic. But LEGENDZ???? not a classic, not even mediocre, da beatz sound strained and da lyricz are tired. This only getz 2 starz cuz of da song Adventurez Of... easily the bezt cut on here, and one of da bezt of dere career. If u truly love ATL cop this, if u dont, find a way to get Adventurez Of... and leave this alone 
 Ok so when I first started reading the book I thought all right this is ok.  And the book went along and I still thought it was ok good at times but just a decent book.  Then I finished the book and I realized something.  Nothing had happened really.  There was nothing to tell you what the overall plot would be for the triolgy it was just them going from once place to the other.  Its like oh there is a ghost we should follow it, yeah because that is such a smart thing to do.  This book just annoyed me so much because nothing happend in it.  I don't really understand why so many people love this book.  This book is average at best and not much else.      
 A carjacking case and a missing 4-year-old boy trigger tension in a fictional town of New Jersey. "Freedomland" which is based on Richard Price's book and stars Samuel L. Jackson and Julianne Moore, could have been a gritty thriller with a better hand like Spike Lee (who did "Clockers" based on Price's book). Unfortunately, in spite of its occasionally interesting moments, "Freedomland" falls flat with lack of sure-handed direction.  Julianne Moore plays Brenda whose four-year-old son is missing. Police detective Lorenzo played by Samuel L. Jackson thinks something is wrong with her testimony as to how her boy was kidnapped, but finding the missing child is not easy as the injured mother suffers severely from the shock and her traumatic past. The film also involves several scenes of racially-triggered violence.  Every part of the film is decently made. They are shot with authentic locations, good supports (from Edie Falco, Ron Eldard and William Forsyth) and intense acting from Moore. She is so intense at times that some may think she is overdoing it, but anyway she is credible as tormented mother. Still something is not just right like Brenda's testimony.  [CLUMSY STORYTELLING] So many things are going on at one time. The film at first centers around the mystery of a missing boy, and then it raises a question about the conflict among the Afro-Americans. Instead of developing these ideas, director Joe Roth introduces new topics one after another into the story. As a result the mystery of the kidnapped boy never becomes intriguing. Lorenzo's inner struggle as black detective is not explored enough. You expect surprises from the solutions of the mystery, or cathartic effect after seeing tense acting from the leads. Sorry but you cannot have either of them.  "Freedomland" includes more than one socially relevant issue. Film's "Friends of Kent" is based on the real group "Friends of Jennifer for Missing Children," volunteer group that searches missing persons. Edie Falco's character is based on Donna Cutugno, leader of the group "Friends of Jennifer for Missing Children," who also appears as Elaine in the film. Here "Freedomland" is given a chance to be original, but Joe Roth somehow wastes it with among the jumbled storytelling. The film has excellent ingredients to make a superb thriller, which you don't see in "Freedomland. 
 I would rate this zero stars but the system will not allow me to do this - hence the one star.I bought this watch for my wife as a 2006 Christmas present. The crystal subsequently cracked due to temperature changes. The elegant design of a thin gold rim holding the crystal cannot stand large rapid temperature differences. I went to my local jeweler who was very familiar with the crystal issue with Skagen watches. I called Skagen, seems they are aware of this problem too. However the only option offered was to send the watch back for repair -pay $25.00 for repair of the crystal, pay $8.95 for s&h and then pay insurance and return postage. As I paid $65.00 for the watch I consider this a total ripoff. I would not buy another product from Skagen and recommend that Amazon discontinue selling any Skagen products until they become a responsible corporate partner. It is a pretty watch and seemed like a good deal - but it is not turning out that way. Or you can buy this watch and only wera it in warm climates 
 J. L. Carr's A Month In The Country (1980), which is set in the 1920s, is the story of Tom Birkin, a budding restorer who accepts a job uncovering a church mural in a small Yorkshire village, a village predictably populated by greenhorns, cranks, and eccentrics of all stripes and colors. What is immediately apparent is that the novel is not a product of the earlier era in which it is set, nor is it an attempt to recreate the style of the period.   Though Carr attempts high British humor in the grand 20th century tradition of P. G. Wodehouse, Evelyn Waugh, Ivy Compton-Burnett, Stevie Smith, Denton Welch, and Muriel Spark, much of what is supposed to be funny throughout the novel is in fact only obvious, smug, and not nearly as intelligent or crisp as Carr apparently believes it to be. Thus, when Birkin's employer warns him about a scythe that hangs in the outdoor privy, Birkin speculates whether "it was the loss of life or only manhood he was concerned about," and most of the attempted humor continues at about this level.   A Month In The Country might have been saved by a compelling plot or theme, or simply a collection of perceptive insights uniquely expressed, but none of these elements are present, and so what little story there is merely plods cutely along. Whether is it is Carr himself, or merely Tom Birkin, who is so self-satisfied is difficult to say; either way, the combination of the anemic first person narrative and the idiosyncratic attempts at humor, in which the author indulges himself at every turn, sink the book quickly.  
 I recently attended the Ashes and Snow exhibition in New York. The show was good,if a bit reptative. Its location, The Noamadic Museum is an engineering marvel and seems more like a gothic cathedral  than shipping containers (Frankly seeing the photos in the building is a truly awesome esperience). After the show I went to book store to pick up the catalog and found it was selling on site for $130. This is way way too much money for what you're getting. Like all of the materials for sale connected to the exhibit you're paying for the presentation rather than the pictures themselves, all of which are reproduced in a much too small size. What you're paying for is the binding and while the binding might, with some better interior material, be worth $130 or more, here its simply a major rip off. Gregory Colbert has those of us who like his work over a barrel and he's going to squeeze every last penny from us. While I do like the images, I can not recommend anyone buying the catalog, or any other material connected with the show, at the wildly inflated prices they are asking.  Go see the show instead, its only twelve bucks and you get to see the glorious space they've built to house it 
 this book is amaterurishly written and edited and poorly final-proofed. organization is helter skelter.  biggest complaint is way too much fluff.  in fact, the book is mostly fluff.  very little on scoring and strategy other than the obvious qualitative stuff.  hotels.  how the riders get on the bus. did you really want to know the secrets of the podium girls?  well there aren't any. but the writers seem to think you want to know that.  maybe you do.  a MUCH better source for everything technical about the Tour is in Wikipedia.  save your money and shelf space and look it up 
 I have a problem with Bakke's idea of "fun."  Fun, by his definition is a free-for-all.  For example, he feels that an organization's "amount of fun" is determined by "the number of individuals allowed to make decisions" (99).  I agree that sharing information "reinforces the feeling of community" (98), but I don't agree with his suggestion that leaders should "ask for as much advice as possible before making a decision" (88).  "Sharing information" and "seeking advice" are two different things.    Bakke misuses the analogy of a child jumping into the arms of a parent by stating that the same is required of leaders to jump into the arms of the subordinate (103).  It is the subordinate who should trust the leader.  In one section of the book, he stresses the importance of "asking for as much advice as possible before making a decision."  But in another section he shares the story of his administrative assistant who "routinely checks with the office accountant to see how her decisions would affect the budget, but no higher approval is necessary" (apparently no other advice is needed as well) (79).  His idea of leadership lacks strength by decentralizing decision-making to others.   In his postscript, Bakke discusses Biblical leadership.  At first glance, what he writes sounds Biblical-"serve the people they lead," and "allow followers to use their talents effectively" (261), but his overall idea of leadership is not Biblical.  For instance, he says, "The Creation story does not assign people, even leaders, the responsibility of `managing' other people" (261)- I wonder what he thought God meant in Genesis 3:16 when He told Eve, "he will be your master."  The Bible doesn't use the word, "manage," but God entrusted leaders to people throughout the Bible-that's why there were judges in the OT.  I don't think the Israelites would've left the wilderness if Moses asked "as many as possible" before making a decision 
 Aleksandra is obviously involved in the publication of this book somehow. Why this moron feels the defensive need to attack other reviewers is beyond me, and downright pathetic. Why do you have to call other people uneducated? Isn't the average reader allowed to post their opinions? You're a desperate loser and a pathetic excuse for a fellow human.   My wife and I bought this book last year hoping it would give us some basic answers to some very basic questions. I agree that the fertilization of a hamster egg is of little consequence to the average couple. We found our money was better spent on "Taking Control of Your Fertility." It offered us very basic information. We were pregnant the following month. Spend your money there. Don't listen to the agenda-pushing moron below!  
 The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it.  It's a dud in my opinion 
 I rented this, and once downloaded it stated that my client license was up.  Tech support couldnt help me, and instead just refunded my money.  It was nothing but a waste of time 
 Such beautiful pictures, and they are great inspiration. Makes you want to spend the day in the kitchen.  There it ends. I tried the white chocolate-candy cane recipe twice.  It just doesn't work.  We (I have a professional kitchen) added flour to make a manageable batter, but after baking could not get them off the baking sheet.  More adjustments, and finally succeeded in making a cookie that no one liked.  We also tried the two layer desert with brownie bottom.  Expensive mess.  The  beautiful photographs are worthy of framing or put the whole book on your coffee table. 
 Get ordained in something!?!?!?!?!  Interview the town hermit for the local newspaper!?!?!?!?!  Need I say more 
 If I didn't know any better, I'd swear this was a book written by a Satanist. The author seems to be rejoicing in the prospect of armageddon, including mountains being blown up and the destruction of all the world's cities. I bought a tatty copy for one penny and I was somewhat surprised to see that by 1973 it was on its 27th printing. It seems reasonable then to assume that Mr Lindsey's views are fairly representative of mainstream America.   If that's the case then that suggests that plenty of Americans are keen for armageddon to erupt in the Middle East so that the "good Christians" may be whisked off for a private audience with J. Christ while the rest of the population burns.   I would recommend this book to all Israelis. In his book The Last Days of Israel, Zionist author Barry Chamish declared that Israel's main enemies were European Socialists. Well, I reckon that Hal Lindsey and his fans present a greater threat. It seems likely that if the supposed Temple of Solomon is not rebuilt and Israel isn't annihilated then a lot of committed Christians are going to be most upset. The bit of "good news" in Lindsey's book is that the surviving Israelis will convert to Christianity with such passion that they will be like "144,000 Billy Grahames".   It seems that committed Christians are in charge of both the UK and US governments and that the US government could be described as a theocracy. I wonder if the theocrats share the views of Mr Lindsey, who states in this book that each Arab generation hates Israel more than the one before, which would be good news as it would mean that they would be more likely to attack and initiate armageddon and cause the return of Jesus Christ.  Russia is portrayed as the villain of the book, but "Red China" and the "Red Chinese" get a look-in in a chapter entitled "The Yellow Peril".   The book however does contain one true statement, on page 120: "Religion is a great blinder of the minds of men." and frankly, I hope "the rapture" does happen soon. The sooner that people like Hal Lindsey are whisked off the face of the Earth, the greater the likelihood for peace in the world 
 Someone reported all my 3 negative reviews of Daniel Silva books and got them removed! Hmm, I wonder who that could be.   I am rather annoyed at this because I spent quite a lot of time detailing why I didn't like one of the books, reasonably, I thought. Apparently, someone had decided that they did not follow the review guidelines. I used no profanities. OK, there were some spoilers, but not more than I usually read in other reviews. Not single worded, no phone numbers, no solicitations, etc. Maybe whoever it was just didn't like my negative review. Well, the last time I checked, the 1st amendment still applies in this country.  OK, so let me try to post another review of why I didn't like this book without violating any review guidelines, and I'm not going to spend 30 mins on it like last time.   I thought the book was very poorly written and very boring. I struggled through 1/3 of the book but the author could not capture my attention and I decided not to continue to the end. I've read a couple of other Daniel Silva books, but neither one of them could change my mind that he is an author that I don't like. I will not be buying any more of his books 
 My introduction to Borges was through the collection Labyrinths. I immediately fell in love with the stories, the prose, the poetry, and so went on to buy this complete volume. While it is nice to have all Borges's stories in one place, and at a reasonable price, the language doesn't really hold up for me. The translation is... well, not sloppy, but too simple, like those childrens' versions of classic novels they pressed on you in 5th grade. I have nothing against Andrew Hurley, but his translation of Borges leaves me cold. I'd give Borges 5 stars out of 5, but Hurley? No more than 2. 
 Unless you love the look of this pepper grinder, I'd suggest you look elsewhere. When compared to a generic grinder, this product produces inferior and very inconsistent grinds. I've gone so far as to grind peppercorns onto a white sheet of paper to look at them. With this grinder you'll always get a huge variation in the grind. Some of the pieces of the peppercorns will be large enough that it would give anyone pause to wonder whether foreign matter had somehow entered the dish. The oval top is quite slippery and when you tighten down the top nut to reduce the grind to something that will prove acceptable, you'll have trouble turning it. Not recommended 
 I really like Thomas Moore's books but this one was definitely not one of his best. I found it very boring and it was kinda one of those books that just made no sense at all. I found it hard to continue to read the whole book even tho I did... 
 An expensive book with little meat. Whole chapters dedicated to basic electromagnetism. Nice if it was a primer on electromag but this is supposed to be a focused book. Buy  "Noise Reduction tech. in Electronic Systems" Henry W. Ott. Much better book for the money 
 This book was a waste of money.  It's meant for beginners that aren't familiar with the terms and concepts of stock trading in general.  If you don't already know these terms or the basic concepts you shouldn't attempt to day trade.  If you do know these terms and concepts, then this book is a waste.  The day traders survival guide is a much better intro book and I highly recommend it over this one.  Other recommended trading books to start you off are High Probability Trading by Marcel Link and Trading for a Living by Alexander Elder 
 Arthur took a classic and added his own garbage to it.  I started reading it (and getting alot out of it) when I came across some material that just didn't have the ring of truth in it.  I looked in an older copy of Think and Grow Rich and discovered that the parts that I didn't agree with (from a moral and business standpoint) were the lines that Arthur Pell added.  The up-to-date examples were ok, it was the changes to the original core values that I just couldn't tolerate.  Get the original or another version that has high reviews.  I give this version 5 stars for the Napoleon Hill part, -3 stars for Dr. Arthur's input, for a total of 2 stars.  DON'T BUY THIS VERSION OF A TRUE CLASSIC 
 Like practically every other company, Dell does an absolutely lousy job of telephone support.  Consider that 1000 times as many people have access to a telephone as have access to a browser.    Michael, a piece of advice.  Try calling your own 800 number and see how much you enjoy navigating the idiotic Dell menu prompts and incessant transfers.  Revolutionize that, and you have my praise.  Otherwise, your book is a formidable piece of history, not something significant for the future 
 Here is why it is junk.  1.  creates a buzz on the line  2.  Not enough room in back of phone for the cord if you wall mount 3.  The LCD is pathetic. Can't see it in a normally lit room.  THis should be back lit, and numbers should be bigger.  4.  All in all, a real dissappointment and it is going back 
 This book reads like the blog of some angry person who ignores evidence to the contrary and embraces anything that agrees with him.  It was very hard to take seriously 
 I tend to be suspicious of official stories.  But that does not mean that I am ready to jump at pretty much any alternative to such stories, no matter how absurd it may be.  Many major events have unusual aspects.  But that does not mean that they did not happen!  What's next from these folks?  Maybe an explanation that Japan never attacked Pearl Harbor in December of 1941?  Or that the United States never dropped atomic bombs on Japan in August of 1945?    The Twin Towers really did collapse.  And there's evidence that airplanes flew into them!  We Americans thought that we had some good people guarding us against sneak attacks.  And I think we did.  But these people either were not quite as good as we thought, or were asleep at the switch, or were confounded by a bunch of regulations that made it tough for them to gather information in a timely manner.  There have been other planned attacks on America.  And, luckily, some of the more serious ones failed.  In at least a few cases, our security people uncovered these plots in time to thwart them.  But we had no such luck on 9/11/2001.  Unless you want to consider it lucky that even more people were not killed.  There's plenty of evidence for how the attacks took place, and some of it is described in the 9/11 commission report.  There's very little evidence for any other hypothesis, in spite of what this book implies.  Books such as this one rarely get taken seriously by knowledgeable people, and that has a tendency to get some readers to think that much of what they read in these books is virtually unchallenged.  That's not the proper conclusion.  In particular, theories that we Americans brought down the Towers on purpose (one of the ideas considered by the authors) are not merely contrary to the evidence but illogical as well.  I do not recommend this book 
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 I was really disappointed especially because I had read so many positive reviews of the book. It very boring and the only exercises there actually were was one little chapter. The book was more of an autobigraphy of the author as well as about the history of the acceptance of women's masturbation which I could have read online if i wanted to. I wouldn't consider this a self-help book at all.  
 I heard the only good song on the CD, and purchased it. I should have tried a few more, it's not worth the price 
 The description of this product says they are space-saving and stackable.  I interpreted that to mean nestable.  They don't nest and therefore they do not save much space.   Had I known that, I would not have purchased them.   If you look closely at the picture, you will see that there are 2 pictured on top of each other with their lids on.  This is what they mean by stackable.  You can also put smaller ones inside bigger ones but even that is not a nice fit and also isn't convenient 
 In principle, this should be a great product.  We got one and set it up in a few seconds.  Our dogs responded to it very well, and stopped most of their barking.  (In spite of some false triggers when it was not screened from the wind.)  Then after less than 10 days of use, it went dead.  The vendor responded politely and quickly with a free replacement unit.  That one worked great...for 5 days.  Then it went catatonic, with a click every second or getting stuck in permanently ON mode.  The vendor responded politely and quickly with a refund.  That's 2 out of 2 units defective, which tells me there is a major defect in either the design or the quality control at the manufacturer.  Instead of wasting your time, maybe you should look for a different manufacturer 
 This book will make the author quite a bit of money.  He has thrown in everything but the kitchen sink.   Do you need to firm your butt, there's an exercise. Need to make a cheesecake for 12, there's a recipe. If you're a vegetarian, heed the memory prescription and be sure to get essential amino acids.  And did you know, the biggest problem with drinking 8 glasses of water a day is that "it is such a bore to pour."  The bottom line is: This is a big waste of money!  Its only therepeutic value is that it is written so poorly, the aggravation alone will keep your memory sharp 
 There was such promise, a woman who had "escaped" her ho-hum marriage, gone back to her roots was finding herself, starting her art work back up, caring for her mysteriously crazy mother, and then she "had" to fall for a monk, and turned this story into a romance novel.  When she "married" herself with knots into the sea, and lovingly talked about mermaids, it had some hope of independence, then it failed, going back to her husband after the "affair" (she got dumped for God.)  She didn't go back stronger, she went back wimpier and needy.  Sure, she had art in a gallery, but whee....where was her growth??  There wasn't any.  Sorry.  This novel leaves the reader disappointed and sad.  Ugh! 
 When I was first chosen to narrate this book, I knew nothing of the racist past of its author -- I knew only that it was the single worst book I'd ever been assigned.  The negative AudioFile Magazine review of the recording (quoted here on Amazon) is completely fair.  Reading the book to myself in order to prepare to record it, I found it annoying in the extreme -- the so-called prose is precious and poorly written, and the allegedly authentic colloquialisms are grating.  When it came time to say it all aloud, for the first time ever (and I've narrated upwards of 200 audiobooks) I found it impossible to invest this piece of literary flotsam with any emotional content whatsoever.  As declining the job was no longer an option, I merely tried to stay out of the way and give it as simple and logical a performance as I could, but I was unable to compensate for the God awful writing, and unable to disguise my contempt for the entire enterprise.  It remains the worst recording I have ever done, and I was, for a time, quite ashamed of it.  Now that I discover more about its hate mongering author, I'm actually quite pleased that the recording stinks.  I now believe I gave this garbage exactly the reading it deserved.  (I must add that I learned a valuable lesson: never record a book you loathe.  I was subsequently offered the execrable "Left Behind - The Kids" series for young adults, but having suffered through "Little Tree," knew better than to lend my voice to the spewing of "Christian" hate. 
 While the script idea for a serial killer snowman is a novel idea, the execution of the story, which possibly could have been on a par with Shaun of the Dead in its wit and visual humor, falls short. Whenever you try to combine the elements of comedy and horror, you have to decide where to take the story: should it be a parody, a satire, tongue in cheek, or a mix of these approaches? What visual framing will convey your choices, and how will the characterizations and actions move the story along to highlight them?  Beginning with the opening narration, an inappropriately told bedtime story to a young girl (at least the voice was supposed to be that of a young girl), the camera moves slowly across ornaments on a Christmas tree, pausing to show the film's credits written on each one (a clever but drawn out setup). This narration sets up the story, sort of, for Jack Frost, and we cut to him being conveyed to his execution in a van aptly titled with Troma-like subtlety "State Executional Transfer Vehicle."  The ensuing truck collision with the aptly titled "Genetic Research" van shows the miniscule budget the movie was shot with, and Jack is now conveniently melted into the snow, where his molecular do-hickies merge with the stuff to create the killer snowman.   Cut to Snowmonton, site of the annual snowman contest and...hey, wait a minute, there's that lack of budget again. No snow! Well, okay, a few very small piles of fake snow lying around, but the snowman contest does look pretty pitiful, and awfully fake. This would have been a funny scene if intended as such, but I doubt the script was that sophisticated.  The first murder is done off camera, and the victim's discovery is framed pretty well and is humorous: the camera angle from behind the dead man's frozen head, looks up at the three police officers looking down at the body in the rocking chair, with one of them annoyingly rocking it back and forth with his foot. Another killing later in the story has a woman viciously murdered by Jack, using a Christmas tree, Christmas tree lights, and ornaments. The scene is vicious and not particularly handled well, so falls between intended to be funny, but not really funny. The camera angle here mimics the first murder, and while clever, loses a lot of its intended humor due to the way the woman's murder was handled. The killings become more vindictive and bloody, as the film becomes more gore oriented, and the characterizations lose the humorous aspect they were meant to convey because the balance of parody, satire, and tongue in cheek are lost to the stereotypical escalating violence.  In a convenient plot device to make Jack more mobile--he can change from snow to water as needed-he can enter houses, and commit a particularly distasteful rape and murder that completely changes the tone of the story. While the scene must have looked clever on paper, it defies logic and thematic sense, and moves the film into more serious horror-head territory (which would have been great if the rest of the film had joined it).   The ensuing scenes, which include the sheriff's penchant for losing keys, and, hey, where did all those aerosol cans and hair dryers come from?! combined with the highly unlikely denouement involving the anti-freeze filled truck bed, are incongruous with the more serious tone of Jack Frost's killing spree.  While this is not a good film, it still contains some elements worth watching, and also provides a primer in what you should not do when attempting a humorous horror film for budding scriptwriters. 
 I can't say I liked this book.  I found it was incredibly boring with no writing style whatso ever.  And the plot could have been taken from a 'typical science fiction' receipe book.  Honestly.  I barely managed to  finish it.  Thora had potential.  Nothing else did.  She didn't even change  in the course of the book.  Leave this one in the bookshelf.  Its not worth  the time 
 This cocoa is gritty and has a bitter taste.  The dark chocolate mint is particularly bitter.  We don't care for the chocolate raspberry and chocolate vanilla flavors either.  The chocolate supreme flavor is sweeter and tastier than the other flavors, but the child in our family still remarked that his cocoa "tasted strange".  There are many non-gourmet commercial mixes that are smoother, more palatable and less expensive than this gourmet brand.  We won't buy this cocoa again.  This gift box selection is very handsomely packaged and looks great in holiday gift baskets. But the cocoa fails the taste test.   
 We viewers have been innundated with gay hustler movies lately, to the point where it's becoming a cliche. What is the endless fascination? Frankly, I'm sick of them. That said, I have to admit that I had a bit of a bias against this movie from the start. This movie did nothing to break out of the gay hustler cliche. The acting is pretty good (except for the whiny, cursing models) and pretty good-looking but the dialog is unbelievably bad. It pivots from soap opera exchanges to allegedly funny one-liners, although I did chuckle at the stuck elevator scene. Sad that some seemingly talented actors couldn't have been some better dialog. The plot has no real story arc or climax. It just sort of meanders from one scene to another without any real direction. The characterizations are pretty sloppy, too.  Ian is pretty well-developed but the screenwriter doesn't seem to know where he's going with Conrad.  Is Conrad a jerk?  Are we supposed to feel sympathy toward him because of his recent breakup? He comes across as petty and vindictive (the blanket incident described in the elevator) and that's a dangerous position to place a major character in. In any movie or story, if you have an unlikeable character as a lead, you'd better make sure s/he has some redeeming quality.  And Conrad has none.  Some of the minor characters are irritating, too: Emily and Ted although the grandfather was one of the bright spots of the movie. In the end, the movie never really answers the question posed in its tagline: "What are you worth?"  It would have been a much better movie if it did.  
 Actually this is not Inspector Wexford's first case, but the first that Rendell wrote with him as the main character.  In fact, if I'm not mistaken, this was her first mystery, period.  And it's surprisingly dull, as far as I'm concerned.  The "shocking" conclusion to me was obvious from the first few chapters -- I can't tell you why without giving it away -- and now, 30 years later, not so shocking.  In fact, by today's standards, it's pretty tame, even quaint.  The caliber of Rendell's work soars with her next mystery "Wolf to the Slaughter" and from there she just gets better and better.  But this first effort didn't do it for me.  Don't base your opinion of Rendell on this book -- unless you love it, of course! -- but do check out the rest of the Wexford mysteries, which are sublimely written and -- yes, truly -- shocking in their conclusions! 
 Reading through reviews of this text, I notice two main criticisms and will address them separately.  The first is that the book has some sort of liberal bias.  As far as I am concered, no bias of this sort is present.  I hold my textbooks to the same standard that I hold news outlets, and I found The American Pageant to be just as objective as the BBC or The Washington Post.  Dr. Bailey looks at both sides of controversial issues, does not, despite the beliefs of other reviewers, pan President Reagan, and has plenty of criticism of the left.  Why, then, the low rating?  This has to do with issue number two, namely Dr. Bailey's writing style.  It is, in a word, irritating.  He feels the need to bring ridiculously flowery language and bizarre metaphors into every situation.  I counted at least six comparisons of national banks, Wall Street moguls and railroad barons to octopuses.  Teddy Roosevelt had, according to Dr. Bailey, "mule-like molars" which he "bared at liberals and reactionaries alike".  It's extraordinarily difficult to cut through the (pardon my French here) merde and figure out what on earth is going on.  I'm not looking for a dry history book, really I'm not.  I believe American history can be interesting without bordering on the insane.  Dr. Bailey crosses the line from making his readers think that he may be insane to actually making his readers go insane.    I've not read any other US History textbook, so as far as I know this may be the best one.  I certainly hope not, for all of our sakes 
 This is one of the best Evans tittles, of course..., but at least this edition, (the first in cd, 1989), needs a deep mastering. 
 This book needs a serious updating.  When I did find something that interested me, the chances were very good that the web links to their site were old and not working.  Further searches for the company usually lead no where.  Wouldn't recommend 
 I bought these shoes a few months ago because I liked the style of them. I wore them just about everyday. A couple of people started telling me "you walk kind of funny in those shoes". They caused my ankles to turn in.I was having ankle pain and my doctor confirmed it was from the shoes. The support (curves) of the shoes are poorly designed. I ran into another women wearing them and walking the same way. I asked her about them and she said she too was having ankle pain. I contacted the company who said I could mail them to the company (at my expense) and they would "inspect" them. If they felt it was a "manufacturers defect" they would replace them with the SAME product. Little good that would do. ALSO If they felt it was not a defect they would just send them back with a note explaining their decision.Don't waste your money and cause yourself pain too. The company may say "they stand by their merchandise" but they don't mean it! 
 Is there a risk that following the events of September 11, 2001, the United States may be overreacting, or acting in an improper or counterproductive manner?  Of course.  We need some thoughtful, objective, and constructive criticism.  And some good advice.  But this book doesn't provide it.  I'll mention just a couple of areas where I think the book disqualifies itself from being helpful.  The first is in the discussion of a racist American backlash against innocent Arab Americans.  And a backlash against dissent from American policies.  That's something that I do not take lightly.  And what this book says will, in my opinion, make matters worse.  Mahajan says "the backlash against dissent got so bad that even one tenured professor lost his job because of it."  Um, who lost his job?  Sami al-Arian!  For those of you who don't know who he is, he's on trial for having been the North American leader of Islamic Jihad, a notorious terrorist group that has claimed "credit" for attacks that have killed at least 100 people in Israel and the disputed West Bank territories.  He's also accused of having played a crucial role in writing the Jihad's constitution, raising money for the Jihad, helping other Jihad leaders enter the United States, and planning an extensive espionage operation.  If there were just one person the United States ought to have been firing from their position, arresting, and putting on trial, it might well have been al-Arian.  He's not the right person to try to defend by claiming anti-Arab racism!  He's not the right person to try to defend by implying that his only crime was that "in his youth" he made "an intemperate speech."    Well, let's see how this book deals with the Levant.  The author says that the Oslo process was about the Arabs "bargaining away part of their internationally recognized rights to the whole of the occupied territories."  Unfortunately for him, there is no such right to all of the disputed West Bank.  Nor is there even a right to ethnically cleanse all Jews (or Arabs) who might wind up on the "wrong" side of the Israeli border.    You can give constructive advice on how to deal with terrorism.  Or you can support terrorism and taunt its victims.  But you can't do both.  And this book is defending the bad guys. 
 Every track but one has a simple, thumping percussion line, an artifact of modern music which I increasingly find tedious. No doubt it is easier to appeal to the brain stem rather than the prefrontal lobes. Unobjectionable as background music, but not actually worth listening to. Perhaps best described as music which one may hopefully, in time, grow out of 
 I am NOT a coffee snob...I like all kinds and strengths of coffee, however, melitta does not do its one:one machine justice with these pods.  I tried all of the pods in the variety pak and was not happy with any of them.    (...) Really good coffee, lots of variety to choose from and extremely quick shipping.  Skip the melitta pods and try the Arabica Express pods (I like the Italian and vanilla pods) from podheads 
 I have had this book for two semsters at a grad level. The information is confusing and at times leaves one lost. I am very displeased with the book. It has not helped me in no way understanding the meaning behind behavioral stats. In fact I am more confused now. I wish the book could have given more details on explaining stats instead of so many examples. The examples are find but the problem is they are continued from the beginning of the book. And if one doesnot grasp the beginning then how can one grasp the remainer of the text. I wouldnot recommend this book to no one.  E.T 
 Damn Yankees was a supergroup containing Ted Nugent,Tommy Shaw(STYX),Jack Blades(Nightranger)and someother guy. All talented musicians, who are best heard in their prespective groups. Damn Yankees just doesn't rock,like it should. I've given it a chance and just can't get into it. A lot of talent involved, just doesn't do anything for me 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 We moved to Budapest and will travel to other countries, so we wanted something that could help us in several European countries.  I didn't expect it to "do it all", but I'm very tired of seeing "Sorry, can't help" on my screen!  I'm just trying to use it when I'm at the grocery store--basic stuff.  I have purchased something else that would be much more helpful--a Hungarian/English dictionary. It's bulky, but more useful!  
 I had read--with delight--the book called "Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH" to my grandsons, so I thought the movie would be a nice followup.  Wrong! It barely resembles the book, and all the most important parts are glossed over or left out. It might be OK for a child who hasn't read the book, but we were disappointed 
 I found the book mostly entertaining until the end. I was very disappointed by the convoluted story, and things were not explained very well at the end. I loved all her other books, but this one was horrible. I found it much more violent and disturbing than previous books, too. The stupid DID ending came out of nowhere and made no sense (maybe she has been watching too much One Life to Live). There were too many characters, too many plot threads, too many murders, and it was not tied together very well.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  I sure hope her next one is better 
 Before browsing through Dear Donald, Dear Bennett, the reader should immediately peruse a copy of At Random, Bennett Cerf's memoirs, so he has a chance of understanding what he is reading in this book. I can't believe Random House would treat the personal letters of their founders in such a shabby fashion. Virtually no footnotes, no annotation, no index---nothing. They might as well be putting out the memoirs of Anna Nicole Smith, rather than the keepers of one of the great literary storehouses of the twentieth century. Before spending any money assembling this volume for publication (if indeed they spent any at all!), the editors should have acquired a copy of The Noel Coward Diaries and followed it religiously as a guide. In that volume, Graham Payn and Sheridan Morely obviously spent months poring over every inch of copy, meticulously footnoting each and every name and archane reference so that upon completion, the reader would easily be able to tell the difference between Bob Menzies and Bobby Andrews, the Duke of Kent from the Duke of Windsor, and easily tell whether Sir Noel was writing about Elizabeth Taylor the film star, Elizabeth Taylor the English novelist, or Elizabeth Taylor the non-celebrity dear friend to Coward's inner circle. Here, the editors (who are unnamed and rightly so) merely say that Saxe Commins was a senior editor at Random House and Robert Haas a partner without furthur definition. (More time is spent discussing the typeface of this volume than virtually anything else.) Most readers of these letters would be interested in the details such annotation would provide. Yes, the letters do paint a wonderful picture of the day-to-day operations of the company, the trials and tribulations of America at war, and the deep affection between the two men. It's a shame the present-day editors at Random House did not see fit to put together a better tribute of their founding fathers 
 This book is fine, it's OK, it's not bad. But there's nothing new here. It's not satisfying as biography -- what we gets feels like tiny fragments -- and the critical argument of the book isn't of much interest. The fact that the author essentially disregards the worth of almost all great 20th century poetry not written by the four men that he chooses to focus on is a huge misstep; he could have easily acknowledged the worth of Barbara Guest, the Language poets, Black Mountain, the Beats, etc. but instead either damns them with faint praise or simply damns them, apparently to make his case for the four New York Schoolers stronger. These are four very important poets, yes, but the author seems to be unable to view them in the greater poetic context of the last 100 years, and this puts the book at a serious disadvantage; it may undermine the reader's belief in him as a critic, and it made me, for one, unwilling to follow him down the rather uninteresting critical paths he was mapping out. The quest to determine what is and is not "avant garde" feels misguided and beside the point; how about actually reading the work in a new or compelling way 
 These are thin solid and dark patties that cook up tasteless, juiceless and unburgerlike in texture.  Completely unlike their advertising and unlike the regular beef patties sold at the supermarket.  I will never buy Omaha Steak products again.  Omaha Steaks' customer representatives are very nice however.  I wrote to them telling them about my experience and they said I could dump the scary meat and they would credit my card.  Thank you very much. 
 Actually I have not read this book and probably won't anytime soon.  I understand there is more than one side to everything but am totally offened at the response to Dr. Barach from ISSD.  The organization helped me tremdously when I first found out I had MPD/DID.  I could not find Dr. Barach's response anywhere on here but I would think that in defending the organization the Dr. is also defending those of us who have a legitimate diagnosis of MPD/DID 
 I received the first topper and it was not satisfactory so I called and was sent another one which was worse than the first discolored etc. I have since returned both pads in the same box 
 Chainfire is, quite literally, the worst book in the history of mankind. Open it up to any random part of the book, and you will most likely find both pages filled with one speech or another by Richard that any decent writer would have put into a page, (and only one such speech!!!) and then continued with the story. however...THIS ENTIRE BOOK is filled with Terry Goodkind's absolutely useless Ayn Rand like drivel delivered in chapter long speeches delivered by the main character Richard. I suppose it is a decent philosophy, but trying to insert this book into the sword of truth series should be a crime. Terry Goodkind deceived every one of his readers, who wanted to read about Richard battling the Imperial Order, into reading something that should only be presented in a philosophy class---and a 7th or 8th grade one at that. It reminds me of having read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand in my freshman year of high school...and thinking that it was the most horrible waste of paper ever...and Chainfire is an even worse imitation of that book. This book is absolute garbage and currently graces my fireplace in the form of ashes and soot. Don't buy it unless its cheap enough to be worth its weight in firewood.     
 An excellent idea, with a fatally flawed implementation.  It appears to be a limitation of the midi controller - drums will fail to sound intermittantly.<br /> <br /> An except from my (so far unanswered) request for support from Ion-Audio.com:<br /> <br /> I have found a problem with my new Ion IED05 Electronic Drum Set - the drums appear to conflict, perhaps in the MIDI interface, perhaps within the Alesis controller. <br /> <br /> When playing the drums, a pad will fail to sound intermittantly (and occasionally, the whole system will mute momentarily).<br /> <br /> I hope this isn't the first you've heard of this issue, and that a fix is available.<br /> <br /> Of course, I've checked the connections, checked to be sure I'm hitting the pads squarely and in the center, tried swapping pads (though the issue affects all of them, not just the snare), etc.  <br /> <br /> If fact, I can often reproduce the problem by simply, repeatedly striking any two pads together, one a split-second after the other.  When it happens, the second appears to mute the first, before the first fully produces a tone.<br /> ________________________<br /> <br /> Until/unless this issue's resolved, you'll find the set a cause of repeated frustration, whether for learning, practice or performance 
 I bought this book because a reviewer said it would teach people with Asperger's syndrome how to make and manintain eye contact. It doesn't. It just says you should make and maintain eye contact, it doesn't teach you how.  This book only tells you what society expects of you, so if you already know what society expects of you, but just cannot figure out how to do it smoothly, don't buy this book. If you already know stuff like, "pull up your pants before coming out of the bathroom", don't buy this book 
 I just watched the recent Frontline about Tank Man, the man who bravely defied the line of tanks in Beijing, and went to Amazon to find books about the subject. Up came this book, among others, and I remember almost throwing it across the room over ten years ago when I read it. You have a guy who escaped, knew a few people involved, and whose only personal involvement is from the outside. He had no balls, and never dared risk himself. Sure, he knows the figureheads, the history, and can write about what happened as if was there. But he was hiding in his room, making himself out to be a hero. If you want to read a book with the only suspense being whether to finish it or not, then this is the one 
 I have never typed a review before, but after reading this book, I felt compelled to voice my opinion.  I was raised Catholic and as I grew older found myself questioning my own faith.  I have many of the same conflicting feelings between science and religion that the author himself claimed to have.  When I read the description for "The Case for a Creator", I was filled with anticipation of what lay within the pages.  However, once I reached page 50, I felt like the air had been let out of the tires.  How, I wondered, could the book claim to present a "case", when the mention of a "case" leads the reader to believe that, as in the court of law, both sides will be presented and argued fairly, and the final determination will rest in the hands of the jury, or in the case of a book, in the hands of the reader.  However, in the "One-Sided Case for a Creator", Strobel destroys his own credibility by not even attempting to cleverly conceal his agenda towards the idea of an intelligent and divine creator.  It is almost an insult to the reader, as if Strobel is saying to us, "I don't want or expect you to think about, analyze, or question what I am saying, I just expect you to lap it up and accept it as truth."  I find Strobel's writing to be maddening...at the end of each chapter I was left with a hungry feeling, as though I had just eaten a plate of air.  With each chapter, I hoped that Strobel would redeem himself by presenting both sides to his so-called "case"...however, he consistently disappointed by presenting only his side.  After reading the book, I was left confused, skeptical, and felt the need to research the side of the case that Strobel conveniently neglected.  A book that could have been a masterpiece falls far short and is an insult to any reader who is looking for a well-rounded argument.  If you agree with Strobel's point of view, you will love it and will lap it up...but why read it if you already believe in the idea of a divine creator???  If you are searching for a convincing book of substance, look elsewhere.   
 The author believes that France's economy, and socialism generally, is admirable. This, against all evidence to the contrary. Really, how much more of this sort of wishful thinking masquerading as economic analysis are we expected to take? Haven't we had enough demonstration of the falsity of these ideas? As socialist economies drag their shuddering bulks to standstills while the people riot (and rot), we are expected to heed calls to admire, and replicate, their failures. Amazing. Read Hayek. Von Mises. Sowell. Friedman. This guy, here, should never have been published 
 This book was recommended for me by Amazon and I am glad I took it out from the library instead of buying it. It took me a long time to get through the book and I found that I forced myself to finish reading it. The main character is hard to relate to or even sympathize with. And at the end of the book I feel that nothing has been resolved. I would not recommend this book. 
 There are two versions for this film , which is not generally known.  Someone selling it should.  I was not informed when I bought the G rated version.  THe repy I received was, "too bad. 
 Very slow book, very predictable, oddly written (sometimes I had to reread a sentence a few times just because it sounded so odd). 
 I have to say I did not have too much faith to begin with that this was going to be a good movie.  However, the reviews I had read and the Blockbuster cashier all said it was a genuinely funny movie. My friends and I were ready for a good comedy. I suppose if you think that perpetual arguing and name calling and irresponsible behavior is hilarious then I suppose it could win an Oscar nomination.   Needless to say, I thought it was the worst movie I had ever seen!  Ever.    I feel like Jennifer Anniston signed onto this movie to vent all her withheld emotions  about Brad and their disintegrating relationship/marriage.  And Vince Vaughn was portrayed as a big buffoon.  I felt foolish hanging in there as long as I did waiting for the tide to turn and the humor to begin. It never happened.  And I watched a good hour and a half.  They yelled at each other the entire time.  No joke.  I felt tense and contracted on the couch and none of my friends were laughing either.  I left before the ending but heard a bunch of groans coming from the living room so the ending was no better.    I cannot say I was disappointed, I simply felt foolish renting it in the first place and subjecting my friends to it.  I suppose the only good that came out of this rotten movie was that Jennifer and Vince found love on the movie set.  So in that case I give it one star.  
 Of the many books and periodical articles that I have read concerning the Spanish Inquisition, this is the most biased and speculative and opinionated.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.  It is extremely long and tedious. We realize that the Inquisition was shameful. However, this work substitutes one prejudice for another 
 To say that this guidebook is lacking would be a bit of an understatement, unfortunately. Why? Because, for example, it includes absolutely NO coverage of one of South Korea's larger cities, Ulsan, which is famous for being the home of the international Hyundai motor company, and was also one of the host cities during the World Cup in 2002. The population is over 1 million people, and to think that such a significant (if slightly industrial) city could be overlooked is proof that the authors of this guide have only scratched the surface of what Korea has to offer the world. Otherwise, I have to give them credit for producing a guide for the country AT ALL, considering that there are hardly any worth buying out that now as it is. I just recommend that for the next edition they do a little more research before publishing it 
 DOWNSIDE:  1. I'll have to add my complaint to several others who had the same problem. The camera suddenly stopped working after nearly 18 months of having no problems. I switched batteries...let it set for some time without batteries or memory card in it...nothing is getting it to work. On top of that I now have a memory card with photos on it that I can't transfer to my computer without a working camera to do that. 2. Not good with indoors pictures ESPECIALLY if you try the "night" mode. If you use that mode, even with a tripod, keep your subjects to still-lifes, only...if you photograph people and they happen to move even the slightest, they will at best be blurry, at worst they will look like double exposures. 3. Indoors pictures set at normal mode, with or without flash, are no better and may even be worse than your standard cheap 35mm camera.  UPSIDE: 1. Through its USB cable, it booted right into Apple's iPhoto software making the organizing and editing of photos that I took a breeze. 2. Outdoors, with plenty of sunlight, gave me near-perfect pictures that got a lot of praise. Kodak did well with this aspect of the camera's ability, given the price. 3. We won this camera (free) so for me it's almost all upside...except now I have to shell out $$$ for a good camera (that will hopefully read my current memory card 
 This is a bad book.  It's unfortunate, too, because it was a great idea.  The book contains many errors, from typos to grammatical errors to code indentation issues to problems which demonstrate a complete misunderstanding of the subject matter.  As a professional OCaml programmer, it is clear to me that this was not written by somebody who understands the subject.  Trying to learn OCaml from this book is a very bad idea; you will end up discouraged and confused at best.  Please don't buy it 
 If you think of the prime numbers as a Dr. Seuss staircase then this book's for you.  There are painfully cute analogies like throughout the book as the author shows off his faculty-lounge acculturation. It is least informed and most poorly written of the current spate of RH books.  Buy any of the others.  Avoid this one 
 I bought this book thinking it would help me to sort out issues I was having in a current relationship. Unfortunately I found the writing style tedious and hard to follow. I am sure there was a message in it but some of it seemed to be religion based and I haven't managed to pick it up long enough to finish it yet. I own my own bible and if I wanted to read scripture I would have picked that up. No doubt others found this book helpful as is evident in other reviews and I don't want to take away from what were obviously positive experiences for them. I also bought "He's Scared, She's Scared : Understanding the Hidden Fears That Sabotage Your Relationships" by Steven Carter, Julia Sokol and also available from Amazon. I switched to that halfway through and I found this to be a far more helpful book and ultimately it has helped me a lot more than the book in this review. 
 I purchased this book, hoping it would examine the _ancient_ Egyptian source of the ideas within the Corpus Hermeticum. But, in that respect this book is entitled in a misleading manner. The author is a researcher for the Center for _Greek_ and _Roman_ Antiquity of the National _Hellenic_ Research Foundation in _Athens_. And, as the name of his foundation clearly implies, his academic zeal begins and ends with Greece and Rome.  Yes, everyone knows that the Corpus Hermeticum we now have was written by Greeks. But, my interest is in discovering the Kemetian source those Greeks worked from to come up with their Corpus Hermeticum. Alas, this book was no help.  
 this movie is a great waste of time. with its annoying litle rich brat kids and one of them kills their new best friend and Diggs incestigates with the worst soutern accent in the world, plus he shouldnt of been in this whole mess. with a bitchy cast and a nowhere story, this'll please those people with less than zero brain 
 If you expect some spectacular insight how Basie and his music came into being, you're in for a slight letdown. The book has a somewhat sedate pace, doesn't feature to many anecdotes or details about Basie and his musicians. There are certainly some interesting facts but on the whole it's rather dry. The book covers Basie's career from its beginnings. I found the chapters on his early life the most interesting ones. From about 1940 onwards Basie structures his memories along his recording sessions; and this gets a bit tedious. I can only recommend this for true Basie aficionados who want to pick up the odd piece of new information 
 The quality of this product cannot in any way compare to the genuine Apple iPod covers.  It is very flimsy, does not fit correctly, does not come with a belt clip and most importantly leaves the display area wide open to scratches and breakage.  That's right; there is no plastic or glass protection for the display area.   There is a reason why this product does not cost as much as other iPod covers.  That's because it is of poor quality.  Also, when you calculate the cost of the cover, plus the cost of shipping it, you do not get a bargin.  As a matter of fact, if someone gave me this product for free, I would not accept it because, like I stated earlier, it provides no protection. 
 OK, Mr. Koontz,  Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence.  This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment.  Leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again.  Your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival...now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs.  What has happened to you, Mr. Koontz?  Are you losing your mind?  Have fun at church...and don't forget to donate another $1,000 to President Bush.  I refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so.  That seems to be around the time that you became a kook 
 We all like hearing scary stories about monsters.  This book provides a few of them.  Because of its pulp horror novel quality it has some redeaming value.  The negatives make it not only a bad read, but make me wish that I had not read it. 1) The author spends a lot of time tooting his own horn. This is fine, but you grow weary of it after a few chapters.  It wouldn't be so annoying but because of the way he writes comes off as if he is trying too hard to make it sound like NOT bragging.  Because of this I grew very aware of it, like when your tounge won't stop worrying at a new tooth-filling. 2) It grows very predictable.  We get it!  Serial killers are psychos who fit into patterns and act out fantasies. It isn't a surprise anymore once we learned this early in the book. 3) Ressler brags about his profile helping to send 4-5 Chicago teenagers to prison for a a grusome murder/rape.  A decade after this book went to press DNA evidence and discovery of the real killers proved that these kids had been railroaded--unequivocally innocent.  Ooops!  This incredibly gross injustice wouldn't seem so terrible if Ressler didn't come off as such a judgemental, I-told-you-so-ing, J. Edgar Hoover loving cop's cop 
 This was the most boring, unimaginal work I have ever read. It was totally sensless 
 I was a child abuse investigator for many years. The business is full of Crusaders such as Mones. I find that most of them are hot for a pay-off, including book deals, and they generally uncover whatever it is theyre looking for. So Mones motivation is suspect, to me. And if you pay attention to the studies he references you get a sense that teens murder for any number of reasons, and manipulate the hell out of everyone with the abuse claims. I estimate 75%-80% of abuse reports are nonsense. Another 10%-15% are do-gooders trying to make something out of nothing. And maybe 5% are the real deal. I always keep in mind that fruit & nuts never fall far from the tree.  I mean, if Mones reported that child abuse really isnt all that bad a problem who would buy his book 
 I bought this set for my daughter. The bedding is such a poor quality, that my daughter won't sleep in her bed.  She says the sheets are itchy.  The comforter is so hard it is like a big piece of cardboard.  I WOULD NOT RECOMEND this set to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I watched the movie hoping it was one of those good 'no guns, no car crash' movies from both Farrell and Hayek; but turned out to be a bad choice. The story is extremely fictional (says a Mexican woman living in the United States) and I know the time period was different, but no woman gets over or forgives such strong racist insults from an Italian man who wants to be white. The characters were not integral throughout the movie, and please.. no one has ever died from too much smoking marijuana; and Mexicans do other drugs as well. Bad stereotypes, bad performances, bad actors. Some pretty images, but at a very high price 
 I've read all of Iris Johansen's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them--this, however was not one of them.  I found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book.  What mysterious event happened to Jock and Royd?  Who is MacDuff--well if you haven't read the previous novel, you'll never know 
 otherwise, I was bored to tears.  I kept closing the book to look at the photo and found more to it than all the words inside the book 
 I somehow listened to the whole CD and I just wasn't impressed. It didn't surprise me that the only decent songs were I'm Sprung, the Remix, and I'm N Luv Wit A Stripper. "Studio Luv" could be a possible single in my opinion. One of the best songs he has done isn't even on the CD and that's "Ask For It" feat. Nivea. Basically, he needs to stick to being "featured" in songs, because he can't hold his own. Too bad 
 This book is a departure from others I've read by the same authors.  There is little flow or organisation to the material.  Detailed technical info is presented, only to be often times refuted by the authors in a side-note as  not of true value.  Therefore I feel the only value in this book is in the  authors' side notes, which are in themsevles often arcane 
 An unbelievable waste of time.  There's no point in finishing the book. I can't feel for any of the characters or care what happens to them. One of the worst books I've ever attempted to read. 
 I wonder if anyone tried to edit this book.  You would think that after 86 years of no championships, this book would be flawless.  O well, at least the Boston Globe tried and I'm sure the ring is more important than a book to Red Sox fans 
 the neighbor has a yapping mutt that barks night and day...since the police won't do anything about it, i bought this bark free...hahaha...what a joke...the darn dog barked more...  anyway...it did zero for my problem and i consider it a waste of money...  
 We bought this for my son for Christmas, on the conditon that he never put fish in it, since the reviews said it killed fish.  That worked fine until he won a fish at the school carnival.  Of course it had to go in with the sharks.  So with freshly treated water and a prayer, we put the fish in.  The next day it was very listless and lying along the bottom.  After checking the reviews, I saw one where the person removed the fish and they recovered.  So we've taken the beta out and are waiting to see if it will survive.  I still would rate this aquarium 1 star for cool looks and lights, but it's very noisy and I believe it kills fish 
 If this is a brilliant debut then what else  these publishers are looking at must be really abysmal!  The characters are cartoons....the writing is glib and I just kept thinking...who cares?   I am just stunned by the positive reviews and the hype and I loved Secret History by Donna Tartt.  If there were minus stars I'd give it one 
 My kids started reading the Left Behind Kids books, and because I was concerned about the message and theology of the books, I started reading them also.  Then I decided to check out the "adult" books from the library.   I am a born-again, pentacostal believer in Jesus Christ, and parts of the theology are not what I read in the Bible.  OK.  I can stil enjoy a good book, one with interesting characters, realistic dialogue, and a good plot.  The issue of plot is difficult for the Left Behind books, I admit, because we know who wins if we've read the end of the New Testament.  As to the rest, it fell flat.  Most of the dialogue didn't ring true.  After a few of the books, I was interested in some of the characters, but by the end of the books, there were only a few of the original characters left, and they were some of the least interesting to begin with.  How many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in Revelation?  How many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in Book 1?  There is nothing new and interesting in this book. The last book is just boring.    It would have been nice, at the end of the book, to wrap up everything.   Jesus comes back, and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over, right?  Some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all.  It was an incredible let down.  I felt like I had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over.  Nothing.  We stick with that one main guy, and everyone else is left in the dust.  It should have had a really, really happy ending, but even that was boring.  If I had my time back, I would stick to the kid versions, if only to discuss theological issues with my children.  At least in the kid books, the sermons are shorter.  And I will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series 
 Jennifer Weiner is such a good writer; if only she could get past her neuroses! Enough with divorce, enough with overweight women! Many of these stories made me uncomfortable or turned me off altogether. There was a reason why various publications rejected these stories way back when, and so should have her current publisher. Ms. Weiner needs to break from the advice of many a writing teacher, i.e., write what you know. Explore new situations, new emotions, and include some happy endings 
 What a disappointment!  It is only lacking cartoon illustrations to make it seem competely childish.  But more disturbingly it is deceptively simplistic.  Told through rose-colored glasses, leaving out what is convenient to ensure a "happy" ending. Save your money, wait for it on Vue-Master 
 The "Everything Grant Book" is not very helpful to those who are serious about trying to locate and obtain grant funding.  The book provides a very broad-brush approach to grant writing with limited examples.  The first seven chapters go back-and-forth between government and foundation grants, which is very confusing, especially for the beginning grant writer.  Even though government and foundation grants have some common elements, they require very different approaches.  When the reader finally reaches Chapter 8 "Components of a Grant Proposal," it really discusses solicitations, with only one page dedicated to grant components.  Chapter 9 provides very basic information about preparing to writer a grant.  Chapter 10 talks about "letters of support," which seems out-of-place considering the authors have yet to discuss the major elements of a grant proposal.  Chapters 11-15 discuss the real conponents of most government grants, but once again fail to provide a comprehensive presentation with realistic examples.  Chapter 16 "Other Grant Proposal Sections" includes information (staff qualifications, management plan, etc.) that really belongs in Chapter 13 "Action Plans."  Chapter 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 include very basic information about writing, reviewing, and filling out forms, and submitting proposals.  The book ends with "Writing Grants as a Career," which seems like an awkward ending.  If I had to rely on this book to give me the background to be a grant writer, I would be struggling to make a living.  I suggest potential grant writers look for a book that has only one emphasis (government or foundation), is better organized, and provides more contemporary examples.  
 This paper yields inferior results when used with an Epson C84 printer and Epson Durabrite inks.  The layers of ink are clearly visible; on some prints there appears to be a "crackle" finish.  Epson paper results are consistently excellent 
 Rambling incoherant plotlines, cardboard cutout characters, and highly tedious prose made this the second worst book I ever attempted to read 
 When the background music completely overpowers the dialogue, you may as well turn it off.  The background music was piercing and I needed to have the remote in hand to keep adjusting the volume.  Not everyone has perfect hearing and shows with overwhelming background music are becoming the norm.  A shame because otherwise I could have enjoyed Crash 
 I bought this from Amazon and I don't like it - the masured temperature drifts from 96.8F to 99.6F in 6 minutes. So inaccurate 
 When I read Michael Cunningham's A Home at the End of the World, I was so dazzled by his prose that I found myself stopping again and again to reread and admire his sentences. In The Hours, he combined the same stylistic virtuosity (paragraph after paragraph imitating Virginia Woolf's style, for example) with a novelistic structure that took three separate narratives set in different times and slowly wound them together to devastating effect. Specimen Days also presents three linked narratives, but everything that we admired about Cunningham's earlier books is missing here. The prose is utterly pedestrian, the plotting ranges from the unlikely to the preposterous, and the links between the three narratives are disappointingly mechanical and superficial.  The three narratives of Specimen Days are set in New York in different eras--the late nineteenth century, the present, and some time a century or so from now. To be fair, there's a thematic connection between them: in each case, one character sacrifices everything for the good of another character whom he or she knows only superficially. But the sad difference between Specimen Days and The Hours is this: in The Hours the three narratives merge to create something larger than each one is by itself, but in Specimen Days the three stories, presented sequentially, fail to illuminate--or even to relate to--one another. Instead, they're connected merely by a quirk (in each, there's a character who recites lines from Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass), a prop (a white porcelain bowl), and the characters' similar names. One thinks longingly of the subtly with which Cunningham evolved the stories in The Hours and wonders what went wrong here.  Each of the stories in Specimen Days is more improbable than the last. The most successful is the first, about a boy who gives up everything to save another character from a disaster he only imagines and ends up saving her from an actual unimagined real disaster. (Since this story is the one most worth reading, I won't give away more of the plot.)  In the second story, a police hotline operator/psychologist unaccountably walks away from her career and her boyfriend to go on the lam with a child bomber whom the police are seeking and who, she thinks, will eventually kill her anyway. Sure. The third story is set in a United States that has been visited by a new species (think large versions of the Geico gecko, but without the engaging British accent) and that has been largely laid waste by some kind of unspecified nuclear or ecological disaster. The story has to do with a lizard character who helps a near-human android get from New York to Denver so that the android can contact his creator. The android suffers from an inability to experience human emotions, but through a turn of events when they reach Denver, he discovers that he can experience beauty and compassion like a full human being after all. "It seems I did a better job with you than I'd realized," says the android maker approvingly. That's right: think Star Trek's Mr. Data meets the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz. How amazing, how disappointing, that such derivative dreck is coming from the pen of Michael Cunningham.   
 If you like snotty women with so-so faces on hot bodies sculpted by bad plastic surgery, this is the calendar for you 
 Every 20 year old Californian I know has reccomended this book.  It was a lot of fun, and a fast read, but a month after reading it, I had to strain to remember anything about it.  I don't think you will find this book  particularly memorable unless you can relate to the main character -- ie.  fashion obsessed, boy crazy, rampant extrovert 
 I thought I was going to see something of Roy Orbinson.  It was only in the title of the name.  I could not watch it when it became vulgar with offensive material.  It is too bad to have a good story with great actors lowering its potentially good quality with such degrading vulgarity. There are better ways of getting this aspect of the story across with such depiction.  Silly me, I should have checked the rating.  I "assumed" it safe as it would involve our beloved Roy Orbinson.  I was sadly and horridly disappointed and cannot in conscience recommend it to anyone at anytime.  By the way,I destroyed the tape in good conscience.  Watch at your own eternal risk 
 It took me about 3 days to figure out the little box with the tiny book IS the book I bought! I thought it's a nice gift came with the item I payed... I guess I'm a Dummy!  I don't understand why so many folks wrote comments under this item while the comments are indeed for another product:-( 
 Crying of Lot 49 Flat - Senseless - One dead accumulation of words - In,fact this book is, at times, so porely constructed all reviewers who herald it should be lead directly to the meat grinders. A book worthy of burning.  Has writing become a whim of the well read, a process of linking obsure facts only to then be skewed by prolix innanities as simple segways to streams of consciousness Poor Plot Poor Writing  Read - Umberto Eco's Foucaults Pendulum. If you are looking for conspiracy. Do not read this book (unless you have time to waste or have by some possibility exhausted every other option on earth)   
 This wasn't worth the money I paid for the deluxe.Lots of it was nonsense...If I could sent it back I would of.... I would just bought the Aloha from Hawaii.Don't waste your money,buying this.If I could sell it now I would !!!!!!Anyone want to buy it,let me know.......... 
 This book is one of the worst educational books I've read.  There are numerous wrong answers and the formulas do not agree with the chapter summary.  Poor proof reading on the author's part. This book is very  mathamatical and several math tricks are required to solve the problems.   This is DO NOT buy if you can help it 
 This book is horrible!  It is  uninsightful and utterly pointless.  The first 200 pages build an advertisement riddled case for healthy diet and exercise that leaves you less than conviced that John Gray has any idea what he is writing about.  Maybe there is a reason the U.S. has outlawed some of the treatments that are espoused with giving Mr. Gray his "insight" into what our bodies need?  The scientific data was never openly stated, but shrouded in mysterious, sensational statements such as "the same diet plan may cause a woman to gain weight and a man to lose weight."  This book left me wondering if John Gray actually believes this stuff or whether he is just trying to fulfill a book contract with his publisher.  I hope that this review does not dissuade you from ever purchasing a book by John Gray.  If you have never read "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" then I highly recommend that you purchase it and refer to it often.  It is a truly amazing and well written insight into the minds of men and women.  Check it out and leave this diet book on the shelf for someone else 
 The only thing worse than this movie is its fans.  Haha!  Racism is so funny!  VERY NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICE!!!  Normally, I like good jokes about various races and cultures, but the jokes in this movie are simply tasteless and not funny, and the fact that it's produced by the same company that owns Fox New REALLY doesn't help the case.  Like Da Ali G Show, I just don't get it.  Why do so many idiots eat this s hit up and ask for seconds?  It is literally mindnumbing to try and watch this limey try to be funny with retarded catch phrases, broken English (wow, a foreign immigrant who doesn't speak well; real original douchenozzle!), and anti-semetic comments 
 I bought several tee shirts for my son. I washed them in cold water and put them in the dryer on a low setting. They shrunk at least one whole size. Also the stiching around the neck puckered. From now on I will stick with product lines I know like Hanes and Carters.  J. Duncan Arizon 
 but that is about the best I can say for it 
 A lover's betrayal. . . A killer on the loose. . .   Eve Duncan was actually happy. She had a man who loved her, an adoptive daughter as great as her own, and her dead daughter's bones were found and safely buried. But then a letter in the mail opens her eyes to a secret her boyfriend, Joe Quinn, kept for two full years. Now she wants away from him, and when a job opportunity in a different state presents itself, she packs her bags and leaves. On her first night in Louisiana, someone tries to kill her, and they won't give up until she's dead! Will she uncover the secret in time? Or will death silence her?  When I picked up this book I wasn't surprised it got high on every bestsellers list. It was moving a mile a minute and between the hired assassins, secrets, deaths, and conspiracies, I knew I was reading a great novel. And then, after chapter 5, the book came to a stop and decided to creep at turtle speed. The character of Eve Duncan became uncharacteristically naive and immature, while her 12 year old adoptive daughter Jane was acting like a 50 year old, smart and mature beyond her years. The book dragged all until chapter 12. Once chapter 12 begins, the book takes flight once again and the bombs (literally) start going off. The ending was good and though I thought it was predictable, it was still somewhat enjoyable. It wasn't as good as the first two books in that series, but it was better then the third. 
 Just as with Haviland, et al - Anthropology: The Human Challenge (with CD-ROM and InfoTrac®), there is to much opinion and to little good science.   Certainly a lot of information, but when flavored with such a bias against "Western Civilization" it is 528 pages to be avoided not required reading in an introductory Cultural Antro. course.  I hate to use monikers, but this is liberal junk, not a good introduction to the subject of Cultural Antrhopology.  One should introduce a science and its methodology to students, not ones personal opinions and possible agendas 
 This book is terrible!  It gives different definitions for the same term several times in the first few chapters.  Why doesn't it just give one coherent, comprehensive definition for each word?!! The concepts are broken up and presented helter-skelter, so reading this book is like working a tedious jigsaw puzzle. Then it includes lots of problems at the end of each chapter, but there is no answer key, and the Solutions Manual is only available to teachers.  Do they think that my professor is too lazy or too stupid to make up his own tests? (Hint to oblivious writers/editors: a textbook is useless if students cannot practice working problems and check the answers on their own.  This is not third grade, and my professor is not a babysitter!)  I bought the workbook (which contains practice tests) separately, but I still don't have the answers to the problems at the end of the chapters. I will speak to the department heads at my college and beg them to switch publishers next semester 
 i am three quarters thru this book and no amount of money could make me finish it. what do people see in this writer? the dialogue is drivel, the characters implausible, and the situations unlikely, to say the least. so here somebody finds another gospel of the life of jesus. of course, this is accompanied by murder and skullduggery and an airhead opera singer (of all things!) heroine.  i'm sorry.  maybe if i were twelve, i'd think it was really cool 
 I bought this for the flashlight feature.  You have to press and hold the button in a clumsy way in order to keep the green flashlight on.  Also, the only way to have the clock light up is if you have the alarm on.  The buttons on the front are cheap and don't seem like they'll last very long 
 I'm not sure why people keep buying this book or giving it good reviews. It's an obvious rip-off of much better books--the ology series by Candlewick. Plus, this book is very hard to read, especially for children, uses some one else's innovations, and is poorly and luridly designed. Although the art inside uses some of Cicely Mary Barker's originals, the rest is very amateurishly done photoshop work. I feel bad for Ms. Barker that her delightful art is given a forum that is in very bad taste. It's a shame that the publisher couldn't come up with their own idea on how to showcase her work, but had to rip off some one else. <sigh 
 This nonsensical bio is written entirely from a blind feminist perspective.  The research is suspect.  The prose amateurish.  The details gossipy and contrived. If Eleanor Roosevelt was truly a woman of thought and progressivism, then Cook has done her an unforgivable disservice. If you're looking to understand Roosevelt's honest-to-goodness place in history, you will not find it is this intellectually offensive work 
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 You would think by now I would have learned not to judge a book by its cover, but that's exactly what I did in this case. The picture on the front cover is charming. The words "Fresh, engaging, and authentically British" from a Booklist reviewer are splashed on the cover. And that reeled me in.  If you like the cozy mystery genre, and are a fan of Agatha Christie, Anne Perry, Dianne Day, Rita Mae Brown, or Margaret Miles, this may not be the book for you. If you liked the 90's TV show Roseanne, you're in for a treat. She's back, this time as a British house cleaner named Lois. Ann Purser goes out of her way to make Lois unsympathetic, and her husband Derek and daughter Josie downright annoying and unlikeable. It seems as though Purser's trying to break down the stereotype of the British mystery by choosing working-class characters in modern times, which I completely respect, but she's building up another stereotype at the same time: that working-class people are brash, crass, and argumentative.  Aside from unsympathetic and sometimes annoying characters, the conclusion of this mystery is a bit far-fetched, and leaves a lot of questions unanswered. The sad thing is, I'm not even all that curious about having them answered.  A very unsatifying read. 
 Oh, Awesome! More Cheap DVD releases from Warner Home Video containing only 3 episodes! Could it get any worst than this 
 I was forced to read this, and attend multiple seminars from the Blanchard group.  Our CFO lives by the concepts, and he is running our department into the ground by following them.  The book is mostly fluff and took less than an hour to read.  There is ONE good point that I got from it, and that is when setting goals for people they should be trackable, relevant, and attainable.  I got that message in about 5 minutes though.  The rest anyone should already know -- praise in public and reprimand in private.  No kidding, learned that the first time I got humiliated in grade school.  Skip the book, and polish that resume if you are forced to read it 
 My husband had only been gone for a handful of days when I ordered this book.  I read all the reviews here and thought that the "religious" aspect would somehow be acceptable, perhaps very helpful.  I was stopped dead in my tracks when I read the following:  "At its very nature death is demonic, and you cannot explain the demonic.  Death happens.  It is not really God's fault, nor yours, nor that of your spouse.  Death is the devil's calling card."  Are you kidding me?  I lost my husband!  He died!  In the context of searching for spiritual understanding, the idea that the devil is responsible for my beloved husband's death is absurd.  Even if the practical, therapy half of this book might be helpful...it is made null and void in my mind by allowing such utterly nonsensical and antiquated thinking to prevail.  I quote further:  "Lazarus will come storming from the tomb.  Death can't hold him back with the power of Christ on his side.  Jesus is weeping because sin has broken this world, and death is a symbol of that brokenness.  Even though he has the power to fix it, Jesus grieves."  Am I to believe that my husband's death is punishment for "original sin"?  The message here is that we, "man", are the cause of the curse of death, through sin we have brought death upon ourselves and only at the second coming of the Messiah will we be "resurrected".    If these ideas bring comfort to those who grieve the loss of a spouse, then this is a good book to read.  I write this only as a warning to those who might have different "religious", spiritual or "Christian" beliefs, or those who may be seeking spiritual guidance.  The opinions set down in this book can be very discomforting and offensive.  
 Eyewitness Castles, Medieval Life, Knights: Boring. Eyewitness Castle isn't that good. It is very boring. The water Eyewitness books like Eyewitness SHARK are far more better then Castles, Medieval Life and  Knights 
 As one who's studied the Mountain Meadows Massacre and other aspects of the Old West, I like a good yarn as much as anyone. This book, however, was a disappointment. Author Sally Denton kept her readership on a short leash and never let anything get in the way of trashing the Mormon church. While other authors kept away from the fraudulent lead tablet while its authenticity was in doubt, Denton showed her disdain by buying it hook, line and sinker.  This tragedy happened before the "Civil War" for goodness sake. Going after the Mormons now is kind of like going after the Israelis for attacking the Liberty back in 1968 -- even worse. No one's left alive who was living back then and there was plenty of animosity between the Mormons and the Yankees, and the Mormons and the emigrants. Californians, who could have kept their mouths shut, constantly threatened the Mormons. In 1862-63, Abraham Lincoln showed how easily he could have civilians murdered and their homes burned with hardly any backlash.  Mountain Meadows was not unprovoked, but it was inexcusable. The right people were never brought to justice and Brigham Young should have seen that they were. But I don't think Denton's animosity now is justified. With all the Southerners murdered by the Union, Mountain Meadows was totally insignificant in comparison.   
 These movies can be had for 7 dollars a piece on amazon.com, and even cheaper elsewhere.  definitely not with anywhere near 40 dollars for the se 
 Zukav has a decidedly anti-Western tone and is obviously biased in favor of oriental thinking.  This is new age gobbledegook passed off as a bare bones reader on physics.  Rather than writing a laconic outline of physics, Zukav spends the majority of his time praising Eastern thought and toying with the idea that everything is subjective.    The reader is referred to any college physics textbook or Isaac Asimov's History of Physics or a good set of encylopedias.   
 I wish I had read some of the reviews of this book before making my purchase. I would have passed on it. I was hoping for something a little more detailed, more definitive. Instead I see a smattering of questionable entries on locations that were easily accessed on his itinerary, whether they were the best the state has to offer or not. As many would, I first looked at a state I know well (Kansas), to see Wood's recommendations. Gulp - he was way off! If P.J. Dinsmoore's "Garden of Eden" in Lucas is not even mentioned, or the world's largest ball of twine in Cawker City, this guy has not done his homework. 
 Even though this movie had good actors in it, I would not recommend it.  I especially was turned off by the language and I'm sorry to say this ended up in my trash and this was a first for me to do that 
  Apparently, this is a film that many women, who have read the book, can make enjoyable.   Characters, including Anne & the Captain, display wooden acting. Poker-faces. Others speak at a clipped pace. The properness of the times allowed for personality, as shown well in "Pride & Prejudice" 1996 & 2006, but not here. Shyness, plainness, or slowness, may be portrayed likeably, with some personality.   Both Anne & the Captain maintain wide-eyed, desperate, looks, constantly. Many of us do get nervous within romance; but we are compelled, by conversation, and activity, to interrupt our nervousness with personality. Thus, Anne's & the Captain's constant, wide-eyed, nervousness is un-natural. All of us at the age of Anne and the Captain, would have refined our nervousness to be responses of: shyness, thought, distance, hopefulness, approval, or alarm.   You understand the quiet thoughts, because of the story, in spite of the confusing, paralyzed, looks; rather than because of them. You come to like Anne and the Captain toward the end, in spite of the wooden acting, because of the story's ending.  This film has pretty scenery; such as walks along the ocean. The costumes are often very unique and well done. There is beautiful singing in one scene, and even better, wonderful singing over the closing credits.   Good period, romance films are so few, and so desired, that many women labor to imagine this film better than it is. I applaud their positive imaginations. However, they continued their fanciful, wishful, thoughts into rating this film. A reviewer, who liked the film, says she had read the book, and she cites a huge amount of important background from the book that is not shown in the film. A poor script for those who have not read the book. Awful directing made awful acting.   I would like to see this good story re-made by a better Director.   Well-made romance films are: "Pride & Prejudice", "Wives & Daughters", "North & South". Fairly made is "Under the Greenwood Tree" 
 Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of "heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads," is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see. 
 I was looking forward to this book, but was very disappointed once I got it.  Several of the patterns were already in their previous books, and one of the others (the sheep shawl) is just four of the sheep scarf from a previous book that are then sewn together.  I have enjoyed most of the previous books from the "Vogue Knitting on the Go" series and expected more from this book, but it did not deliver 
 This collection has a serious handicap in the omission of "Flower Drum Song." This gem is not available at all on DVD. What a loss to all 
 that was the worst novel ever.  I didn't follow the story line at all.  It seemed so random, almost like there wasn't a story line at all.  I was soooo confused with the book because I didn't see any characters except some hydrogen, cobalt, and zinc oxide.  There were so many marraiges between hydrogen and carbons and other oddly named people.  I was revolted when reading that 2 hydrogens married an oxygen.  DO NOT GET THIS BOOK.  IT IS POSSIBLY THE WORST STORY I HAVE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO READ 
 I live on the Vineyard and let's just say, this cook book does not represent island living in the least. The island is filled with an eclectic mix of people but you would never know it by this book. It tries a little too hard, says very little, is not innovative and seems to feel that it is better than the rest of us by showing some pictures and recipes of some celebrities and those who like to hang out with them. I have tried many of the recipes and few are memorable. The chatter written by the authors of the book and of each individual recipe seems overwritten and trite. Give me some humor, some grit, some wit. These are some pretty self-absorbed people. Lighten up, people. Let's hope this is the LAST of this series... 
 This book should have been a collection of short stories.  It needs some heavy editing.  There are moments of real science fiction and story telling, but it is burdened by preaching.  
 I'd say it was an ok movie, nothing to rave about. Monica Bellucci was a miss-fit, I didnt think she fit in at all as an American doctor helping poor Africans. Bruce Willis is always good. The action scene in the village was probably the best part. The last scene were not all that great at all, very ameaturish in my opinion. I found it really funny, that none of the Nigerian soldiers could shoot straight. Its ironic that all the people trying to do something good for the Africans were either Americans or Europeans, considering the fact that much of Africa's problems today could be attributed to European Colonization, or how everyone turned a blind-eye to what happened in Rwanda. If you want to watch a really good movie on this subject, then watch HOTEL RWANDA 
 Sorry folks, this is not a serious book by any standards. Much of what Shenkman has to say is either unproved speculation or purposeful misunderstanding of events and indeed of history itself. Please do not take this as a serious effort. It is not 
 I find that this unit spatters and sputters terribly when I make quantities of rice measuring 3 cups dry or more. It is a 10 cup cooked unit and I can't imagine making any larger quantities than I have. I use the right amount of rice and water. Water spills over onto my countertop and through the air hole. As it nears being done the liquid spatters out the air hole all over my countertop. What a mess! I threw away the packing materials or I would probably return it. I do like the non-stick pot and the keep warm feature. If anyone has any advice on how to keep this mess from happening, I would appreciate it 
 This would have to be the worst book I have ever read.Wow Will is running from dead people. Some one is trying to kill him so cool.How much more boring can you get.I would not recommend this book to a cave man or any thing for that mater. So what I'm saying is it stinks 
 I bought this player for viewing movies while camping. Fortunately we usually sleep in our SUV so we have access to a DC power outlet. This player does come with a cord that plugs into a cigarette lighter outlet. Otherwise it would be totally useless because the fully charged battery only lasts about 45 minutes.  The picture is ok but colors are not at all bright or vibrant. The sound is barely loud enough even when you're sitting two feet from the unit.  I've only watched two movies on it so far and it froze up once requiring a restart from the beggining of the movie but it does have a scene skip that allowed us to get back to where we left off pretty quickly. If it keeps working I'd say it was worth the $50 I paid for it at CVS 
 While this book contains a wide range of topics of interest to those considering parenthood, it doesn't cover these topics with very much detail.  I would have found it more helpful if the stories of the women interviewed had been longer than a paragraph apiece.  Overall, this book is useful in that it brings up many important issues for consideration, but in my opinion, it served only as a "springboard" for further research 
 A very cheap quick ripoff of a commercial success of Gremlins. The kid below me is to stupid to know what good films are. Take the pacifier out of your mouth and change your diapers, Mommas boy 
 Please do not be decieved into believing the lies that this books spews, it is neither a plausible nor in anyway acurate depiction of C S Lewis. He himself would be appauled at the implication that he agreed with the mormon philosphies. He was a true bornagain believer with a total desire to follow the one true Jesus Christ. Mormons believe that Jesus and Satan were brothers.So to assiociate the writings of a genius with the heretical lies of mormonism is totally rediculous and credulous. Keep your money and buy a book specifically written by the master himself. I personally love 'the great divorce' it will inspire your soul touch your sences and bring u face to face with the majesty and wonder of Jesus Christ our precious redeemer. The lord bless you all 
 It seems to me that this author is trying to tell us he is tired of Lucas Davenport.  I feel that he wants to transplant the best of Davenport to a new hero.If so, he failed.  If that is the case, he failed. There are long stretches of boring reading and suddenly a spark of the old haro comes through to us.  Worth to read if you cannot fall asleep; after some half a dozen pages, you can. How sad.. 
 I listened to cd and I dont know how to explain this cd. I cant really explain to well I guess, but i'll try. The problem I had was the swearing. I usually dont have a problem with swearing, but the way this band did it ruined the cd. It seemed like every other word in the songs are F$%*. It sounded like they tried to damn hard to impress the youth by doing this. The cd held nothing speical at all, not what I really wanted to hear in a metal cd. If you want really inspiring music go and listen to a Hatebreed cd. This cd is alright, but the swearing was so stupid and out of place. HA! Thats what I meant to say, the swearing just seemed random and out of place. Thats what the problem with the cd was. Just add it here and there, not every other word. Probably would have been a better cd that way. To fans fo Throwdown, please do complain. Everyone has an opinion and that is mine. 
 This book is so small that I can't believe it. And, it's not very inspirational either.  The photos are small and the print is even smaller.  I don't recommend this book 
 WWE mastermind Vince McMahon is pimping out his wrestlers as much as he can.  From the Rock with The Scorpion King a few years back, to more recently with John Cena in the abysmal The Marine, WWE wrestlers are popping up in bankable genres (I don't think we'll see the Undertaker in a romantic comedy anytime soon though).  With See No Evil, Glen "Kane" Jacobs is Jacob Goodnight: a religious psychopath with an eyeball fetish who is determined to eliminate sinners in as many grisly manners as he can think of.  And wouldn't you know that there's a group of trouble making sexy teens paying his run down hotel home a visit?  The first thing you'll notice is the lame attempt at what could be conceived as character development in the beginning of the film, before each gets picked off by our resident psycho.  There's nothing in See No Evil that you haven't seen or heard before in horror/slasher films from the 80's to today; combined with annoyingly terrible acting, predictable plot gimmicks, and the like.  The few good points of See No Evil are some nicely done gore effects (but few too many) and the casting of Kane who makes as opposing and intimidating a villain as any WWE fan would come to expect.  Other than that, this turkey can easily be avoided; even by the most devoted and die hard of horror afficiondos 
 Reading this book is required for my school district's health course, and that is the only reason I read it. The Jarretts, a wealth suburban family, are torn apart when the older son dies in a boating accident. The frigid cow of a wife closes herself off from everyone else, while the son goes to see the 'wacky' psychotherapist Doctor Berger, who is incredibly irritating that I was tempted to skip every chapter he appeared in. Everything else in the book is just boring.  The characters are all obnoxious, with the possible exception of the father, and if I had the choice I would drown them all. If you want to read a novel about teen issues, there are others out there that are much more worthy of your money and attention 
 All I can say about this CD is that I was so upset with the songs. Most of them got no interesting story to tell, unlike good songs that always do. I admit that he got a great voice, probably one of the most talented singers in the industry, but... If only he got better materials to record. He should learn something from his first album. 'Every light In The House' is still one among my all time favorits. Hope that he could get back on track ASA 
 We have had two of these things and both are nothing but junk!  That they charge $20 for it is a crime!  It gets jammed with every turn and it only increases the waste of stickers and tape.  Don't spend a precious dime on this piece of junk toy 
 We bought this for a Christmas gift for our son. What a colossal waste of money. He was so dissappointed that it was so hard to use (even with adult help). My husband had to re-solder wire connections before we could even use it once. We would have been better off to buy a strong magnifying glass and the prepared slides and looking at the slides that way. Actually finding and focusing on a slide image was almost impossible due to the cheapness of this product. It was his "big" present and turned out to be a dud. We'd return it, but that would blow Santa's cover 
 Her other two books were awesome so I expected the same out of this one but was sorely disappointed.  I kept slogging through the short stories expecting them to be connected in some way but alas, I was wrong.  The entire book is a series of short stories that go nowhere.  They're not connected with at all.  I'm left totally unsatisfied.    How did this get published?  Oh yes, the name "Jennifer Weiner" was on the cover.  Don't judge a book by its cover and I am ashamed I did just that.  This is the first book that makes me want my money back.  Shame on the publishers for letting this one out, in hard back no less.  To think what I could have done with $20 and the five hours I spent on the book.. 
 This book does not have enough examples in the text.  I tend to learn better by example and this book is not for people like myself.  Also, there are no solutions to any of the homework problems in the back of the book.  So you can't check your answers to see if you are doing the problems right 
 but stupid and mindless. Presley was never an actor, and proves it once again here. But the songs are even worse than his acting. There are no good ones. None. Not even the title song, whioch was never a major hit for him. The rest of the cast is the usual melange of unknowns or semi-knowns who either totally non-act, or overact with the extremely limited talent they have. Only Harry Morgan, who was likely the only really talented one in the bunch (OK, Strauss to a degree, too) seemed to be having a good time; it's almost as if he went into the movie with a "Hell, it's a paycheck" attitude. The ending goes beyond trite into fantasy. And what can you say about Donna Douglas? Well, she was slightly better here than as Ellie May Clampett. But that's like saying one shade of battleship gray is a bit less dull than the other. The humor in the Beverly Hillbillies rarely, if ever, developed from her. Catch this on TV if you have a few minutes to kill 
 If you have ever installed an X-10 module then this book is a waste of your money.  I purchased this book based on the reputation of O'Reilly as a publisher.  But after reading this book I will not make that mistake again.   This book contains very basic X-10 information, so if you are intrested in exploring the use of X-10 for the first time this book might be interesting, but I think there are far better places to start.   Examples... Hack #1 discribes basic X-10 addressing, hack #2 tells you how to turn on a light.... What a joke.  Hack #88 "Streamline your Apple scripts"  Well, like 95% of the world this has no use to me... I use a PC.  Anothe Mac only hack is #91 which is using the mac iCAL program.  There is no PC version.  Hack #92 is for Charting... And you guessed it... It is for the MAC AGAIN! #93, MAC again...  So keep lookng this book not worth the money.  
 I dragged myself through every novel in this series with soap-opera like compulsion, always looking forward to the climatic appearance of our Lord.  Therefore, I anticipated this final novel to be glorious, as the title indicates, but I was woefully wrong.  Are my expectations too lofty for the day of our coming King and His Kingdom?  Certainly not!    I support Christian fiction with many 5 star reviews,--just look at my other reviews--but I can not recommend this series 
 Lady Diana Westover is a most unusual young woman.  The daughter of a duke, she has spent most of her life living quietly in Lincolnshire with her father.  When he passes away, she heads to Bath to visit her aunts.  While they seek to introduce her to eligible suitors, Diana searches for a different kind of man.  She has a secret, you see.  Diana has a passion for gothic novels and is in the process of writing one of her own.  Unfortunately, her sheltered upbringing precluded her meeting the dark and dangerous types of men.  Making up for lost time, Diana is using the pretense of moving around in Bath society to find inspiration for her villain.  She finds her perfect Count Korlovsky when she spots the Viscount Adderley.  Having been blessed with a handsome face, Edmond Terrington, the Viscount Adderley, is no stranger to admiring looks from the ladies.  However, there's something different about the intense looks he gets from Diana Westover.  When he catches her several times eavesdropping on his conversations, Edmond decides to turn the tables and pursue her.  Soon their little rendezvous turn into stolen kisses, but there's a problem with their growing romance.  An old rival has long spread malicious lies about Edmond and it has tarnished his reputation.  Now, Edmond will have to put his past to rest in order to win his lady.  While KISS ME QUICK has its share of enjoyable moments, it gave me an impression that the story is mired in contradictions and the protagonists are much too modern for their setting.  It's hard to believe that a hero like Edmond Terrington would willingly stand by and allow himself to be slandered for years.  That behavior just doesn't seem...well, Regency-like.  As for Diana, as clever as she is to get into all sorts of adventures, her behavior comes across as erratic especially towards the end of the story.  With such fatal flaws to be found in its lead characters, it was all the more difficult to warm to the story.  TheScheme 
 I am against Sufism in general and against the Ibne `ul-Arabism in particular. Sufism is nothing more than a philosophy based on hallucination, either self-induced or drug induced.  A greater danger of Sufism is their smooth approach in leading people towards shiism and this man, ibne ul-arabi is champion at that.  I have read his main book,  futuhat, which I consider his master non-sense, and time after time I was amazed how his argument was pointing towards shiism. Don't be fooled by his few sentences here and there which he makes against "shias", look at the essence of what he is telling people. Does ibne ularabi really think that people are that naïve?  If I were a shia, I would have known no better book to use as a shia propaganda than this person's book.  Corbin, without knowing perhaps, has done Moslems, especially the one who live in the west and are not very familiar with their religion, a great service by exposing Arabi as who he was, a shia or shia sympathetic. I look at him a very smooth and clever shai.  That is why many Sunni scholars have written so many books against this man and his evil teachings.  I just see it my religious duty to warn my brothers about the danger of this most famous hypocrite n the Islamic world 
 If you're not anal about sound quality then please skip this review.   That said, this DTS disc sounds terrible. Why?   1- If you're even vaguely familiar with this album or the songs, you will hardly recognize them here. The multi-channel mix is way out of phase from the original stereo mix; in other words, they sound totally different from each other.   2- This disc doesn't have the fidelity of the SONY re-mastered Abraxas. The tape hiss is very noticeable, and the overall sound is very dull. Just compare this disc with the newer re-mastered version and you will hear the difference immediatley.  Save your money and "maybe" someday SONY will release a multi-channel SACD from the same source as the rather excellent re-mastered cd 
 I had to read this book for my highschool literature class. Now I enjoy reading a good book now and then but the only reason that this is a bestseller is that all highschools across america must buy the book for summer reading every year. This book put me to sleep. The only reason this book gets two stars is because of the Trojan War chapter which I wished was longer. It was rich in detail and made you want to keep reading, unlike the rest of the book. I only recommend this book if you have to for a school class but other than that don't waste your time 
 I am a huge fan of Nick Bantock and his trilogies, and was looking forward to his latest novel.   This story was not intriguing as his past movels, and the "artwork" was almost non-existent.  I was so disappointed, and suggest that if you want to read it, check it out of the library and don't waste your money.  I'm going to re-read Griffin & Sabine again, just for the thrill of it 
 `Paparazzi,' produced by 20th Century Fox and Mel Gibson's Icon Productions, looks exactly like any celebrity's secret fantasy. But making someone's secret fantasy into a film is not a bad thing at all. What I disliked about `Paparazzi' is not the lack of wit or insight into the `jobs' of paparazzi - oh, that's so easy to guess - but the lack of storytelling skill, or its payoff as entertainment. In other words, the story about the rising Hollywood star Bo Laramie who is badly treated by the paparazzi and his secret payback plans is neither thrilling nor intense as revenge fantasy.   Yes, I understand. Some paparazzi (if not all) deserve to suffer such a bitter fate as those persistent cameramen who stalk and harass the new Hollywood action star Bo Laramie (Cole Hauser) and his family. I know some cameramen really do annoying things, and provoke celebrities on purpose in the same way as the mean and sleazy `journalist' Rex Harper (Tom Sizemore) does to Bo and his son. And suppose his beloved son and wife are hospitalized because of those paparazzi, what should he do?  [CLUMSY PACE AND UNDERWHELMING PAYOFFS] `Paparazzi' is a revenge fantasy that is part based on the reality in Hollywood, and the tragic death of Princess Diana. You just cannot discuss this kind of exploitation film from a moral perspective because these films are purely entertainment in which we see the good guys rewarded and bad guys punished. And I like these films from the days of Charles `Death Wish' Bronson.   `Paparazzi,' however, does not let us wallow in this guilty pleasure fantasy enough. In other words, the actions (or Bo's revenge) are not thrilling enough and neither are the payoffs. Trashy or not, any revenge story must have good amount of thrills in it in order to really taste sweet. But the taste of `Paparazzi' is only mild at best. It does not give us enough taste of honey because several ruses Bo uses to trap these paparazzi are too far-fetched and even tame, and those paparazzi are also too easy a target for him.  Bo oversteps the mark because they overstepped it. This questionable formula works only when it does not give enough time for us to think. In spite of its short running time (that barely exceeds 80 minutes), however, `Paparazzi' kills its potentially interesting story by its slow and clumsy pace, heavy-handed direction that does not know the right way to tell an intriguing story, and disappointing acting from Hauser and Sizemore.   The only thing I find interesting is the cameos from Mel Gibson, Vince Vaughn, Chris Rock, and Matthew McConaughey. Otherwise, `Paparazzi' lacks power and action that those revenge fantasy should have 
 Wonderful prose -- use of language 
 I didn't know too much about WiMAX and this book didn't add a whole lot. it seems like a bit of hodgepodge printed in very low quality.  a bunch of pseudo 'business considerations' and a lot of hype + some information that seemed outdated.   on the plus side - it is a very short read and I could expense the cost ... 
 Not only is this film not well produced, with relatively poor visuals and a less-than-quality soundtrack but it leaves one completely unsatisfied.  The violent scenes are unnecessary and provide little but visual uncomfortableness throughout the entire movie.  I was expecting something much more  based on prior reviews.   I found the film falling far short of where it  could have gone - disappointing and puzzling 
 Definately only a book to use to look up names.  not to actually help you find one. You can find this type of alphabetical dictionary set up of names many places online for free 
 THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.  I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life 
 Don't bother with this book. She promises to let you in on some great motivation she experienced and nothing happens.  Also this book just seems a vehicle to get you to buy her evergrowing junk related to her "plan". Well she didn't need or have all this jazz when she lost all this weight, why should you? She is just trying to make more money. You don't need all that extra stuff she is trying to con you in to. If the book was motivating I would say buy that and use it, but it's not. So it is best to just overlook this whole thing entirely 
 Great DVD in general, but the mastering of the audio leaves a lot to be desired. Basically, the sound is too flat in both stereo and 5.1, and the 5.1 mix is really heavy on the right channel (sounds unbalanced).  Most of the footage from this DVD comes from the Eurockennes de Belfort festival. Of which I have an unofficial copy (it was broadcast over digital TV in Europe, a friend recorded it, made a DVD and sent the uncompressed original to me).  Let me say that the broadcast version of this show is *vastly* superior to what is found on this DVD. Which leaves me disappointed and wondering what the fark Rhino Home Video was doing when they mastered this DVD. It's not terrible per se (it is the Pixies after all), but when I know that there is source material out there that is better I simply cannot give this a good rating. They should have put the original audio source on this DVD instead of doing whatever they did to make the audio sound muffled.  I'm actually going to write to Rhino and inquire why the audio on this DVD is so awful 
 A very disappointing book, and again, makes me very wary of any item on a "New York Times Best Seller List" or any other list, and really any big name reviewer recommendation.  This book has one 50 page chapter which is excellent - the recap of the Thompson "Shot heard around the world" homerun. If you are a baseball fan as I am, that (barely) made the book worthwhile. The other 700 pages are disjoint, incomprehensible, and really trivial. You come away thinking "I really don't care bout this stuff" - I don't care about the dynamics of trash, about J Edgar Hoover's bathroom habits, Klara Sax's artistic depression and annoying infatuations about roof tops, about characters that just don't have much depth to really care about. At the end, even potentially interesting characters like Albert (the one on the baseball quest) become hard to bear. The whole book in fact had the feel of going to a senior citizen home.  I read this book, as perhaps others did, expecting a book about the mafia or about other figures in the underworld. What I got was a book with a good first chapter, some interesting tidbits here and there about how life used to be in the 50's (fear of nuclear weapons, duck and cover classroom exercies), and a lot of knowledge about the trash business.   The "masterful" epilogue, as other reviewers call it, really does no justice to a reader who has spent so much time toiling over Delillo's ragtag story telling. I am ok with stream of consciousness writing, or nonchronological chapters, or even random chapters, but the methods used in thsi book served no purpose other than to further make the reading difficult.   Was this book about how mundane our lives are versus the bigger things that occur around us? Or how each of us is on an individual quest? Or that the 50's-60's-70's-80's were just years of fear, and the 90's are years of greed? I am still unsure, I still don't think any of these themes came across well.  Please - not pretending to be a sophisticate, intellectual, or professional critic - but this book is really not worth the time or effort. You can be staisfied by a number of other books, including the "The Corrections" by Franzen or "The Cold Six Thousand" by Ellroy  which cover a similar period or similar themes and do not make you so frustrated or disappointed at the end.  Read the first chapter, then put the book down or you will be sorely disappointed and have wasted an awful lot of time.  
 I can't believe any kid over 3 would ever listen to this album. This is not music for kids, it's music that grown ups who don't like music think is what kids should listen to. I'm sorry, it may have been sweet when Mr. Rogers sang these songs as part of his show but these overproduced celebrity sung songs are unbearable. Where is the humor? Where is the kids point of view. WHERE IS THE IMAGINATION? I can't believe 13,000 people would spend a Saturday morning listening to this as they did last summer to Ralph's World. Not only do artists like Ralph Covert and Justin Roberts sing music that speaks to kids, but they sing music that brings the kid out of all of us. This music may be great to put on while little Billy chews on his blocks, but forget about it being played ever again once they reach 6 years old. And me and my daughters will still be "Surfing to Our 'Our' Imaginations", 50 years from now. 
 this CD Deserves 1/2 a Star Because i did enjoy whipping it out the window of my car into a nearby bicyclist....It was pretty funny.  Otherwise this record was worthless 
 I generally enjoy reading biographies, but this one was an exception! A very boring read! I did not think that Lincoln was being portrayed as overly religous as another reviewer did, but I seriously doubt that lincoln had evangelical inclinations. I was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of Lincoln's life. I feel that there was too much concentration on Lincoln the politician (his political development) and not enough about his family and social life. I wanted to know Lincoln better on a personal level and I did not feel that this book provided much insight. I may have been expecting too much, but I prefer a biographry that maintains my interest rather than puting me to sleep, as this one frequently did 
 I've enjoyed other works by this artist, so I purchased "Christmas and Sante Fe" without listening to it first.  What a mistake.  It's what I call motivational music.  It makes me want to do something else 
 Blum's style is horrendous.  She traipses from one anecdote about her son to the findings of scientists she has interviewed without the blink of an eye.  She does not so much advance arguments or conclusions as much as merely advance dumbed-down versions of scientific studies.  Matters such as which questions underlie the research and what the research reveals are interspersed with bad puns and Blum's own opinion as to whether something is insulting or disgusting.  Her attempts to lighten the fare are patronizing and distracting.  She wrote way too much about non-humans.  This or that primate species is simply not the human species.  The differences between them are so great that their relevance for the human species does not seem to be established.    Most of the research she chose was physiological, behavioral, and anthropological.  Evolutionary biology (a.k.a. sociobiology) gets only occasional treatment, despite its recent progress in explaining male and female differences.    Note also that the book was published in 1997.  I write in 2005, so the book is eight years old.  Try to find something more up to date on the subject.  Overall, the book's faults can most easily be attributed to the fact that the author is a journalist and not a scientist.  She sarificed too much to appealing to the general readership and is not well-schooled in the science of human sex differences herself 
 It is difficult to give this book a critical look because it has become as unquestioned as the Bible is in certain circles.  According to the author the Vietnamese are unknown and unknowable to westerners. (Somehow she has grasped their elemental essence.) They share so little in common with the rest of humanity that Stalinist communism is the only political system under which they will prosper and be true to their anthropological roots.  "The moment has arrived for the narrow flame of revolution to cleanse the lake of Vietnamese society from the corruption and disorder of the American war.  It will have to come, for it is the only way the Vietnamese of the south can restore their country and their history to themselves."  As it has been seen by the eyes of the world through the history of Southeast Asia since 1975 the South Vietnamese were truly fortunate to have been "liberated" and "brought back to their heritage" by a force as truly benevolent and peaceful as the government of the "Democratic Republic of Vietnam."  Overly academic in an elitist anti-anticommunist way, this book has been required reading in all "revisionist" undergraduate history seminars and lectures since its first publication in 1972. (What was "revisionist" in the 1970s is the Very Truth in 2005.) It has the obligitory academic but irrelevant references to "dead white men" (Shakespeare's Tempest) for mostly incomprehensible reasons.  As I watch the people of Vietnam being pimped by their government to enrich its coffers and those of the Nike Corporation, I think of how stupid, ignorant and ultimately vile this book is and was.  As I watch the diaspora of Vietnam succeed and prosper I wonder how Frances Fitzgerald can sleep for all of their brothers and sisters left behind in that unfortunate and misjudged land. For all of its damage done it is regrettable that this book was not the end of Frances Fitzgerald's career, but its beginning 
 If you seriously know nothing about the opening then this book will probably help you some.  However, if you already have gathered all the basic concepts (which seem to be mentioned in pretty much every chess book ever made) then this book is a waste of money.  Even for the complete beginner, I reccomend the recent books Openings for White/Black Explained by Lev Alburt, Roman D., etc., which can serve as both an introduction and a full course.    I thought this book would give me a repertoir, so I would know some actual openings.  However, the coverage of any one opening is so minimal you definitely dont know enough to actually play it in anysort of competetive way.  To repeat: this book will not teach you to play openings competetively, it is only an introduction.  Seirawan briefly covers classical openings and then covers in slightly more depth his "opening solution" which is the Kings Indian Defense versus d4, the Pirc versus e4, and the Kings Indian Attack as White.  First off, I found I do not enjoy playing any of those openings at all.  What is the advantage of being able to play the same 5+ moves at the start of every game? Then what after that?  Well these openings are not devoid of theory and once you reach the end of the first 5 moves you have just as much work to do as with any other opening;  you have just delayed the inevidable conflict for the center--which means a slower, longer, duller game.  Secondly, if you do like these openings you will still have to buy more books that actually cover them!  I would reccommend, even if you are a beginner, to buy the Openings Explained for White / Black by Lev Alburt, Roman D.  Besides full coverage of the openings in the repertoir book, it also briefly covers some other traditional openings (just like winning chess openings).  If you want an introduction you have one in the first chapter; if you want to really LEARN an opening then you have that too.  Or if you already have an idea what openings your want to play then DEFINITELY don't get this book, instead get some thorough books on that/those openings 
 This movie is so bad, it barely deserves mention. However, I am a big DL fan, and I am writing this in the hope that Dolph will not abandon his fans---he may be making movies like this just for the $$, but, I believe, he is also doing irreparable damage to his career 
 I have enjoyed every installment of this series except the latest edition. I could never get into the plot and left the book wondering if it was even written by the same author. Instead of the smooth flowing writing I am used to it was very difficult to follow and had radical character departures from usual behavior with very sloppy hasty justification. This appears to be a rough draft not a finished product. I am very disappointed 
 Bland, bland, and more bland.  It seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance, and fell far short of the mark.  With the except on the main character's mother, nearly every single character was completely unlikeable.  And a little Lea Delaria goes a long, long way.  It does replicate the 80s very well, but it just feels so devoid of humanity 
 I was really excited about getting this book, but realized why no one else had written about the trivia of Walt Disney World. I feel that the author put a lot of hard work into the book, but the info is not worth reading.. this is said by a disney fanatic who owns over 100 disney related books. This book is not worth spending the mone 
 Secret Agent was quite a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Gerard Depardieu, Robin Williams, Bob Hoskins, Christian Bale, and Patricia Arquette among others. The movie brings to the screen the story of an Englishman, living with his young wife and her retarded brother in the city of London.  Things, however, are not as they seem in 19th Century London, with spies, double agents, anarchists and revolutionaries having a field day...  In short, the acting is surprisingly average (!), the setting is pretty good, while the dialogues and the plot are below average. The movie has that Sherlock Holmes feel about it, but without the "magic," meaning that in the end you are left... numb, and wondering: "Was that it?" As for the rating, it could have been PG-13.   Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really... 
 too bad that such an important subject was handled in such a biased way.  even worse is that the facts were either only particaly used or twisted to fit the point mr. toobin was trying to make at the time.  everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts.  this book should classified as fiction and not non-fiction 
 Ric still assumes you can get 10% on investments.  Right.  And your Enron retirement plan will keep you cozy until you're 99 
 I had read a review where the Christ Clone Trilogy was compared to Dan Brown's DaVinci Code. I love Dan Brown's books so based on that review I purchased the first two books in the Christ Clone Trilogy. THEY ARE TERRIBLE!! I was greatly disappointed. There is so much focus on disaster, the writing is stilted, the characters are shallow, and the misrepresentation of Jesus Christ and his apostles is just too much. This is the worst book I've read in a long time. The "disclaimer" at the beginning of the book asks us to suspend judgement until all three books have been read, and I admit I only got half way through the second book and just couldn't go on. It was SO DEPRESSING and it twisted the teachings of the New Testament to an uncomfortable degree. I know these books are fiction, but I still wonder what Mr. BeauSeigneur was trying to accomplish. I ended up throwing both books away - I wasn't about to donate them to our local library for anyone else to read them because they were so bad. Any Christian would be very uncomfortable reading this book. 
 I ordered one and had it arrive totally broken. Amazon sent a replacement. That too was defective. Save your time/money and buy another, maybe in person. I'm not convinced that hair dryers survive shipping.  (Amazon is giving me a refund including shipping, so there's not a problem there. 
 The reader should be aware of the fact that the author of this book was in the process of converting from Buddhism to Catholicism when he wrote it. In fact he then went on and wrote a book specifically about THAT - it is titled "The Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism". In my opinion Williams goes out of his way (and at times quite obviously) to promote the view that Buddhism is inherently nihilistic. Rupert Gethin's "The Foundations of Buddhism" is vastly superior, as are the books by Kogen Mizuno: "Essentials of Buddhism" and "Basic Buddhist Concepts" 
  I took a night course which used this textbook. The instructor who is a certified coder and is an instructor at other institutions found MANY misleading instructions. You can be told to do something one way in the book but in real life at a billing job, you would have to do it another way. Also, we found many contradicting statements. They say one thing but do something totally different in their examples. It's really not worth the money 
 I think someone doesn't know the definition of comic.  It was painful to get through this book as it's hard to care about more than a couple of the characters or storylines.   
 Pierre Mornell's, 'Games Companies Play,' makes for a quick and easy 2 hour or so read - printed in enormous type with a sparse page layout readers will effortlessly glide from start to finish without so much as utilizing a sprinkling of brain power.  While this book does serve nicely as a very general overview of the job search and hiring process, those who are in need of more nuts and bolts information will be sorely disappointed with what this book has to offer 
 I book leaves me wondering. Dont buy it. I saw on the website its all FALSE 
 I was very excited to get this product.  It scans well, files well, is very sexy and promising.  Then I decided to Search for a few files based on my Keywords.  Oooops!  It won't search!! If you don't know already, PaperPort offers you only one free tech support call.  After that it's $20 a pop.  The rather surly technician I reached had me re-install my program.  Okay, but it still wouldn't search.  Then he told me to un-install Windows Service Pack 2.  Uh uh, no way.  Nada.  That's when I asked for a refund. I bought MyCab for $40.  Tech support is marvelous, within one hour over the Internet.  The only thing it doesn't do is scan within the program, but then I can do that, can't I? AK Napa, C 
 This is a well written book, however, I feel I should point out several issues I have with this book, which seems to follow the formula of the "modern teen problem novel".  This novel "explores difficult emotions" such as selfishness,jealousy, and alienation from God. All characters who are devoutly religious are portrayed as either uneducated or mean, and any "enlightened" characters or heroes are portrayed as not being religious.( Does anyone really know any Christians who go around , Bible-in-hand, accusing other women of "whoredom"?) And what modern teen "problem novel" would be complete without some sexual themes, and at least a brief discussion of menstruation ?  At the book's end, our main character chooses to continue in her career after the birth of first child. Parents should also be advised that Sara Louise's "coming of age" includes rejecting religion.( Although, to be fair, the book does not portray Sara as a happy person, but I think this subtlety will be lost on children.)  Judging by other reviews, most child readers did not pick up on the fact that Caroline was a much kinder and more likable person than Sara Louise.  An adult reader who is wise to the anti-religious bias may enjoy the book ( if they're not grossed out by the idea of a 14 year old having a crush on a 70 year old man). If you are looking for a book about a normal child, with normal child feelings, dealing with her "perfect" sister, read Little House on the Prairie and leave this book on the shelf. Appropriate reading for adults, who can understand the bias against religion, but not at all recommended for children. 
 This book was nothing but painful to try and get through. Though I sometimes enjoy Jodi Picoult's writing, Picture Perfect was extremely far fetched and simply unbelievable.  I spent a lot of time rolling my eyes, shaking my head, thinking...come on, give me a break. I stopped the torture about 60% of the way through, giving up the hope that I had indeed wasted 10.46.   Pretentious, unbelievable, boring, pathetic story line...save yourself the money and the torture..pass this Jodi Picoult novel by 
 Being a dog lover and a lover of literature I was thrilled when I found this book on the store shelf.  A quick look at the list of authors and the cover illustrations and I was thinking what a find.  This book boasts that it's "for lovers of good fiction - with a healthy side interest in dogs".  This sounded perfect for me.  I was very disappointed reading this book.  I found a number of the stories to be uninteresting and I felt a few were very poorly written.  While I will admit that a few (and I mean a very few) of the short stories were good the majority of them were appalling to any dog lover that I know and many of them had nothing but a brief mention of a dog in them.  It truly is not a book for dog lovers or even remote animal lovers.  If I had known what this book was really about, I wouldn't have spent my hard earned money on it and would urge others not to bother.  Borrow someone else's copy or see if the local library has a copy but don't spend your money in hopes of some good dog stories because you won't find them in this book.  As for the literary value of this book, it might be more highly respected if it wasn't so misrepresented and marketed to dog or animal lovers but I doubt it. 
 I expected much more from this book. I'm not really sure why, though, because we formerly used the Gallup test to select our  sales people. This could have been a good book. But the authors seriously miss the mark. They are clearly more interested in selling their own version of a sales test than giving sales people useful information. Most of the information they do share is not new. It's the same old stuff you get in Marcus Buckingham's Gallup sales brouchure also marketed as a book. The biggest problem with Benson and Rutigliano's book is the airy fairy untested psycho fluff they're trying to float as established scientific discoveries. The two authors are both Gallup's hired hands. They say successful salespeople are successful because they share one common trait. They "use their strongest aptitudes" to succeed in their work. "Strongest aptitudes?" Where haven't we heard that one before? What about intelligence and motivation and values and skill development? This book reads smoothly but won't work in practice. I know because we used to use the principles marketed in this book. But the selection mistakes proved too costly as we found out they also did for other users. Forget about the strenthfinder test this book touts. The book is an undisguised phising expedition for more people to take their sales test. But who cares? Does anyone still think you can trust surveys collected on the web? There are plenty of excellent books out there for sales people. Miller and Heiman, Tony Parinello, Spin Selling (one of my favorites), Dudley and Goodson (another favorite), Zig Ziglar, Huthwaite, these are the books salespeople should be reading 
 I do not recommend this book.  I purchased it under the assumption that it would include individual accounts of people dealing with MS.  It does, but not in the manner that I presumed it would.  The book does offer individual accounts of the struggle with MS, but the stories seem to be incomplete and unorganized.  As someone living with MS, I wanted to know about the individual's diagnosis history, symptoms, treatment, etc.  Many of the stories never mentioned specifics or they left out important events.  The idea of what the individual's have been through does make the stories inspiring, but the lack of content and organization left me feeling frustrated and sad 
 Terrible sound, boring.... worst classical CD I have ever listed to. I highly recommend Mozart: Requiem 
 This book did not work for me. I believe that natural chemistry and relating to one another are the hallmarks of a mutual and intimate relationship. In this book, the author, rather than helping readers open themselves up to intimacy and be themselves, presents tricks on how to attract the opposite sex. Personally, I'm not looking to 'trick' anyone into going out with me or fall in love. How I open a car door for a woman or how she should or should not reach over to unlock the door for me as I'm walking around after I've opened the car door for her feels like protocol designed to play 'the game' properly. I don't feel that it's a game. It's about being true to ourselves. It's about relating - being best friends. And we are not peacocks - displaying our feathers at such a time and presenting at a certain time. We are empowered with language. I'm more partial to books that explore the similarities between men and women rather than the differences as Gray does. Authors that I recommend are Charlotte Kasl, John Welwood and John Stoltenberg. Good luck! 
 An entertaining, though frustrating look at the Victorian era. Wilson's habit of using 5 words where 1 will do and never writing an unequivical sentence grows old quickly, and it is hard to keep track of where each chapter is going. Paragraphs and chapters do not segue neatly into one another. While the book does discuss a lot of interesting ideas and people I can't help but think other books on the era must do so as well and in a more pleasing style of writing 
 I've been reading golf books for thirty years and this one has to be in the top five of the worst I've ever read. As I was reading this I noticed that I was reading the same paragraph, word for word, only in different chapters. If you want to read good books on Pinehurst stick with anything by Lee Pace. 
 Walt Whitman's life's work is his "Leaves of Grass", enlarged over the years with additional poems.  Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the "Manifest Destiny" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.    The poems are diverse and upbeat.  The language, for the most part, is clear and easy.  Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines.  Very few poetic devises are used.  One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry.  But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.    Although a classic, "Leaves of Grass" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology.  None of his poems are memorable.  Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.  I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.  Whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, "Dead Poet's Society"; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is 
 What a waste of time. This was like sitting through a very boring business course. I was never interested in turning the page. I would have liked to see more of Carly personal side and maybe some human aspect to this story.Instead I felt like a robot was telling this story.Very much of how great her business style was and very little about anything else. I forced myself to finish this. A huge diaappointment.Don't waste your money 
 I bought this video based on the reviews and was so disappointed that I never got past the first 20 minutes.  I am not a prude, but to use the f word in every sentene as an adjective, verb and however else it may be used was a complete turnoff.  I put the video in my recycle box.  Maybe it had some substance, but I could not get past the first 20 minute 
 Found this novel very trite and the lead character too overblown and shrill. Also as another reviewer said - what is with Jerry Mather's being gay???  I am sure that he is NOT.  Loaded with errors and mis-spellings.  I could not understand why the lead character did not want to be around her family.  Her mother did not seem like a bad person so I did not think that this was developed at all.  This novel could have been alot better and I am not going to read any of her other books.  Too many good southern writers to read instead of reading Ms. Smith's. Read Cathy Holton's novel instead - wonderful southern women's novel 
 I'm really dissapointed in this remix cd, I love NIN and Broken was a great EP. But they remixed them a little TOO well. A really good example is the last song "Screaming Slave?" what the heck is the point of listening to 6 mintues of hearing someone yell in pain? It's boring 
 This book is lame.  It's black and white drawings are sloppy and they don't instruct.   There is little or no instructions This book is way over priced.  Stay away from it 
 This book is typical marxist/internationalist nonsense. Anderson's apparently brilliant revelation seems to be that "nations" are artificial constructs or "imagined" entities. Well, duh. All civilization is essentially artificial in the sense that it is man-made and not a natural phenomenon. Perhaps we should all go back to wearing fig leaves and chanting around fire-pits. All sarcasm aside, Anderson-along with many reviewers here-seem to think that artificial equals bad. Nay, I say. One of the most natural things in the world is the tendency for birds of a feather to flock together. Or, as related to humans, we naturally stick to our kind. Nationalism is built upon the fact that humans are happiest and most productive when they live and work with others of the same language, race, culture, etc. Therefore, Nationalism simply takes this natural fact and officializes it. So while nationalism itself is of course artificial, the underlying priciples are anything but. We nationalists also have the apparently evil habit of preferring to preserve and cherish our respective cultures as opposed to having it watered down and eventually disintegrated by the onslaught of multi-culturalism and internationalism. People like Anderson make a living out of furthering this one-world fairytale where supposedly everybody will just throw down their guns and embrace if we could only get this stubborn "we're different" idea out of our thick heads. Needless to say, this type of person completely misunderstands or denies the unavoidable reality of human nature. Face it folks, we're different. But you know what else, that's ok. 
 The argument that there must be a higher power because there is too much complexity is childish. Just because we believe it to be complex does not require that something as intelligent as a human (or more so) was needed. Check out The Blind Watchmaker by Dawkins for a superior argument.  I also just wanted to note to Cymry9876, and to others, that Antony Flew has not "converted" to theism as has been often claimed. How do I know this? He announced his position to a crowded auditorium at a conference on Secular Humanism in Amherst, NY. Misinformation does not an argument make 
 As other reviewers have pointed out - this book is all about its clever title.  Cahill does a very poor job at his subject.  He really is not in touch with Ireland and the book reads like it is padded from sources that are not familiar with current information.  I found particular irritating the way he "patronized" the Irish as an island of children.  Irish contribution to world scholarship is better described elsewhere.  I would not recommend this book for those really interested in medieval Ireland - I would recommend McCaffrey's In Search of Ancient Ireland as a better alternative for those really looking for a quality read 
 Whyte's historical knowledge and presentation of 4th and 5th century life creates a credible and interesting background for this story. As a history buff, I am always looking for good writers in this vein. I have to say that I was disappointed by the writing style and the sledge hammer subtle plot development. The important points were emphasized and repeated ad nauseum to the point of distracting from the flow of the narrative. The romantic relationship with the principle woman was not very convincing or moving and I found myself skimming those passages rather than being moved by them. The characters seem somewhat 2 dimensional as well. Mr. Whyte has written many books on interesting subjects and time periods, but I doubt I will try any others since I was so bored with this one 
 Un-Christianlike methods used here! I wouldn't recommend to anybody that they read stuff about a religion from the enemies of that religion! People should study books and literature from their own religion, put out by their leaders, to find out what they believe! Or, as my 17 year old son likes to say, "Why would you ask a lawyer how to do the work of a doctor?" Instead of tearing down a church, the author should write a book on why his beliefs are so great. Did he do that yet?   I believe the author can't be satisfied, or at peace, as long as it is possible that the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is true. He has done everything he can to disprove it, and failed miserably.   The Book of Mormon is simply an ancient "journal" of people in another land that Christ visited. Why would God not check on and visit all people in all ages? That's what I find hard to believe, that God only spoke to prophets before Christ, but not after? Hmm. Why would He do that to us? I don't think a loving God would. Do you? 
 The book was written before the peso devaluation and subsequent crisis and is utterly useless unless you need a paperweight.  This 3rd Edition is dated March 2002, and all hotel and restaurant pricing is from pre-devaluation. I spent November 2004 in Buenoes Aires and am headed back January 19, 2005.  Buy Time Out Buenos Aires instead: Second Edition 2004.  It is perfect 
  Don't get burned.  Here's why:  - Incomplete.  A lot of classic clips are missing from this set.  Blatant Example: The booklet has pictures and a small writeup on the "Keep God out of California" skit - but reading about it in the booklet is all you'll get to do, they didn't put the skit on the DVDs.  Read the rest of the reviews here for just a few of the dozens of major skits you won't get to see with this set.  - Censorship. I want to hear every damn word.  With the stunts these guys have been pulling for years, swear words and the occasional private patch are the last things Paramount needs to worry about protecting us from.  I held off on buying Volume 2 and Volume 3 because they were bleeped and blurred, and I would have passed on this box set too if I had taken the time to research this.  Shame on me.  - Format.  It's a mess, tossed together like a CKY disc.  Still fun to watch, but it should have been kept in it's original episode format, in order of air date.  Don't get any expectations of bouncing on the couch in time to the awesome intro theme, or being welcomed to the episode by Knoxville like you may be used to.  I'm ticked that I dropped a hefty chunk of money on a set that was put together with no regard for the show's legacy.  Material is either missing, edited, or censored - I'll bet those Paramount bigwigs even censored the missing skits before they dumped them from the DVD set.  What a waste of something beautiful 
 A rather spirited debate among reviewers for a book that is rather boring. What did we learn from The Juice? 1. Steroids are bad. This is a revelation? 2. Players such as Giambi and Bonds used steroids. In case you are the one person who has not seen the 176 specials about steroids on ESPN, this could help.   Other than this, the book really revealed nothing new. And the big story is from a source that is anonymous? What are we talking about, baseball's version of deep throat? You have to do better than this.   It was long, drawn and no real "meat" to it. More hype than anything. And I got sucked in with the advertising. Canseco's book was interesting. Great stories and easy to read. At least he gave me something.   I have to agree with some of the critics. Mr. Carroll did a  disservice to his readers by including the nutritional stuff with steroids. Most people I know use a lot of this and it is fine.  It would be like the president says all drugs are bad - cocaine, heroin and cough medicine. Silly example because we all know that cough medicine is not harmful assuming someone does nothing stupid like drink the whole bottle but it does illustrate the point. He was wrong and should have done his homework or avoided the subject altogether since he seems to known pretty much nothing about it.  Anyway, I like Mr. Carroll but this is subpar. Guess that's why it's not selling really well 
 This is the kind of music you hear in the background during a movie or TV show when teens are on a rampage or adults are on a killing spree.  A couple of decent, uh hum... "songs."   
 not one of neruda's favorite books to begin with, although there are some gems, these translations are not worthy of the original poems 
 I decided to rent this movie after having seen Farenheit 9-11 and compare the two. Comparing it to Farenheit 9-11 this movie is amazingly bad. Farenheit brought out things that were done by Congress that this movie just glossed over. Farenheit actually interviewed congress members who admitted that they had not read the act before voting on it. This filn stated that they had all carefully read it in a very quickly glossed over statement. They did not address the Bush-Bin Laden connection or the fact that the Bush administration very quickly got the Bin Laden family out of the country after 9-11.  This movie is just a rehash of the Bush campaign's attack on John Kerry and really not worth the time it takes to watch it. And it's only a little bit over an hour long!!! Doesn't present any documentation of the "facts" that it proposes. At least Michael Moore backs up his charges with either documentation or direct interviews with the subjects. Also, much of what is proposed in this film has now been proven false.  Don't waste your money or time with this film 
 You Remind Me of You by Eireann Corrigan takes a stark look at eating disorders, suicide and co-dependency.  Because we are first introduced to the characters when they are still in high school and follow them through college and beyond, I would recommend this book for high school seniors and older.  This book shows the harsh realities of life and love.  However, it tends to get mired in the harshness more than is necessary.  Although life often does not feature one happy ending after another, this book's adherence to melancholy and the unhealthy aspects of love and interpersonal relationships becomes trying as one reads.  
 Koch is the author of one of the most interesting books of modern criticism, STARGAZER, one of the first books to take Andy Warhol seriously, so in my book he may be forgiven many sins, but THE BREAKING POINT is pretty bad.  As history, who knows?  I can't believe all the things he dishes out about the power of the Politburo to enforce the Popular Front and its supposed hegemony of US culture.  And his condemnation of the filmmakers who made THE SPANISH EARTH is just unpleasant.  Ivens was no Soviet agent, he was a committed documentarian.  (That's not to say that THE SPANISH EARTH isn't a boring piece of schlock.)  What sets Koch apart from other writers, however, is his incessant banality as a writer, as a stylist.  He is incapable of writing a single sentence without committing some go for broke solecism.  He will set your teeth on edge from page one, right from the moment you discover that he plans to refer to his two protagonists as "Hem" and "Dos" all through the text, thus stripping them even of the dignity of their names.  (Martha Gellhorn becomes "the Girl.")  His rib poking gets painful around page 9 or 10.  Yes, Dos Passos is great, but not for the reasons Koch cites.  And despite what Koch asserts, without argument, TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT and THE FIFTH COLUMN are not bad books.  They are indeed among the most interesting US novels and plays of the last century.  Koch is like a novelist attempting to enliven history with a novelist's little tricks, gleaned from the WRITERS DIGEST.  Get right in there, focus on your characters, make them quirky, show what they're drinking and wearing.  Imagine their thoughts.  Tell us what they're thinking.  Make one an angel, the other a devil, that way the reader will be able to distinguish them.  Well, I loved STARGAZER but this one's for the birds 
 I would've loved to have this information more succinct & to the point, it would have made a good article...unfortunately the author obviously attempted to stretch it out & pad it, which, in my opinion makes for a frustrating read.  I give it 2 stars because it does contain some useful information, if you can tolerate & get past the author's overstated & condescending writing style 
 His 1st CD was so much better, this is all ballads and he seems angry, maybe about his divorce, I enjoy his upbeat CD a lot more. Sad and boring 
 The whole book just meandered from the get-go, never going anywhere.  One could surmise early who would be killed and who the killer would be, but the murder was certainly an afterthought.  I'm also tired of Qwill's relationship with the boring Polly.  And the great number of times he mentions his mustache.  A great disappointment!  -- Pa 
 Many, many recipes in this book call for eggs, nuts, peanuts and milk.  My son is allergic to all these but CAN actually eat wheat just fine.  I thought this book would have lots of ideas on things I could feed my son.  But really it is a gluten-free cookbook which calls for his allergens and then says, "for egg allergies omit eggs", "for nut allergy omit nuts."  I could have just bought a gluten-free cookbook and omited eggs and nuts.  There would be no difference except that I wouldn't feel frustrated every time I read "omit nuts" and "use soy milk instead of milk" or whatever.    I think the title of this book should have been 'More than 150 recipes for the Celiac and wheat-allergic child which are low in sugar.'    The author has *NO* idea what it is to have a child with nut, egg and dairy allergies.  Also, many of the suggestions she gives and resources she listed are *NOT* OK for children with nut, egg and dairy allergies either.  Frustrating book!    However, I do think that it is probably an *excellent* cookbook if your child has Celiac or a wheat/barley/rye allergy so she gets 2 starts intead of just 1 
 i purchased this book based on the good reviews it got and was completely disappointed! the heroine is annoying, her vampire is dull - i stopped reading half way because it kept putting me to sleep, literally!  if katie macalister was going for fun romp, she needs to take some lessons from mary janice davidson - 'undead and unwed' or 'undead and unemployed'. even linsay sands does a better job in 'single white vampire', 'love bites' and 'tall dark & hungry'.  or, for a more dark read, try emma holly in 'catching midnight' and 'hunting midnight. i enjoyed these most of all. hope this helps 
 Having worked in Military Intelligence for over 30 years, I can say first hand the author of this book is severely restrained from reporting the truth. I have been all over the Middle East and have come to love the people of all cultures, Arab, Jew, Christian, Shi'ite, Sunni... the list is long. The sad part is that hatred brews daily in this beautiful part of the world, the cradle of civilization. Even sadder is that the hatred clouds the judgment of so many peoples, it is unlikely they will ever make the concessions needed to live peacefully together in land that God made.  Moreover, this hatred spills over into the media, especially outside the Middle East, where many people show great ignorance towards all sides of the conflict. The US culture, especially, views Arabs (generally) as terrorists without an ounce of humanity.  This is where I take exception to books such as this. Granted, actually publishing the truth about IDF operations is at conflict with the security of the Israeli homeland. Given the same situation, I would not publicize our military strengths, weaknesses and tactics to our adversaries, if it meant jeopardizing my homeland.  So while books like these may be interesting, they do not reflect a full measure of truth, and put the Arab military in an incompetent light (yes they are not tactically and strategically as savvy as the IDF, but they have grown stronger and learned from past conflicts). Unfortunately, books from this author, as well as his articles in well know magazines drip excessively from the party line of his motherland's politics. His views have rarely show even a modicum of respect for the adversaries with which the IDF battles. Thus, the circle of hatred continues and the flames are fanned even more.  While I respect everyone's right to their opinion, the constant degradation of many people and cultures by this author through his one-sided, often blatant irreverence of the truth, heavily detracts from the book's attempt to account history.  I too have written Osprey, urging them allow a more balanced view of a very ugly side of humanity- wars and their outcome. They should be studied and lessons applied, to prevent further hatred and bloodshed, instead of being "celebrated" like the victors in a World Cup Championship, all the while, trash-mouthing the loosing side.  I dream of being able visit to the Wailing Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem, walk the beautiful beaches that once made Beirut the like Paris in the Middle East, and travel through out the region without feeling like a prisoner breathing the air of impending hostility.  In short, I don't think I will ever see peace in this very historic part of the world in my lifetime nor my children's, nor my grand-children's. It is a shame that so many likeable people (by themselves) can become so ugly towards each other when put in close proximity, or when the mere mention of the others' names occurs.  This book, and others by the same author, serve only to add to the air of hostility, while glorifying the accomplishments of the combatants whom the author is pressed, and spun with motives that cling frightfully to hide the truth, however elusive that may be.   Yes, war is horrible, but when presented in the patented style of this book and many of the author's other journals of history, I ask the question: With what purpose, Mr. Aloni, do you write? It does not seem to be the pursuit of history, rather, a pale, woven patchwork of events with more holes, burns, and unraveled thread than the average bias would create. Factual, interesting history, this book it is not.  That's my biased view. I could be wrong. Let's hear yours (not to start a Holy War, but for the sake of meaningful dialogue). 
 If you are reading this review, presumably you are wondering if you should buy this book.  My answer would be, I can't imagine why you would want to considering that the All Music guides are available online for free at allmusic.com.  You owe it to yourself to check out that incredible site.  And if you absolutely must have an actual book, which I can understand, why wouldn't you prefer one of the All Music volumes?  For starters, there's the All Music Guide, which is the rough equivalent to this Rolling Stone volume in scope (covering all non-classical popular music) . . . except that it reviews twice as many albums as the Rolling Stone Album Guide.  And if you want more in depth information, entire separate volumes are available covering the blues, classical, country, electronica, hip-hop, jazz, rock, and soul.  (Since I especially love the blues, I bought that volume to pack with me into used CD stores.)  The reviews are more thoughtful, insightful, and generally helpful than Rolling Stone's.  And the rating system has some extra features especially helpful to someone building a collection.  In addition, there are educational essays on the history of the genre.    With this kind of blockbuster competition, Rolling Stone's claim on the back cover that this book is "the only resource music lovers need to read" is just pathetically laughable.  In case you are wondering, I gave it two stars because it isn't totally awful.  I would keep it if someone gave me a copy.  As others said, some of the writing is clever, as in previous editions.  And they do like the blues.  But I'm just not willing to spend money on a reference book that wastes any space, even to be critical, on Britney Spears, but omits George Harrison.  Maybe that should be the acid test for you 
 Though I love his show, this book does not seem to have the outstanding qualities I expect from Jeff Smith.  You would be better advised to purchase his "Frugal Gourmet Cooks American".  THAT one is a treasure 
 Very little plot, which is boring. The reader should be paid by the page, if not by the word, to read this book! 
 Almost every character in this book is unlikeable, unbelievable, and leads a life of unremitting misery, to no end.  Morris gratuitously gives even her most minor characters sickening motives and gross stupidity.  Morris writes well, but her vision of reality is badly flawed.  The book is a mess, so depressing that, thank God, by the end it's almost laughable.  
 This book was very bizarre. It was recommended by a friend who said it was her favorite book of all time. I honestly couldn't wait until it was over and I almost stopped reading before page 50. A soulless, scentless perfumer in 18th century France becomes a serial killer in order to extract the unique scents of his victims and create the ultimate perfume. The point of the book (if there is one at all) is that human beings are nothing more than easily manipulated animals, victims of our own instincts and physical desires, and that our arrogance of anthropological superiority is an illusion.  
 Before purchasing this watch, you should go to a store and take a look. This watch is HUGE. The temperature feature works fine until you wear the watch, then because of your body temp. you have no idea what the temp. is. The barometer feature is displayed in millibars, not something I am acquainted with. I could not get the compass feature to work correctly.    It took approx. 3 weeks to be delivered ( free shipping ). I returned the "watch" and purchased a TIMEX, paid for shipping, and it was at my door in 4 days and works perfectly 
 My friend who lives in Rome suggested this book. I generally avoid Dan Brown, and sort of wish I had avoided this book.  His research was great, if you can believe all of his information, and the well described locations all over Rome were marvelous, but ........   Two, not one but TWO, men fall out of a helicopter very high above Rome and land unharmed?  Many other plot devises were quite difficult to digest.  Plus, Brown seems to have a personal vendetta for the Catholic Church.  God certainly knows a lot of evil has been done in the name of religion and the church probsably leads the pack, but Brown's problem seems rather personal.  Maybe he was abused by a priest 
 Here's a book which falls most ungracefully between two stools. On the one hand it purports to be a synopsis of of tome which, though important, few have mustered the fortitude to slog through, and on the other hand it's another display of P. J. O'Rourke's puerile and facile wit. Each page will display a few sentences from Adam Smith, the significance of which are sometimes difficult to fathom as it seems as though only the most simple and obvious platitudes have been chosen - e.g., "Vice is always capricious: virtue only is regular and orderly." - followed by a wisecrack from P. J., usually at the expense of a Democrat or reporter (the usual suspects).  For example, on page 38 he writes, "And Book 5 is Smith's attempt to apply his ideas to solving the problems of government. But since problems are the only excuse for government, solving them is out of the question." O.k., after stopping to reflect on that, I suppose that by "But since problems are the only excuse for government, solving them is out of the question," he cynically means that governments operate like a crooked mechanic who deliberately makes shoddy repairs so that you will be forced to return and give him more business, but such smug asides do nothing to elucidate Smith's ideas. It's like attending an economics lecture and having the misfortune to sit in front of the class clown who keeps blurting out the same jokes over and over.  The book becomes more readable beginning with Chapter 8, where there are fewer of P. J.'s zingers, and I learned that, according to Smith, a trade imbalance between nations - such as the enormous trade deficit between the USA and China at present - is of no consequence. That's nice to know, but the explanation offered seems incomplete and somehow unsatisfying - like being assured that the iceberg ahead poses no danger. I'd like to learn more, but O'Rourke rushes off to a similarly superficial discussion of the next topic.  To his credit, O'Rourke is fair and balanced in that his chosen quotations from Chairman Adam often fly in the face of Libertarian dogma - e.g., "Every tax, however, is to the person who pays it a badge, not of slavery, but of liberty. It denotes that he is subject to government, indeed, but that, as he has some property, he cannot himself be the property of a master," (sentiments which O'Rourke judges to be "slightly demented") or "The mean rapacity, the monopolizing spirit of merchants and manufacturers, who neither are, or ought to be, the rulers of mankind . . ." - and he often illustrates how Smith was plain wrong or even contradicts himself; so much so that it seems that Smith was merely one who happened to notice that the new free trade and widespread commerce was a vast improvement over the recent feudalism of his time. In all other respects, he comes off as just a sententious old windbag - though not nearly as tedious as O'Rourke 
 I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE 
 Triops are absolutly the most horrid thing I've ever seen. Kids may think they're fun and they ARE educational, but triops are for a science lab - I'm sticking with sea monkeys 
 I really liked Platypus' Ice Cycles (at least the first half). This one is, however, forgettable. It has a few good licks but nothing catchy tyhat I remember like "Better Left Unsaid" from Ice Cycles. I think I listened to this CD two times max 
 This book is a great overview to professional responsibility and very interesting but if you rely on it to take the MPRE you will fail.  only write this for people out there like me who are taking a second Bar and MPRE after moving to another state, years after completing law school,  and looking for MPRE study materials online.  There arent ANY MPRE TEST QUESTIONS IN HERE  - you have to do old tests, tons of them, to pass. 
 If you want to read the purple prose of a man who is deeply ashamed of being latino and gay--in fact, so ashamed of the latter that he paints a picture of gays and lesbians as a talentless lot of artificial people doomed by moral pestilence-- then this is the book for you. If you're white and heterosexual and you're looking for a brown-skinned person to make you feel like you're culturally superior, why this book will be downright therapeutic 
  After reading some of the review for this book on this site, I question if these reviewer were sober when they wrote there reviews. The book is boring,and after a few chapters you'd maybe start looking for a new book. And if that CD breaks, from what i've been told, you'll have a hard time getting another one from the book company. I'd suggest you check out your local book store and take a look inside the book before you buy it; it would save u alot headache 
 This is an excellent way to learn how to use Aromatherapy.  It gives synergistic blends that can be used for ailments as well as beauty and skin care 
 As someone who was on bed rest for the last trimester of my pregnancy I can relate to the character in that respect.  However, the story is so-so.  There are much better reads out there 
 What is the longevity of John Bradshaw's book, and how does his writing stand up in the perspective of time?  The book was published over ten years ago, and it seems to have dropped through the cracks of the large and populous human growth floorboards, of which it was a part.  The first thing I noticed about Bradshaw's writing is its sheer verbosity.  He writes in a roundabout way, rather than concisely and to the point.  Contrast him, for example, with a writer on Buddhism or Taoism (say, Alan Watts?).    Writing on Buddhism or Taoism may provide authors with a natural impetus to be concise, but the human growth movement is broad and billowy, and concise writing may not be important to the authors.    And Bradshaw seems to drag in every alley cat he ever heard meow in the human growth movement, to help him reflect on what he sees as the underlying principle of it all: Shame.  Bradshaw reports that he is a theologian, but also someone who recovered from alcoholism, and was deeply shamed as a child, which shame he finally learned to deal with and overcome.    There are many fine snippets from his book, which may be of use to folks, but overall, I think most people looking for direction are going to be repelled by his constant conceptualizations.  To paraphrase another well-known quotation, "People cannot live on concepts alone."  If he had given more personal studies or little case histories, it would have been much more helpful.  Instead, he includes page after page of some "guided" meditations or shame inquiries, which were totally useless to me.  If you are looking for guided meditations, this is the place for you.    So, in all, Bradshaw's book does not hold up to scrutiny after time, in my opinion.  It's one of the many from its era and niche that was forgotten and will be unlikely to remembered henceforth.  Anyway, it was a bestseller once, and that's what counts, I guess.  It did have its 15 minutes of fame, and a lot of books never even get that.  Diximus.     
 There are as many nights as days, and the one is just as long as the other in the year's course. Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word 'happy' would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. -Carl Jung    The story of Bone written by Fae Myenne Ng is a dramatic story that takes place in Chinatown of San Francisco. It is based on the lives of a Chinese American family that has lost the life of a family member. The family is frowned upon because Mah the mother of Ona, Leia, and Nina had 3 daughters. To have a female child is to have bad luck, because they are useless, they show no bravery, they serve no purpose but to have children and they disrespect the families' name. The book touches upon all different aspects of Leia's life in no chronological order, she relives each story through incisive memoirs. You learn that Mah had an affair, with a man and he left her when he knew she was having a daughter. Then she met Leon; Leon worked in the shipping industry and Mah at the baby store. Mah and Leon fell quickly for each other. But when Leon was out at sea she was secretly in love with Tommie Hom. He had hired Mah for her looks, even though she could not sew at all. Tommie taught Mah how to sew beautiful dresses almost as fast as the patterns were printed. She became the best sewing lady Tommie had ever had.  As a kid Ona loved to wait for Leon's ship to come in, she cried for days after he left for sea. She was the type of kid that became emotionally wrapped around anyone she met. Ona loved to be around people all the time, she spent her days at the butcher shop with the owner, and he taught her how to wrap the raw meat to be sold. She also liked to hang out in the laundry room with Leon. One day Tommie Hom decided to hire a women by the name of Rosa she was a lovely woman that Mah quickly become attached to when teaching her how to sew. They became such good friends that Rosa's husband Luc and Leon liked to be in each other's company. When one day they decided to close up the baby shop and open a Laundry Mat in their name. It was a good success but it did not last long. A few months after they opened and all the bills were just being paid off Leon and Mah went in to open up the shop and to their surprise they could not open the door, the lock had been changed. They called Luc but no one would answer. That's when they learned that they had been taken advantage of. Ona had fallen in love with Luc and Rosa's son Osvaldo. Leon was furious with her but the more he hated there relationship the more they fell for each other.  The story touches upon death, Ona whose troubled life ends tragically in early adulthood when she jumped to her death at the top of the Nam because she was prohibited from marrying the man she loved.  The book episodes all different aspects of Leia's life in no consecutive order, she relives each story through incisive memoirs. Through out much of the book you learn about Ona and how the family deals with the guilt. Everyone wonders why she jumped, they ask over and over how they could prevented this, but the family learns in time that your fate is determined by the choices you make. Leia makes her way from feeling guilty to parting the ways between sadness and being truly happy like a ship liner on the open sea. The sea is life and the liner is the awakening.  I believe to get the most out of this book you must look for a deeper meaning. The author is Chinese American and they are traditionally instilled with a form of emotional meanings. While reading this book I realized that I saw what the Leong family endured was incredibly sad and that is had a unfortunate effect on the family. I did not allow myself to become emotionally surrounded by what the Leong family was faced with. They encountered death, and pain, sadness and defeat but they still moved on to support each other and they moved on with life. They learned with every life there is death and with every affliction their will be gallantry.  Fae Myenne Ng describes each moment with descriptive language each sentence takes you to a sidewinding conclusion. In her memoirs you get a strong feeling of deep emotion, from guilt, to love, pain, and grief are completely described in a narrative perspective. The type of memoir used was very serious it gave the story line a very mysterious title. You can tell how Fae pictured Ona, she was like a blossom she was radiant and sweet, full of life and loved. When Ona was stopped from marrying the man she wanted dearly she could not subside from such a cold-hearted decision from the traditional Chinese family.  Birth and Death are the two noblest expressions of bravery. --Kahlil Gibra 
 Ok, I am a new sales rep, and I thought this book would make a difference for me.  Well the only difference that it made for me was in my wallet, which is unfortunately much lighter now.  The book had some good advice, but not worth all of the filler which the author overwhelms you with just so that they can sell a book.  Save yourself the time, see if it is out in cliff notes.  10 pages was all this book really neede to cover the points that this guy wanted to make.  Save yourself time and effort and look elsewhere 
 The sound comes from the violin was really terrible. I couldn't believe it! It hurt my ears badly that I did not finish listening to the entire CD.   I have listened to a couple of Ms. Carter's earlier CDs. They did not sound so badly. So I figure it might have to do with this particular piece of instrument. I don't know....Give it a try and find out for yourself 
 I've read just about everything Nora Roberts has written. I cannot believe Nora Roberts actually wrote this - it must have been a ghost writer.  The characters lack all the charm and depth one expects to find in a Roberts novel.  I won't be moving on to the next two novels - I simply don't care enough about any of the characters to see what happens to them 
 I gave it 1 star because there are no 0's. Absolutely horrible. No story line, extremely bad acting. Boring movie from start to finish. Do not buy this movie. The DVD cover is very inviting, but there is no way I would even watch it on cable TV if I knew 
 It's ALive 3: Island of the Alive is down right hilarious. Nothing is better than watching mutant babies grow up and eat people. I mean seriously. My personal favorite scene was the court room scene with the "baby" in the cage. Good laughs.  In this flick, Michael Moriarity portrays a father of a mutant "baby." The government decides to put the lil' suckers (theres five or so now) on an uncharted island. Five years later, they decide they need to get "fluid samples" off the creatures for scientific research. Michael Moriarity goes along for the ride. Well the "babies" have grown into five year old "adults." And one of them has had a baby of their own. Yes indeed, Moriarity is a Pappy. All is well until they all die. Except Moriarity. The monsters want to get back to civilization and Moriarity gets stuck with the job of taking them there. Somewhere along the journey, they chuck him out into the ocean, Cuba picks him up, he gets back to the states, bla bla bla. All in all, this is a funny movie that deserves a four star rating on a B-movie scale. Watching this movie alone is like getting beat to death by golf clubs, but watching it with a bunch of B-movie lovers is a riot.  If you liked "Island of the Alive" I recomend: the awesomely bad movie "Creature," it's sci-fi on drugs and totally funny. What I learned from Island of the Alive: Cuban officers are nice AND funny 
 I have never read anything that resembled utter junk than this. I must congratulate the author on his esoteric-convoluted writing style, because it has made understanding the concepts that much more difficult.   This book has absolutely no merit what so ever. In fact, this book is so bad, I will burn my book rather then selling it to fool some other prospecting buyer into thinking this is a good book.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!! 
 First show on Broadway I ever left at intermission. I bought the tickets because I didn't think I could go wrong seeing a show directed by Strohman, starring Craig Bierko who was fantastic in Music Man and was flat flat flat in this show, and music by Harry Connick Jr. whom I have loved forever. It taught me that everything has it's place and Harry's place is not a Broadway stage. I hope for his sake, he does not try again. If I could rate something at zero stars, this would get that rating 
 I was very excited to get these bowls in the mail because they are so cute, and the concept of having a suction bowl was (and is) appealing to me. My son loved the bowl right away, as he was able to reach into the bowl for some puffs to feed himself instead of having to push the puffs around the table until he could finally grab one in his fingers. I'd also like to add that he ate tofu cubes for the first time out of this bowl and loved them! However, I'm disappointed because the suction on the bowl does not work for more than a few seconds. I'm constantly pushing the bowl back down, which is disruptive to his meal. Despite some of happy memories I've had with this bowl, I would not recommend buying these bowls because as 'suction bowls' they do not serve their purpose 
 Living in southwest Florida in the area of much of the locale of this story I was constantly reminded of the tangle of the mangrove forests which are typical of the coastal waters of this part of the world and the Ten Thousand Islands in particular. Virtually impenetrable. So was the confusing mass of cracker family detail piled on the reader. One has to force one's way through it and the result is a pretty thin story at the end. However the author's tidbits of history about the area and the spoilation of the Everglades is of interest for those having some knowledge of and curiosity about the subjects. I also felt that this New York born writer carries a lot of his Yankee baggage with him which causes him to unload the usual northern liberal unsympathetic, vulgar, racist stereotyping of southern life of the past on the readers. Way overdone 
 Boy I had high hopes for this one. Coming off their best album, Shot, and produced by Gang of Four's Andy Gill, I was expecting a masterpiece. The opening track isn't half bad, but the rest is throw-away. Doesn't even  sound like Jesus Lizard. Go get Down or Shot instead 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 I would strongly discourge using this book to try and learn mass transfer. We used this book in Purdue's mass transfer course and the classmates I spoke with agreed -- this book was extremely confusing and took a "hand wave" approach when solving the difficult mathematics.  A much better book is Transport Phenomena by Bird, Stewart, and Lightfoot 
 This product is absolutely useless.  The "Paint" is so thin it does not work as advertised.  You cannot write with it on the body or the walls.  Complete waste of money 
 I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip.  Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.  It's so awful I'd rather listen to the new Nickelback CD than this! 
 I cant say that I wasn't disappointed with this book. I had high hopes for Mona, but this book was so dull I wanted to cry. I try my hardest to make it to the end, and unbelievably I did. The ending was laughable, and not in a good way. One of the WORST I have ever read 
 I am not impressed with Tiffen filters I got in this set.  The finish of the rings are poor.  Despite of previously poor reputaion, I recently purchased some 67mm Quantaray filter from the local Ritz Camera store which are of much better quality compared to this set of Tiffen filters.  I never got Tiffens before, had good experience with Hoyas.  I will probably stay with those from now on.  Now come to think of it, Ritz camera indicated the Quantaray they had were made by Hoya.   The glass on all the filters are quite a bit more reflective compared to the Hoyas and the Quantarays.  Not a good sign. The circular polarizer had some smudges and some lense swirl that after 10 sheets of lense tissue and quite a bit of cleaning solution failed to be fully cleared off.  Quite frustrating.  All of the filters came with lint and a few little smudges on them, not sure if the store handling or the manufacturer handling was to blame, but none of the other filters I got before had this kind of problem right out of the box. The set might be cheap, but it sure is for a good reason 
 I retuned my copy two days after it arrived. The similarity between this book and the other is uncanny. That the other book  was published years before this one leads me to believe that Mr. Alburger has plagarized extensively from the original. The other book contains pretty much the exact same information - word for word. Whole chapters are virtually identical. Admittedly, James Alburger adds a few ideas of his own but they are not worth the price. There are at least 5 better books on VO than this 
 *** stars - can't change the above!  Valio is a rearrangement of some of the songs of Amar sin Mentiras. And it definitely has the feeling of an afterthought.  While it is a pretty  decent salsa album (albeit brief), it is simply not in  the class of his other three salsa CD's, Todo a su Tiempo, Contra la Corriente, and especially, Libre. The arrangements are standard competent rather than thorougly innovative and unique  as were the older ones. 
 The book delivers the promise on the dust jacket, of showing the Jesus who is not political or "religious" in any conventional sense. It's nice to read Jesus words anyplace, in the Bible or elsewhere.  But, Wills betrays his Catholic upbringing on many pages. He finds no mention of priests, bishops, or popes in the New Testament, nor does he show any respect for any other form of organized Christian religion.   He doesn't give the Catholic Church the credibility to rub two nickels together, much less to canonize the works of the Bible itself. Wills shows so much contempt for organized Christianity, as being unfaithful to Jesus. He ends up sounding to me as if he's criticizing Jesus for failing to lay down a plan for spreading the gospel. If it was not via an organized church, then what does Wills think Jesus meant 
 I am taking a class at West Viginia State Univesity and it used to be known as West Virginia State College. The class is children's literature and Mr. Roger Samples teaches it and he keeps it interesting the way he teaches the class. The book Madeline I did not like because it reminded me of a military school the way they had to eat and walk in squads every where they went. It also reminded me of an old boarding school where you had those mean teachers hitting the kids with a ruler when they answered a question wrong. I did like the rhyming words and would read this to my class. It tells you that her friends want to be cut up just so they can have a scar just like her. It does not tell they pain she had after the surgery or the painful recovery of rehab. The book makes you believe that having surgery is fun 
 The book is brilliant, no question about it. His stories are great, his humor dry and culturally insightful. The problem is that, like all audio books, the voice of the narrator can make or break the experience. And in this case, unfortunately, the voice of the author fails the material.  Sorry, Bill, but your voice is just too droning and monotonous for an audio book. It's hard to get past the first few discs as his voice tends to lull you to sleep. I wouldn't recommend this audio book for listening while driving or in traffic (as I did, and almost got into an accident).  If you want this book, get the paperback 
 This should get a zero rating. Every other page is blank. There is no information anywhere. There are some vague definitions of things like "mortgage." Don't waste your money 
 This book is nothing more than a re-hash of things from other books.  A large portion of this book is nothing more than quotes from the book "The forgotten Soldier" by Guy Sajer.  Interspersed is the authors "opinion" of what the various quotes mean.  Not very historical if you ask me.  All in all, it is just barely interesting, and also one of the least informative that I've ever read 
 I haven't seen a Superman movie since the first Christopher Reeve flic back in the 80s, so I'm probably behind the times on these.  Just picked this one up on a whim and, though it had its entertaining moments, it was overall rather mundane.  The special effects were very cool, but they were forced to carry the weight of a lightweight script.  How many times can we see Superman, Lois and family, and "the average Joes" be in seemingly fatal circumstances only to be rescued at the last second by either the Man of Steel himself, or (in the case of Superman) by Lois?  After a while the pattern gets tedious.  Also, fear I have some quibbles about the acting.  The good guys were merely okay (all of them could have done a lot more to make their characters more fun and memorable), but the bad guys were downright BORING.  Parker Posey seemed like she was asleep while she delivered her lines as Lex Luthor's girlfriend; Kevin Spacey seemed to be trying a little harder to bring Luthor to life, but, alas, he pretty much failed.  Whole cast and crew seemed like they were under the influence of ultrapowerful Kryptonite that kept them weak and sleepy. Too bad 
 I really like dark-comedy. I actually prefer it to regular comedy. However, one of the most important things that I look for is laughter. A film can be very dark, and make you laugh too. And while this film could have been good, the gratuitous violence takes precedence over a good plot,  and the film itself is lost in the "Let's see if we can shock everybody!" attitude of director Peter Berg. What a shame too; afterall, the film had a very talented cast. I have seen many dark-comedies, many that are violent. Yet they all had a common denominator: Violence for a reason, not violence for the sake of violence.  This film felt more like watching a train wreck. The longer you watched it, the bigger the wreck got. One [many] of the reviewers wrote that people just don't understand what dark-comedy is. I do! And this isn't dark-comedy. However, I understand that comedy is a personal thing. What may appeal to me, may not appeal to others. Some will enjoy this film, and that's fine. I know that I have my share of comedies that many would consider pretty bad. And that is why I don't mark people with negative hit's. I always felt that a review should enlighten a person. And if it does, the better for it.  Therefore, although I disagree with many of the reviews here on the merits of the film, some have put forth some valid reasons why they enjoyed the film. But the film was not that good to me. I have the film in my collection. It was given to me by a relative for a present a few years back. I would not say go out and buy this film, instead, I recommend the film with extreme caution. You must judge it for yourself. One warning however, it is not for children. [Most dark-comedies are not anyway]. So, while I don't think this is a good film, and definetly not a good dark-comedy, you must judge the film yourself. Rent it first. You may or  may not like it. It just didn't appeal to me 
 Game case was broken when purchased, this is very cheaply made, you could get splinters from the wooden racks.  Tiles are good but would not recommend this one,  Pay more for a better deluxe version as this one is NOT. 
 The Sweet Escape by Gwen Stefani is unoriginal, shallow, and the most pathetic album of 2006. First of all, she can't sing, she can't write and she needs to go back to where she came from, No Doubt. When she was with that band, the songs were halfway decent and the guys in the band rocked, not her. The only reason she got famous because she liked to show her nasty looking stomach off and she was dating a popular musician at the time who would later become her husband. Well honey, you are a nobody and hopefully people will come to their senses and realize the same thing as well. Don't waste your money on this garbage, if you want a real singer then check-out some real Garbage, Shirley Manson instead 
 The title of the book is quite misleading.  About 85 % of the book is on the period after 1740.  About half of the book is about Franz-Josef's reign.  The author's mainly cared about 'liberal' reform and concentrates  on this throughout the entire book.  I think that this is why he didn't  give much space to the early Habsburgs, because they weren't envolved in  liberal reform.     The other main problem with the book is that it  isn't  clearly written.  Someone who doesn't know the history of the times will  have difficulties following the book.      The format of the book is that  it discusses the political, social, and cultural histories of each period.  This book, which has a similar format to J. J. Freehan's German History  1770-1866, is certainly not on the same caliber 
 reviewer PTR said it right, but i'll say it myself: this great, ingenious novel, when we cut to the chase, really s*cks, is really beyond brutal. the writing isn't bad, it's frightening, reaching new heights of convolution and impermeability. i've read Faulkner and liked some of his books. "Light in August" was powerful and hypnotic, and I did the obligatory The Sound..., As I Lay, and another of his earlier novels, the title of which, for the moment, I'm forgetting (but I swear I read it).  Absalom Absalom, assuming you're not a Faulkner cultist, will drive you to near suicide, so keep away any nearby guns. In other words, you may be tempted to take yourself out of your misery, forgetting you've got the freedom to put the book down (i finished it, aware that it was taking months, if not years, off my life). Go ahead, Faulkner fans, rip me a new one.  I can take it 
 This is a wonderful book to read if you want to imagine yourself living somewhere exotic in an uncluttered space with minimal (or no) possessions.    It's all about design and I'm sure design mavens and architect-groupies will love it.    I picked it up looking for "good ideas" (as advertised in the title) I could use in, or adapt for, my small condo.  In my real life as a middle-class working person living in the US.  I found none.    Pretty pictures, though, of some inventive solutions to putting bed, bath, kitchen, and sitting facilities into small areas.  
 In this book 7 claudia and Janie fight a lot. In book 26 claud has to say good bye. I hate or not like too well because I don't like Janie. If you want fighting with words youd like this book. NOT ALL BSC BOOKS RULE 
 This is biogrpahy at its worst. Uncritical, subjective and poorly written, the book has conveniently glossed over Churchill's many blunders in politics, his unstable personality, his sexual perversion and his character faults.  The voters told Chutchill, depsite what his admiring biographers wrote, what they thought of him by giving him the boot 
 There are many problems with this movie keeping me from liking it. One, the opening with young Clark just drags on for far too long. I could deal with that, though. The thing that kills the movie for me (spoiler alert, assuming you've been on a deserted island for the last 25 years) is the end. Not only do I think every show/movie that uses time travel to undo some tragedy is a cop out, it was also performed in the most unbelievable way possible. The world is not a big tape!! You can't rewind it! Even as a kid when I first saw this, I realized that spinning the earth backwards would not reverse time. (It would cause some good ol' fashioned world wide devastation that would have made Luthor's scheme look like nothing in comparison.) Also, if he can fly that fast, why couldn't he catch the missles in the first place 
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 i like how the people on here who turn to sarcasm when rating this cd think they're funny.  heh, so witty.  anywho i'm not a big fan of fall out boy, but there are a couple of good songs on this cd........notably grand theft autumn and saturday.  those are really the only two that hold up its rating for me tho...2 stars 
 The Hole revolves around four prep school students who spend a weekend in an abandoned bomb shelter. One of the students is traumatized and makes it out alive. The others are dead.  Well, this has got to be one of the worst movies ever made.  Flaws:  * The acting. Thora Birch's pseudo English accent is extremely annoying. Most of the time, it doesn't sound real. Keira Knightly's character is way over the top. And with all of the characters, moments that are meant to be emotional are simply over the top.  * The plot is extremely convoluted. SPOILERS COMING!!  Do you really think Thora Birch would lock herself in a bomb shelter and risk her life and the lives of others for love?!!!!  The ending: STUPID. Thora Birch gets away with it, after telling a detective her story. When the detective tells Thora to make an official statement, she refuses. When confronted by other detectives, Thora lies. Okay...the extreme flaw with this scenario: the detective who has been informed of the real truth -- all she has to do is tell her superiors. At the very least, they would investigate her claim. In the movie however, all is tidily wrapped in Thora's lies. Who do you think detectives would believe? A member of their own force or a murder suspect?  There are far too many flaws with this movie to go on and on. Definitely not worth even a rental 
 this movie was ok but kind of depressing the whole show builds up to this one thing that never happens and there is not munch of a happy ending, sean was great in it, a very diffrent chracter 
 While writing for my thesis on "VoIP for SME's", I read a couple of VoIP books. The book from Mr. Harte is very brief (and the layout/cover is not very attractive, it seems very outdated). Considering the price of the book, it has a very bad price/info ratio. If you want to read a primer, I would recommend VoIP for dummies. For more advanced reading, try Voice over packet networks from Wright (you need to know the fundamentals, before you read this one!). 
 An earlier reviewer remarked "Fortunately Joscelyn Godwin didn't try to reproduce Francesco Colonna's difficult and idiosyncratic Italian in English, otherwise the book would have been as difficult to read as 'Ulysses' and needed another volume just for footnotes." The correct word is unfortunately. The present translation is a lifeless, dumbed down document. I wasted my money 
 I thought it would cover two burners.  It covers the big burner and then the edges don't sit on any heat.  If I would have looked into it better I would have known this, and I would have just bought the square one.  I was looking for a two burner one for when I was cooking for more than tw

      Three kids whose parents have abandoned them are put at a place called Whitegates.  They escape and go down river to the worst place you could ever imagine.  This is where they meet the grateful Heaven Eye's.  They also met heaven Eye's grandpa who is a little weird and scary. The scariest things happen in the Black Middens.  They have to try and find out the mystery of the Black Middens, Heaven Eye's, and grandpa      The dislikes I had about the book was every time someone had said something David would write he said, she said.  He would never replace said with yelled or screamed or anything.  I didn't really like the end of the book that much.  I thought the book was a little pointless.  The ending didn't really have a reason behind it.      I would recommend this book to people who are into books about people getting stuck somewhere.  Also I would recommend this book to people who look at the positives in life.  
 Disney keeps goming out with sequels to the best DVD's ever made.The  Jungle Book Limited Issue Is the best movie ever made.My Grandson watches it all the time. Its made for  the child also the adult like me. I bought  Jungle Book 2 totally dissapointed in the dvd.  I did not like it at all I returned it.Its a horible movie for children:  Disney stop ruining our excellent dvds.I give this dvd A - 
 Without a doubt, Understanding The Bible, 6th Edition, is a "hatchet job" on the Bible and, as a result, will test the faith of Jews and Christians alike.  But fear not!  Those who are even moderately confident in their religion will see through the author's relentlessly atheistic opinions and view it as an untapped gold mine for the Christian apologetics crowd.  When Mr. Harris (in his chapter bibliographies) recommends, among others, the works of those false witnesses over at the "Jesus Seminar", R.Funk, et al, and their New Thought babblings, then I came to understand the real truth about this book and the author's deceptive intentions.  I have only one thought for those unbelievers who think the Bible and Christ's teachings are wrong and pure folly.  If it is so; if Christianity is wrong, then there can be only ONE FOLLY that replaces it:  the folly of trying to pretend that there is some meaningful reason for life on this earth.     I feel truly sorry for Mr. Harris and those frantic souls similarly aligned; they have nothing but death in a void as their final reward.  This is why they are so angry, pessimistic and cynical in their religious criticism.  As Thomas  Kempis said in My Imitation of Christ (early 1400's) , "All carnal joys enter pleasantly, but in the end bring remorse and death."  As a result, "There is no peace in the heart of a carnal man."  May God bless and keep you all.  Amen. 
 I think this book releases women into bondage. It doesn't set people free to pursue God. Nor does it set people free to bask in His love. We have created a sub-culture of prejudice, picky, insecure single Christians who are complacent in the name of waiting on the Lord. I feel like this book has been a breeding ground for Christian men to have their cake and eat it too.  While it teaches women to subserviently let guys walk all over them.   This book teaches little on self-respect, being secure in Christ,intimacy with the Father, or being a strong woman. Ladies, you are the pearl of great price. Any man who isn't willing to give EVERYTHING up to be with you, isn't worth it.I feel like this book is a misrepresentation of Christ's passion and purity towards us.  This book is far from passionate. The ultimate passion and love anyone can ever have for anyone,is when they lay down their lives for a friend--- Jim was selfish and reluctant. Not only did He kiss other girls, he wasn't attracted to her. I feel like he had little interest in Elisabeth.  Personally, I think he played games. Ruth's Boaz, on the other hand, sought out her protection, provision, and well-being. He inquired of her and took notice of her compassionate works. Passion is full of faith, adventure, and risk-- Jim lacked those characteristics towards Elisabeth.  Purity is not just abstaining from sexual immorality. Purity is abstaining from selfishness and seeking someone else's well-being above your own. Purity has the best intentions. It isn't picky, it isn't prejudice, it isn't insecure.  I think sometimes, we are guilty of treating marriage or relationships like a scooby snack. If you're a good girl and you follow steps A-Z without wavering, you will have some 100% perfect guy tossed your way. However, that is the furthest thing from the truth.  Husbands aren't due to merit, they come in the Lord's timing. They also come from a willingness to follow your heart.   Personally, even though I commend Elisabeth on her willingness to love in the midst of adveristy and to hope in all things.I don't want my love story to be anything like Jim and Elisabeth's love story nor do I see how she let Christ control her relationship. I feel like she was governed by a plethora of religious balogne. It lacked passion and it lacked the purest intentions. I would not recommend this book. 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 My opinion of this book hasn't changed however my e-mail  address has 
 This is a good looking book but disappointed us, somehow there wasn't a lot of useful information in it compared to other guide books! We sold it when we got back 
 Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD?  Seriously?  The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The Vanishing" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's.  This isn't a matter of comparison.  This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie.  Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie.   And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  We've been cheated.  Totally cheated.  All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood cornball syndrome.  Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK!  Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated.  This is [...]of a great movie.        
 I bought this title, as well as "Upside-down Brilliance.."  I could not find my child's traits in the "RBCIALBW" book because he does not meet the criteria for ADD.    However, when I opened the "Upside-down Brilliance" book, I discovered "him" (and me!) on nearly every page.  This book does include a section on ADD and the right-brained child, but the "RBCIALBW" does not separate the two.  Had I not bought both books, I might not ever have discovered that my child is a VSL (Visual Spatial Learner), which is helping us a lot!    These are two very different books 
 The Cheetah girls are so full of themselves. I recommend the Cheetahs girls to 5- year olds 
 Based on the other reviews I must have read a different book. But seriously Payback bills itself on the ideas behind creating practical and actionable innovation, how else could you meet the promise of 'reaping the rewards of innovation.'  Unfortunately the rewards they are talking about are all in terms of cash and profits making this book a 101 finance book built around the authors notion of the Cash Curve with the following basic tenants:  - don't spend to much to create an idea because that consumes upfront cash - don't take too long to commercialize and bring the idea to market - get your idea into volume production as soon as possible - support the idea with a measured post launch investment.  Sorry but that's it. The book is heavy on the finance 101 side and extremely light on the idea of practices and ideas. Sure they say that you can play different role: innovation integrator, orchestrator, or liscensor but you pretty much know what the authors are going to say just by the role names.  The book does have an number of case studies, many that are available in the public domain, however these cases are more narrative telling you what happened without being analytical and telling you why the did this or that and the result it took.  Overall this book is very light on the ideas and actions required to deliver the rewards of innovation because it treats innovation as a financing event that is intended to generate cash. While that view is true, there is allot of insight, actions and practices that must happen before we can start thinking about how to get cash out of an innovation. I only hoped that the authors had taken the time to tell us that.   
 Ayn Rand's question-and-answer sessions following her lectures, and following the lectures of Nathaniel Branden, were always a fascinating display of her brilliance. They showed an incredibly powerful mind at work on the spot, instantaneously able to unravel virtual pretzels of mistaken premises, errors of logic, and, not infrequently, one or more forms of dishonesty, and bring everything into the clearest, sharpest light. Watching her do this incredible work, I came to think of her as a kind of avenging angel, routinely righting the intellectual wrongs that were destroying our culture and that almost always went unanswered. She answered them-in spades! I thought of  her as taking the questions of intellectual shysters and hanging them with them.   Few things could be more valuable for advancing Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism, rescuing contemporary culture from the philosophical poison that is destroying it, and, at the same time, giving a sense to those who never met her of what Ayn Rand was like in person, than making her Q&A sessions available to the public, in the original, spoken form in which they took place and were recorded.  Unfortunately, this was not the approach taken by Prof. Mayhew and Leonard Peikoff, whom Prof. Mayhew credits with having encouraged him to undertake the project. Instead of remaining faithful to the oral nature of the material being presented, they decided to make a book out of it, which it never was and now cannot properly be.   Speaking is not writing. Converting lectures, and still more, spontaneous answers in question periods, into the form of an essay or book requires editing and a process of considerable intellectual refinement. As a result, in order to put her oral material into the form of a book, Prof. Mayhew was placed in the impossible position of trying to improve upon Ayn Rand. This is an assignment that no one in the world would be capable of carrying out but Ayn Rand herself.   It was totally unnecessary to attempt it. Making the attempt must rank as a classic example of context dropping. Of dropping the context that while carefully considered, edited writing is superior to spontaneous speech, it by no means follows that the most carefully considered, edited writing produced by Robert Mayhew is superior to the spontaneous speech of Ayn Rand. Nothing can be gained from attempting such a conversion when there is no one alive capable of reliably carrying out the conversion.   The result of Prof. Mayhew's misguided attempt is a product that, in his own words, "should not be considered part of Objectivism."   In his view, the reason is simply that "no one can guarantee that Ayn Rand would have approved of editing she herself did not see." But these words subsume something much more substantial. This is revealed when Prof. Mayhew says, "I should mention, however, that some (but not much) of my editing aimed to clarify wording that, if left unaltered, might be taken to imply a viewpoint that she explicitly rejected in her written works."  Here we have a confession that the content of some of Ayn Rand's answers has been materially altered, indeed, apparently transformed, at least in part, into  the very opposite of what she actually said. We have no way of knowing if what was involved was a mere act of misspeaking, or something of real significance, possibly representing a change in her position on a subject. We cannot know if Ayn Rand was addressing a complexity in her position that was too subtle for Prof. Mayhew to follow and that he mistakenly inferred a contradiction of her published position when in fact there was none. Whatever the explanation may be, the reader will never know. Nor will anyone know what significant new knowledge the world may have been deprived of because Prof. Mayhew assumed that he was entitled to correct Ayn Rand.  Even the most minimal respect for honesty would have required explicitly naming all such Q&As and providing the exact text of Ayn Rand's answers in all such cases. If transcripts were not to be provided for all the Q&As, they should most certainly and absolutely have been provided in cases of this kind. That way, the reader would know what Ayn Rand actually said, not what Prof. Mayhew had decided she should be allowed to say. In his capacity as editor, Prof. Mayhew could have argued for his particular interpretation in a footnote if he wished, but not present his interpretation as though it were the view of Ayn Rand.  But with the most cavalier disrespect for his readers' independence and powers of judgment, Prof. Mayhew not only does not provide the transcripts necessary to know what Ayn Rand actually said, but he does not even tell us which particular answers of Ayn Rand he has altered in this way nor how many answers he has altered in this way. The result is that a reader who has had no first-hand experience with Ayn Rand's answers can never be sure if what he is reading on any given page is the views actually expressed by Ayn Rand in a Q&A or some distortion of Ayn Rand's views invented by Prof. Mayhew. In effect, his policy of disrespect and secretiveness has substantially destroyed the value of the whole book.  Many years ago, there was a young actress to whom Ayn Rand gave the responsibility of directing a production of her play "The Night of January 16th." Toward the close of the play's run, an actor prevailed upon this young woman to allow him to alter one of Ayn Rand's lines in one of the play's last performances. When Ayn Rand learned of this, she was furious and completely ended her relationship with this young woman, who had been in her inner circle for several years. Ayn Rand attached the highest value to her every word and would never agree to her words being altered by anyone, let alone made to represent the opposite of what she said.  I cannot say if Ayn Rand were alive and knew what Prof. Mayhew had done with her words, and what Leonard Peikoff had allowed and encouraged him to do, that neither of these gentlemen would now still be alive. Ayn Rand would not literally have killed them, though she might have thought about it. What I can say is that neither of them would ever again be welcome to touch a single word or thought of hers. 
 Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general. Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags 
 This is a sickingly incipid "book," a complete waste of time. This so called writer should not be allowed in print 
 I did a little calculating and I figure that if they sell all 20,000 (LIMITED EDITION??) of these for $40,000 each, they make $800 million.  But, the free shipping is killing them. IF they only charged $10,000 shipping, they could make a billion dollars on this book 
 If you want to do the same exercise over and over.. but with better make up and cuter outfit go ahead.  If you want better exercises and articles look to Oxygen or Women's M& 
 I was expecting to read a book about the Amish. What I read instead was a very self centered book about a woman searching, rather blindly, I felt, for herself.   She had very little in the way of insight into Amish life, even after spending a period of time with them. And her inability to get outside of her own head/her own life was not terribly interesting to read.  For someone who always longed to be a 'star,' I am sure publishing a book was quite a thrill for her. Shame she used the Amish as a platform for her own ego 
 I have been a fan of Sue Henry since her first Jessie Arnold mystery.  I was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure, but was very disappointed in this outing.  The characters were one-dimensional.  After discovering who the "bad guys" were I needed to reread part of the book for clarification.  Sue Henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters.  "...they hadn't a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours."  Even the relationship between Alex and Jessie seemed stilted.  I realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher Jessie Arnold, but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little 
 I found this book to be too wordy.  Theorems are sometimes stated without proofs then followed by several corollaries with proof, followed finally by the proof of the original theorem.  Allusions are made to geometry  unfamiliar to some learning the basics of commutative ring theory.  A nice  book to come back to 
 This book will appeal greatly to psuedointellectuals, who will invariably write mealymouthed reviews on Amazon with the word "Timely" in the title. But for a book ostensibly about our relation to the suffering of others, this is an incredibly dispassionate and overanalytical book which, despite the title, is really just a book about photography. In fact, as far as I can tell, Sontag just retreads her ideas on photography that have been published elsewhere. I have great respect for her, but this isn't her best work, especially given the subject she claims to be addressing. Only a hardened intellectual could write a book consisting of a series of disconnected, clever observations on the nature of photography and call it "Regarding the Pain of Others." This is exactly why people accuse modern academia as being so devoid of relevence and meaning.  In the end, I found the individual arguments interesting, and she is clearly very smart, but the book ultimately adds up to very little more than a souless disappointment 
 I challenge you Mr. Will Wong to a duel. Ill slice you and dice you with my knife 
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 I was hoping to find an intelligent critique of evolution and fundamentalist Christianity in here, but was sadly disappointed.   It's not so bad that Deloria does not understand either the scientific method, nor the theory of evolution.  His complete misunderstanding of the aims and tactics of "intelligent design" proponents, and of the reasons various courts dismissed their claims to intellectual integrity is not the most serious flaw in the book.   He invokes strawmen to stand in for both creationists and evolutionary biologists to cover his lack of understanding of both Biblical literalism and scientific orthodoxy could just reflect his inadequcy as a scholar. The real problem is his smug dismissal of these two viewpoints as though he were an expert on them.  The book is a sustained argument from authority in which the author himself claims to be the authority to whom we should all defer.  I confess I quit after three chapters. Deloria has nothing to teach anybody who is really searching after truth. I suppose this book will engage people who like to criticize things that threaten their preconceptions. People who are interested in theology or science should look elsewhere.  He is supposed to be an expert on native American spirituality, but the slipshod attempt at scholarship I found in this volume incline me to be deeply suspicious of any assertions from the pen of Mr. Deloria 
 I used to love Iris Johansen's books esp. her Eve Duncan books. The last few though have been terrible. On the Run was the final straw, she's lost me as a reader. I read about 100pgs and gave up. The plot was so dumb I can't believe she got someone to publish it. 
 I saw this book on Oprah. If she recommends it, it must be good, right? Wrong. The book doesn't deliver what it promises. Common stains are not always included. I assume that Oprah recommended it because (of course) she doesn't do her own laundry and would have no way of judging the quality of this kind of book for those of us who do not have hired help 
 I have seen every Doctor Who episode ever made, and most of them enough times to have memorized the wittier dialog.  I own every Doctor Who DVD published so far, and will buy every DVD put out in future ... EXCEPT THIS ONE.    I would not watch a single minute of any episode of this horrendous abomination of a show to save my own life.  It would have been a great episode if it had had the merest semblance of a plot, remotely convincing costumes and effects, sets that didn't look completely artificial and sound hollow, and sound effects that didn't grate on the nerves like nails drawn across the chalkboard.  Don't get me wrong: I usually don't much mind the poor production values of the early years, and can overlook them in every other early Doctor Who every made (even The Gunfighters).  But, you have to draw the line somewhere, and I draw it when I see inept extras prancing around the Doctor in butterfly suits while earnestly intoning gibberish in the rapid melodramatic crescendos and diminuendos  of their butterfly language.  The horror, the horror 
 I'm an avid true crime reader & was looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, the author never connects you to the character. Their manner of writing seemed textbook like. With the exception of 2 victims, they totally left out what happened with the other victims. I couldn't finish the book, it just wasn't worth my time. IMHO, it's a waste of paper. I wouldn't waste your money on it. You'll only be disappointed. 
 This is quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read.  It  drags on like a rusty knife for far to many pages.  The book could have been good, could have saved itself if it had ended on page 152 instead of page 195.  The story after 152 is irrelevant, pointless, lacks continuity, and ultimately leaves the reader wondering why it was included.  Instead of the sad story of the young writer, you end up with that plus a monologue in which the author attempts to build sympathy for himself, justify his existence, and generally prove that at 50 he amounted to something 
 the dvd didn't work and returning it couldn't be more awkward so just cut my losses not happy in the slightes 
 This didn't fit in with the book we were using: "Modern Physics" by Tipler and Llewellyn.  This book completely neglected much of the quantum portion.  Be sure to buy that book also. Kind of elementary. 
 The title of the book is great, and it's full of beautiful B&W pictures.  But the content is a nicely bound collection of ramblings.  It reminded me of the time I was in school and wanted to compose essays without much thinking or researching the subject - nice marketing campaign to publish those...  One of the examples - the author was inside of the Mc-Donald's with a group of students who were shouting and laughing, and then he left the building and its atmosphere and went into the Church, where he felt the atmosphere could not of been more different, making him look harder at trivial things...  And...  Either more architectural facts or more philosophical thinking would make this book interesting... 
 Reading about statistics in this manner- the language, crammed text, etc. is a surefire narcotic, if that's what you want. It's heavy on quantitative research and methods- and tries a little too hard to pack it all in. You might use it as a reference but realize that you will probably get a headache from reading more that 5 pages in a sitting 
 I just watched (actually by fast forwarding) "The Legend 2" and another Jet Li starrer called "Red Dragon" (not to be confused with the Hannibal/Anthony Hopkins movie of the same name) and I implore you to not waste a second of your precious time or a dime of your money on this so called martial arts crap, chinese style. First and foremost dubbing of any of these movies takes out the authentic flavor out of the original making the comedy, villiany, romance and any other kind of human emotion sound, look and feel pathetically lame. That's the big and only difference between these 'B'grade action movies from Honkong and a slicker production like "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon" (slicker only, read my review of CTHD for details on that fiasco). This is no serious martial art and the comedy like those innumerable chinese martial art movies, SUCKS. I can only give some credit for the flexible acrobatics. If you wish to watch sensible Jet Li action check out his Holywood movies. 
 This book is the 3rd in a series of "Hinges of History" by the author Thonmas Cahill. For a book about Jesus, the writing style is somewhat cavalier; not unfunny, mind you, but in the context of the discussions, out of place. If the style is somewhat disconcerting, the contents are downright disturbing. This is not a scholarly book. Indeed, it is full of errors and oversights, and on occasion, bad taste. For example...  "Since scholars can no longer consult it [the Aramaic version of Matthew], they have given to this putative source the name "Q"... (p. 75)." Nonsense. The Q document is not the lost version of Matthew.  "Its origins [the Gospel of Matthew]     ...may well lie with such an eyewitness (p. 75)." That's right. Mark and Matthew both wrote their Gospels. And I have a bridge I'd like to sell you.  "Gehenna...pyres were kept burning for this purpose [burning children]. (p. 80)." In fact, Gehenna was a garbage dump and the burning fires were used to dispose of the waste, which included dead people.  "She [Mary] was..no more than fourteen or so... (p. 95)." The fact is no one has any idea how old she was, except that she was a "young woman" and that most Jewish woman in the 1st century BC married at the age of 12.  "...kataluma which means a room occupied by human being. (p. 99)." Yes, but it also can mean a "cave" and there is a wealth of theory and literature supporting the idea that Jesus was born in a cave.  Though this book is not without its merits, you have to wonder what its purpose is. While it is well written, there are much better written books, and while it purports to provide some facts, it hardly ranks even as a weak scholarly text. It provides nothing new, and its rewriting of the old is so full of mistakes that it doesn't warrant reading 
 Clinique's Exfoliating Scrub is a facial scrub for oily skin. It is a thick, white paste packed with medium-size scrubbing grains -more grains than in Clinique's "7 Day Scrub" for normal skin. To use, massage onto clean, wet skin in a circular motion. Rinse with warm water. Careful not to get it in your eyes, as I did once while rinsing it off in the shower. This scrub does an adequate job of exfoliating and retexturizing skin. But it's unsuitable for sensitive skin, and it stinks to high heaven. It contains menthol, which burns skin and clears the sinuses at no extra charge. Having so much menthol so close to my nose is not a good thing. Of course, it is "100% Fragrance Free" according to Clinique, meaning that the smell of menthol is unadulterated by perfumes. The scrub also contains salicylic acid, so beware that this might be too drying for some skin types, especially if used frequently. The performance isn't bad. The olfactory aesthetics are atrocious. This is the harshest, most caustic facial scrub I've ever used. Sensitive complexions beware 
 To quote a friend of mine "This book has the wrong name. Instead of being called "Home Networking Annoyances," the name of the book should be "Why Windows Is Hard To Network." Yes, this book does talk all about home networking, but it only mentions Windows operating systems." Any one using any other operating system should not waste their time or money. It is unfortunate that the author is so narrow in her view as the topic is of considerable interest to many users of computers other than those operating under Windows. 
 If this is your first Barbara Taylor Bradford book, you may never pick up another one.  I, on the other hand, like to give an author the three strikes rule, so won't hesitate to try something else, but it won't be very soon.  If you want to read one of her novels, do NOT start with this one like I did.  This is very boring--like snails serving as soap stars--not to mention slow and predictable.  I listened to the entire thing on cd, but think it was mostly because I liked Ms. O'Karma's narration--she has an appealingly smokey voice like Carolyn Jones from the Adams Family.  It still couldn't save this story with its endless self-serving "what-about-ME!" mantras and Valentine's overly moralistic attitude.  I'm the same way, and I bore myself!  You knew from page one where this story was going, and the dialog was as insufferable as the descriptions of everything from food and clothing to moths reproducing on peeling wallpaper.  "I was a war photographer and my mommy was mean to me" resounds every other page, yet she wants to get away from all of that.  Nothing's worse than a character or real person who brags, then turns around and screams "Look at me, look at me...How DARE you look at me?!"  
 I was expecting a lot more from this film, having read good reviews. While the plot was good, the acting was horrible. It seemed like a high school student made it. Not entertaining at all 
 This book seemed like trash to me.  Connor O'Brien was so incompetent reading the audio version, however, that it may have contained some sparks of life, before he snuffed them out.  If you read it yourself, you may find something to like.  Be warned, however, that this story is about child abuse.  A five year old girl is found murdered.  The autopsy reveals several previously broken bones.  When detective J.P. Beaumont begins the investigation at the home of the girl's separated mother, he finds she is a member of a religious cult forbidden to speak with non-members by its charismatic leader, and other children of cult members show signs of beatings.  There are several things not to like, besides brutality to children.  The cult leader, who appeals to the police as chief suspect initially, is not normal enough to be a satisfactory villain.  He belongs in a horror story, not a mystery.  I was totally unimpressed by Beaumont, much too insecure and inarticulate for a 15-year homicide veteran.  Stylistically, what stood out was the cliches.  It's like Jance was totally distracted while writing the book, maybe babysitting six kids at the same time.  Returning to the audio, O'Brien read excruciatingly slowly, without the slightest inflection to his voice.  If the book contained any wit or humor, any suspense or human emotion, O'Brien made it disappear completely 
 This book is a thinly veiled sample of religious antisemitism in which the author demonstrates profound disdain for Judaism and either a willfull or foolish ignorance about it. His quotations from Hebrew scriptures are decontextualized and he demonstrates obvious ignorance of the original language.  While I and others offer this book for sale, I do so as a specimen of modern fundamentalist Christian Jew-hatred, masquerading as an attempt to help others reach salvation 
 Unlike years ago, Logic comes with good manuals and there is a variety of books and even a DVD available for learning Logic. Among all of the books, I feel this is the worst, and not worth even owning. In fact, I sold my copy of it.   The book is not terrible but it has nothing going for it. Its a rehash of the manual that comes with the program for free. Its not particularly well written, not fresh, not insightful, and not interesting. It seems to be written by a guy with no particular writing talent, nor talent in using Logic who just wants to make a buck by explaining the manual again in a dry uncreative way.  Merton's book has no special insights like Len Sasso's excellent book Emagic Tips and Tricks which is well written, to the point, and useful, or Stephen Bennet's User's Guide to Logic Audio. Both of those books come from experienced Logic pros and cut through the verbiage to give you immediately useful methods. These guys can write well, and they really know how to use Logic!  Merton's book also doesn't have the excellent tutorials of the Apple Pro Training Manual - Logic by Sitter and Brock.  Thats a great book for learning to be an expert in well organized lessons. But Merton has none of that. Another alternative would be George Leger's Logic Pro training DVD.   I just don't see any reason why this book was published. It seems that the publisher is producing "Power" books for Protools and other music software, and they just needed someone to fill the Logic spot. But I don't think this book is worth reading much less buying. I think your needs will be much more satisfied by one of the books written by true expert Logic pros, good writers, and those who did it for own love of the product rather than a quick buck 
 I read the first two books, and they were very weird, but I still liked them all right and would have given them 3-4 stars.  This one was just TOO weird.  I completely didn't understand parts of it and abandoned it about halfway through.  Very challenging and not highly recommended 
 What a terrible book. It's slow and mostly pointless at times. Think of all the excitement you have working in a cubical with situations much less funny than those you'd see in Office Space. That is the premise of this book. I went into this book thinking:  1. This a great author! 2. All the characters are about my age! 3. I'd love to see what working in Microsoft was like when things were just starting to get huge! 4. My friends and I are all computer nerds. This is EXACTLY what it are going to be like when I graduate college this year!  I was wrong on all counts. There is nothing I, as a 21 year old tech-savvy, internatioanl business major, could relate to. It lacks an interesting plot. It lacks characters  the reader can enjoy. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of a few mildly interesting situations scattered few and far between in the book. Go. Read ANYTHING else 
 This review was originally posted as a discussion topic in the section below. I have decided to add it to the reviews section. As you read below you will see that I actually think that this book, so far as the various contributors are concerned (excepting the short introductory essay by Carson and his lengthy conclusion-analysis essay at the end, and possibly Seifrid's learned but wrongheaded, in my opinion, essay), is an excellent book. The various contributors provide excellent discussions of the areas of Jewish literature that they cover, especially from the angle/questions of the law, how the literature reflects Jewish understanding of it, the identity of Israel and the relation of that to the law, identity of Israel and eschatological hope, the literature's covenantal-conception of Israel's relationship with its God, how the Judaism reflected by each piece of literature understood `grace,' etc. So, as a book discussing Judaism in the ancient world, especially early Judaism when Jesus was around (several of the essays do not touch on Judaisms contemporary with Jesus and/or prior to 70 CE and 135 CE, which makes a massive difference), this book is excellent. The one star rating reflects how I rate the book with respect to how people in general seem to perceive the book and its goal: to refute Sanders' `Covenantal-Nomism.' The one-star rating reflects what I think of Carson's summary-analysis essay at the end that claims/presents the book as a triumph over Sanders in a way that people who do not like the (?) New Perspective on Paul (as I state below, that term means something different to different people; it seems that for most people who do not like the NPP, especially the ones who have not read anything by supposed-NPP scholars, it seems to mean some understanding of Paul that does not present Paul as espousing a Lutheran-Reformed theology; this is relevant as I have lost count of how many times I have seen scholars, who are not technically NPP scholars labeled as NPP who simply try to set Paul in a first century context with his letters addressing first century issues). Please read below to see some short comments on why I think that this book utterly fails to refute Sanders' `Covenantal-Nomism' as a helpful way to designate the pattern of religion exemplified by/in the various Early Judaisms.   First off, if you respond (or post a review in response) to this please indicate how much of this book you have actually read. Now, when I read this book last year I was struck by several things. After having read Sanders, it seemed that this book was the book out there that, basically, vindicated him! Each contributor that touched upon Judaism during Jesus' time essentially said that Sanders' 'covenantal-nomism' worked as an excellent way of describing whatever segment of Early Judaism (during Jesus' time) that they were treating. The basic criticism of Sanders' concept of covenantal-nomism as applied to Judaism contemporary with Jesus was that Sanders was using protestant-roman catholic categories for discussing Judaism; categories that may not be the most helpful.  There were other minor criticisms, but please understand that none of the contributors who touched upon Judaism when Jesus was around claimed that the Old-paradigm for understanding Judaism (semi-Pelagian works-righteousness...merit-seeking-l... etc) should stand.  From here I should move onto the most interesting part of my experience of reading the book last year: reading Carson's summary essay. It seemed that the summary / analysis essay misrepresented the conclusions (import/significance of the contributor's essays for assessing Sanders' covenantal-nomism) to an amazing degree; to the extent of, basically, claiming the opposite of what the contributors wrote. I do not know how to explain this. I was astonished. Numerous scholars/reviews concur with this assessment: John M.G. Barclay, Craig Bomberg (sort of), John Byron, James D.G. Dunn, Pamela Eisenbaum, Donald Garlington, J.R.D. Kirk, David Kuck, Ian W. Scott, etc. Other reviewers note that the contributors assess Sanders fairly positively, but with nuanced criticisms; not criticisms to the extent that Sanders is so wrong that, as Carson's summary essay would leave one to believe, a `traditional approach' to Early Judaism is still an acceptable understanding.   As a side-note, it is interesting that the contributor who treated 4th Ezra (I believe that it was Richard Baukham) claimed that it too fit the broad outlines of a covenantal-nomistic pattern of religion. For those of you who have read Sanders' `Paul and Palestinian Judaism,' you will know that that is his main example of an Early Jewish writing that did not exemplify a covenantal-nomistic pattern of religion but, rather, works-righteousness religion. So, at least according to one contributor, Sanders did not really go far enough with his covenantal-nomistic concept. This is one humorous example of how the contributors do not support Carson's analysis/conclusions in the essay at the end of the book in which he tries to smuggle an old-perspective understanding of Early Judaism in the back door.  So, in semi-response to `A Reader' who posted a non-review on May 31, 2004, this book does not challenge `the (?) New Perspective' (it seems to mean different things to different people; for most opponents, especially ones who really have not read anything by any supposed NPP scholars, it seems simply to mean some reading of Paul that is not a traditional Lutheran-Reformed reading). Rather, it stands as an obstacle that challenges to `the NPP' (or at least post-Sanders understandings of Early Judaism) must overcome. Lastly, this volume is one of the main reasons why volume 2 (The Paradoxes of Paul) is, in my view, not very helpful. Since the contributors to that volume basically presuppose Carson's account of `the findings' of volume 1, they set out in a wrong/uninformed direction. They also do not touch on the places where the serious debate needs to happen, what is/was Paul's context(s)?  Lastly, (this section was not in the discussion post), Carson seems to argue against positions that his supposed opponents do not hold. From reading Carson one would get the impression that Sanders and those who follow him think Early Judaism to be one large homogenous unit, with no diversity. They would think that Sanders claims to have presented a systematic-theology of Early Judaism (again, Carson may acknowledge in some places that Sanders is not trying to present this, I do not remember. Nevertheless, from reading his negative sections; sections where he presents his findings in polemical-genre as though they are set against Sanders, it seems that he is thus presenting Sanders and his followers as thinking they have done what I described prior to this lengthy parenthetical). This, just like Carson claiming that Sanders has a Paul whose pattern of religion is also Covenantal Nomism (in lectures Carson gave concerning the NPP at RTS-Charlotte...instead, see Sanders' section dealing with this question on pages 511-515 of `Paul and Palestinian Judaism'), is blatant misrepresentation of Sanders in the form of arguing against an opponent who does not exist/implicitly (sometimes explicitly) attributing to Sanders and his followers positions that they do not hold. This is all absurd. Sanders explicitly acknowledges the diversity of Early Judaism. In fact, the whole point of his calling covenantal-nomism a `pattern of religion' is that he cannot present a systematic theology of Early Judaism because it is so diverse. In fact, Sanders does not even claim to survey all relevant Jewish data; note that his title has reference to Palestinian Judaism (lest someone, such as Carson, want to jump in and claim that thus Sanders sets up a false barrier between Palestinian Judaism and Hellenistic Judaism, etc, Sanders also notes that one cannot do this, but nevertheless he will restrict himself to Palestinian Judaism-literature for `practical' pg2 reasons). One can find all of this in Sanders' short (32 page) introduction section to `Paul and Palestinian Judaism.' Lest one want to criticize Sanders for addressing those issues in the introduction and ignoring them throughout the rest of the book, he or she should read the rest of the book and see how conscious Sanders remains of all the introductory issues throughout the book. In fact, I recommend reading the introductory section that one can see what Sanders' goals were, who he is arguing against, etc...basically to help set Sanders' book in context and thus understand it better.   I hope that this pseudo-review has been helpful. I know that it is not really a review as it does not do the things that a typical review does. Nevertheless, I think it should be helpful as it addresses the concerns and questions that most of the people who are interested in `Justification and Variegated Nomism, volume 1' have. It does not refute Sanders. It does not challenge the (?) NPP's at all as it does not challenge the (?) new (for Protestants) view of Judaism that Sanders set Protestant scholarship on the trajectory to realizing. For people who think that Carson is just `the best evangelical scholar' and `an authority in this area,' please think again. Though he may be a great scholar, my interaction with his work, limited to this two-volume series and his lectures on the NPP at RTS-Charlotte to which I listened online, showed me `a Carson' who misrepresents his opponents (most basically by arguing against positions that they do not hold in a way that makes it seem as though they hold them), obscures data and issues, twists the work/words of other scholars around greatly, and at the end of all this really succeeds in not actually addressing the issues that need to be addressed. Or, to put it another way, Carson throws up such a smoke-screen of jargon, twisting, and misrepresentation, that, with respect to this book, the questions that Sanders raised about understanding Early Judaism, other scholars' tweaking and development of Sanders (especially in terms of learning to analyze Judaism in less `protestant' categories and learning to ask better questions of the Jewish literature), etc are not touched in his summary-analysis essay. Instead, if one reads only his introductory essay and summary-analysis essay (as Carson recommends in his RTS-Charlotte NPP lectures) one comes away without any real substantive interaction with the issues and discussion of the contributors to the volume (perhaps Seifrid's essay excepted). More than that, one comes away with a total misunderstanding of Sanders, his followers in understanding Early Judaism from his `covenantal-nomism' trajectory-perspective, and the impression that, basically, all the contributors would be happy with an old-perspective understanding of Early Judaism.  So, please read this book. It is an excellent discussion of Judaism(s) in the ancient world with a specific set of questions in mind. The contributors themselves (besides Carson) do substantively interact with Sanders as well. But, if you are looking for a book to be able to simply hurl at supposed followers of `the NPP,' the reason for which many seem to look to is, do not bother. In fact, if you are using it that way, simply mentioning the name as though it stands as the great critique of Sanders, you really should stop doing that. Lastly, as I mentioned above, it is because of this book that I find volume 2 to be, largely, a failure. Some of the essays within it are very helpful, see Westerholm's essay summarizing `the NPP' over the last 25 years, Silva's essay (even though I tend to lean in the direction against which he is arguing) on the subjective vs. objective genetive reading of pistis christou in the context of faith vs. works of the law in Galatians that takes the `objective position' and supplements its previous arguments with the findings of an article published by another scholar, and Hengel's essay (which was previously published in the Tubigen symposium volume `Paul and the Mosaic Law'...Hengel is an excellent scholar). Even so, however, since the main exegetical contributions and related essays presuppose Carson's understanding of volume 1, this volume thus does not really touch some of the most important `Paul in context' issues that need to be touched in the discussion that volume 2 seeks to advance (critique it seeks to bring).   
 I've read Sarum, London, & The Forest and really enjoyed them.  This book is not nearly as good.  It's just plain boring.  I kept reading with the hope that the book would improve in the next chapter - needless to say my hopes were dashed! I will probably give his next book a chance, after all, every author should be allowed a "dud" now and then 
 John R. Barry (another Digital Communications textbook author) first introduced me to this text.  And Mr. Barry, as with many com. theory persons I've met since (GTRI in Atlanta, GA; MITRE along around the Boston area of MA; Northrup in El Segundo, CA; Intersil in Palm Bay/Melbourne, FL) actually use this book to justify their values and beliefs.  Essentially, it's their Bible.  The only problem is that the values and beliefs in Proakis, especially from an engineering perspective, are very third rate.  Trying to use this text in a classroom situation, especially with a third rate engineer as an instructor, is an utter disaster from both an economic and an engineering perspective.  John R. Barry, for example, is a very good baby-sitter and a so-so mathematician (he couldn't be otherwise as a faculty member of Georgia Tech).  But as an engineer, John R. Barry, as with the other followers of Proakis, compares very unfavorably (in fact, I don't consider Barry an engineer; I consider him a phony that should be removed from the ECE faculty of GATECH; the department's economic fortunes would be far better if he were moved into some kind of adjunct English/Mathematics Faculty or just shipped off to some research laboratory without any students to harm [i.e., vampirically mind f--k them and then kindly provide them with werewolfic deliverance (yes, I mean along the lines of the 1972 movie with Jon Voight [Angelina Jolie's Dad] and Burt Reynolds)]...any place where truth/reality aren't so important).  There are far, far better communications engineers out there than John R. Barry [infinitely better to be precise].  And what makes these others better [others meaning real engineers; John R. Barry being a make-believe "engineer"] is not mathematical ability, memorized knowledge, or even rhetorical shrewdness, but rather the difference lies in a faith of facts; something a follower of Proakis never seems to possess or even grasp the possibility.    In fact, the values and beliefs in the Proakis text seem to promulgate not only  Intellectual Abuse, but also a Spiritual sort as well. In a nation (where Steven Pinker, who like Proakis is of Harvard Fame, has noted) that has around 75% of its population esentially believing in the biblical/torah-related account of things, this kind of Spiritual abuse can be very dangerous indeed and lead to serious consequences.  Though it may not be intentional, nevertheless, the values and beliefs of Proakis's text and those of its instructors tend to be extremely spiritually abusive.  These values and these beliefs somehow set up a massive cognative dissonance with many student's own biblical/torah-related values and beliefs.  The result is almost always a broken-spirit.  From an economic perspective, this is bad. Very bad. And it should be stopped by no longer using this text or any like it.  Most of the "engineers" now being "developed" by the followers of Proakis (e.g., John R. Barry) are very analogous to Mid 20th Century Carribean medical school "doctors."  They can say, write, and use a lot of terminology making them useful for billing purposes, i.e. writing up invoices to Insurance/Government agencies.  These "engineers" like those "doctors" don't and probably never will understand the essence of their professions, though because of their training or lack thereof they really think they do.  When in fact, they are utterly clueless "professionals. 
 Easterbrooks book, while possessing an upbeat outlook on environmental matters, reveals all the hallmarks of a book written by someone with little insight and knowledge of environmental biology. As a scientist, I am  appalled by his fundamental lack of detailed references in support of his  perspectives, and inaccuracies which make this tome seem something akin to  a high school project. Of course, whether it is written this way  intentionally to appeal to the uninitiated or not is debatable. However,  there are dangers when someone as naive as Eastebrook dabbles into an area  of which he is neither qualified not informed. Altogether a rambling series  of prose with little substance 
 This is an un-successful follow-up to "Culture matters". Cases are generally boring, and attempt to answer the "how culture matters" failed. We will have to wait for a better try.. 
 This book was a selection in my book club. It definitely lacks the content and depth of most of the books we read. I found the characters pathetic, weak and self-absorbed. At some point, people need to realize that they can't blame their parents for everything that they don't like about their lives, and just move on. THis book would be a light read to take to the beach, but I was glad to be done with it. It just went on, and on and on 
 Forget this Cliff Notes crap! Just read Night. It's a great book and it won't even take you long to read. I wish I could give this Cliff Note book zero stars 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 I used this maybe 4 times when the "in" stopped functioning, but it mysteriously *would* work in reverse.  I wish I read other people's reviews on this before I bought it. Horrible waste of money 
 I obviously did not conducting enough research before buying this book.  I am seventeen and this was an easy read, but I was hoping for and expecting a philosophical examination of our speedy lives.  Instead I was bombarded by semi-interesting, useless facts about how our world has been struck by "hurry-sickness" and how everything has been accelerated (a fairly obvious fact).  If you are consious enough of our world to buy this book (because of its title) for yourself, it will not raise you conciousness with any deep philosophical questions or with any solutions.  The only people who will benefit from this book are the ones who will never buy it for themselves.  Therefore I believe this book is basically useless and slightly boring 
 Sporting another politically incorrect cover to make your average feminist  cringe, Peter Banks and Flash released their sophomore effort minus Tony  Kaye's Hammond organ in tow. Banks' flashy guitar work fills much of the  void in tunes like Lifetime and Black And White, but it's downhill all the  way from there. After a promising debut, Flash falls flat on this one 
 Every song on this CD sounds as though these guys sat down and listened to other bands and then tweeked the tune a little. The second song on the CD sounds like Animals from Nickelback. If you know who Galactic Cowboys are then you'll recognize Ladies And Gentlemen etc... The best song might be Blacksheep but every song on here got copyed from someone 
 These songs take me back and are all top hits! It should be noted that the CD will not play in some players. Some copy protected thing I guess. It would be nice if Amazon would list the players that don't work with these CDs so we could make a better buying decision. 2 stars for the player problems. 5 stars fot the music 
 first of All KRS-One is One of the Greatest Rappers&Story-Tellers Ever&Ain't nobody out now in Rap Can even Hold His Shoe Laces when He breaks things down.having said that&understanding He didn't fully want this Album out He still hasn't knocked me out with a Album all the way through in way over a Decade.He has had some tight Jams&of course His Flow still will just leave you dizzy but the Music&Subject matter are pretty much the same&He hasn't challenged His Full powers as a MC in quite some time.He still has the Words&Flow to Roll you over but Albums like this&others of recent time just don't even begin to do this Man Justice when you remember&Grew up on His Best stuff.but regardless I'll always listen to Him.He truly changed&Flipped the Game 
 First off, Robert DeNiro as the monster. I saw him and immediately thought of Jake LaMotta or Vito Corleone. They didn't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from New York. Second, Kenneth Brannagh was so in love with  the set that he forgot about story. Finally the scene where Elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous. Frankenstien's shock that she's not happy to be back--burnt up, cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest-- was supposed to be touching but I laughed. We all know how great Kenneth Brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really, really, really bad.   I give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of Aidan Quinn's face. 
 I am shocked how bad this book was.  The author is obsessed with racism yet makes sterotypes out of the folks who live in the town.  He comes across as a lightweight elitist who does not have the skill to write a book on such a complex issue.  He repeats himself over and over again and never really captures anything below the surface.  It is not surprising that so many loved this book as it does not tax the brain and patronizes those too foolish to realize they are being patronized. Plus it is so so boring 
 When I reviewed THE STREET LAWYER recently, I mentioned that I've never put down a Grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props. For that book, certainly. For this one, nope. I read four chapters, 41 of its 391 pages, and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot. I hope he just had an off day or something, and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable. 
 I can look at pictures anytime.  There is no "how to" design information nor how you can alter or rearrange your own bathrooms.  The average American home is practical and utilitarian...not high priced, hard-to-find items. 
 I like Ludacris. Don't get me wrong.  But this album is kinda annoying.  The blow it out yer ass song is hard to listen to and repetitive.  The splash waterfalls song is also really redudant, if you heard it on the radio as many times as I did, you might agree.  He just talks through too much of this album... instead of rapping.. the beats are kinda weak and repetitive.. there are 3 good songs on this one: Diamonds in the Back, We Got, and Eyebrows Down.  The rest of them are kinda annoying.  But like I said I DO like Luda.. just get red light district or word of mouf instead 
 I admit, they have some good recipes, but most of them are not simple and very time-consuming. There is always a million ingredients in each little recipe. If you are a stay-at-home housewife and absolutely LOVE to cook, buy this, but if you are just normal, you won't find many recipes in here for you. I suggest you consider 'Cuisine at Home' before you buy this one 
 I, by no means am a literary critic. I am just your average spiritual mom, who does believe in the Indigo phenomenon. My personal review of this book is as follows: I'm not really sure if this book is Ms. Condron's story telling anecdotes to reminisce about the past or to publicly brag about her supposed "Indigo" child. Most children are brillant and special. They see life through eyes that are untainted and of course they will have thier own unique point of view, as we all did when we were young. Other than attempting to wordsmith our parenting skills, I found nothing of significant value in this book that I didn't already know. As parents, it is our job to develop our social and mental skills around each of our children's unique personalities, it is necessary for our children to grow and develop a mutual respect for parents and all who enter thier lives. Although research and book reading on Indigo children is nice to know and have, I don't think this book is one of the "essentials" for your collection 
 I cannot imagine what Sony or their sad, sad technicians were thinking - or NOT thinking when they "remastered" this great musical.  I HOPE - and one can only hope - whomever it was that "remastered" this music (and I can't imagine why they would call it re-MASTERED) that they got FIRED afterwards or went back to basic recording school.  MASTERING a musical CD means that you check your levels and balance - something they either forgot to do or were too busy talking while they should have been listening to what they were doing.  Did Sony imagine they'd be able to sell this on it's own merits...that being an attractive, well known, sell-able music CD of a charming musical - while duping the buying public (sadly ME included) that it would be something worth having for any Broadway music collection??  Well I was most assuredly fooled.  Even with my cheap (Sony by the way) 2 track tape deck could have come up with better than this rendition.  I just cannot abide that some highly technical "master" of recording equipment couldn't fix this before the thing was committed to a glass cd master to be cut in quantity, offered and distributed as a "remastered" version that SHOULD have been BETTER than the original but sadly isn't even close.  I thankfully, still have a cassette tape version of this musical from when it was first released many years ago and prefer that to this impossible display of cd "mastering" I have EVER heard - and I've heard a lot of quality remastered CD's - but this isn't one of them.  THE ONLY saving grace of this CD is some of the extras that have been included.  But not at full price..if you ask me.  Think twice or at least understand at the outset what you're getting....a very poorly "rekindled - NOT remastered" CD that has some singers sounding as if the "technicians" forgot to bring up the volume on those tracks.  Pretty sad, pretty sad.  Disappointing.  Love the musical - HATE the lousy CD 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 If you like the newly built McMansion-styled homes, then this is the book for you.  If you are looking for authentic French decor and tips, don't buy this book.  This is no more "unmistakably French" than la Madeline food is to French cuisine 
 I hated this book and here is why :  1.) Way too verbose (like a literature novel) for an action novel.   2.) Too much boring character development (to the point of being a distraction to the plot) 3.) Very slow.  The plot took forever to develop.  There was no suspense in the middle of the book. 4.) Terrible ending (the worst ending I could have imagined for this plot)  The only good thing I can say about this book 1.) I read it on the plane, so I really didn't "waste" my time per say, since I had to kill the time anyway 
 This movie is lame, corny, predictable, weak on a plot, and altogether just bad.  Sure it was funny in small spurts,  but it just didnt deliver the complete package.  I think Larry is a funny guy,  but sadly Larry is the only good thing about this movie.  gets 1 extra star for being mildly funny. 
 This book might be good as a simple review for children interested in kennels.  I found it to be very simplistic and filled with a lot of "common sense" information.  If you are really interested in  reading it, check your local library, it is just not worth the money 
 I have numerous Verilog books and this one I use the least. The examples are for simple applications that most people never need or can figure out on their own. I would not recomend this book 
 My first Nora Roberts' book....with only be persistent did I complete the book....found it to be very slow paced with an unrealistic storyline...shallow characterizatio 
 Easily the worst textbook I encountered during my undergraduate years.  Unfocused, sparse, and almost completely lacking example problems.  Riggs touches briefly on lots of topics and treats none of them completely, leaving the reader lacking any notion of how process control actually works in real life.  I'm not a big fan of the book by Seborg et al. either, but if you have to choose between the two, go with Seborg 
 I suppose you will enjoy this if you really like Yo-Yo Ma at his most boring.  This is glorified elevator music and about as interesting 
 Another book that is written like hearing a narrative. I would not recommend this bok for any reader 
 Perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses, Boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others.    Lacking even the slightest trace of shame, he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses.  As a result, there's nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages.  Even more pitiably, like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to "sanitize" his clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source, Boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed.  One wearies quickly of the Manichaean results.  And like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be nuclear (or social) engineer, he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally, succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was.  Why, even the title itself has been purloined from Alistair Home's 1977 underground classic, "A Savage War of Peace"!*  Considering that Home's tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from Boot's, this is irony most profound.  It is scarcely surprising, then, that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly trumpeted in Boot's book, thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it -- unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the Ozymandian ruins of Boot's espoused belief system.   * Recently reprinted and highly recommended!  
 Someone like John Berendt, former editor of New York magazine, reminds me of why I left Manhattan, with its small-mided delusional ego-centrism. He's an unskilled writer and thinker, with the soulful depth of a gossip columnist. Pick your favorite town or city, and imagine someone spinning the news-making personalities (University heads, retired CEO's, Mayors, developers, elites and gold-diggers) into a porttrait of your town, coated with a pretense of depth through literary references. You'd be incensed. Most people don't care about the trials of the rich and famous (maybe 10% of the population does, enough to keep books like this successful) -- they care about real stuff, like life, death, happiness, meaningful work, family etc. There's nothing important here. This is not Venice today, and the inhabitants of the city are right to ignore the book 
 An unreadable book.  Bits and pieces stretched out over 800 pages that never add up to a whole.  To use DeLillo's garbage theme: it was like finding litter on a sidewalk.  Each piece once meant something, but who knows what.    I finished it because I had read so many good reviews that I thought there must be something worthy in it.  Sometimes a book is torture and then everything comes together at the end.  Not in this case.  Torture for 800 pages and then poof! DeLillo tidies everything up in an epilogue.  Nice scenes and nice sentences and BIG ideas don't necessarily make a book a worthwhile read. It was my first DeLillo book and it will probably be my last 
 Did Hunter really write this book? I've read Lady of Sin & Lord of Sin and it just doesn't seem like the same author. There is barely any emotion in this book. Daniel does not love Diane, he lusts after her and Diane has got cotton in her brain. She is so naive its ridiculous like going to her friends house, who by-the-way is a mistress. And is she ruined? NO! Huh?? Oh and yeah, she sleeps (begs him is more like it) with Daniel in exchange for a promise! WHAT!? She apparently has no idea what behavior is not proper for an innocent. What exactly were they teaching her in that french school?   Daniels revenge thing is totally out of hand too. I seriously didn't believe he would choose Diane over revenge. And his 'friends' from the dueling society? Well their just blah too, not very likeable or dislikeable. No interesting characters in this book at all. Maybe his sister Jeanette and Paul could have used some more pages.   I think I'm going to stick to Hunters lastest works and forget about these older ones. Good I didn't read them first.  If you want to read a fantastic historical that will keep you enthralled and pull your heart strings read Kingdom of Dreams or Almost Heaven by McNought. Kleypas, Quinn, Garwood and D'Allessandro are excellent writers too 
 Like many things from the Certified Fraud Examiners, this book comes with a hefty price tag.    The book is alright but it is definitly not worth 100 dollars.    If you have read a few other good books about fraud (books by Chuck Whitlock, Frank Abagnale, Carl Sifakis) then you will find that less than 1/4 of the information in this book is new.  Since it is written by an accountant, it is not as enjoyable or readable as most books out there.    Furthermore, anyone who as ever changed font sizes, page margins, fonts, and line spacing to make a boring term paper meet the minimum requirements will notice that this 'encyclopedia' is double spaced and the inner margins are massive.  In fact, the inner page margins are more than twice the size of the margins in 'Frauds, Deceptions and Swindles' by Cark Sifakis.    If this book had normal margins and single spacing its 840+ pages would probably shrink to approximately 350 pages.    If you are willing to spend 100 dollars on books about fraud, you'd be better off buying a smorgasborg of used books by Whitlock, Abagnale, Sifakis, and whatever else the Amazon AI recommends.  
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 I couldn't go three pages without running into something that was sloppy, incomplete, or just plain irritating.  Full of many good examples that back up the book's main idea (using lessons of history to guide current decision-making), the book unfortunately is also full of hyperbole, flawed argument, inaccurate generalizations and over-simplifications.    It's easy to show how the lesson of a historical incident can validate a decision, if you ignore all interpretations of that historical incident except those which confirm the decision you're trying to support.  Tautologies are convenient, but they prove nothing.  A little more precision, a little more discipline, and the thesis of the book would have been a lot more convincing.  Even worse than that: too often, the author asserts controversial opinions as though they were accepted fact; too often over-generalizes to the point of meaninglessness; too often slips from chatty informality into factual inaccuracy.    I really, really wanted to respect this book, because I am always looking for works that synthesize the lessons of many different historical periods.  The idea behind this book was intriguing, which is why the poor execution of that idea is so disappointing.   
 If you are a Christian looking for information about certain Bible topics then this dictionary is not for you.  There are even some sections where the author doubts the validity of Scripture and claims that there are faults in the Word of God.  If you are looking for wishy-washy details then this is the book for you.  If you believe the Word of God is just that THE WORD OF GOD, then don't buy this dictionary.  There are so many other Bible dictionaries out there that will be of much more help and guidance.  My suggestion to all....give this one a miss 
 The new iPods do not have the connections to work with FireWire. So this cable will only charge the new iPods with video. Besides this this is a good product for the iPods 
 This series is a travesty. I understand the feeling of loss when you finish a beloved series, but let Laura, not MacBride, have the last word on her family's experience. So much in his books rings false: the clumsy historical allusions, the narrative voice, the potty humor . . . One of the greatest things about Laura Ingalls Wilder's work is the way her voice advances in maturity as she, the main character, grows: Big Woods is written for little girls and Happy Golden Years for young women. MacBride doesn't manage this and talks down to readers. There is a tiny thread of Laura in these books, but not enough to do more than frustrate her fans. Sampling is for rap, not fiction. 
 Recently received this for our 5 year old and I really cannot recommend it to anyone. Master Mind is a terrific game concept for developing logic, but this version of the game has a few problems. The most important is that, at the slightest bump of furniture or board, the game pieces do not stay in the shallow indentations on the board. Game over. It's really that simple and pretty much that inevitable. Also the scoring peg tray overflows into the secret code location so that every time one digs out a scoring peg a wave of pegs flood the secret code cave. Other comments: the pegs for scoring and the pegs for color coding are not too different in size, and both come in red. The pink is light purple and there is also another purple - confusing to small kids.  If you know original Master Mind, you'll know there's a 4-peg code, and scoring it is such that the "code breaker" doesn't know *which* of his colored pegs is in the correct spot or the correct color. Kid's MM has 3 peg codes, but the scoring indicats *which* peg is in the correct spot and which is the correct color. Thus after a few plays it is close to impossible for a child who "gets" the trick to not guess in about 3 rounds, and it seems to discourage the logic exercise since the feedback from any old guess will do just as well. What I'm trying to say is that even if the gameboard were well designed I wouldn't recommend the game for kids over 5. But given the tendency for pieces to fall over, I would send the manufacturers back to the drawing board 
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 Britney Spears cannot sing! She's just like Madonna, she can't sing but she's famous for her sex appeal and dancing. I really do not like her voice and song choice most of all! She sounds like a 8 year old little girl 
 The Ying Yang Twins are so bad that it is not even funny. Now if they had talent then I could buy this CD, but that is not the case.. 
 I purchased this book as part of a required reading for my high school honors geometry course. It is perhaps the most utterly boring and fanatical piece of fiction I have ever read. Not only is the book completely devoid of plot, it is lacking in all aspects of what a true work of fiction should include. This book has not educated me further on geometric concepts, nor has it enlightened me of any time period of which this book is said to be mirroring. Instead, it has wasted my time, which is precious to me now, and has completely confused me. Do not purchase this book. Do not assign it as required reading and most definitely do not read it for pleasure. There are other 80 page books that you can spend your time on.  Read anything else before you read Flatland 
 How could anyone think that Jennifer Love Hewitt looks or acts anything like audrey? who in thier right mind could see this gangly, ungraceful, talentless, squinty has-been as one of the most beloved actresses/humanitarians of our time? Its blasphemy and I am glad this movie tanked. 
 I generally love the O'Reilly books because they tend to be very thorough and have lots of practical code examples, but this book was a big disappointment to me. I was easily frustrated by this book. As a beginner to MySQL and database programming, I was completely lost whenever I tried to apply something to my own projects. The explanations given here are very brief and the authors often send you elsewhere for more in-depth discussion. I wound up doing most of my research online and just using the SQL reference chapter to look-up query syntax. I give it two stars because it did help me get started, but I'd say this is a poor reference for anyone looking for in-depth coverage 
 This book, to be fair, should be critiqued by a handicapped person. Even if their handicaps aren't the same, experiences are pretty much the same. I think this writer made up much of what she claims to have experienced, not about her illness and her experience with going from doctor to doctor and resisting permanence but about her experiences with people. Those seem to me to be a lot of fiction based on fact.   It wasn't until the last few pages of the book that I started agreeing with her. But even there she didn't go far enough. I'm sure that a memoir written by a 37 year old (which is the age I believe she was when she wrote this last year) is ridiculous; at that age you still have a lot of life left to experience, and you certainly aren't as wise about your past as you will be when you're older. And "wiser" is important when you're philosophizing about your condition like she did in that book.   The biggest thing she doesn't get yet, which surprises me since she has kids, is that what happened to her hurt her parents much, much more than it did her. She sort of mentions that near the end of the book when she talks about her father finally saying, after all those years, it's too bad this had to happen to you. Notice, though, the emphasis she puts on it taking him so many years to say that.   Throughout the book, she constantly puts down two things: her parents and the Catholic church. Of course, her parents aren't the same as mine, but I still think she's unnecessarily hard on them. It made me dislike her, as a matter of fact. And, as a former Catholic trying to justify her attitude toward the Catholic church, she puts in print absolute falsehoods about the Catholic church. This made me think she's not as smart as she thinks she is. For instance, she insists that the Catholic church teaches that limbo is a place where even 2-day-old babies go if they haven't been baptized, which is untrue, and I think someone should call her on that. The Catholic church does not teach that; the author is remembering incorrectly something that she thinks a teacher said when she was in elementary school.  But the last few pages of the book were good. She said that becoming handicapped isn't so much a travesty as it is something that just is, something that is more remarkable than awful (to paraphrase).   She talks endlessly about all her pain before and now. I've found that the more when you talk about pain, the more it hurts. Someone ought to tell her that 
 I recently bought this DVD and was really looking forward to seeing it. Halfway I stopped watching it. Disappointing 
 First of all, it's sad that someone would put out a product (the 360) that gets so hot that it tends to fry itself, unless you spend another 10% of the product cost on a little series of fans.  Second, I attached this. I plugged it in. It wouldn't even turn on. Waste of money. Do yourself a favor and just keep your machine in an open, uncluttered, unblocked area. If you absolutely must provide additional airflow, just point a $10 clip-on fan at it 
 First time I looked through this book, was curiosity of my local library.  Checked out, and was blown away with how cool this book is.  That was 9 months ago.    Being a big U2 fan-and since the price had dropped considerably-decided to buy the book.  After a few minutes of 'reading' it, realized how crappy the pictures in the book are.  Seemes like 90-99% of the pictures are washed out, grainy, and horribly reproduced here.  Was there any quality control as this book went to press?  And for those 'new, never before seen pictures' they are pretty ho hum.  Because its not totally horrid, I'd give it 2.5 stars.  Just, well,  disappointing.  If I had to pay the full MSRP, I'd give it ZERO stars.  While I must say, for $14 or so, you do get some good training on how heavy your next laptop will be... 
  Phew. Rubbish at its purest. I am a Wiccan and proud of it. This book aims to undermine our beautiful religion, and I strongly feel that a child - ANY child - should conciously choose their own faith. It is their right, and parents should do nothing to stay in their way. Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, Wiccan - let your child choose 
 This poetry has no redemption or beauty. It is dry, sarcastic, dismal, and plain out unhealthy to the mind. It's not worth it. Read poetry that moves you to understanding, not this 
 From the moment Celeste met her adoptive's father father...I knew there would be trouble. Not only didn't we find out if she were pregnant...which would have made for an interesting twist...she never heard from the boy she gave her virginity to again! I was really disappointed in this story 
 For the price ($80) I expected much better sound.  Should spend a little more and get a Shoenhut or for $10 you could get a toy piano that sounds better than this one.  Very tinny sound, completely out of tune (why do they bother even assigning a note to the keys?), and lid is attached with screws AND glue so the only way to get to the metal rods to attempt to tune it, even after the screws are removed, will be to crack the wood casing getting past the glue 
 Over the top attempts at wit seldom work, as this volume proves. I like dry humor, sarcasm and off the wall references, but this is just dumb 
 Hesser-Biber uses the subject of women and their body image to give her opinion on how "evil" capitalism is. The first four or so chapters are all about how the horrible, terrible, capitalist pigs who just want money are responsible for eating disorders, low self esteem, and everything else. The rest of the book she spent time telling stories, as though we didn't get the point all ready that people are unsatisfied with how they look.  Then she goes on and on about how women are just objects while men are looked at for their intelligence. Oh, but she ignores the fact that there are TONS of shirts out there for girls that say "Boys make great pets" and "Boys are stupid," etc., yet not ONE about girls. Not to mention the negative advertising about men (I saw one ad about a minivan- "Gets more done than your husband ever will").   Don't bother with this book. It's worthless and only got in my way of reading other books that are actually worth my time. 
 I threw this book in a bonfire after I discovered Goodman. Painful to read. Manages to be short on detail and current developments (buy Goodman if you want either) and yet somehow wordy and full of information you don't need. Horribly edited. If you wan't something concise buy Lippencott's review (though the info is a bit dated). 
 I bought this book mainly because I have a bump in my nose and would like to try to hide it.  This book does show a technique, but it involves caking on so much makeup that I would have to put layers on the rest of my face or else it would just look silly.  I don't wear much makeup to begin with and I am not comfortable with the amounts suggested in this book.  There were some nice homemade beauty tips scattered throughout (face masks and whatnot) but nothing I couldn't find on the internet for free.  Basically, 'the plastic surgery without the surgery' is putting on layers upon layers of thick foundation to cover up any flaws - and that's no secret!  
 I anticipated more of this book just from the reviews, but I guess I was wrong. I gave it a chance and kept reading thinking it would get better as it progresses but it didn't. i stopped halfway through when I realized that I'm only torturing my self, I could've read about quantum physics and it would've been more entertaining. I did not see the humor or the point of this book 
 I really wanted to love this book and have been trying to figure out why I didn't; why I wanted to fling it into a pit of fire. Content-wise it told me all about Jerry to the nth degree. In a trite, trivial voice!  Oh, it  could have been a contender. It could have been wonderful because the  follow-a-manager-for-a-year angle is cool. But the problem is Ms. Baker  doesn't know how to tell an exciting story, a story with moments and  dialogue and emotion. Instead, she transcribes facts!  The pacing is  turtle-slow, and the writer tries far too hard to be clever by saying  things with icky cliches and similies. I wanted to take a pen and edit. I'm  sorry to sound harsh that's not my intention because I really think it's  not all the author's fault. The editors were asleep. Needs more white space  and more pronouns instead of "Jerry this" and "Jerry  that." Nothing fresh, not even a bit twisted. Sigh. What was it about  again 
 I don't keep up with every single Ludlum book, and when I bought this in paperback I'd just assumed it was one of his earlier ones that I'd missed--since I was aware that he'd died.  About 15 pages into it I found myself looking back at the front to make sure I had the right book--the writing style was juvenile.  It felt like a high school kid's first attempt at a spy novel.    Then I looked at the printing date and realized I'd been ripped of by the publisher!  Ludlum did not write this, and it is so painfully obvious.  I trudged through another 100 pages or so--you know--figuring that I'd invested some time in it and it might get better. It never did.    I admit to not finishing it and I know I'm not missing anything. Just to get as far as I did was a tedious chore.    Robert Ludlum would be writhing in his grave if he knew the slop that St. Martin's Paperbacks is peddling in his name 
 If you're thinking of reading this book, let me save you some time--don't.  I like a good literary read as much as the next guy (really), and make it a point to read all the Pulitzer winners, but this book, in perfectly plain English, sucked.  There is no plot, no beginning, middle or end, and is so tedious and boring that I actually started reading it from the back forward.  It didn't help, but it didn't make a wit of difference either.  Do your self a favor and skip it 
 What a waste of time.  There is no spirit of realization behind the words.  It just made me want to go direct and read the words of Parmahansa Yogananda directly and not waste time on this ego trip 
 While this book has some good topics to be discussed with kids, it is more about "how to get the teacher to like you" and concentrates on rules that are outdated and a bit unrealistic.  I'm pretty disappointed 
 I blame Yoko Ono for helping split up the Beatles (I think the Beatles were on stormy seas anyway, but Yoko was definitely the iceberg and John steered the ship right for it).  "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" IS about Lennon's love for LSD, despite the same type of lying he tried to deny in the "Beatles Bigger Than Jesus" backpedaling.  (Come on: McCartney just admitted that "Got To Get You into My Life" was about weed!). Yoko Ono has hijacked the Lennon legacy all these years for her own nefarious purposes.  She's just sold Lennon's likeness as an "action-figure doll," for Pete's sake.  And we're still dealing with the talentless half of the Lennon/Ono union.  First Yoko.  Now Sean.  The Instant Karma Lennon sang about all those years ago is still tormenting us--which is a meaning I'm sure John never saw coming.  The ultimate horror of what all the hippies wished upon their enemies--the Government, the Establishment--has come back on them.  SELL OUT is what they all did.  Lennon would be horrified.  I suppose there is some form of justice that the Ono bloodline is completely devoid of talent or shame.  They can put out as many CDs as they want, they can engineer tribute shows to John without inviting any of the Beatles or the son who could sing (Julian), and they can use that unholy alliance they have with Rolling Stone magazine to put their faces out there as much as they want (the last time I saw Sean, he was on the cover under the heading, CHILDREN OF ROCK STARS).  But the same kind of status-quo and denial and propaganda they cursed back in the day...is now their standard-operating procedure. It's almost funny 
 I LOVED the book and made the mistake of buying the movie without watching it first. This movie is boring and did no justice to the book 
 I had a difficult time with this book. Having ready "Flags of Our Fathers", I had hopes this would be as well written and informitive. However, from early on this book came across as just another piece of "pagan liberal propoganda". The ethnic cleansing of American Indians by the United States was an early warmup of typical pagan propoganda and it headed downhill from there. The pagans liberals have a prospensity to always color whatever the United States does in the worst light and make the atrocities of our enemies to be minor indiscretions. This book is another pagan apologetic for what's wrong with the US and right with all nations who wish us ill. 
 I know this is Philosophy's big seller, but I hate the way it smells.  It reminds me of those old ladies that bathe in their fragrance and make everyone around them nauseous.  My husband hated it too, as did my son.  I like the comments about it smelling like dead flowers and a dryer sheet.  That is about as close as it gets.  If you want a good Philosophy scent, go with Falling In Love, Pure Grace or Philosophy - the scent.  All of them are better than Amazing Grace.  I don't care to smell like a perfumy granny, thank you.  I'll stick with my Falling In Love 
 This book was extremely disappointing.  I was looking for my first book on pressure cooking, and this one had nothing that my family would have wanted to eat.  It was more for someone who is looking for gormet fare and exotic ingredients than for someone who just wants to feed their family a tasty, healthy meal 
 I read this book and was vastly disappointed. It should not be placed on the same shelf as David Drake or David Weber. If you want a good book with a good story line, plenty of action, and any type of ending to the book at all stay away from this book and go with something else 
 All the reviews on this book were so glowing I thought it a given that I would like it, but that wasn't the case.  As someone who is a relatively "new" fan of the Beatles (at 39, always a big Who fan, I finally relented and gave the Beatles their fair shake and fell in love), I come with few preconceptions about the whole Lennon/McCartney thing. People seem to want to side with one or the other, and most for John. But for me, you couldn't have had one without the other. Would anyone really have wanted the Beatles to be with songs just by John, or just by Paul? They obviously balanced each other, seemingly perfectly.  This book, however-to me-presented an unbalanced view, slanted not just heavily toward John, but heavily against Paul. It seemed that every chance he got, the author would take a swipe at him. Conversely, it seemed that whenever John should have been taken to task for something, the author instead gave him a pass.  I'm now going to turn to the Hunter Davies book, the one that was written from the "inside" in '67 or so. I know it's the "official biography," and that for some people that may mean a facile, if not servile, treatment of the Fab Four's life, but at least it was written at the time, with copious first hand knowledge of them 
 I really wanted to like this CD. I tried, I really did. But in the end, it never got above generic rock for me. Yes, it does rock pretty hard at times, but the main thing I couldn't get past was the pretentiousness of the lyrics. Enough of the heavy-handed Biblical imagery already, Barbara! Leave that sort of thing to Dylan...he knows what to do with it. (In fact, they end this CD with a cover of Bob's "Highway 61 Revisited," and don't do the song any favors.) And while Barbara Keith has power in her voice, I don't hear much soul. Take a listen to Neko Case to hear the difference between a belter and a singer who can mix a strong voice with subtlety.  Musically, the CD is full of pretty straightforward rock riffs, a bit along the lines of Joan Jett without the growl and later ZZ Top. They're basically a competent bar band that needs to lay off the sophomoric "poetry," and honestly, I'm a bit baffled by the overwhelming response this CD has gotten here in the Amazon reviews. I guess this might sound good compared to a lot of what you hear on mainstream radio and MTV (when they play videos) these days -- that is, you'd have to not have been doing much exploring outside the mainstream over the past decade or so. To each their own, in any case, but the lyrics of these songs make me cringe. I need it played with more freewheeling spirit, more heart, more soul, and a little more creativity. A bit of a sense of humor wouldn't kill them either, for that matter 
 This is more Latin pop trash.....do we really need another Ricky Martin/Enrique somethingorother? And PLEASE don't tell me women actually find this scrawny, messy-haired, buck-toothed Ricky wannabe reject good-looking.....he has a hideous face, it scares me.... 
 Community Playhouse in Long Beach did the show this August. As it played, the plot didn't come through, but the wit of Shaw did. The playhouse didn't have the costumes of the military men, nor the actors to carry-off the pomp and bravado of these would-be heroes. In a time when G.W. Bush is fighting his own phantasmic enemies this play should have lapooned the whole spectre of military madness. George Bernard Shaw gave us the theme it will take some imagination and talent to make it contemporary and equal to the madness of our times. Ano 
 Morehouse's book begins to unravel as one reads.  The accounts of remote-viewed things were far too generic and received (ark of the covenant, Mars, complete with ancient living beings, angels in flowing robes no less who guide him) to be believable.  Truth has a certain baroque quality, which this story is lacking.  Also, the reader is informed that angels informed Morehouse that they live in "a dimension parallel to yours."  Hunh?  We live in a three dimensional world (if you do not count time as a dimension) in which each dimension is perpendicular to the other two.  So how is some other dimension parallel to all of these three?  And are the angels saying they exist in a single dimension?  They inhabit a straight line?  We are further informed that God lives in a four-dimensional world.  Gee, so do we, if you count time, which most physicists do.  So... what distinction is being made?  The story smacks of the scientifically impoverished imaginings of the author.  
 This was a "notorious rip off".  This was a misrepresentation of Lemony Snickets Series.  Amazon intentionally leaves out the fact that this is a blank notebook and is not the latest release in the series.  People who are waiting for the release are being duped into buying this worthless book with the expectations of receiving something else.  This is switch and bate and Amazon has stooped to it. Good way to loose customers pulling this kind of business!!! By the way, there should be a spot of 0 stars 
 This is the type of book in which the author daydreams his/her way through it. What is simply speculation, rumor, hint and flat-out tall tale, becomes fact under the pen of the wishful author. "It probably isn't so, but I am a respected author, and if I say it is so, people usually believe me." It is the sort of book for someone who is probably only going to read one book on Richard III, so Weir hammers the reader over the head with her theories, to make her point so thoroughly that the reader won't even want to get another opinion. Try Paul Murray Kendall, Jeremy Potter or Charles Ross on Richard III and become acquainted with solid scholarship. One star is one too many. 
 I purchased this product along with the Koi and turtle and they worked for one day. The koi would not turn off unless the batteries were pulled out. The turtle would not turn on unless you physically held the button in and the fish just quit altogether and sunk to the bottom of the pool. 
 "Tribulation Force" picks up where "Left Behind" ended, and like that book, this one's slow. After the first one, I thought maybe things would start to happen in this one, but they don't. There are a few plot elements that are connected with endless filler. And none of the things that do happen in are completely devoid of suspense. There's one major event that we're told after the fact via a TV newscast. You might think that a book about the end of days would be interesting, but these authors obviously don't know how to write a thriller. It's just endless soap opera. This book and "Left Behind" should have been one volume. If all the books are the same pace, the whole series should have been a trilogy, but of course, then they would make less money.   Don't waste your time on it and don't encourage these talentless hacks by buying their books 
 The images in this book almost mirror the images shown in the 1st Basquiat retrospective book from the Whitney Museum (edited by Richard Marshall). If you own the Whitney book, there's no need to pick up this one because you'll be looking at a lot of duplicate images. If you don't own a Basquiat book, you can't really go wrong with either edition and I would lean towards the newer book. But there's no need to own both of them. So why the low rating? It's a shame that the curators didn't take the opportunity to add something new for Basquiat fans. Many years have passed since the 1st Whitney retrospective and we're basically presented with a book that repeats what's already been printed. Unfortunately we'll have to wait for someone else to put out a book of new Basquiat material for us to see 
 My wife an I bought the book and tried the diet.  We could not last the 2 weeks on phase 1.  Neither of us can stand the taste of fish, so our limited choices were limited even more.  The first week went okay, but by the second week, we noticed that we had become quite irritable.  We did not want to see another salad, cheese stick, chicken, or lean ground beef.  It was not so much that we craved breads, pastas, and candy.  We missed fruit.  Even though it would only be a few more days to reach phase 2, we decided to ignore this book and start with a diet based on the government guidelines (the "dreaded" low-fat, high-fiber, portion control diet).  In addition, we made exercise a part of our daily routine.  Our moods improved quickly,  Weight is coming off.  We are getting stronger and more fit.  It's been about a month since we quit South Beach and we are happy with our current diet and have no desire to dump it.  One thing South Beach did teach us was the importance of snacking.  It really helps with portion control and hunger issues.  Only, we changed it from cheese and nuts to no-fat yogurt, fruit, or veggies 
 Amazon should send all of these 25th Anniversary DVD's back to UNI, the faulty product locks up after about 1 1/2 hours on both my Panasonic and Sony DVD decks! I see this problem also exists in the wide screen version from the reviews of that product.  Simply put - DON'T BUY THIS LOUSY UNIVERSAL PRODUCT!!! 
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 I'm a big fan of the Zone diet and have lost 55 lbs to date, however, the recipes in this book are nasty, nasty, nasty as well as time consuming... too much chopping and preparation for someone on the go.  I don't have the time, nor do I have the inclination to fix all the food suggested in this book, even if it did taste good (which it doesn't).  Forget buying the book and try something else -- it's not worth the paper it's printed on.  I don't know who came up with these recipes, but they are definitely out of touch with how "normal people" eat.  
 Surprisingly sleaze and Chauvinism by female Director Heckerling! She duplicated it in Chevy Chase vehicle National Lampoon's European Vacation too! Many child actors got their start here, but the thing that cracked me up,  as I saw it when it came out (unfortu- nately) was the dialog of my fav band, Cheap Trick: Ticket scalper "...The magntism of Robin Zander and the  charisma of Rick Nielsen...and what about the tunes, 'I Want You To Want Me, The Dream Police...nan-nan-nah, 'You're momma's alright, your daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird, Surrender, surrender...", before he's  interrupted. If that isn't somebody's idea of 'Surrender', they've stumbled  onto this review by mistake 
 Although a majority of readers obviously loves this book, I have to say that it really seemed like a waste of money to me. Our only daughter left for college this year, but fortunately I have trained her in time to be independent. If your kid doesn't have a clue how to live in the real world and if if you're still willing to do everything for them and not have them take responsibilities for their own lives, this book is right for you. Not in my dreams would I have made lists for her what to take because she can well do this herself! I do miss her and she misses us but that does not mean clinging dependency! I expected different things from this book, on a deeper psychological level 
 I picked up a copy of this because of the number of people telling me that this was so much better than Conway's other poorly-done books. After reading it, I strongly disagree!!  Beginning in the introduction, when she incorrectly states that "the words Wicca, Witchcraft and the Craft are actually interchangeable", there is very little here that can't be found in dozens of other phoney McWicca-lite introductory texts.   Her history is based on the myth that there was once a peaceful matriarchy, and everyone worshipped "the Goddess" until evil patriarchy came along and spoiled everything. She would do well to actually read some of the accurate archeological works listed in her bibliography!  She then proceeds to confuse the term "Paganism". In spite of the way she misuses the word, "Paganism" is actually a large group of related, but highly dissimilar religious. It is not a single path "based on a specific pantheon of deities", and there are certainly more than "only a few differences between Wicca and Paganism, besides the difference in their ages". (And NO religion can be dated back to the Stone Age! NO ONE knows what beliefs existed then, what their 'religious' practices were, or even if they HAD any religious beliefs!) She also defines many Traditions within Wicca inaccurately, and shows little understanding of the history of Wicca, or the various practices that define it's many branches.  When speaking of Deities, she first states that Wicca is polytheistic, then proceeds to "explain" that all Gods are a reflection of a single God archetype, and even the Gods are subservient to the Goddess. (That's not polytheism.) She also speaks of Triple aspects of Goddess, saying that this is a universal concept, and that it has been recognized "from the beginning of religion". This is untrue. (She has quite a habit of stating historical "facts" that are contrary to the archeological evidence, without saying where she is obtaining her "information". She also frequently speaks of conclusions of how found items were used or what they signify that are very different from what the scholars who are trained to interpret such finds conclude. Especially when the archeologists determine that NO conclusions can be made from the evidence available.)  In my opinion, Ms Conway's version of "wicca" is a blend of New Age thought, Ceremonial Magic influence, and poor research. While I don't doubt that it could be used to create a viable and valid spiritual path, it bears little relation to actual Wicca. If one wishes to learn about Wicca, I would strongly suggest starting with A Witch Alone by Marian Green, then moving to books such as Gerald Gardner's recently republished classics. No, it won't be as easy as what Ms. Conway has written... but *real* Wicca cannot be condensed into a 400-page how-to manual 
 In a nutshell, credentialing, atrophy of the scientific mind, and failures of professional ethics are leading to a new Dark Age where there is much information and little truth. And sooooo? Just tune into to your local news 
 Whole Foods does not = Macrobiotics as this author has decided. Whole Foods includes meat, very heartily, as it is a "whole food". I planned on a book full of recipes including snacks, which are very hard to think of, and was disappointed. The copy is trite and recipes are not very helpful regardless 
 This book is a complete joke, the title is a complete misrepresentation of the book's contents.  I've read journal articles that have more information on embedded control than this 200+ page book.    Everything in this book can be gotten from more complete references on control systems, such as Dorf and Bishop's "Modern Control Systems" for starters.  Even Phillips and Nagle's "Digital Control System Analysis and Design" has more information on embedded control when it isn't even the primary focus of their book.     Instead of explaining how to program control systems in C/C++ the author provides a brief overview of control techniques and MatLab code.    The author never actually discusses embedded control which is the title of the book.  The point of the book, and even the title, is supposedly to explain how to control embedded systems with C/C++, yet the author never discusses anything remotely close to this, the closest he ever gets are programs that convert MatLab files to C.  This is completely useless if the author doesn't explain how to use a converted MatLab file on an embedded microcontroller.  The author doesn't even have examples on choosing processors for embedded systems.    Save $70 and put it towards a real controls book.   
 A boy has a college interview at a small academy and meets the other guys there.  And they talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk.  They go to classes and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk. Then they go down to dinner and and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk.  Then nighttime comes and the boys all feel themselves up.  In other words, this movie is vintage DeCoteau.  It defies all known logic (the boy shows up for his college interview, is accepted immediately and somehow moves in the same day with no luggage or discussion with parents), has lame effects and lots of half naked boys.  It's hard to tell if this is a commentary on the Catholic Church scandals or just another excuse to show writhing youg men in bed. Definitely another laugh riot from the director of such "classics" as Leeches and Leather Jacket Love Story 
 Wolpe takes forever to answer the question, "Why Be Jewish."  One must first plow through mounds of fluffy and cute prose -- much of it sounding like a bad imitation of Abraham Joshua Heschel.  Wolpe waits until  the last paragraph of the final chapter to answer the question, but give an  answer that can only be described as insipid.  Mr. Wolpe apparently  believes that the reason to be Jewish is that one should be good and joyful  and help the world and be one with God.  Sorry, Mr. Wolpe, that is not a  reason to be Jewish.  That is a reason to be an ethical monotheist, which  is all that Wolpe's "Judaism" amounts to.  A banal and  disappointing work 
 I wish I could give this movie zero stars. It's really amazing how someone can inject raw gore, violence, and sick humour into a movie, and try to pass it off as slick comedy, drama, and deep philosophy. This movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie. The sheer perversity in this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind of dark humour is beyond criticism. Do yourself a favour and please don't ever watch this movie if it comes on air. It's not even worth watching for morbid fascination. I terribly resent the fact that I gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out of sheer curiosity. But then, I may actually be glad that I did. At least it taught me how an exercise in atrocious film making can be 
 This book made me want to run to the bathroom with my hands covering my mouth. The plot is absurd, and epitomizes mediocre literature. Certainly wasn't a page turner, more of a page-flusher 
 Is is just me or is Deneen one boring individual.  I've only read the first 43 pages but I am just so turned off by how this woman went on a trip with a man who didn't want her and always ends up "pleasing"  herself all the time.  She strikes me as a woman who is mad at the world  just because she is overweight and can't get a man.  I can't get into this  book at all.  Maybe I'll try to read it again if it's the last thing I have  laying around the house 
 After the first 11 books, that were laced with black comedy and inopportune situations handled and aligned in a way to make sense, the 12th books somehow leaves the reader gasping for more and ends with a flat note. I can, however, find cognizance with the moral of the story that sometimes people you think you are close to, fail you with their "nobleness" or lack of guts! That you have to find strength in yourself to fight your own wars and that a family has an important part to play when you're struggling through your live. I think the gist of the story is that that the three children find succor in each other - almost a live force driven by love, that protects them and eventually helps to extricate them from impossible situations! 
 I like the theory of parent, adult, and child...But how do you explain when the adult/parent becomes a child? 
 I found this book to be schizophrenic at best. Not well written and an absolutely non-sensical storyline. The plot was rather dumb and dull, and I found myself not caring one whit about the main character in the book. I'm wondering if Ms Hodgson was perhaps a bit delusional herself when putting this book together.  I DO like well-done fantasies and mysteries...unfortunately, this was neither 
 By reading all of the other reviews I thought that this book would be right up my alley, and the actual story line was, but the execution of the story really lacks something.  I felt no real connection to the characters, and there was never any suspense to the writing that made me want to read further.  It's not that I disliked the book - it's that it didn't stirred my emotions at all.  I felt that it was a waste of time 
 I have had cats myself for over 15 years, and right now have three very amusing ones at home. That said, this is one of the least funny calendars I have ever seen, and you'll get more entertainment staying at home and letting your cats OD on catnip, believe me. I do have the book, and thought it was cute, although mostly for the pictures rather than the banter. I did expect this to be in B & W because one-a-days rarely come in color, but many of the pictures are not particular funny, regular cat shots (i.e. a head shot of a basic cat), of terrible print quality, and the quotes are awful. Very stale and lacking any sort of wit. The people saying this is hilarious are probably the types that think that "Blue Collar TV" and fart jokes are the epitome of high humor. So if you like basic, straight-forward comedy, by all means, get this calendar. I like more substance to my humor, and if you do too, pass on this.  Even "Cathy" cartoons are funnier than this. *Gasp 
 Utterly amazing and unique sound. Her voice is so powerful. 
 A totally worthless piece of garbage 
 Three things are necessary to make a good translation of the Quran into English: mastery of English, mastery of Arabic and knowledge of islamic history/faith. Arberry's has great command of the English language but unfortunately he comes short in his knowledge of the Arabic language and Islam. This makes his translation a beautiful read, but extremely inaccurate and even plainly wrong in crucial parts. For a much better translation I would recommended Muhammad Asad or Nooruddin. Pickthall's translation also is good, but difficult to read.  
 First of all, I don't derive any pleasure from writing bad or negative product reviews. But I'm afraid in this case I have no choice but to voice my opinion of this Remington R-960 electric razor. I have been shaving with electric razors for 30 plus years now. I've used all models of Norelco and Remington triple-header razors over the years as well as Remingtom Micro Screen electric razors (which I currently use). And I'm sorry to have to report that this is probably the worst one I've ever used. (Yes, before you ask,  I do always use a pre-electric shave lotion prior to shaving). The first morning I used this Remington R-960, I felt nothing out of the ordinary. Felt pretty much like any other electric razor. About 15 to 20 minutes after I finished shaving I began to notice a burning-type feeling around my neck/throat area. About an hour later I really felt this burning sensation. I was about to leave for work when I did a quick 'mirror check' in the bathroom and HOLY COW!! My neck and throat area was bright red and all swollen! And I mean BRIGHT RED and SWOLLEN! No wonder the burning sensation I was feeling. I looked like I just finished (trying to) shave with a gas powered hedge trimmer! I got to work and the guys I work with were like "Holy Crap!! What happened to you?" "Why, I just shaved with my brand new Remington R-960 this morning. Why do you ask", I sarcastically replied. They said it looked like someone took a chain saw to my throat! You get the idea. The bottom line ... it took approximately 6 days for all of the redness and swelling to entirely clear up in my neck/throat area. Needless to say, that morning which was the first time I used my new Remington R-960 electric was also the LAST time I used it. I haven't touched it since. Frankly and if I may be honest here, I'm a little frightened of the thing now. It's like it had a mind of it's own and it bit me but good. Now, each morning when I'm shaving with my Remington MS2-300 Micro Screen (not triple head) razor, I sort of have a tendency to keep one eye on the little monster as it is still sitting there on the shelf near the sink and mirror, patiently waiting for the next time I'm foolish enough to pick it up again. You have been warned 
 A very boring and stupid film about college freshmen with a kindergarten maturity level. The movie is horribly slow to get to the point and is riddled with nonsense dialogue: I've heard better lines in 'Fast Times At Richmond High' thank you.    Altogether a very forgettable film that has a lot of talk about nothing. Don't believe the great reviews about this film: the film might appeal to the 14-17 year-old crowds fantasizing about how 'cool' college life might be with all the 'cool' people and 'parties.' If you're not in that category, skip this boring film and save both your time and your money.    
 I guess Albom will just keep churning out this psychobabble but I'm done with him.  At least I can say I never paid for any of his Oprahlit. Just wasted time at a library. Please don't make this huckster one cent richer. Buy something more edifying.  Like toilet paper 
 Now, I enjoy Victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person -- in fact, probably more than the next person, since the average "next person" hasn't ever read any. Tales of derring-do, adventures to unexplored distant lands, lost civilizations, great artifacts, etc. -- that's all good stuff. What's not good is this book, which is tedious in the extreme. On the surface of it, Haggard's followup to his hugely successful (and infinitely better) "King Solomon's Mines" has all the elements: a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers (one of whom is descended from pharaohs!), a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man, an expedition to Africa, and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life.  However, despite this promising laundry list, Haggard's execution leaves a great deal to be desired. A friend described it rather aptly as "a book with a lot of story, but not a lot of plot." Which is to say that in my edition, some 320 pages are filled without much happening. There is the initial mysterious set-up, the journey to dark Africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations, the heroes' conveyance to the "lost city", and then... and then things kind of grind to a halt. Lengthy descriptive details, lengthy internal ruminations, lengthy rambling speeches, lengthy everything -- but very little of consequence occurs until the very end, when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life.  I suspect much of the problem stems from the book's origin as a long-running serial in the Gazette. As I understand it, serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment, and thus, it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible -- hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words. Judicious editing could reduce the book to 1/3 of its size without any loss of note. Of course, as another friend pointed out, it's probably best to read the book is small chunks -- just as one would have done with installments. Spreading out one's reading of it over a period of time, he suggests, may serve to conceal the book's rambling nature. In any event, there are some nice scenes here and there, such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches, but those are about all I'm likely to recall from this book in a year.   Of course, as is noted in the introduction to my edition, Haggard lifted the main elements of the plot, and even the the true name of "She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named", from several earlier adventure novels by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, so one can't even give him much credit for imagination. I suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of Victorian Englishmen: racism, anti-Semeticism, misogyny, fear of miscegenation, etc., but as entertainment for the modern reader, it falls woefully short of the mark. 
 I brought this book to Paris along with 4 others, and although had high hopes, I found it frustrating.  It didn't provide enough choice within a geographic area, and with respect to our one "big night" out, led us to a disastrous, expensive disappointment.  Alcazar(p. 51) had miserable service (she had billed it "exquisite") and a meal that had to go back.  We did much better following Rick Steves' recommendations, and our own noses.  If it's the third or fourth book on your list for Paris, as it was for us, save your money and the aggravation of carting the hefty thing around.  It's not worth it 
 This text was used at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for an honors OB course.  It served the class well by providing relevant and often humorous applications of theory.  However, the descriptions of the actual theories  themselves were weak and vague often referring to other concepts not yet  learned 
 This book does have a fairly intricate plot, and I did want to know what would happen to Ned and Verity...that said, do people really enjoy being clubbed over the head with a hundred redundant clues?  One of the pleasures offered by fiction is puzzling out the situation--once you've figured out a particular aspect, it just becomes tedious to be given nudge after nudge, while the dimwitted protagonist stumbles around for another 100 pages.  Willis occasionally hits the mark with her humor, but her tricks get old after a few repetitions, leading up to a climax of self-congratulatory literary allusions and treacly religious overtones.  What a disappointment 
 A waste of money and time.Information so general that only a abolute beginner can use it.So called expert tips are common knowledge...tips for a succesful email...1 be responsive to customers tip2 be honest all times,tip3test tip4 have a good mailinglist tip4 have a good offer or quality product.... WELL WELL that's great news. This book is a recyling of the recycling of the recycling....You can easly see the book has been made in a few day 
 The premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years, whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him, appears to be alive after all.  The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case.  How does she resolve her dilemma?  By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity.  Lame!   And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere.  I don't know what "K" or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers, but I'm not interested in finding out 
 I found the characters in this sleepy little town quite nice; human, normal, likeable, not unlike the folks in my northeastern New York home.  However, to me the pace was incredibly slow, and I agree with "A Reader from Boston" that I "slogged my way through this waiting for something, ANYTHING, that would catch my attention." I was unable to finish the book.  I shared it with a coworker who also gave up half way through.  It now resides in our company "lending library.&quot 
 I have read all the patterns in this book carefully and won't knit any of them, though I might adapt patterns from other books to reflect some of Eaton's design ideas. My main reason for shelving Eaton's book is her reliance on schematics. Schematic drawings illustrate pattern instructions with symbols (not symbolcraft), arrows, lines, and numbers. Eaton does not provide a key of any kind to these drawings, which amazes me given that she assumes her readers need far more basic instruction in things like casting on. Neither Vogue Knitting nor any of my other comprehensive reference books was any help; a search of the Web turned up no instructions. I suppose it would be possible to puzzle the schematics out by carefully comparing the text instructions to the drawings and creating your own key. But I think that was Eaton's job. Frankly, I am now far too irritated by her oversight to reopen the book any time soon. 
 As a licensed  therapist, I expected to be interested by this book.  I read hopefully for about 50 pages, then I skimmed pretty well for about another 100 pages.  What a irritating bore!  The counseling accounts were  bearable, although a little boring, but the eternal droning on about the  squirrels and birds was more than I could bear.   The writing was awkward.   It made me want to go to my back yard and quit reading -- which i did.   Maybe, if you are interested in counseling this might hold more appeal -  but I found it simplistic and sentimental in an irritating way 
 Shaw, who more than any of his contemporaries dealt provocatively with the crucial issues of his day, has not worn well.  In a 1971 encyclopaedia I had as a child, the entry on GBS called him the greatest dramatist since  Shakespeare.  That's better than Moliere, Sheridan, Strindberg, Ibsen,  Wilde, Jarry, Chekhov, Brecht, Ionesco, Beckett!  Such a laughable  proposition is untenable today, and we can now see Shaw for what he is - a  superficially amusing farceur, who squandered this modest gift on deadly  social comment, deadly because he reduced issues that effected real people  to theorems, and reduced those people to mere mouthpieces.  There is no  subtext in Shaw - everything is expounded tediously and teeth-grindingly on  the surface.   ARMS AND THE MAN is one of his better efforts, and, after an  uncertain start, settles into some nice old-style farce - hidden  identities, buffoonish heroes, scheming servants, crusty old majors; when,  though, the puppets start lecturing us on war, idealism, class, gender  etc., one's heart sinks, not because what Shaw says isn't true, but because  a letter to the Times would have been a better place to say it.  While  Wilde's plays grow with the years, seeming richer, more meaningful,  brutally satiric, bursting with complex and fluid themes, Shaw's work, in  their steadfast refusal of mystery and ambiguity, seem chilly and remote 
    This is  largely the same team of Letters who do the majority of  lettering for Image Comics, and maybe one day when they decite to do it for a more professional comics company, then they can write a book like this, until then, NO SALE 
 Wesley J. Smith presents palliative care as the be-all and end-all solution to terminal and chronic pain.  However, he doesn't address the facts and statistics.  Countries with legalized euthanasia, such as The Netherlands, have exemplary levels of palliative care that transcend what is offered in the United States.  The example of Oregon, the sole state where assisted suicide is allowed, has shown a marked increase in the level of pain relief for the sick and elderly.  Tragically, Smith's opposition to euthanasia leads to more pain and suffering for the terminally ill, which in turn leads to more support for euthanasia.  Palliative care is far from perfect today, and it is unlikely to alleviate all pain for all patients.  Most practice euthanasia 'under the radar', by calling it 'terminal sedation' by sedating the patient into a coma for weeks until they die.  Frequently, they'll awaken several times in excrutiating pain.  Not surprisingly, they'll do this without consulting the patient, so Smith's ideology removes more autonomy.  Thusly, the patient is either condemned to a death with insufficient pain relief, or a prolonged comatose state without any choices at all.  Then there's the case of Terri Schiavo.  Wesley J. Smith also opposes the removal of patients from life support.  This is nonsensical - Terri's wishes were well-known among her husband and many friends.  If we let doctors decide what treatment is 'best' for the patient, people will lose trust in the medical profession.  Surely the one on the receiving end of painful and often futile treatment should be allowed some say in whether they undergo and/or continue some treatment.  Indeed, I would say that their wishes should trump those of their doctors.  Surely we do not want cancer sufferers to ignore their symptoms and avoid doctors out of fear.  In addition to this, many resources and a great deal of manpower was wasted keeping Terri alive for years after no improvement was reached and Michael, her legal guardian, decided to remove her from life support.  Many lives could be saved and improved if nurses did not spend years taking care of a vegetable that could not respond, had no conscious mind and no hope of recovery, as the autopsy proved.  In the end, we all own our own lives.  Smith would like to choose to live for himself.  What he doesn't have the right to do is to make that choice for all of us and demand that we live on his terms 
 Many of Ms Garwood's books have similiar plots and characters, yet each usually stands on its own.  I don't know WHAT happened here, but this book was boring.  There's no other way to say it 
 There are 149 5 star reviews and 92 one star reviews.  This is more representative than an analysis based only on the last 20 reviews. But what is more notable than that is the fact that  the five star reviews tend to recieve a resounding thumbs down from the people who have read them.  Lone Nut Theorists can only bash and discredit their opposition since their story is false.  Posner totally disregards the Parkland Hospital Doctors statements regarding the neck wound as a wound of entry or the massive rear exit wound in the back of the head. He would also have us believe a high powered rifle shot to the head would not cause movement in the direction of the shot. That somehow our body would jerk back in the opposite direction and cause a large entrance wound and a small exit wound contrary to the numerous eyewitness accounts.  To expect us to believe this nonsense is insulting.          
 Uggh, this is a terrible remix from the one of the worst bands out there: Scissor Sisters. Ooooohhh, they took the songs from their debut and threw in another keyboard! What a great Remix! NOT! All this time I thought that only bands who had talent and wrote their own songs were worthy of remixes. I can't believe the Scissor Sisters took one of the greatest song in Rock (Comfortably Numb), and turned it into a radio friendly dance song! Ahh! What's next? Ashlee Simpson doing Stairway To Heaven? If you want some GOOD remixes, try any of the Nine Inch Nails remix albums, whixh rock. Trent takes the amazing songs he writes and turns them into something completely new- almost as if you've never heard the song before. This sucks 
 This dictionary was required material for my first Arabic course.  However, I often found natives saying "we never use this" when I would ask them about translations found in the dictionary.  Very rarely, if ever, are the translations within it correct.  As such, it has found its place in my home as a home-made picture frame.  If you need an English-Arabic dictionary, you can't go wrong with Al-Mawrid.  I'd stay away from the Oxford at all costs.  It is so concise it has left out accuracy altogether 
 I will be succint:  This book is absolutley worthless.  Do not buy it unless you want to feel as ripped-off as I do 
 I am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent!! As for me, I made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay. The fault in order of importance: poor screenplay, poor cinematography and poor performance by Pacino, who seems to be vying for the most over-the-top performance. The film was absurd in many ways from the outset: the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans. Close-up after close-up conveying no meaning, Pacino overacting like Jack Palance in one of his not-so-famous European pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies, an utterly dumb plot with Pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops.   First example, they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that; then, instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound, they storm the stairs and Pacino stands right in front of the door yelling "Police, you're under arrest."  They kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source. Of course, Pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream, having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort.   Cut to Pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog, glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog. Stumbling around further, Pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from, we must assume, his quarry. Did the screen writer forget that Pacino's colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit, too?   Inevitably and apparently not, because Pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him. As I watched this scene unfold, I became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what I knew already, that Pacino has fired on and killed his partner. It was then that I decided that I had had enough.   By the way, the European version, with Stellan Skarsgaard is infinitely superior. Don't waste your money or on-line rental queue on this Hollywood drivel. Ditto for the other Pacino junk I rented at the same time, The Recruit, which I could only stand for about a half hour too 
 Sounds like the background music used in the 70's Rockford Files TV crime show...and a little like the CHIPS music too. Similar to music by Tom Scott from back then. The crusaders never really get hard funky or dirty funky, they are more smooth groovin funk. The sound for the times is very clean, too produced for true funkyness. Don't get me wrong I like the old 60's JAZZ crusaders, just not this 70's phase of their career...they sold out to a large extent, and continue to do so, it's where the money is.  No improvisatory feel either. This is for smooth jazz lovers. hard funk lovers will be disappointed, as will true jazzers.  I wish the crusaders kept their jazz chops from the 60's but they keep burying it like it never happened, even to this day, afraid to lose sales if they get too musically adverturous like their mid/late 60's true jazz albums. Their 70's albums like this are partly to blame for today's smooth jazz... in other words, not really jazz, not really funky, just kind of smooth groovin, more for casual adults and offices. not challenging, not offensive, formulated to an extent. But hey if you like this, that's cool, just dont think it's real jazz, or real funk. It's smooth and casual, slightly simmers, pleasant background music, but doesn't COOK like so many other groups from the same time period that mixed jazz, funk, and fusion. It just sounds like they are holding back...I know they can play more advanced, and write more creatively, they just choose not to ever since the 60's 
 Hi, I recently bought this game guide hoping that it would help me get all the achievements on the xbox360 version... I was wrong... this guide is a base guide for all systems... so it's really not helpful in what i am looking for.... as far as game guides go... everyone might want to stick with brady game guide 
 When the character who is narrating a lengthy novel is as unbelievable and artificial as Hannah Musgrave is in "The Darling", the book is not worthy of completing.    
 I was recommended this movie by a friend here at college, and because he spoke so highly of it, I thought I would just buy it instead of rent it. I definitely regret that decision. If you're thinking of buying it - rent it first. It was dull and obnoxious, not to mention weird. The only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate (which is why I gave it 1 star instead of 0). However, if you're still interested, definitely rent it, you might enjoy it. 
 This novel is neither a love story nor a story about Titanic. Don't be misled if that's why you want to read this story. What it is, is the tale of a 12 year old boy struggling with the confusing and conflicting feelings which the onset of puberty brings. Unfortunately, this is a poor choice of narrator for a tale of the tragic ship. Sumner Jordan, is so wrapped up in his own feelings and fantasy love story, the object of his affection is a 21 year-old suffragist, that he is neither observant about his surroundings, nor perceptive about the feelings of the famous and fictional characters he meets. Worse, he complains about everything. So much so that when he is going through his crises, instead of feeling sympathy, you just wish he'd deal with it and keep quiet. Sumner is also hard to believe as a 12 year-old boy. Especially at the beginning of the book, the voice is more that of a girl.  A major problem with the story is the lack of character development. You never get to know enough about any of the characters to really care about their fates. During the sinking, the life and death decisions are made so quickly, little suspense is generated. If you collect Titanic literature, by all means, add this to your collection. If you are looking for greater insight into the disaster, look somewhere else 
 For one, this is a picture book with captions allegedly written by Ted Williams but certainly ghostwritten.  Two, although there are a few new Williams photos that appear to come from his own private collection, Williams himself has stated that he lost almost everything of this nature in a hurricane years ago - most of the photos in this book have appeared in one or more of the illustrated Williams books that have already appeared.  Three, the reprint quality of many of the pictures is sub-par; better versions appear in other books. Four, given Williams' recent debilitating illness, there is something a little weird about bringing out a book like this at this time.  That being said, if you absolutely have to have everything that has Ted Williams' name on it, get this book,but only if you already have everything else.  Otherwise, start your collection elsewhere 
 This book was silly and read like a poorly done self-analysis. Some facts and dates might have been useful as opposed to starting with a thought, back tracking to something else, then fast forwarding to something else. Writing about Christ's mother's *passion* without reverence was the last straw. Read this and enter the 'throw this book against the wall club. 
 Not since St. Augustine has there been such a whining, carping screed begging for Christian inculcation by a celebrated intellect. I'm not even sure why this is a book. A cranky letter to the dean, and president of the alumni association would have served his purpose, and saved a few trees as well.   Without going into detail, or needing to, you will find in a nutshell that Mr. Buckley feels it's fine for Yale faculty of faith to gently shepherd students toward Christian beliefs within their science and math classes, but it's a sin for the other, heathen, atheistic masters, to rampage through the clay of young minds and, in one semester, destroy the fragile faith of 18 to 20 years of Christian indoctrination. Pu-leese!  I'll grant you he was only 25, and at that time standing up for one's individual ideals was new, but why is it still in print!  On the other hand, in today's renewed climate of monkey-brained hysteria in the classroom perhaps it might seem to be time to dig up an old reactionary guru or two for validation. In fact, soon I wouldn't be surprised to hear that some addlebrained congressman was trying to pass a law mandating the teaching of Buckleism in schools.  Cool book title though!  
 Gage was an early feminist, and this is her polemic, written in 1893, showing how religion, the law, and male-dominated custom oppressed/s women. She is fierce in her criticisms--and stony cold. Reading it is like being whipped with a stick. Perhaps this is a good thing overall, but I found her approach way too heavy handed 
 Product name is the same but outlook is totally different from the picture on the web. In addition, no "all region code" supportted! I will return it ASAP. 
 Honestly, I'd first like to say that amazon recommended it and I stupidly took the recommendation. I'll never do that again. Secondly, even though I freely admit to loathing cheesy romance novels such as this, this book is not even well written. Every few pages the author rehashed the same few paragraphs. I read the book, skipping paragraphs that looked familiar..I know I skipped at least 70 of its 333 pages. Perhaps Ms. Wilde was getting paid by the word. Surely that is the only excuse for such poor writing 
 I have just finished this lengthy and mundane tome. 564 pages of this author's ponderous personal philosophy,  gratuitous sexual dysfunction, constant and maddeningly self ingratiating referrals to classical music and composers, discussions on all the authors that ever walked the earth, and when finished with all the above, a good little story that could have been written with one third the pages.  As if all this were not enough, Styron pulls out every lengthy, obsolete, and arcane word that he can find with which to propel his story along. (One can imagine him, loaded with whiskey--which he freely admits to being his greatest source of inspiration--pouring over every dictionary and thesauras written in an attempt to impress the reader, or, at least the liberal East Coast intelligensia.)The end effect for the reader is a constant slowing of momentum of the narrative, in order to look up a new and confusing word every five minutes. (One does, however, come to learn what "simulacrum" means; he uses the word some 15 or more times throughout this laborious read.)  I will not go into the story, save to mention the three major plot lines: that it is one of about 10,000 treatments of the after effects of concentration camps; a love story about a deeply scarred woman, having endured life in one of the camps, and a mentally deranged man; and a young Southern writer coming to grips with culture shock in Brooklyn--this being Styron, or Stingo, as he endearingly calls himself in the story. In one of the more compelling passages in the book he realizes that he no longer wants to live in the South and turns back to the squalid and sewer like life of New York. Being from the South, and after having slogged through this tedious read, I only wish that he had been belched into the Northeast sooner.       
 Unfortunately I have become used to typos in books.  Although this was a rare occurrence 20 years ago almost every new book has a few.  But this Lawford book has at least one error per page.  Not just spelling, grammatical, and continuity errors but also chronological, factual, and historical.  Chris goes to a jewelry store to buy a "bobble."  Do you think he meant bauble?  He mentions a cat with a "gastronomical" disorder when he clearly means gastrointestinal.  Was there any editing done at all?  Or did the publishers just rush to print with yet another Kennedy book? And there were way too many glimpses of Jackie in the bathroom.  Chris, please show some restraint and have some respect for the dead. The addiction/"recovery" story is old news but having a few Kennedy connections will always sell a book, no matter how badly written 
 Makes many accurate observations about boy behavior and its origins,however,the book leans a little too much toward "feminization" of boys in preventing behavioral problems.This may be the politically-correct way to help boys,but not the productive way or the ethical way 
 I purchase library books for a 200 plus student preschool.  The children may choose their own book each week.  Off the top of my head I know of 8-10 parents that would object to the picture of the fox with a chicken in its mouth.  While I personally did not have a problem with the picture, I have to review it through the eyes of others.   I sent the book back 
 Please do yourself a favor and avoid this book. This is the fourth edition and perhaps the worst introduction to fluid mechanics book ever printed. I am a PhD student and have had many courses in fluids. This book is riddled with errors and mistakes. The theory is correct but the derivations of certain equations and the solutions to many, many, many problems are wrong! I cannot believe these errors have survived to the 4th edition. Another reason to avoid this book is because the solutions provided with instructors make great leaps in solving problems. Many of the solutions state "this problem requires a laborious derivation and is much too hard to solve" or something to that effect! I also assist in teaching many intro fluids classes and this makes life miserable. Please use the 5th edition (or any other fluids book for that matter. 
 Although Anne made some excellent points, it was still one-sided. She still speaks of Republicans in general as being better which is wrong because many of them are just as hypocritical as Democrats (and some are worse because they know what God commands but don't actually care), and although she gives some explanations as to why Republicans are the better party, they are deceptive and wrong.  For example that Republicans are better because they promote Chrisitianity and are specific in their arguments: yes, that is true in some ways, however many promote false Christianity and make it look bad because many of them are not truly Christians but putting up a show. That needs to be said otherwise people get the impression often that all Christians are hypocrites and that it's all about financial gain or vain glory. And merely having a specific argument doesn't make an argument better. For example I can say, "Democrats are out to get your kids and the poor because they want to raise taxes on the poor and give tax cuts to the rich and want to force children to learn white wash" but so called Republicans like George Bush want to do that too and have done that.  I would like to say that this is a good book to give to a young girl, because it shows you can still be fememine, wise, and a Christian, and yet not be a fool or knowledgeable and emotionally immature (in other words a nerd), but it has too many big errors.  It's helpful howewver for everyone in general who wants to know what is wrong with some type of arguing and how to argue constructively. Although she doesn't give a thorough explanation on that subject, it's very good and concise. And I just happened to be comforted by her words because the day before had been attacked with vagueries by a pastor from an AOG church 
 Brian Hinton's Both Sides Now is a complete disaster.  What could have been a promising biography of Mitchell is instead a garbled mess.  Indeed, Hinton's text is relatively void of biographical information.  Rather,  Hinton relies on a handfull of interviews published of Mitchell's, and he  quotes from them in such large chunks that the reader would be the wiser to  check out the interviews from their sources.  Following a brief, and  flawed, biographical section, Hinton uses the rest of the text as a forum  for his interpretations of Mitchell's work.  Album by album, song by song,  Hinton gives his own personal commentary on Mitchell's music so that the  text ends up reading like a diary of Hinton's own personal reflections.   Moreover, Hinton's analysis of Mitchell's songs are sometimes so off-base  and confusing that the reader is left wondering how he comes to these  conclusions.  Finally, his constant personal comments in the text make it  seen like nothing more than a high school writing assignment 
 If you are looking for a great story that will really drag you into it, don't read this book.  Lord help me I thought I would go crazy and only got through the first three chapters.  There is not an ounce of structure to this.  It's just a bunch of thoughts and "reports" of sightings of UFO's, "mothmen" and other oddities.  I'm not sure if Keel intended for this to be a re-telling of things he believed really happened or if he honestly thought he was writing a novel.  I can't take anymore, I give up and usually I'll read just about anything all the way through to give it a fair chance.  All of these little scraps of sitings in no order whatsoever make me say... So what?!?!?!? 
 I heard about this book and thought, "OH I'm from the South and this book will be lovely to read to find out about how things used to be." And I would probably have been right if I could have made out what they were talking about. The slang is much too thick for me. I'm not sure anyone could understand it except people who actually are from this region. Thumbs down for no translation 
 While I jumped into the character sporadically (I think this is the second one I read with him as the main character) it flowed fast and his smart remarks I always find humorous.  While the plot is quite weak and I actually guessed part of it, it was a fun read.  It went quick and should have built more into the red herring that the cover leads you to believe.  Even the school principal lacked some Ooommmph if you know what I mean.  The grandmother was a good role, but the parents coud have been much more important.  So overall, let's call it a quick read, funny and enjoyable, but not one of his best.  I picked it up at the airport and read it on the very same trip.  Not one I would keep, so back it went with the 50% return offer the airport here has 
 right the people i work with love this band and album so really i was pressured into buying this album..so i bought and i thought i was going to be blown away due to the hype from my friends but in reality this sucks more than the mudvayne album i've just reviewed terrible distorted guitars bad production off key singing, half baked lyrics the only good thing is the cover and maybe one of the singles are vaguely average apart from that the rest sucks...don't be fooled by the hype by the press this band sucks so will babyshamble 
 I tried this diet and it didn't work for me. Also, the daily meal preparation was a challenge at best, and many questions were not addressed or anticpated in the book. Even though I enjoyed the recipees, I was exhausted after a week of meal planning.I respect Dr katz very much normally, but this was, in the end, a recipee book 
 These are old Disney shows from 2 series.  I saw then on the late-night "Vault Disney" series.  They were well done and interesting.  The only problem is that this DVD is only a few (6 total) of the 18 shows.  So although I would rate the shows as a 4 or 5, this release gets 1 star for being incomplete.  Save your money for if and when the whole series comes out 
 I know H. James is considered one of the "Greats" of American literature and I question my taste for hating most of his writing.  With few exceptions I think he is  a pretentious purveyor of obscurantism.  I read Wings of the Dove many years ago in the days when I would not allow myself to set aside books I did not enjoy.  I recently picked up a collection of his short stories and remembered why I disliked him so much.  Now in my old age I had no pangs of conscience when I happily closed the book before finishing it.  If more of the stories had been like Daisy Miller I would have proceeded further but unfortunately much of the writing reminded me of Wings.  I am currently seeking  relief from Henry's turgid prose by reading Hemingway.  I'd trade in a Henry  for an Ernie any day.  It's also difficult to like Mr. James' snobbish, shallow and unsympathetic characters.  The more sympathetic ones were obscured by his heavy hand and my impatience with his style.        
 If you are looking for a book that gives meanings behind the names don't buy this book.  It only gives the author's opinion on the name or a list of famous people who share the name.  I also find that is does not have a good selection of names.  For example, it lists the name Torquil(which I have never heard of) but does not have the name Travis, and the book even mentions the name Travis in an opinion on another name.  I find it opinionated and poorly written 
 I have been trying to order this from Amazon since October 2005. Twice now they have delayed and delayed the delivery for months only to finally cancel the order. They clearly do not have access to this book 
 Ok, i was going to go to the Warped tour, but i decided against it.  Warped Tour has become too commercial, jamming together mostly emo and screamo bands for their shows.  Since when are emo bands punk?  It's just loud, whiny pop music to me.  One day, emo will die and maybe the promoters just might book some real good bands for the show.  Until then, this is what we have to put up with.  However, major kudos for Big D and the Kids Table, i love them, they're an amazing ska band, and if you're reading this you should check them out.  There are few good bands on this cd really though 
  i have to say i love cheryl lynn this album is great  but it's missing some very good song's she did a tune for the 1985 movie called heavenly bodies the song at last you're mine is an excellant track it peaked at #34 for a whole 10 weeks so i agree with the previous comment and the song fidelity so in order to be called a greatest hits all the song's should be in joel whitburns top r&b boo 
 Simple ideas.  Was not very useful for my work environment. I was looking for something that was a little different or unusual that we haven't tried 
 what's going on? what's the problem with people who consume such common sense useless material like this 
 This guy blathers on about how science should be approached from a neutral perspective with an opened mind and without preconceptions.  Fine. Nothing wrong with that. But then he totally contradicts himself by proposing that the basis of scientific investigation should be the supernatural beliefs of one particular Christian sect.  I think aliens came here in UFOS and populated planet earth. They used special ray guns that turned animals into rocks and that's where fossils came from.  Fossils exists don't they?  So there's proof of my alien theory.  It makes just as much sense as "intelligent design".  Hey, the aliens were the "intelligent designers".  That makes sense to me and I have just as much evidence for it as creationist/IDers do for what they propose. I want that taught in schools too. 
 The goals of the book area laudable but I find it very frustrating to read.  The diet directions are very general and scattered; they seem very unorganized.  I found a lot of contradictory information such as a quote from a doctor saying it's impossible to loose more than a pond of fat in a week and then 2 or 3 pages later several testimonials as to how people lost more than 2 pounds of "weight" in a week (averaged)on Null's diet: well which is it?  Also, he recommends eating with canola oil (a Frankenfood type product). There were other concerns but I do not have the book in front of me.  He seems to make many claims without telling you why it is so.  While reading the book I wondered if someone made a fake copy and I was reading it.  I expected so much more from this book.  However, overall I see it for the good it is trying to accomplish and still recommend the book: I just do not see it as very "solid" in instruction.  I  wish it was better formatted as to how to do what he says.  It basically recommends a vegetarian diet and more live foods (vegetable, fruits,sprouts,lentils) while cutting out dairy/wheat.  I found the recipes to be very odd mixes.  I got a few ideas from it but they are "weak as water" recipes.  It is neat that he recommends getting a balance not only in the diet, but also in the home environment, emotional, physical, and spiritual.  I may need to read it twice 
 The amazing part of this tragedy is that Shilits was a frequent visitor to the baths he condemns in this book even after knowing he was infected and thus infected countless other humans, directly or indirectly.  This book is good only if you view it as an example of someone blaming someone else for your own destructive behavior. While this book has become a major read for those who are into "victimhood" the sad truth is that Shilts is far more guilty than any of those he condemns in this book because he was the one who transmitted the virus, not the owners of the baths he paid money to in order to have his night of fun and ultimate death.  Shilts was sick in more ways than one when he wrote this and deserves condemnation rather than praise. Good night, killer.  
 After slogging all the way through this book, I came to Amazon, expecting to see a low rating. I am surprised to see that it has 4.5 stars (as of when I'm writing this review) and a lot of positive comments.  On the plus side, the author did take some interesting ideas and combine them in a way that makes sense. I don't mind the hours I spent reading this book because at least it made me think about a couple of things I hadn't realized before.  But on the other hand... there are really only a few important concepts in this book, and you can see what they are by reading a couple of the longer reviews here (like Coert Visser's or the one from "Dr. Professor Hossein Arsham." There's no need to read the whole thing unless you want to hear those same concepts explained over and over again 
 I give this book one star as there was nothing lower to choose from.  Save your money.  This book is not worth either your time or your money.  Was she on drugs during the writing of this piece of tripe?  
 This is a fairly helpful book for those born before the '70s-- a time when "a yarn" wasn't an archaic term. Does it give some helpful hints?  Sure, there's the obvious ones like show don't tell and all characters have free will. But fiction has changed a lot since Henry James (thankfully), and this book might be better left unread. Plus, I don't buy the "only people who aren't well-read don't like it" argument. I've read nearly all the books mentioned and I still wish I never bought this book 
 With the title you expected to become more "literate" on the worlds religions.  With the exception of the last chapter where the auther tried to sum up religions (well, those that aren't Christianity based) in about a paragraph and tries to define terms used by those religions in about 2-3 sentances.  The auther will however go into 7+ parapraph descriptions of every sect of Christianity.  The author makes a good point about needing to teach RELIGION in public schools, but the first 4 chapters (only 6 in the book) are mindless bible thumping dribble about how great it was when Christians ruled public schools.  This author describes history of other religions, but goes into great lenghths do portray theology of Christianity.  This book was quite horrific and I made myself finnish it, hoping that I would learn something from the final chapter (I did not).  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE THAT WANT'S TO LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT RELIGIONS, other than the "traumatic" downfall of Christian influence in public schools.  The only thing I can say is, I'm glad I'm done with this book, and unfortunatly it has to sit on my shelf 
 This book is a total let-down. It offers extremely limited information on all places worth seeing. The JR lines may be given but are not including the new Kyushu Shinkansen line and many new or discontinued stations.  Also, as other folks pointed out, the private railways are not mentioned. A superb trainplanner in conjunction with Rough Guide or Lonley Planet would be Jorudan. Jorudan in an online travel planner for Japanese public transport and airlines. They have an excellent guide with up to date initiary data for all your trips in Japan. If you are not a US national, you may want to avoid onley Planet aswell, as it is verry clearly aimed at and written by US nationals 
 Ms. Headley really does seem to be just thrilled with herself.  That's fine, but I was far too bored with her life to want to keep reading 
 Hey Noam, I was wondering if it worked the other way too?  If you tell enough lies about things, manufacture evidence, cite sources that are dubious at best and then sell them to your unwitting disciples do you manufacture dissent for the things that get in the way of your political ideology like truth, facts, common sense, and reality?   A falsehood well footnoted is still a falsehood.  Anyone that reads Noam Chomsky should also read the Anti-Chomsky Reader.  This man is an extremist political ideologue that is hell bent on spreading his anti-American and anti-Israeli hate messages.  Noam's motto is if you manufacture a lie and tell it in countless boring pseudo books enough times people will believe it.  Sorry Noam I took a pill called reality when I was growing up and it immunized me from the likes of you, Michael Moore and whoever else sells your drivel.  While you Rage against the Machine, I and others like me, Rage against the Morons.  For those of you that blindly utter that Chomsky is the most cited reference on the planet I counter that McDonalds is the worlds largest restaurant on the planet.  Over indulgence in one can lead to poor physical health, sampling at any level in the other leads to disastrous results in one's mental health.  Like smoking, there is no safe level of exposure to Noam.  At least McDonalds can claim that their products taste good.  Neither's claim is generally a good reflection on society as a whole.  I was just wondering about this statistic's validity.  Is this scientifically documented or is it pop myth like everything else Chomsky writes.  Does the statistic include Chomsky citing his own opinions from one book and then presenting them as established facts in another?  Noam would interview 1000 people that witnessed an event. If 999 said things happened one way with only one dissenter Noam would discount, ignore, or attack the 999 and present the 1 as the established version if it fit with Noam's agenda. 
 It's great that Dr. Weil recommends that we get fresh air, exercise, eat lots of vegetables, avoid fast food hamburgers,  breathe and think positive healing thoughts.  But that's the extent of his good advice.  He also gives some very bad advice that is effectively shredded in 2 new books that have come out.  "The Whole Soy Story" by Kaayla Daniel and "The Fluoride Deception" by Chris Bryson.  Between soy and fluoride you'll have a wiped out thyroid in 8 weeks (+ or -) and that doesn't bring optimum health.      
 This is a very weak book.  It contains nothing but disjoint, pointless tidbits of info.  There is little logical flow. Because of this it isn't suitable for beginners. Because of its basic nature, it isn't suited for non-beginners.  If you're a beginner looking to learn to play, look elsewhere.  If your an advanced beginner and you want something to doink with, this may be ok for you.  "Blues You Can Use" is a *far* better guide for the advanced beginner who wants to be able to play something 
 This movie is not worth Sam Elliot.  I was very dissapointed, I will most likely thow it away 
 lack of talent leads to jealousy that inspired the author to create his "theories". 
 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's basically a movie about 3 kids who grew up together only one was emotionally scarred for life as a child. As they grow up they all go their seperate ways until another horrific event brings them all together again for one more sad, unsettling experience together. Does anyone grow or learn anything? No. Do the "bad guys" pay? No. It is difficult for me to say just how much this movie sucks without giving away the ending. Suffice to say that no one wins, innocent people get screwed over, and in the end - no one really learns anything. It's a thoroughly depressing movie with no point - unless the point is that life sucks. As if viewers don't have enough of their own problems, or as if real life isn't traumatizing enough - we are subjected to this horrible 2 1/2 hours of misery. I am not exaggerating - there is no redeeming value to this movie. Sure the acting is great, but what good is it with such a tragic story. And this is not like a Greek Tragedy or Shakespeare Tragedy - there are no heroes, no lessons to be learned, no moral to the story - it just makes you feel miserable and hollow and then nothing - just the credits rolling. This movie is so terrible that I would rather watch "Kazaam" than watch this again 
 I bought this recharger kit specifically for a Sandisk m230 mp3 player.  When I first received the kit, I charged all of the batteries.  Upon first use I only got 7min. out of each battery, when I got 20 hrs. from the batter sent with the player.  I learned online that the batteries still have their charge, but due to the battery's "memory effect" or "voltage depression," my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min.    If you are buying batteries for an electronic device that detects how much "juice" is left in a battery, do not buy this kit 
 the book started out really strong. stories (vignettes/chapters/whatever) about her childhood and crap that happened to her. not like, abuse, but seeing a fat girl at summer camp receive head--stuff like that.  and then it degenerated into a mommy blog.  i can't get pregnant. blah infertility. blah we're pregnant. blah we went on vacation and my son doesn't love the boob. blah he loves it again.  frankly, i don't care.  interspersed with the baby crap, there were some stories about her grandma and her alzheimers. those were good.  i could have done with a lot more grandma stories or childhood stories and a lot less about pregnancy and having a kid.  the stuff that wasn't baby related was really good though 
 I love this movie! It is so incredibly stupid and funny. It is absolutely ridiculous and slightly crass. The grinch and the whos look like a bunch of clowns. The film was predictable and completely ripped off from the animated TV special. This isn't as stupid as Barney, because at least the makers of this film actually tried to be funny, rather than just childish and retarded. This film has gotten a lot of mixed reviews on amazon.com, so be sure to rent it before you buy it. 
 I am a fan of Coetzee and have read many of his previous works and loved them.  Disgrace is one of my all-time favourites but this one left me feeling cheated.  The book began with promise and I loved his characterizations of Paul and Marijana but with the introduction of the mysteriour Elizabeth, the book began to spiral downward and didn't bounce back.  I had to struggle to finish it and felt let down.  I wouldn't recommend this for my book group, which is why I wanted to read it.  We loved discussing his other works.   Maybe I wasn't in the mood to delve into the inner psyches of the characters but this one left me cold 
 Because Hinton's is the first Joni Mitchell biography I've digested, I was hoping for something that didn't leave a cheap, plastic taste in my mouth.  The known parts of her life that are inspiring to me were reduced to banal fodder mentioned in passing, while darker aspects became reasons for the author to step up to her vehement defense--these outbursts were nauseating and usually at the expense of someone else, leaving many questions largely unresolved.  Hinton tends to shuffle back and forth between regurgitation of objective fact and jarring personal opinion.  Incidentally, I like what one reviewer said about this book reading "like a last-minute book report".  The fact that he completely destroys my favorite JM album in his woefully amaturish musical critiques doesn't help either.  This book does not do justice to an artist such as Mitchell 
 First off I belive that this would have been better if written by Greg Cox. Mr Hanna has probably only seen about 2 minutes of an episode because in this book he makes Sydney seem weak (which we all know she is not), He didn't really give the main Charater much to do since she had was injured and what got on my nerves the most was that he had Sydney call Vaughn "Michael" (which she NEVER does) and has people call Dixon "Marcus". For a second when I was reading the book I had to think of who this "Marcus" was. So overall this is a book that you can skip. You won't be missing anything.   
 A rambling, self-obsessed, horrendously written bore. If you don't know any obnoxious NY princesses, and you are simply desperate to feel like you're at a really bad party, monopolized by a self-absorbed narcissist, you will find your own personal ring of hell with this book!! Otherwise, steer clear! 
    The fact is that Hollywood has become little more then a Gossip new town with magazines like variety and web-sites like Ain't It Cool and DARk Horizons putting out tons and tons of both electronic and newsprint propoganda that is as fake as anything we saw the superpowers do during the  Cold War.    This book seems to celebrate it, but it's eally sad, All three movies listed on the 2003 summer weekend were large on visual effects or glamor, but weak scripts and even weaker casting of people who can not act.   How anyone can see this as a good thing is beyound all rational thought to me, or good taste 
 This book did not work for me. I believe that natural chemistry and relating to one another are the hallmarks of a mutual and intimate relationship. In this book, the author, rather than helping readers open themselves up to intimacy and be themselves, presents tricks on how to attract the opposite sex. Personally, I'm not looking to 'trick' anyone into going out with me or fall in love. How I open a car door for a woman or how she should or should not reach over to unlock the door for me as I'm walking around after I've opened the car door for her feels like protocol designed to play 'the game' properly. I don't feel that it's a game. It's about being true to ourselves. It's about relating - being best friends. And we are not peacocks - displaying our feathers at such a time and presenting at a certain time. We are empowered with language. I'm more partial to books that explore the similarities between men and women rather than the differences as Gray does. Authors that I recommend are Charlotte Kasl, John Welwood and John Stoltenberg. Good luck! 
 A joke that swept through The University of Texas a long time ago:  A freshman physics teacher at Texas A&M asked his class to name the greatest invention of all times.  One student said fire.  Another said gunpowder.  Another said the internal combustion engine.  Then a Texas A&M football player on the front row said, "The thermos bottle."  When asked by the teacher why he would pick that as the greatest invention, the student said, "You put something hot in it and it stays hot.  You put something cold in it and it stays cold."  The teacher asked why that made it great, and the student replied, "How do it know which to do?"  That thermos bottle is in this book in the form of a magic (indistinguishable from magic) sphere.  I liked the first book, in spite of its "magical" science.  This novel seemed like a shaggy dog story leading to the thermos bottle.  Much ado about little 
 This is the dumbest, most predictable, horrible waste of time i've ever ever seen.  This movie tried very very hard to be funny and simply wasn't.  It took a pretty good idea and butchered it by cliche jokes and feel good high school humor that's supposed to encourage all of us angsty youngings to go to europe, drink, and copulate with any random gorgious blonde that happens to walk past us.  After watching this movie I felt incredible stupid and regret being apart of a culture that could make such main stream trash.  my only hope is that our european friends didn't seen this for it would most certainly cause an international incident 
 I would have been fascinated to read a comparison of how Protestants are treated in, say, Italy, Spain, Portugal or France.  What's that you say?  There Are no Protestants in those countries!?  They were tortured, murdered, driven out of their homelands or forced to convert to Catholicism many centuries ago!?  Wow.  I guess in comparison, American Catholics should consider themselves extremely lucky to be allowed to immigrate to a land founded by Protestants, to practice their faith, to get rich if they work hard, and to share every freedom that people of other denominations enjoy.  And, being so grateful for this freedom, I have no doubt that they all work hard to ensure that Protestants in Catholic countries have the same rights and privileges, right?  uh... Right 
 Now when I say boring I don't mean it isn't realistic I have no doubt that women do talk this much about sex when there alone but since they all seem so unlikable (with the exception of Olivia D'Abo who plays the lover of one of the women who reunite in this film), I didn't care about what happen to them. Matter of fact, I would be so happy if something bad happen 
 It seems many reviews discuss this book through the prism of their politics, as opposed to reviewing it _as a book_.  As a book, I was quite disappointed. Firstly, a good half of the book is taken up with the PRE-war planning on invading Iraq, rehashing material presented (much better) in Woodward's or Clark's books.  When we finally get to the post-invasion planning, the book suffers from a fatal flaw - the author's own axe-grinding. The author was a principal on the multi-agency project, led as I remember out of the State Department, which compiled a long set of guides for how the reconstruction should go. In one of the more notable (but already known) failures, these guides were discarded by the Bush administration, as the authors were viewed as too "soft". OK, fine. However, the author harps on this over and over and over. Over and over, the book reads like this: "So then Bremer made this decision, which turned out wrong. We told you so.".  This is also weakened by the fact that the authors recommendation is virtually _always_ "form a multi-sided commission to study the issue" - not exactly gripping reading. Frankly, I can see why more action-minded minds might have started to ignore the author and his comission - sometimes multi-sided comissions are not the right answer!  The blurb for the book gives the impression that the author was a "True believer" (one of Rice's friends, etc.) who became disullusioned over time. This may be true, but the book is written instead with the advantage of 20/20 hindsight - the author's recommendations were always right, Bremer's/Cheney's always wrong, according to the book. Not only does this strain credulity, but it made this a rather unenlightening read for me - i would have been much more interested in something that discussed how the planning _evolved_, rather than the litany of "we told you so's" that this book presents. 
 Specifically, you'd have thought that Russell and Corrine Calloway would've learned from what happened to them in the aftermath of the Stock Market Crash of 1987 (chronicled in "Brightness Falls").  Nah...they're still the shallow, selfish, self-absorbed people they were 14 years before.  The trouble is, you can't really tell whether McInerney thinks that's a good thing or a bad thing. 
 With little to no warning on the CD package, this CD is 100% concert performances.  There is not one original recording in the whole thing.  For a seasoned Bobby Darin fan, that may be just fine.  But for people who are new to Bobby Darin (or any musician for that matter), you should never begin with concert performances, but with original recordings.  That way the listener can get a feel for the singer and his songs.  I wish I had done a little more homework before buying ACES BACK TO BACK.  I wish I had purchased a Bobby Darin CD which featured only Bobby Darin, singing the songs he is best known for (although those songs are featured on this CD) and singing them the way he is best known for 
 Let me begin by saying that I appreaciate Mr. Rouse's attempt to create a very readable version of the Iliad.  I too wish more people read the classics.  However, I think he has inadvertantly destoyed the epic nature of the poem.  This is THE original epic poem, one that has inspired numerous authors throughout the ages.  When I read this poem, I want epic language to go with the epic proportions of the poem.  Rouse's version does not have epic language.  By modernizing the language, he takes away from the epic nature of the poem.  Traditional translations open with the line "Sing, O goddess, of the perilous wrath of Achilles son of Peleus, the accursed wrath which cast a myriad of pain upon the Achaeans and sent forth many noble souls of heroes to Hades."  Rouse's version opens "An angry man--there is my story:  the bitter rancour of Achilles, prince of the house of Peleus, which brought a thousand troubles upon the Achain host."  I think you can see what I mean by a lack of the epic language.  If you wish for a good modernized version of the story, then this is the translation for you.  However, I think you will lose part of the story by reading a modernized version.  Overall grade:  C 
 I've been through FOUR of these expensive units. They work great on my Great Pyrenees dog. At least they work for awhile. Then I end up trying to figure out if the batteries are dead, then if the NEW batteries I put in were dead to begin with, and then I send it back for repair. Once I got back a unit that worked again - for awhile. Then I got back a unit that never worked again.I stopped sending in my broken units after that.  So - in desperation, and impending poverty, I switched to a shock collar; it was either that or what my breeder calls a "blue juice special". It also worked - and yes, I tried it on myself and decided that it wasn't cruel at all. But the punchline is this: the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar. At least they were cheaper, so I didn't lose as much money 
 In desperate need of a light read and curious about the multi-author approach used with this novel, I dove into "Naked Came The Manatee" with anticipation of the fun and excitement typical of Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiassen writing.  The story unravels the mystery behind two heads, both with a great similarity to Fidel Castro that are lost in transport from Florida to Cuba.  Each of the thirteen authors writes a chapter of the novel, with Hiassen and Leonard attempting to pull the story together in the final chapters.  The characters are odd and criminally inept as most characters in Hiassen's and Leonard's writing but the story is underdeveloped and lacks the immediacy of a great crime mystery.  If you have nothing else to read and this book happens to be within reach give it a try. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed 
 I bought this power mop for my daughter for Christmas, and it broke the first time she used it 
 This is the second book I have decided to review. I have decided to do so inorder that others may avoid my mistake. The book is banal. It goes on and on, creating category after category of needless taxonomies. Nothing even slightly new or interesting. Additionally it suffer the problem of all "internet" books. It was hoplessly outdated by the ime it hit thw shelves. Someone exceptionaly tiresome wrote a phd thesis, invented jargon and then decided to turn it into a book.  
 If you like Zakk Wylde's work with Ozzy, then don't spend your money on this garbage for it will forever tarnish the image of the guitarist for you.  This is just ultra-sloppy, unoriginal metal.  Guitar solos are pretty much absent, and most of the songs sound the same.  I'm pretty sure Mr. Wylde was actually drinking black label when he wrote and recorded this.  He put out *3* solid albums with Ozzy, and unfortunately, that will be the high point of his career 
  I reluctantly bought this phone because my Kyocera Slider suddenly died on me conveniently 3 months after VM's warranty was up and i had just purchased a $20 phone card + had airtime credits which were not refundable.   Now i am not a teen and my phone and things do not receive harsh treatment.My kyocera slider actually looked like new when it died with no scratches what-so-ever so i was pretty upset.After multiple calls and 2 emails to VM it was pretty clear they weren't going to do anything to help.        I was offered a replacement slider at $20.Obviously I didn't want the same one that could possibly die on me after a couple of months so like i was saying I had no other recourse but to purchase this Audiovox 8610.By the way AFTER I PURCHASED THE PHONE AT A LOCAL STORE IN TOWN (when i called to activate the phone)they have the nerve to tell me that I could've purchased the same 8610 from them at a discount price of $24.99 because the slider died.The f!@%ng idiots!HELLO COULD YA NOT HAVE TOLD ME SOONER???and after i spent $50 + tax.sheesh!    Anyway back to the phone review..the ringer is indeed low as others have reported here.Its so low that if its in my purse i can't even hear it! WTF??? Also the battery life sucks, no sooner does the thing ring and the batteries at half.It also doesnt get good service with the VM/Sprint network, my slider had xcellent service w/it despite everything and rarely if ever dropped calls.        So I've had it 5 days and I'm considering attempting to bring it back where I purchased it from.However i don't want to buy an expensive phone from VM because I'm seriously reconsidering continuing w/them.   The way I see it VM leaves alot to be desired with the quality of phones they sell + they are expensive.I am a lite user but if you talk slightly more than usual you end up feeling it wallet- wise.Prior to these issues I was a happy VM customer but not anymore.   
 There are some excellent stories and writers included, but the introduction to the book, its arrangement, the selections make it  disappointing. There are so many authors who should be here who aren't and  others who shouldn't who are. These Gillans are a one-note team. Always  harping on the same theme in an overdone way. Multicultural literature is a  great idea, but the Gillans are always reiterating the same note and tone.  One wants to say, "Get off it!" The stories individually would  have more impact if not a part of this collection. They need to breathe on  their own. This collectiont suffocates its own contents to death. I'm  sixty-seven and an immigrant myself, but I've read enormously, [though the  age marker on this review form is broken and makes everyone 12 or under. I  have to say this here, but you can cut the parenthesis. 
 I am black American and have combination hair...nappy, wavy and straight.  I've been using drug store relaxers for over 30 years (Crème of Nature, TCB, Dark & Lovely, Revlon Realistic) whatever is "on sale" with satisfying results.   These products leave my hair evenly straight and shiny but hard and stiff immediately after the process.  I usually wash my hair after a few days (I like to give it a rest after relaxing) and use a good conditioner to soften and detangle.  From there I am able to go about 12 weeks before having to retouch.  In general my hair is healthy and responds well to straightners.  My biggest expense is with conditioning products to maintain my hair.  I'll try anything and spend any amount if it works well on my hair.  I have great success with Frederic Fekkai products and love Phytodefrisant Botanical Hair Relaxing Balm...this stuff is amazing if you like to wash and go (air dry) and it works wonders with blow drying/flat ironing too.  (Bumble and Bumble Styling Spray is another amazing product for great flat ironing results.)  I forked out $60 to try Phtyo2 after reading all the rave reviews.  I am satisfied with the outcome but not blown away.  Yes, Phyto2 did not smell bad, it did not burn my scalp and it did straighten my hair but no better than Dark and Lovely or TCB, and my hair was still hard and stiff afterward.  It has been several weeks and my hair is doing great, but again no different from when I use Dark & Lovely.  I guess I am lucky that my hair responds well to ANY type of relaxer so I doubt I'll be spending another $60 for Phyto2...I'd rather buy two tubes of Phytodefrisant Balm and continue to with my $7.99 drug store brands.  I hope this helps someone with similar hair as mine.  If you do well with drug store brands, Phyto results are not that different...spend the money on their other products that nourish and condition your hair 
 There are many good things to say about Mr. McWhorter's book. Manty other reviewers have done that.  I want to add a warning.  Mr. McWhorter's book is about the theory of language dynamics.  It is not about any particular language, culture, people, place, or time.  Mr. McWhorter explains the processes that cause languages to change over time.  He does a remarkably good job of this.  However, he makes references to actual languages and actual statements only as they serve to illustrate changes over time.  If you are looking for some understanding of some particular language at some particular time, you will sadly agree with me that this book constantly changes the topic.  If there is a sustained discussion of one language for more than ten pages, then I cannot find it.  I must admit that I could not finish the book, after several tries.  The subtitle should be removed from the book.  This book is not a history of languages.  It is an excellent exposition for the general reader of the dynamic forces behind language change.  However, it contains nothing about any particular language 
 The answer is a big NO!  After the first 15 minutes of this movie, which don't get me wrong were quite awesome, the movie completely tanks at all levels. The movie was set in a mall, but did they use the mall to help them in any aspect of survival, NO! I read an interview with the Director of this movie, and when asked about setting the movie in a mall, the director said that the mall was just a location and any other location would have worked just as fine.  Now look, when you're using the title, "Dawn of the Dead", you better remake it great, I mean really great.  The followers of Romero do not hand out free passes as easily as the GP.  You know, I might not have had that big of a problem with this movie if the title were different.  Definately not when the same.  If you want to see really good Zombie movies, watch the original Romero trilogy, 28 Days Later, the Lucio Fulci trilogy, or even the Return of the Living Dead.  Heck, even the Resident Evil movies easily out did this stinker.  Don't waste your time or money 
 To anyone wanting to buy this book for the "true Crime" value , please don't. Other then the shortly described misery Bobby Kent put people through the rest is made up scenerios and untrue accounts. I have had the chance to get to know several people involved and all agree on one thing , the book is full of it.  If this was a fiction book it would be great . If you have already read this book and would like to know the truth or ask questions there is a Yahoo group that may help .  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/freemartypuccio 
 An unreadable book.  Bits and pieces stretched out over 800 pages that never add up to a whole.  To use DeLillo's garbage theme: it was like finding litter on a sidewalk.  Each piece once meant something, but who knows what.    I finished it because I had read so many good reviews that I thought there must be something worthy in it.  Sometimes a book is torture and then everything comes together at the end.  Not in this case.  Torture for 800 pages and then poof! DeLillo tidies everything up in an epilogue.  Nice scenes and nice sentences and BIG ideas don't necessarily make a book a worthwhile read. It was my first DeLillo book and it will probably be my last 
 This is a 12-page promotional piece for Kouzes' and Posner's books and Leadership Practices Inventory, a 30-item questionnaire about leadership, written in the breathy style of business-school literature.  A true non-value.  If you are interested in their work, buy The leadership Challenge (Jossey-Bass, 1997), which has the same editorial tone but at least says something 
 I am a little disappointed in the upgrade to Microsoft Office as it is not user friendly nor is it as accommodating as the earlier version 
 After attending several of mr. Dershowitz's lectures I had expected better.  The dialouge in this book is almost too painful to read.  To think that this book came from the mind of such an eloquent orator.  Mr  Dershowitz should stick to the spoken word 
 This play, mysteriously awarded prizes, must be the most conventional, boring work of the last decade. As at least one reviewer argues, there's nothing fresh here, nothing that transcends the hip soap-operatic. Margulies is the John Grisham or Robert Ludlum of playwrights. He should be writing TV dramas where the absence of philosophical subtext or depth is taken for granted. Only sentimentalists who swoon over problems in "relationships" could take this pabulem seriously. Apparently these days, this includes the Pulitzer Committee. It's good to remember, though, that this Committee, at least in drama awards, is overly fond of the safe and conventional. It prefers toothless works to anything with real bite. It rewards an empty work like "Three Tall Women" but scorns the unnerving "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" No doubt it will continue to reward the forthcoming effusions of the tame Donald Margulies 
 This is not the book to buy if you want tips on how to parent the gifted child. Galbraith wastes time catagorizing different types of "giftedness" and ends each section with a few tips on how to parent. I felt this book was overpriced for the information it contained 
 Okay, someone writes a book to attempt to prove MacDonald innocent.  The writer makes lots of money just as McGinnis did with the first book Fatal Vision(which by the way is more entertaining to read.)  But the facts of the matter are that MacDonald's appeals have all been turned down and every bit of new evidence has been rejected by the courts.  And now his attorneys are trying to get a new trial based on what they say was a threat to MacDonald from a prosecutor.  Sounds like grabbing at straws to me.  The courts decide and they have found him guilty.  Of course there are people who will cling to their belief that he is innocent.  But then there are people who  believe that Scott Peterson is innocent too.  But they're not the courts so it doesn't matter. Skip this book, it's boring and nothing new is spectacularly revealed.  
 Rush Limbaugh - the man most responcible for replacing the biased liberal media with the biased conservative media - giving millions of Americans false hope and dangerous half-truths.  I've had enough of this marketing phenomena known as "conservatism."  They have created a demographic group for the sole purpose of selling books and merchandise.  The anti-Clinton/Moore/Kerry books are the same junk as the anti-Bush/Cheney/Reagan books.  No on is interested in opening their mind  and learning-they simply want to reinforce their own shallow ideas, entertain themselves and feel comfortable in their own little imaginary world.  Forums hosted by so called Conservatives are run in the same close minded ways in which college liberals shout down any guest speaker with whom they disagree.  Meanwhile, the two parties (the only choice the American voter is given) are virtually the same when it comes to the most important issues.  Both parties are taxing and spending, and supporting the illegal invasion of America by Mexicans.  Big business is in bed with big government and they are both getting even richer by selling you books pretending to speak ill of each other.

 I didn't like this book.  Truth be told, I still haven't finished it, and I bought it over six months ago.  The characters are boring; the situation (while ripe with potential) drags; and the recipes don't even sound good.  I am supremely disappointed, as I usually love what Nora Ephron does.  Bummer 
 I'm a big fan of Outlaw and Texas Country, however, still album was not for me.  Hank III is too raw, too basic, and too lacking for me.  However, he does have a very unique sound and style and I can't think of anyone else out there that he sounds like.  Still I'd be cautious about buy this CD and listen to the song samples that Amazon provides 
 Many reviewers compared this novel to Jurassic Park, saying it was a better book than Crichton's. What absurdity. I am not saying that JP is an awesome book, but it was far better than Tyrannosaur Canyon.  Tyrannosaur Canyon is a fairly intriguing story, but poorly executed and VERY poorly ended. It's as though Preston suddenly realized that he was going to have to get his characters out of the predicament he had put them in, and didn't know how to do it. The ending is too fast, too unlikely and too unrealistic.  The book closes with a theistic comment by one of the characters, which I believe is Preston's way of attempting to belong to both camps, having his science AND being religious.  Overall, I had high hopes for this book and I am sorry to say that in the last 100 pages, I was greatly let down  
 Easy exercises for the neophyte, but nothing here to challenge or enlighten someone with some exposure to yoga, tai chi or chi gung. If the term "new age psycho-babble" is in your vocabulary, you are not the type who would appreciate this book 
 Normally I like Nora Roberts, but this book was a very tough read. Callie, the main character, was not likeable whatsoever. She was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth. She did not come across as strong or self-sufficient, just nasty. It was not entertaining, just tiresome. I started skimming towards the end because I just wanted to get through it.    The end was anti-clamatic, didn't really settle the issue of two sets of parents. The last few pages were practically identical to Three Fates, which, incidentally was a great read.         
 Despite generally good experiences with Microsoft products, Windows Live OneCare seems to have resulted in very poor performance on a brand new Lenovo PC running Windows XP.  I removed it and performance has improved back to where it was, now running McAfee for virus scanning etc 
 This film is actually directed by Andrei Konchalovsky, the man who co-wrote the magisterial film Andrei Rublev, one of ANDREI TARKOVSKY's greatest films.  It's hard to believe this man went from writing with one of the greatest Russian directors of all time to directing a B-movie with Stallone and Russell, but there you have it.  How depressing.....  
 I was so disappointed in this book. I found it very hard to believe that Jonathan Kellerman actually wrote this book. I found it downright corny the way Alex Delaware was playing ace detective and kept just happening to be at the right place at the right time. The book seemed to have no "story" to it, as his always do. I got very bored reading one and a half pages of descriptions of what people were wearing, how their hair looked and on and on. I always enjoyed Kellerman's breif descriptions of people and places, but once again, this became downright corny.  I'm glad this was not my first Kellerman book, as I probably wouldn't try another one. I'm a dedicated reader of his and hope that this was just a fluke. Everyone's entitled to one bad book. Hope that was his first and last 
 I usually really enjoy Jayne Ann Krentz and her alter ego Amanda Quick, but I actually returned this one to the library unfinished. I found it boring and the whole dream reader concept to be unbelievable 
 I was expecting at least a degree worth of difference, it did NOT help at all!  Absolute waste of 50 dollars 
 I'd been meaning to read this book for a long time, and I realize that it's considered a "classic", so I was surprised and disappointed when I finally got around to reading it. Basically, Holt describes various situations where children are playing and learning. If I hadn't already observed the same kinds of things with my own children, maybe this would have been enlightening. If you're someone who's spent time with young children, I don't think you'd get much out of this book. Perhaps if you haven't, then it might be interesting. 
  Green has solid Celtic studies credentials and her previous books, like the Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend (Thames and Hudson) were exemplary in terms of quality photographs and helpful bibliography. I therefore had, perhaps unfairly, high expectations for Green's The World of the Druids.  Though there is a fair amount of text on each page, most of the emphasis is on the images and their captions. The captions often reinforce the impression that the non-artifact images created by artists like Gustav Dore and Fuseli are legitimate sources of data about historic druids, when they are at best sources of data about romantic nineteenth century presentation and imaginative views regarding druids.  Much of what Green has to say is speculation, presented as fact or scholarly hypothesis, like her ruminations on druidic prayer: "Druids and their peers would have conducted solemn prayer rituals for the whole tribe or community on important occasions. Lesser priests might lead small communities in prayer, and the head of the household perhaps led private family prayers" (32). Unfortunately, there really isn't a lot of data one way or the other about druid praying in the pre-Christian era. Green makes such assertions without referring to sources or even using the resources of comparative religion as support. There are a number of similar problems.  Green is at her best in The World of the Druids in her discussions of archaeology, and at her worst in discussions of myth and literature. Her chapter on sacred places is particularly well done, but not by itself worth the price of the book. She does include a brief survey of modern druid groups' beliefs and a directory of neo-pagan druid groups, but readers would probably do better to use the web to find Neo-Pagan druid resources since addresses and contact people change so quickly. The gazetteer of Celtic museums in the back of the book is a very useful list, and quite nicely done, though I wish her bibliography had been a bit more extensive.    I think in Green's efforts to relate to a new audience, specifically Neo-Pagan and new age readers, she missed her target by "dumbing down." Green would have done better to have written a well-bibliographied introduction to druids along the lines of  The World of the Celts or her Dictionary of Celtic Myth books. I think that Neo-Pagan readers can readily find enough unscholarly material about druids; what they need is access to well-researched and cited books directing them to additional sources. Unless you already have Piggott's The Druids, and Green's World of the Celts, I'd give The World of the Druids a miss 
 This cd has music that seesaws between pretty and pretty boring...but then you get to the song "Hymn". It is a drop dead, completely gorgeous and jubilant piece of work. As much as the other songs are unimportant, nothing, boring, stereotypcial, new age, synthesizer,  schmaltz, "hymn makes the whole purchase totally worthwhile.   The song is that beautiful 
 I was hoping to find 200  top-rated recipes from allrecipes.com.    The site itself does not sort recipes by rating, so you must scroll until you find "IT"--a recipe like  Baked Pork Chops which received a 5-star rating from 1488 cooks!      Now, that inspires confidence!   This book will not provide you with tempting photos and 5-star recipes rated by thousands of cooks.    Instead, unfortunately, these recipes' ratings are all over the place.  For example, several were rated by only 7 cooks----7 cooks who only gave them four stars. And, oh, yea, the only photo is on the cover 
 I had been reading some of the reviews about this book and when i saw it at my bookstore, i bought it.   The first few chapters very very promising and i thought this will be an excellent read. But as i read the book, somewhere along the plot i started getting bored and losing interest.   I don't discredit Lisa's sizzling sex scenes but i feel that this book revolved too much around sex, sex and more sex.   What began as a good story plot turned out to be very disappointing.  I don't recommend this book the LK fans.   My friend asked me how i felt about the book and my reply was, "the book is a sex manual which describes different methods to sexual positions."  
 A bit cheesey... I felt like I was reading a fluffed up self-help book! If you are a fan of The Da Vinci Code looking for more information on the lost sacred feminine, this book will be of little help.  I bought it because I thought it would be an interesting way to absorb some facts, but I found it to be a simplistic, repetetive, overly-idealized account of a woman's "rebirth".  I couldn't even finish it!  While its okay as a light read, it won't satisfy your want of solid religious/historical information 
 I bought this book because I am switching from Windows to Linux on my home network.  I thought it might be quicker to learn the ins and outs with the book vs. surfing from place-to-place on the web.  My experience with the book is not that great--it never provides enough information on any subject to answer the question I have.  I always have to resort to the internet for enough information to solve the problem of the day.  It might be o-k for general Linux information, but it won't get you up and running as a system administrator on a home network 
 When I read the first five pages I knew I was in trouble.  The writing throughout the book was very flat. Keeping track of all the characters was a monumental feat that left you wondering WHY they were actually written into this novel. About the only completely "fleshed" out character was Scott - The main character's lover who happened to be a Baseball athlete. Sprinkled adorations of this character created many stalls to the story line that I began to NOT care for Tom or Scott. I also found myself cringing at all the location descriptions given to the reader about Chicago. Again, this intricate location detail created a stall to my reading. Hasn't this writer figured out that less is more? Yet, I continued through the 182 pages HOPING to get some real writing style that would drive me to the entertainment value I get when reading a Joseph Hansen novel.  How sad I was to see this book finish flat. Time to cleanse my brain with a Dave Brandstetter detective read. Oy... 
 I must agree with some other reviewers of this book, and say that it is a very dry list of factual data, interspersed with Bill Wyman's moans and boasts. His gripe with Allan Klein about money seems to be quite valid, but he mentions it about a thousand times. Mick and Keith get quite a pasting- again it seems quite valid, but do we need to hear it so many times?    Bill opines that Keith Richard's voice is weak and that his own songs were ignored by the band. Listen to his only self-penned Stones track of the 60s, on "Satanic Majesties", and you will conclude that this is quite a self delusion- his voice is far weaker, and his songwriting at that time was also inferior.     The book seems to be more authoritative on dates, but we can only take Bill's accuracy on faith. My knowledge of the Stones is not enormous, but even I can see some big factual errors. For example he tells us that neither Taj Mahal nor Marianne Faithfull recorded songs for the "Rock n Roll Circus". A recent re-issue has proved him completely wrong.      As another reviewer rightly said, Marianne Faithfull's autobiog is a much better read 
 The concept of a futon mattress atop slats is actually comfortable and I lay on it for a week happily until I made the mistake of putting too much focused pressure and snapped/broke two of the very fragile slats by climbing onto it with my knee first.  Also, I called the manufacturer on the first day to tell them that the filling inside the cushion covers was making me itch.  These are not cushions with a black cover.  This is a black cover filled with recycled fabric pulp.  The rep was not interested in responding to my complaint.  Don't buy this.  Go to a futon store and buy something that resembles this and it will be much sturdier. 
 THIS SITE IS HARD TO FIND THE INK CARTRIDGE I NEED. #78 TRI COLOR FOR MY HP 750 
 If you want info on what to do with toilet paper rolls or empty plastic bottles and food trays then this book has good info.  However, if you are looking for crafts that you would be proud to give as lasting gifts buy  another book. Also I found that unless you have a large supply of craft  materials like paints, glues, fabrics, etc., you will need to spend a lot  of money to finish most projects. Defeats the trash to treasure premise.  The furniture section is not much better. I garnered more information  watching the home and garden television shows. I am very disappointed this  book does not provide information on gifts I would be PROUD to give this  Christmas. This was a waste of money for me 
 This has to be one of Betty Grable's LEAST entertaining musicals. Why didn't they release Mother Wore Tights, The Dolly Sisters, Moon Over Miami or any of the 20+ other Technicolor musicals she made for Fox between 1940 and 1953.....not THIS turkey 
 Moore sets out to blame guns, rather than the people who make Prozac and other 'designer' seditives for the massacre at Columbine High School and runs afoul of Mr. NRA himself, Moses, better known as Charleton  Heston. Heston, gentlemanly as he is defeats all futile arguments Moore, an anit-gun (mostly) leftist has v. the Second Amendment. Long live the second Amendment, otherwise the First Amendment is gone, too! Moore should wake and wise up. Better Moore efforts that are highly recom- mended are: The Big One, Fahrenheit 9/11, Roger and Me and even the un- derrated Canadian Bacon 
 I wish I hadn't bought this book.  I love the magazine so I was hoping that the book would be like a whole bunch of the magazines condensed into one huge helpful book.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  There weren't that many pictures with tips and most of the book seems to be a collection of comments on all the weddings Martha and her family and friends have ever had, from her grandmother to daughter to close friends.  That was a little odd.  The pictures were beautiful but not very helpful.  There really weren't too many new ideas or good tips. I was very disappointed.  As long as you don't expect this book to be like a condensed version of the magazine, you might like it.  I read the whole thing and put it on the shelf.  Hopefully I can pass it on to someone who will appreciate it at some  point 
 they are a lovely color, but I don't like the fact they aren't zippered.  They slip off constantly 
 I am an avid ani fan, but this is my least favorite album since "not so soft."   And I think the two records have the same problem: no joy. Back then, Ani was burned by the city and lashed out.  Now, she is burned by love/marriage and is lashing out again.     The problem isn't that this is a post-relationship album.  "Dilate" is one of her best, and nearly every song was a letter to a lost lover. The difference is that here, the primary attitude is scorn.  At least (or at best) on Dilate, she admitted to love, and to the pain that follows. It was cathartic and powerful.  But here, most of the time she's saying, "I'm better off without you" and even beyond that, "I'm better than you." Ouch.    The music is dischordant, which is ok, but in the end, it just isn't  very interesting, and the spoken word pieces have stopped being poems and just become rants. (Compare the ramble and rant of "True Story of What Was" to the sonically intense pieces of old like  "The Slant" or "Fuel.")  Of course I'll keep buying her records.  But this one doesn't, and won't get much play 
 Characteristic of this reader is the bothersome overlap of topics. It dramatically fails to give insight in theories of globalization itself and the link between these theories and global reality. After studying this reader even experienced students of Anthropology will give anything for something that is less grandiloquent and more useful because of it's simplicity 
 I ordered two Kitchen Books. Great Kitchens: Design Ideas from Top Chefs AND Great Kitchens: At Home with Top American Chefs. GUESS WHAT? Same book. That is why I gave it a low rating. I feel I was Dooped. Of course, I sent the book right back but why change the cover photo and title?  I could find nowhere that is said they are the same book. I did not need the aggrevation so beware 
 For me this book was an exercise in waiting for a good ending.  Though I've only read one of Bret Easton Ellis' books, American Psycho, I had been so affected by it that I leaned into his newest book with great hope for a new adventure.  I didn't expect something horrifying but I expected humor, insight and an intense experience of some kind.  I wasn't stimulated in any of these ways.  In fact I was rather annoyed for probably 80% of the book.  I don't have much interest, empathy or sympathy for the semi-autobiographical past that Ellis' character Ellis possessed.  I have to admit it was a new experience for me to be have a solid non-fictional base dissolve into fiction.  [...].  But just as Ellis struggled for the entire book to understand the unbelievable events around him, so did I.  Was it a dream?  Drug/alcohol induced?  I literally ached with disappointment when a ghost hunter/exorcist was sought out.  lame.  Terby spelled backwards?  lame. 3/07 equals an address?  lame.  I was pleased with the frightening atmosphere Ellis created inside the house, with lights out and unknown creatures making noises and leaving messes... but I can't give him all the credit for that. Takes a little bit of suspension of disbelief and imagination to enjoy that kind of stuff. ;)  In the end I felt like I'd wasted my time.  I felt that perhaps the book was a good exercise in introspection for Bret Easton Ellis... but the moral of the story was delivered clumsily and to my disinterested and unsympathetic eyes.  bleh, not happy I'd give the book away but a friend gave it to me and wrote a very nice note to me inside the cover 
 This is the 3rd book I have read on The Templars. The text is a hodge-podge of interesting facts and spectulations on The Knights Templar.  The disorganization and disjointed style makes the information difficult to follow.  There is entirely too much repetition and too many rhetorical questions in every chapter.  There is virtually no chronologic order to the material.  It would have been very helpful to the reader if the author provided a simple map to indicate the location of the many places, temples, churches etc. mentioned in the text. It was difficult to know without searching other references if the location of the place, incident, battle, or refuge referred to was in the Middle East(holy lands), France, SCotland or England!    In Chapter 6, one of the contributing authors(Defoe)gives a history of the Canadian Masonic Templars and later in the same chapter, R. Lomas, presents a brief history of Freemasonary.  This was a bit perplexing and again, this underscores the disorganization of the text material.   Finally, given the problems that quickly become obvious to the reader, the editor must take some blame or responsibility for the poorly organized material of the text 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Queen's Fool" are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. "The Virgin's Lover" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to Trollope 
 This is a very nice coffee table book, and for a beginning art novice there are some "secrets". But, for artist with general high school level education this is little more than a nice picture book.  	There is no discounting Yves Lanthier's skill or excellent creative ability but the few tips he gives are not for creating the Trompe L'oeil ceilings he exhibits in the book. Rather he shows simple stone / marble technique, a basic wall effect and basic light shading in the last fifteen pages of the book. 	This is not a book the speaks to basic line and eye illusion of ceiling depth which I was looking for. 
 Line by line the writing is superb. Ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important. But here may be the problem with ID. The constant shift to describing everything in the narrator's line of vision confuses my sense of what's relevant. Every other page is a distraction from something I wasn't sure about to begin with 
 When I purchased the book, I thought it would act as a resounding inflection into the life and times of a woman struggling with the horrible aftermath of critical events similar to what I had gone through three years earlier.  I did not find that at all.  This book came across more as a wishy-washy love story than a tell-all "I'm writing to help others" book of caring and honesty.  Her husband must be one great guy!  I found nothing in this book that helped me fight my own demons or helped me deal with the personal strife that I've had to live with all these years.  I respect Deborah for her willingness to put this all out there, but in the end, her book was an arrow through my wallet and a major disappointment 
 I love Adam's Rib, Woman of the Year and Philadelphia story.  Sadly, this movie lacks the orginality and sparkle of those movies.  Tracy and Hepburn are their usual best, but the script is uninspired from beginning to end.  Overly talky, stagnantly staged, and filled with characters and situations you can't care less about.  The few bright spots are the ending and Lansbury's performance because its so different than the dowager roles for which she later became famous 
 On November 28 two better versions of this collection will be released.   The first is entitled "The Christopher Reeve Superman Collection".  This release is listed on Amazon.  This version will have 8 disks including a 4 disk special release of Superman I with both the 1978 release and 2000 expanded edition (don't know how that relates to the longer TV version only shown twice).  There will be a two disk version of Richard Lester's Superman II which will only contain one version, not the longer TV version (a darker film), which has not been rebroadcast.  There will also be one disk versions of III and IV with some new special features.  In the case of IV it is not clear whether it will be the version released in the US or the 20 minute longer version released in the rest of the world.    I and II will also have remastered productions of the Fleischer Studios Superman cartoons, long overdue since the special edition VHS versions of those cartoons (no longer available) were of superior quality to the DVD releases.    The four Superman movies  as described above supposedly will also  be released individually.    Most importantly, the long hoped-for Richard Donner's version of Superman II (a noticeably different movie from Superman II heretofore available) has been completed and will also be released seperately at the same time.  This is not just a modified cut, but actually a noticeably different movie as Richard Donner had a different view of the basic story.  For one thing, Marlon Brando as Jor-El has a major role in Richard Donner's version, while he was totally writtten out of Lester's intrepretation.  Marlon Brando's appearance in Superman Returns was made up of alternate takes of what he did in Superman I.  What is in Donner's Superman II has not been seen publicly before.   Donner's Superman II is not planned to be part of the collection above.  Superman Returns will also be a separate release in one and two disc versions, although this is not yet shown on Amazon   On November 28 the Ultimate Superman collection will also be released.  it will include all of the above along with the Richard Donner cut of Superman II, the 2 disc version of Superman Returns  and a host of special features.  Not yet sure if Supergirl  will be in the package, although a new release of that (not yet listed on Amazon) comes out the same day).  Still some speculation if 13 or 14 discs.    There is reportedly another package, also called the Ultimate Superman Collection, that will come out the same day, consisting of 19 discs.  Not sure what's on the extra discs relative to the US release.  That version will be released abroad, not in the US, at least not now.  Maybe later, after they've sold as many US versions as they can and want to see if they can sell the collection agian with these extra discs.  
 WHOA THERE.  UH UM.. OK.  Stutter, Gulp & Yuk.  The only thoughts I have about this book would be massive spoilers.  If you loved Star By Star you'll love this.  In Dark Empire, Leia saved Luke from the dark side, so it can happen.  But I fear history may repeat itself and balance is about to be restored.. again.  This is not why I read Star Wars novels.  Quoting Robert Mc Adams - It is rather depressing how the Star Wars universe is being portrayed right now, and frankly, if this series continues on the arc it is going -- it will have killed the universe I have loved to read about for so long -- leaving me with no reason to continue reading about it.  Hope or Hopeless - We will have to see where they take this story arc.  We have the makings of a new three way rebellion.  Aaron Allston - there is little of the sense of humor well got in previous Allston Books.  Audio Book - The switch to 6 hour abridgments is great.  The overall production is excellent. 
 I used to like my Viking 512MB CF card a lot.  I had such a card for more than a year.  In that period, I used it in my camera.  It's filled up for several times.  Also occationally I use a card reader (SimpleTech) to write/read that card, to transfer some big files between computers.  It's all fine, and suddenly one day, when the card was half full, and after a card reader reading, I got "CF card error" on my camera.  Fortunately, after I delete a few pictures, I could move on.  I gave the card to  other people, so I don't know how it's doing now.  After that, I purchased another Viking 512MB, half year ago.  I used it to transfer files for a few times, and have never filled it up using my camera yet.  Now I am getting consistent "CF card error" message on my camera, even after re-format for several times, while I don't have that problem if I use another card.    One theory I heard was that a card reader may damage a card.  I can not verify though.  Anyway, I will have to buy another card now, and it won't be viking for this time.  ===== One month later ===== I contacted with their customer support.  They gave me a number for return, and I mailed back my damaged CF card.  They sent back a new one in a week.  The new one is working fine so far.  The exchange was not difficult.  They did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt.  They only verified the serial number.  That's good 
 After reading Skinny Legs and All, and loving every word, I bought this book on tape.  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with it and stopped listening after the first CD.  How many times do we need to hear about an extra large scrotum?  It must be repeated a hundred times, and it just wasn't amusing.  The reader, Barrett Whitener, tries to do the best he can, but his poorly contrived Japanese accent (which sounds more like a German accent), just doesn't cut it.  I'm sure if I gave it another 3 or 4 hours of listening, I might get hooked, but who has that kind of time to gamble?? 
 ...But it gets one star for the brief moments that Ricky Jay has in the film and another for portions of Alec Baldwin's performance.  Overall this is a stinker.  Mamet is not a good director.  He should stick to writing 
 I am an avid sports fan and I love football, but sorry, I didn't enjoy this book one bit. I kept waiting for the Grisham who writes compelling dramas (The Broker, King Of Torts) to pop out, but realized midway through it wasn't gonna happen. As someone else here summarized - "it's chick lit about guys who played high school football" 
 Did I miss something, or did this guy risk his life based on a promise to someone he just met? Too much irrational behavior to mention.  I had to force myself to finish the book just to see how much more ridiculous it could get.  The (paperback) cover refers to Michael Crichton three times, the praises inside, another three, and one reference to Stephen King.  These are two good authors that I enjoy reading but this book was not even close.  
 The only thing I noticed was that with Bounce, my clothes have no static cling. With dryer balls instead of Bounce, lots of static cling! Drying time remained the same 
 Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts describes marriage as " a supernatural event founded upon a mutual exchange of holy pledges." The authors save this description for the last chapter, however, from the third chapter on the book is creepily christianic. They ultimately trivialize all advice that can be found in seminars, counseling, mentors, and books, presumably, even their own. All that a marriage really needs is religion.  I want my money back 
 ...and to be honest I hated it. She has that dramatic face in every movie, it always looks as if she's going to burst into tears or something - so she's mostly just fit, it seems to me anyway, for these tragic "no hope for mankind"-movies. Plenty is a movie so Britain-grey that you should never watch it on a day you feel tired or something, you'll only get deeply depressed. And do not misunderstand me, I am no fan of shallow comedies, I'm moved by actors like Hopkins in Shadowlands and Penn in Dead Man Walking - but the woman Streep plays in this movie, well, how many women could identify themselves with her? What is Plenty trying to tell us?  Two stars for Stings' effort as Mick in the movie. Not a big role, but his character has "sex" with Streep - and is basically used by her. And finally Mick is the first to call her character "insane" if I remember right. Big Deal? No, but I am a big fan of Sting - therefor let me add : Are you a Sting-fan, add this to your Sting-dvd-collection.  But watching the movie is pain!  
 I am going to build muy custom house and I want to do it according to the Feng Shui. I was expecting to find many Feng Shui floor plans samples...well let me tell you that not, it has not many Feng Shui floor plans, such a few, and most of them do not match what the book says. I mean that most of the foor plans are not according to Feng Shui bagua grid (occidental), i.e.: bathroom is Wealth area, when it is known in all schools that bathroom can't be placed there. I found just 1 floor plan, so it is not worthly to get this book if you are looking for Feng Shui floor plans. 
 The charicters of both Elizabeth and Darcy behave in a manner I would never have expected them to be so stupid as to do.  These are two people of sense, to have them behave in such a ridiculous manner had me shaking my head and asking myself how much the author read Austin's work.  My guess was either very little or with very little understanding.  I was extremely dissappointed 
 Not that the music is bad but its a little to soft DJ Cam in most parts.  If you like light jazz sort of beats then you'll really enjoy this, but as apposed to most of Spookys other beats its really on the light side.  Asphalt and Parachutes are 2 tracks of special mention.  The former is a nice piece of trippy hip hop while the later has a really funky groove 
 The Leak-O-Matic fully lived up to its name.  As a new parent, I don't have time to do things once, forget about doing things twice.  I need simple and reliable- the Leak-O-Matic is neither.  It worked OK for the first few times, then I partially filled the tub and put all the items nearby necessary for bathtime.  By the time I returned with baby in hand, the Leak-O-Matic had dribbled all over the laundry room counter, soaked all my other items on the counter, water ran down onto the floor, under the baseboard, and dripped from the upstairs landing onto the downstairs foyer floor.  The Leak-O-Matic is the Hindenburg of all baby bathtubs.  It is too bad that I cannot give it zero stars.   There are many people who say that you just have to assemble them correctly, but judging from the number of irate mommies here, I conclude that it is either too a complicated design or just plain crappy engineering.  Think about it- the number of people with young children who took the time to go online and tell everyone that this thing is a piece of cheese!    The cups on the feet stick to the countertop so you are unable to positon the tub once it is attached.  The fabric mesh incline allows the baby to slide down into the water, so you're always repositioning the baby.  I'm surprised that this thing didn't come with a built in toaster for 'added safety'.  I did not research every single item on the registry- I figured that if the big stores carried it then it must be at least "OK".  Back it goes.  If you buy this thing, then good luck to you, and don't burn the toast! 
 I've begun reading this book and I was sailing with Thomas Moore real tight.  He was skillfully sailing the ship until I got to his fourth chapter where he got off into a skiff and cut the rope.  He has set me adrift in a wide sea without a moral compass.    He leads his readers into the occult and astrology. A place where a former Monk should fear to tread. While I don't mind learning about insights of the dark night through greek mythology and other lesser known personalities, I feel Mr. Moore could have served his readers better examples by using concepts and personalities from the Judeo-Christian tradition.   Mr. Moore holds too highly the concept of self and self fulfullment.  What I understood from Part Two of the book "Disturbances" is don't take responsibility for your choices.  Follow what you feel you must do in order to develop your inner self and talents even it that means to destroy and hurt your relationship with family and friends.  Jesus' idea was in losing one's self that we find out true self.   I haven't finished the book yet so I guess it's a bit unfair to write a review so soon. However, I thought I would tear through this book because the first 68 pages held so much meaning for me.  I've gotten bogged down in the middle and have picked up another book by James Finley which is an expose of Thomas Merton's thought.  Merton's Palace of Nowhere -A search for God through Awareness for the True Self.  I love this book.  What I am discovering from Merton is that the self we construct is an illusion but we need to find our true self through our search and union with God.  I believe this is the true purpose of the Dark night of the Soul which is to lead us to the realization of our need for grounding in the source of life.  I have two more books by Moore which I plan to read. Care of the Soul and The Re-enchantment of Every Day life.  So stay tune 
 I ordered it for Christmas but I didn't get it until December 27th.  It's now in a closet waiting for another gift-giving occassion 
 First Edition of this book is a 40+ year old publication that first sold for $3.95 in 1964, now the current edition goes for $75?  Why?  Because it is still used in college classes.  This is really dated material. HOWEVER, because the newest Edition (6th - 2003) costs up to $75 new, some clowns here through  Amazon.com are trying to sell you an older Edition for prices ranging from $25 to $65 making it look like you are getting a "good deal" on the more expensive 6th Edition.  The problem is that they then send you a 1st , 2nd or 3rd Edition, all of which are only worth between $5-10 each!   Buyer BEWARE here!  If you are paying $25 or more for this 6th Edition, MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET A 6th EDITION!  Inform Amazon.com ASAP if they send you something else 
 This book is definately for the beginner and was of no use to me. I have only been working as an importer for about a year and found the book useless. I would recommend it only for the novice. If you have any experience at all you have already heard this information 
 I thought that the music quality was fine, but the music did not sound the same as the music in the original soundtracks.  John Williams does not conduct his songs on these CD's. I could hear differences between songs I allready own and songs on these CD's. It seemed like the conductor on these CD's interpreted the music differently and therefore the music did not sound the same. I did not like that I could hear the difference between the original soundtracks and the songs on these CD's. I also found an error with one of the song names.  Instead of Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone, one of the song names was Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone. I would definitely recomend the original soundtracks over this set of CD's.  
 I'm having an 80s Hair Metal party and I don't have any L.A. GUNS on hand (I used to have em on vinyl!) so I bought this Greatest Hits Compilation. What a bust! The songs on here are not the choice cuts I would have picked as L.A. GUNS best songs and they seem to be trying for a grittier, heavier sound (tryin to keep up with the times, Boys?) so even songs like One More Reason and Electric Gypsy arent the glossy versions I remember and like.  L.A. GUNS was hair metal in the vein of MOTLEY CRUE and POISON. Who wants a dirty sounding L.A. GUNS 
 hated it!!! it made the Christians look really stupid & unmatched to the challenges at hand. it seemed to ignore the whole purpose of the book series - the fight to save mankind from the antichrist by ordinary believers left behind after the Call [the Rapture]. this was the worst movie in the series followed closely by the second movie. i think cloud 10 should just call their movies something else but NOT say they have ANYTHING to do with the left behind series. maybe i wouldn't have been as offended if it was just marketed as science fiction and NOT like its end time fiction like the book series.. 
 i have to say i love this movie very well done.but after all these years of it's release why? has it not been put in widescreen format or updated on HD or Blueray or a new 2 disc DVD set the laser dics version is in widescreen format someone needs to get this out in the newer formats so we can really injoy this movie.. 
 Making your way through this book is a difficult process that requires a great deal of patience and probably a dictionary. Unfortunately, the awards are few, made apparent when you realize the points that the author tries hard to obfuscate are superficial. Not only is the writing style nearly impossible to get through, the book lacks any deep analysis of culture or economics.  The visual tools that the author uses to illustrate his theories are made up of huge oversimplifications of international economies 
 Recipe for Disaster: Get a dog for every member of the family. Don't spay or neuter any of them. Allow them all to run free for a year while you follow along, observing them as they run through traffic, fight, and place themselves in danger of death or injury with regularity. Don't establish a relationship with any of them, work with them, and train them in any way. Watch and take copious notes as they withdraw from the family and revert to survival behavior. Write a book about the experience and make a lot of money. Fool the masses into thinking that this was a fascinating experiment and therefore any irresponsible behvior on the part of the author was somehow justified.   I threw this book in the garbage, where it belongs.  
 well i bought this series agaisnst the star rating it has and i can only say that in my humble opinion it is badly written the acting is ham,and the actors of a standard that do not rate on a scale of 1 to 10 and i do not mean they score higher than ten. i cannot understand its  five star rating as comparing it with other series such as medium, numbers,waking the dead,it should never have got passed the pilot.if i could i would rate it 0 stars.if there is a secound series i will not be buying it.  
 god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, "then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after."  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.            
 This book is comprised of the kind of writing Sockel calls "thick clotted prose". After decades of reading the clear, unadorned, precise and excellent English of The Economist, I have become intolerant of pretentious layered jargon. What, for example, does this sentence say, which could not be said in simple words: "The organization's objectives, responses, and business models should be calibrated on the basis of its capabilities." Perhaps it could have been: "Organizations should do things they are good at." If this thick clotted prose had coagulated into high scholarship, I might have bothered to read on. Alas, that was not the case. The authors write, in a gesture alluding to scholarship: "Evidence shows that customers are demanding clearer information from their solution providers..." What evidence? It was not given, nor references to studies showing it. Read this book to find out how not to write.   Better still, get yourself a good book on this topic. See "Cultivating Communities of Practice" by Wenger at al., from Harvard Business School Press. Here you shall find lucid expression, good English, thorough endnoting and source documentation, and a comprehensive treatement of the topic. 
 We got this as a Christmas present and played it once, and the kids and I were bored with it. To us, it wasn't really much of a challenge and the game ended way too quickly. Also, the game does not look like it could stand rough play, which I think can definitely happen with this game. Honestly, playing "Go Fish" with regular playing cards is more fun than this game 
 I was very excited to read this book! I ran home, got comforable and started reading. I found myself skipping through the pages. I found it was very myth based, and too much about religion and Jesus and mary. I bought it because I love Tori and have been fascinated by her. I wish this book was more about her life, her childhood. I have read less then half this book,and I will either force myself to finish, or return the book. I really am sadly dissapointed. Tori is the singer and song writer that you can listen to over and over again. I have bought her CD's 3 and 4 times each because I listened too much and the CD was worn. I really don't suggest anyone to buy this, you will be let down, just as i was. 
 I bought this book after reading the wonderful reviews by some excellent reviewers and felt sure that this book would enlighten me as to the mystery of death.  Forgive me, P. Atwater, but I found the beginning of the book so hard to believe, that I couldn't take the rest seriously enough.  Perhaps the book 'After Death Then What'  - also recommended by a highly respected reviewer would have been a better place for me to start.  For instance,  when Atwater explains the circumstances of her three deaths, she relates how she miscarried and severely hemorrhaged in the bathroom, which precipitated her first death upon the bathroom floor. She then comes back to life, struggles five blocks to the doctor's office where she collapses in his office.  The doctor apparently doesn't even look at her chart and, while laughing uproariously at the fact that she'd been taken advantage of and raped, injects her in the right thigh with an unknown drug to stop the bleeding and sends her home.  Now, I have very little faith in doctors and constantly question their conclusions, but never have I heard of a doctor who would laugh in the face of a collapsed hemorrhaging woman and then just send her back out to her car to drive home alone.  And if this did happen, why did Atwater not haul him over the coals for malpractice?  The second death occurs as a result of a blood clot forming in her right thigh, causing the 'worst case of phlebitis (the doctor) had ever heard of, let alone seen.  He kept saying "There's no way you can be alive" ".  However, he, too, just sends her home with a prescription of 'dangerous drugs'.  Thus follows a second death from a burst blood clot which Atwater manages to return from unaided.  The third death is the result of the rejection of the man who had raped her coming back to ask her forgiveness (which Atwater gives), and then refusing to listen to her relate the experiences of her previous two deaths.   Apparently, the "emotional blow of being refused was at the core of death number three" She is brought back to life by her son, who sits opposite her and 'talks' her back to life.  No physical intervention such as mouth to mouth resuscitation etc. - just talks.  Later, 'several physicians' verify that if her son had called for medics, Atwater would have gone too far to be resuscitated.    There appears to have been no medical verification at any time that any of these deaths actually occurred.  I'm not suggesting that Atwater is making things up, just that perhaps she may have left her body and had an astral experience that may or may not have been actual death.  Three times returning from 'death' with no help is quite extraordinary, as most medical people will verify after working hard to bring someone back who has 'died' on the operating table.  At this point, I put the book down and forced myself to read the rest later.  Yes, there are some very good points raised, but I'm afraid that I wasn't convinced - much as I would like to be.    
   hi- it was impossible to use this product because the key   they gave me didn't work. i   might make a fisbee out of the dvd!                                                jerr 
 Simply put, this movie shames the Dragonball Z genre.   This movie has a very poor plot, uninspiring music, lacks drama or emotion, and could be entertaining to only the youngest of children at best.  Avoid this film and, perhaps, send a message to funimation to stop putting out garbage.  
 Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  But, this IS a good concept... unfortunately, Amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality!  So, until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds... DO NOT try and download Season 1, Episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7!!!  1, 3, 8, 9, and 10 were the only ones that were 100% complete for me 
 Longtime fans of Scott O'Dell's classic Island of the Blue Dolphins, do yourself a favor and avoid this lackluster sequel.  Island of the Blue Dolphins was one of my favorite books as a kid.  I must've read it at least a dozen times.  Somehow, I didn't find out that it had a sequel until years later.  Intrigued by the idea of a sequel to Island, which kind of ends on a cliffhanger, I read Zia.  I was interested in seeing how Scott O'Dell would handle what happens to Karana when she is finally rescued off the island after being stranded for 18 years.  As you probably know, Island of the Blue Dolphins was based on a true story, but the facts are few about the real Lost Woman.  So how would the talented writer Scott O'Dell concoct what happens to Karana?  The result, Zia, is terribly disappointing.  For starters, fans of Karana won't have much to read about.  At least half of the book deals with her niece and nephew trying to go to the island to rescue her.  The story is told completely from the niece's point of view.  We never get to hear what Karana herself thought about experiencing a new land and being reunited with people after so many years, and the sadness she must have faced at finding that her tribe was gone.  We learn almost nothing about what happened to Karana's father and sister, just that her sister's children have ended up orphans in a missionary.  And sadly, there's nothing interesting about Karana's niece Zia and her brother.  They merely serve as plot devices to stretch this paper-thin story out over 100 pages or so.  I now appreciate the "cliffhanger" ending of Island of the Blue Dolphins in its perfect simplicity.  It is better to leave the story when Karana leaves the island, and let it be.  Your own imagination about what it was like for Karana to live at a missionary where no one spoke her language and there was no trace of her tribe left is better than the depressing depiction of her life in Zia.  I wish I could erase Zia from my mind.  Zia truly is a sequel that should not have been written 
 This my first pair of 100% nylon socks.  The problem I have is that my feet cannot breathe in them.  My socks are wet after a full day wearing them. I guess I'll just have to stay with cotton...I've never had that problem before with cotton/polyester socks. They do stay up above my calf all day long, though. 
 I had just visited the "Confederates in the Attic" page on Amazon, on which there are a few reviews stating that it is an "anti-Southern" book that made vast stereotypical judgements about the whole of the Southern people in presenting a few "fringe" characters who were extremist in their desire to see the Confederacy rise again. I could accept that notion but for the number of positive reviews of this book, which I read in a bookstore just two days ago.  I was intrigued by the title (and slightly amused by it), and knew what I was likely to find, being a Civil War buff and knowing that in many ways the South was politically and ideologically quite wrong. But the pages I read exceeded all expectations. What we have here is frothy, poorly-written "proof" of Yankee aggression and distortion of the "truth" about the Confederacy, supported with copious citations (as is typical of polemics, such as Ann Coulter) of sources culled from the very dregs of Civil War scholarship. I had only to read a passage on why the Confederacy was "not fighting for slavery" to put the book on my list of worthless revisionist nonsense with purely one-sided partisan bile. The section simply opts to list five Confederate generals who did not own slaves, and then select a series of letters written home by "soldiers" in which many words about "fighting for freedom" crop up, providing the basis for the hilarious tag line for the section, "Another Northern myth exposed." Unfortunately for the Kennedys, only ONE of those letters is cited as actually being written by a Confederate soldier, and that is the only one that didn't mention "fighting for freedom." No doubt their heavy use of distorted selections to cloud the ideas of the readership lulls them into believing they are seeing a "repudiation" of the North's "version of events."   I appreciate revisionism's raising of points contrary to the "party line" about history. Some of the points they make are true, and color perceptions about the war in a good way. For instance, their talk of blacks owning other black slaves is true, and their talk about the facts that many Confederates did not own slaves and did not neccesarily feel that they were fighting for slavery (as slaveowners represented a small upper-class of planters in a South where many lived in agrarian poverty) has merit. Unfortunately, the whole thing is colored by a tone that treats the North as though it were Nazi Germany, to the point where I began helplessly grinning at what I was reading. I fear that people who will not investigate very far into the time period, however, will be misled by this book, which claims to add nuance to typical understanding but which is in reality unnuanced pro-Confederate crap. Revisionism is useful, but for novices it can become difficult to draw the distinction between judgements which have a lot of support and judgements that have little support, and choosing which histortical view to award more credence, particularly with the presence of clearly partisan "revisionisms" that have political and racist agendas. Even then, I don't see how a novice could be fooled by this nonsense. 
 If you want your dogma reinforced then this is a great book. It blazes through philosophical arguments with proposterous nerve.  example 1. The problem of evil is solved thus: "And God has done something about the problem of evil. He has done the most dramatic, costly, and effective thing possible by giving his Son to die for evil men."  example 2. To John Wisdoms damning parable, the book argues: "For in Christianity we do not have merely an allegation that the garden of this world is tended by a loving Gardener; we have the actual, empirical entrance of the Gardener into the human scene in the person of Christ (cf. John 20: 14,15), and this entrance is verifiable by way of His resurrection."   All of the arguments assume the ignorant position. The argument from design is entertained in the most ridiculous manner -arguing from the specific to the general. Reality is simple -we are here because things are the way they are -if they weren't, we wouldn't be here. Too many leaves in the teacup being read by those who want to see things that are not there. I'm afraid for humanity if they think this is knowledge.  
 Updike failed to hold my attention throughout the story both because of its utter lack of suspense in any dimension and the inconsistencies in his character development.  As other have stated, you know from page one that the final page will involve an Arab, a truck and a bomb.  The lack of anticpation must therefore be compensated for by something else - perhaps excellent writing, interesting character development or original insights.  Updike fails to deliver on all three counts.  One particularly slipshod literary technique Updike uses is the phrasing he gives the title character Ahmad.  When Ahmad speaks, it is in the voice of an intelligent, thoughtful foreigner.  His phrasing captures very well the cadence, vocabulary and grammar of a well spoken non-native speaker of English.  Curiously, Ahmad IS an American, raised in New Jersey by a thoroughly American mother.  So, what influences created this stilted phrasing?  Updike is trying to somehow comvince us that a Jersey teenager speaks like a Pakistani or Egyptian immigrant.  There is no need for the technique and its inconsistency with the character's life is grating.  Updike also relies heavily on ethnic/religious stereotypes.  Sterotypes often have some basis in fact but generally make for uninteresting literature.  However, in Updike's case, the stereotypes make little sense at all.  For instance, a high school counselor's entire personality is attributed to his "Jewishness" both by himself and by others who opine on his personality.  This is particularly curious given that the man was not raised as a Jew and, in fact, his family had rather adamently turned away from the religion two generations earlier.  So where does all the Jewsih influence come from?  Likewise, Ahmad's mother's personality is often linked to her Irish heritage.  Yet there is no evidence whatsoever that her Irish background (which could have been many generations ago) has influenced her one bit.  The reader is left once again to wonder what motivates the stereotype - other than simply poor writing and careless character development.  Another out of place literay technique involves the inclusion of fairly lengthy passages from the Korna in Arabic.  Obviously, few Western readers will understand Arabic and it seems meerely pretensious for Updike to include the original language rather than paraphrasing or translating the passages.  What comes across is an attempt by the autohr to show he has done his research.  If that is truly the point then the reader must wonder why the passages are reproduced in Western script rather than Arabic script.  After all, the Koran is not written with Western phonetics in mind. Ultimately, the book leaves one wondering why such a lightweight, poorly constructed piece was released by such a skilled author 
 Anyone interested in the resolution of the Anastasia controversy must also read Peter Kurth's books: "Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson" (ISBN: 0316507172) and "TSAR: The Lost World of Nicholas and Alexandra" (ISBN: 0316557889).  Also read Kurth's direct rebuttal to Massie's "Romanovs" at peterkurth.com, specifically http://www.peterkurth.com/ANNA-ANASTASIA%20NOTES%20ON%20FRANZISKA%20SCHANZKOWSKA.htm  Highlights:  1. The DNA test's techniques are so antiquated that they produce many false positives and negatives.  These techniques are no longer considered accurate enough to be admissible in U.S. courts.  2. The DNA sample from Anna Anderson was taken from a bit of "her" intestine that -- God knows why -- had been sitting on a shelf at the hospital where she had had surgery years earlier.  Where is the "chain of custody" that any legitimate court would require of such evidence?  Thus, the sample tested is suspect.  3. The DNA test results that "prove" AA was a blood relative to Polish peasants in fact PROVES THE OPPOSITE.  According to Massie's geneology, AA was a PATERNAL blood-relative to these Poles.  But the DNA test that was conducted can only trace MATERNAL blood relations.  So a POSITIVE DNA test result "proves" a relationship where none could possibly exist, using Massie's own geneology.  None of this proves that Anna Anderson was Anastasia.  But it does cast serious doubt on the conclusiveness of the DNA test results that Massie champions, and serious doubt about the accuracy of Massie's book 
 First off, I am an avid reader and love a long challenging read, however, this novel is one of the worst I have ever read! It is long, boring and has absolutely no plot. I purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews. Although from the looks of most of them here, I personally suspect that many of those who raved, never actually read the book 
 this product is extremely difficult to learn. I recently purchased two more expensive manuals ro learn the process and also the tutorials the company has are beyond the average users learning. 
 This copyright is 1996....but initial copyright is 1889, and that is how it reads.  Bought for my granchildren who at 11 and 14 are offput by the style.  Recommend for historical value but not to improve history skills for today's generation...not going to happen 
 seriously, if you've read the joy luck club you've read them all. in case nobody noticed, her books are all the same. whoever said that the kitchen god's wife was a duller version of the joy luck club wasn't that far from the truth because it just WAS the joy luck club, only you've read it already so you knew what was coming. ie fights between mother and daughter. how profound/prosaic. really, read one of amy tan's books and you can talk about all of them with some kind of authority. 
 Beware of Spoilers: The story started good and went continually downhill. I don't need a happily ever after, but this ending was too much of a dramatic stretch and the Author seemed to enjoy to punish Jennifer Parker for falling in love with the wrong guy. Some plot points were utterly unbelievable, incl. killing off her son, taking away her friends, killing off her lover and Jennifer's true love Adam, who does nothing much than whining how he loves her, but sadly, his wife just got pregnant....same old, same old. I reckon the story is too outdated to be plausible any more. It was the first book I read from Sidney Sheldon and I am not going to read another novel from him. 
 I'm about to write a review that makes me sad because I have really enjoyed other books by Huston Smith. I respect his willingness and ability to explore diverse religious traditions and practices. His book "The World's Religions" is THE classic introduction to the topic. In fact, if you haven't read that book, then please don't buy this one; click over to that one, which is really a very good book.  This book, on the other hand, is very disappointing. We don't like to see our heros make big mistakes; but that's what this book is.  The essence of Smith's book is that religion matters because science alone cannot deliver meaning. Nor can material consumption, nor purely secular scholarship. So far so good. I agree with Smith that scientific knowledge and material consumption alone are totally inadequate to form a meaningful approach to life. We also agree that extreme postmodernism--with the idea that all attempts to find or articulate knowledge about the world are ultimately mere power plays--is not always true.  But we disagree about the status of human values. Smith believes they have no value unless they exist externally from human psychology. But I, with many others, argue that on the contrary my values and experiences stand on their own as meaningful and real. We might be wrong, but at least he should make that case rather than just stating his opinion.  Certainly the mainstream religious worldviews assume that the most important source of values is out there, in the existence of gods or ancestors or something like that. But all the great mystical traditions of the world teach that the truth that matters, the most important or most real truth, is within us. It is not out there in the world, and we do not need to look out there for anything. Whatever supernatural stuff out there exists or not doesn't matter: the great spiritual realities and truths that we need and enjoy are within us.   With that in mind, the inability of science to find and measure ghosts, gods or Platonic forms doesn't matter. In a very real sense, science has done spirituality a favor by empirically freeing us from supernatural entanglements and confusion. Look no more out there!   But Smith (like many religious people, unfortunately) cannot accept it. He cannot believe in his values unless they exist outside of himself, unless they would exist even in the absense of humanity. I think this is not only a philosophical error, but also a failure of courage. He cannot maintain the rationality of his values unless he shares them with rocks and the vacuum of space.   So, he has a big beef with science. Science has failed to find any supernatural thing; and so far the world has been understood remarkably well with natural explanations. That is not what most religious people would have expected, but as the mystical traditions knew, it doesn't have to matter.  He keeps referring to us as, for instance, a "razor-thin veneer on the world of dead matter." This is certainly not the only response to science! In fact most scientists regard the universe as wonderful and fascinating (not just dead matter), and us as wonderful beings, blessed with the ability to experience these marvels. He quotes a bunch of existentialists to support his pessimistic evaluation of science, but ultimately the existentialists (like most scientists) came to the right conclusion:   Spirituality, values, hopes, fears, etc... don't matter to scientific theories! Who cares? They matter to me! And I assume they matter to you too! Well, fine, that's what we need.  He burns scientists such as Ursula Goodenough, E. O. Wilson, and Stephen Jay Gould for having this insight. No doubt he would trash many others if he knew about them. But Smith's inability or unwillingness to share in this humanistic nobility is his worst flaw.  His wrongful hatred of science leads to a mistake about the origins of modern materialism. In his mind, "The line that runs from a materialistic wordlview to a materialistic philosophy of life is not a straight one, but it exists all the same" (48). Most people today seem to believe that they can buy happiness, if only they have enough money; but most of those people believe in God. And even when religion dominated politics and culture most people were materialistic (yes, even in "the mystic East"). Modern marketing is not taking advantage of a new human nature, but the same one that we've had since the neolithic (at least).  So he terribly misunderstands the nature of human values. Sadly, although that is central to his case, there are still more shortcomings.   He declares that what "religion, and philosophy, and art, and common sense, and our deepest intuitions, and our practiced imaginations... have said about the Big Picture throughout human history has shaken down into a single, wondrously clear and inspiring worldview." Wow, that is remarkable. I'd like a description of this. I think there is a great deal of diversity.   But Smith maintains that the great tradition teaches the immortality of the soul as a source of human hope. Hmmm. Not in ancient Greece, not in ancient Israel, not in many other pre-agricultural societies, and not in contemporary Judaism. For Hindus and Buddhists, the immortality of the soul is the greatest spiritual problem: they are doing their best to stop being reincarnated. Many other differences like this could be enumerated. Although there are some basic features of human worldviews everywhere, I don't see the agreement he promised. And neither do the overwhelming majority of the world's religious people.  And that brings me to a criticism I really hate to make, because Smith has done more than perhaps anyone else to bring knowledge of the world's religions to the average person. Smith's worldview in this book is not some great universal human tradition, but simply liberal monotheism; probably Christianity. He enriches it with a diverse sprinkling of other religions, but he merely brings them all under the umbrella of an implicit Christianity, not taking their traditions seriously. I've never seen him so negligent of other religions, so loyal to Christianity. Now Christianity is a great religion, but it's not the only worldview in human history, and not even the primary one or necessarily the greatest one. If Smith titled the book "Why Christianity Matters" and was honest about his bias, this wouldn't be a complaint. But he says the book is about all of humanity's traditions, and that's what we would expect from Smith. But it's implicitly dismissive of Zen, Taoism, Buddhism (especially Theravada), Hinduism, many ancient religious traditions, and many traditions of hunter-gatherer people.  I have one more criticism. A number of scholars in Smith's field have been accused of indifference to, or actually supporting, very bad regimes. Now, many religious people have stood up to such regimes bravely and fiercely; Bonhoeffer is just one of many examples.  Smith writes, "If a two-year-old drops her ice-cream cone, that tragedy is the end of the world for her. Her mother knows that this is not the case. Can there be an understanding of life so staggering in its immensity that, in comparison to it, even gulags and the Holocaust seem like dropped ice-cream cones?"  No. Because the human beings destroyed by those tragedies are inherently valuable, unique and irreplaceable, while ice cream cones are not. Smith's failure to perceive that leads me to suspect he shares some of that indifference to human life. Who would compare the value of human beings to ice cream cones? Really, when you think about who would, Smith suddenly finds himself in some very scary company.  In Smith's defense, he's gotten pretty old, and that perhaps a younger sharper Smith wouldn't have made a lot of these assumptions and comments. His only important and valuable point is that we have to look for fulfilment outside of materialistic possessions and experiences.   I conclude by emphasizing my original point: this book is worthless, but other books by Smith, especially "The World's Religions," are wonderful books that I strongly recommend. 
 From what was a landmark study by ethnobiologist Wade Davis into the folk preparations in the creation of zombies and the belief system associated with Haitian voodoo came a Eurocentric mess of a movie with the same title that was originally released in 1988.  It was reported at the time that Davis only agreed to sell the rights of the book if Peter Weir was hired as the movie director and Mel Gibson would play the leading role (based on Davis). Neither person was ever involved in the movie project.   The DVD cover tells the story as presented by director Wes Craven; the movie strips the book of its exploration into the real history and customs of the religious practices unique to Haitian society and pounds away at the the evilness of voodoo and the destruction it can cause to the human psyche.  In the movie, the scientist is in search of a secret voodoo powder that places people in a simulated death. The setting is in a time of political revolution and the movie does touch upon authentic details of Haitian society. But the action degenerates into the overt racism of the horror genre that gets repeated over and over again; the darker the skin, the more evil the sin.   To save time and money, purchase the book and appreciate the solid research and writing by Davis & disregard the DVD.    
 excuse my english but if youre a delicate person then its good for you but if youre like myself then this product would last arround 4 days like mines,, all i did was walk to my job for half hour and it began tearing apart; it wasnt defective , its the material its made out of,,, the  product itself is a good idea but the material is delicat 
 When I first got the book I thought it was basic Tagalog, but it wasn't. This book is for people that know some Tagalog. It was very hard to use for learning the language. Not a good book for beginners 
 I thought this would be a great-tasting, healthy snack after reading the reviews. Mine arrived safely and crunchy, unlike the other reviewer who got a bad batch. However, they were not sweet and tasty. My sister described it as tasting like cardboard. Now I have 5 whole bags I don't know what to do with. Maybe I'll put in a recipe and hope it turns out better. If you can, I'd recommend try before you buy 
 After many years, I decided to finally give Kathy Reichs' Temperance Brennan series a go.  So, where better to start than her debut novel 'Deja Dead' which introduces Reichs' heroine.  Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist working in Montreal for what I'm guessing is the French-Canadian equivalent of a Medical Examiner's office.  Of course our heroine is head strong, independent, and unlucky in love (aren't they all?).  Well, some murders start turning up and, amazingly enough, our intrepid anthropologist is the only person that links the crimes together.  Do the police believe her?  No, so she must investigate the crimes on her own.  And by doing so, the murderer then turns his attention to Brennan and her family and friends (don't all killers eventually do that?).  First off, the book is bloated.  The book (at least the paperback version) clocks in at about 530 pages.  Reichs' writes too much about menial tasks that her character, Brennan, does during her usual day.  Does anyone really want to hear repeatedly about what a character had for dinner or what paperwork she does at work?  I know I don't want to read it.  Now I'm a person who enjoys a nice, long book but 'Deja Dead' (where did she get that title anyway?) is about two hundred pages too long.  And it is a very slow read.    Secondly, her main character, Brennan, just isn't likeable.  In fact, I found her quite annoying.  The policemen in the novel are portrayed as incompetent, arrogant jerks who are too worried about being right than they are about doing the right thing.  When in fact I think that they just didn't want to deal with this overly nosy anthropologist who is obviously stepping on toes and irritating people who are just trying to do their jobs.  Reichs' tries to portray Brennan as a lone crusader fighting against all these odds to get to the criminal.  When in fact she is an irritating anthropologist who has no business investigating a murder.  She is, basically, a laboratory-based employee who should not be in the field.  So I don't blame the cops in the book that don't like her.  She's butting her nose in where it doesn't belong and, in a part I actually liked, she ends up bringing irreparable damage to her family and friends.  I thought it a just outcome.  Also, after about the twentieth time of Brennan looking at some cop's rear end and saying "I like the way his butt looks...Oh, stop!  You need to get laid." I wanted to scream.  Dr. Brennan, at least in this debut novel, is extremely irritating.  Thirdly, I have read the basic plot of this book in a hundred other novels.  The suprise "switcheroo" ending is not suprising but more annoying...  It is just a cheap way to trick the reader.  And if I have to read about one more main character who ends up becoming the target of the "killer", I will scream.  Its pathetic.  How many times does it need to be written?  Its ridiculous.  Now, 'Deja Dead' is the first of Reichs' books that I've read.  I've heard that the following books in the Brennan series are better and I certainly hope this is the case.  I really didn't like the book:  not the characters, the plot, the writing...  But I will give Reichs another try and read the next book in the series.  If its as bad as 'Deja Dead', I don't think I ever read another one her books 
 this book is retared...i would never let no one else read this it really that bad...i cry it was so bad...every time i look at it makes me sneeze...now that bad...i just sneeze i look at it...it give laTisha ga 
 Chris Byron's schtick is to pretend to be a friend of Martha Stewart, but tell her story in the most cruel light.  No friend would write a book like this.  Hence, from the start one feels he is disingenuous while trying to establish his cred.  I am probably the one person in America who knows almost nothing about Martha Stewart, but Byron's account assembles such a string of digs that before long it gave me the feeling of being stuck in an elevator where someone had vomited. Why subject yourself to this?  I skipped ahead a few times trying to find a different tone, but the guy continues his vicious ways while feigning disinterested storyteller, and I finally had to throw it down.    I do not understand this writer's motivations for such unkindness.   This book makes me wonder about the value of all such book. By what standard is a book considered a good book? Does it inspire us?  Yes, it is well researched and well written... but so are so many others.  This book is disrespectful to a fellow human being and for what purpose?    With so many other books in my reading pile, I have to skip out and move to the next.       
 This book might suffice as a light college reading assignment (as there is not much in publication that deals with this subject matter), but if you are not forced to read it, stay away.  Full of inaccurate accounts and plain falsisms, this book nowhere near respects it's subject matter, and gives an overly pedantic and bland report of Indian American Youth Culture in NYC.  It is clearly the work of an individual on the outside, looking in 
 This book is uniformly praised by ignorant people who want to believe the Warren Commission. Posner saw an opportunity to take their money, and he took it. Good for him. I'm sure if there was a sizable market of people wanting to believe OJ was innocent, he'd write that book too, with all sorts of convincing "scientific" evidence. Take a look at Weisberg's Case Open, if you can find it , for documentation of some of Posner's more amusing misrepresentations.   
 IMO, this is a terrible book for beginners.  The structure is non-linear; within the first few pages the author references more advanced Photoshop techniques as if the reader understands what he's referring to.  Frankly, I'm surprised the "for Dummies" group ever published the book.  If you're new to Photoshop, this book will almost certainly confuse & frustrate.   It simply is not a text that "Dummies" (read beginners) will get much out of.  I read the first 3 chapters, and I still had no understanding of Photoshop's basic features.   Perhaps it will be a good reference book as I become more adept at Photoshop, but I wanted a book that would teach me the basics.     I've found both the "Photoshop CS2 for Beginners" DVD and "Adobe Photoshop CS2 Classroom in a Book" to be far superior choices for Photoshop novices.  If I could rate this book a zero rather than a one, I would.      
 I'm a sucker for these "social satire" type novels, especially when they skewer the rich pretentious people in New York City for whom only the Ivys are good enough and who start with the fierce competition in preschool.  This book sounded like it would deliver that, but unfortunately, it bored me.  I was never really clear on why Laura wanted to be involved in this mess in the first place.  She is presented as having good, solid values, but she gets caught up in the competition madness anyway.  Which she admits, but then her claims to be somehow "better" or have "more common sense" than the other characters do not stand up to scrutiny.  But then there was the book itself...boring.  A major mystery revolves around who kills a hamster.  Could there be a sociopath-in-the-making, some "evil" young child who is a hamster-murderer?  Which children attend therapy?  Could a child have some awful disorder that would make him or her do this?  Obviously, since the hamster-killer will be rejected from the exclusive school, it is imperative to find out just who wrung the hamster's neck, and as soon as possible.  Competitive parents are trying to lock other children out of the prestigious school by falsely accusing other children of hamster-murder.  I mean, come on.  Could this happen?  I suppose so.  Is it funny or satirical?  No.  It's not portrayed well enough to be funny, and it's much too l-o-n-g and drawn out to be good satire.  I got really tired of hearing about the darned hamster.  Maybe the point is that these parents will freak out about everything, but unfortunately, the reader gets dragged through a bunch of "is it him?  is it her?  will my child be falsely accused?" hamster-murder BS until I was thoroughly sick of the whole thing.  It seems to me that good satire is not boring, but boy, is this preoccupation boring.  When we finally find out who killed the hamster and why, I was completely underwhelmed.  I didn't care about anyone at that point.  Of course there are the requisite "secrets" about the upper-crust parents, but I'm afraid they bored me as well.  I'm learning the hard way that just because a novel is described as satire, and the situation sounds very interesting, that does NOT make it good reading.  I'm having a similar struggle getting through Claire Messud's latest, but I will try it again.    Satire should be interesting, and the fact that so many authors fall back on the Candide device (wide-eyed innocent observing a bunch of weirdos) is getting extremely tiresome.  Especially when Candide compromises her principles to be part of the popular crowd and then has an unrealistic "revelation" at the end.  Please, give me Edith Wharton any day over this 
 I am in eleventh grade Advanced Placement (AP) English and this is the first book I have ever read that has made me want to learn another language. This writer has no respect for his readers with his continously confusing run-on sentences and distracting word placement. Furthermore, he has no respect for the "laws" of the language, that are put there to keep from this very disgrace of a novel of ever happening. I will never read another William Faulkner novel; for this one has made me feel like my intelligence has been stripped from me. In plain, American, understandable English: THIS BOOK STINKS 
 I love my Dyson vacuum because it works better than any other vacuum I've ever owned and I have spent more money on other vacuums and I have been disappointed until now.  But the floor attachment is an overpriced piece of junk and I am being polite.  Mr. Dyson should have made it differently because I am afraid of scratching my wood floors with this attachment 
 I am a 40something male, diagnosed with MS 10 years ago.  Ms Davis seems to have missed her mark! When she writes about "finding your bliss", is she kidding me?  Bliss for most of us who suffer from MS would be to just have 10 minutes without pain, discomfort (I won't start with a list).  Ten minutes, that's all.  Just take away our pain (body and mind)just for this brief instance, would be beyond any bliss you could imagine.  Her biggest and most damaging issue is that NOT ONCE DOES SHE ADDRESS THOSE OF US WHO SUFFER FROM PAIN!  Mostly pain in our bodies, how to deal with it, what to do, who to turn to.  Who is she kidding?  She must not an issue with pain, only numbness.  This is understandable, MS is different in each case.  Actually, if I had to choose, I would have gone more twoards the numbness (in the event I had to make such a horrible choice)  Her Ten steps to moving beyond.... should be retittled: "My walk down the yellow brick road and it like totally stressed me out".  In "Lean on Me" who is there to lean on?  Don't wast your time with this book.  I only give it one star for the references made in the book i.e. web addresses, orginizations etc.  It's the only reason I'm going to keep the book, it will be on my shelf in the reference section.  Sorry Ms Davis, but I had to tell it like "I" see it, in thousands of people.  Just ask Montel Williams about his "pain" issue 
 My problem was that these books were missing chunks of pages!  We didn't notice it until book 4 of 6, but 80+ pages were gone!  Now, Amazon was great about replacing the set adn paying for me to return the messed-up set.  This is just a warning to check your boxed set when it gets in for missing chunks of pages!  Of course, the Harry Potter series is great, adn we love having them in paperback 
 I have read the other reviews with great interest.   N. J. Dawood's translation of the Qur'an is as close to being worthless as it is possible for an English translation of the Qur'an to be. The errors and mistranslations are such that many consider it to be perilously close to blasphemous. At best, it is absolutely impossible to get a clear understanding of what the Qur'an is really saying from Dawood's attempt to render the Qur'an into modern English.  He changed the traditional Sura order to the chronological Sura order (i.e. the Suras in the authentic Quran are not arranged in the order in which they were revealed). This indicative of his excessive license with the work, as well as his clear contempt for the original. An Iraqi Jew, Dawood excercises considerable self-aggrandizment with his claims that Jewish and Christian teachings influenced the Prophet. These and other liberties demontrate his unwillingness and incapacity to produce an accurate and unbiased translation.  His mistakes of translation are beyond ridiculous: e.g. 'bani Adam" (correct translatied as 'children of Adam'; from al-Araf 7:31) is rendered as "children of Allah". In Al-Baqarah 2:191 'al fitnatu asyaddu minal qatl ("oppression is worse than slaughter")' is mistranslated as 'idolatry is worse than carnage". Space does not permit me to list the dozens and dozens of other errors which would be amusing if applied to any other book.  As a Muslim, my disgust for his translation is so adamate that I refuse to permit a copy of it in my home.  Because if this, I have absolutely no animosity or ill feelings towards any of those who posted vitrolic invective about the Qur'an: simply because they never read the Qur'an. They read N. J. Dawood's worthless poetry; which, of course, cannot provide them with a shred of useful information with which to make an informed choice in the matter. I will not hold people's ignorance against them.  With all the sincerity at my command, I advise all, Muslim and non-Muslim alike to shun Dawood's translation as you need not mere diseased swine 
 Fairy tales are written the way that they are written for a reason.  And when greedy producers and actors and directors realize this maybe the world will be a better place.  The characters in Fairy Tales aren't suppose to grow up. They are written for certain age groups and are moral lessons about concequences in life and how she/he's life will change depending on which choices that one will make and direction she/he follows 
 Only 38 pages into this book, I've had to put it down in sheer awe of how utterly inaccurate this book is.   From the questions it suggests you ask a prospective pediatrician to the AAP's "neutral" view on circumcision, this book is obviously written in a very biased undertone.   Thankfully, I got this from the library. All I have to do is return it and try and forget the bad, bad information it provided.   Keep looking 
 What really bothered me about Hudsucker Proxy: Capitalism is the wonder of the world providing food and subsidence to everyone, even Communist slaves and Fascist toady's under a democratic people; yet, Hollywood insists on blasting Corporate Culture, when the overwhelming majority of businessmen are not only honest, they are exemplary.   So much Hollywood talent and money wasted on a bad idea, so what else is new?  The Coen's have jumped the shark with this take off of the American Screwball Comedy of the 30's.  I cringed every time Jennifer Jason Leigh tried to imitate Katharine Hepburn's classic gargle.  The poor actress may have destroyed her career with this stinker.   I can't stand Tim Robbin's politics, but must admit that he is the best actor to play a fool in the movies.  He almost carries this farce.  Paul Newman; however, is collecting a check.  He's been collecting checks since the 50's.  His salad dressing stinks too.  I'm amazed at how much money the Coen's command in Hollywood on such flimsy pitches.  I loved Fargo and enjoyed The Big Lebowski (not as much as some cult fans), but this film, why did they bother? 
 Here's what this book never explained:  if you are WILLING to cook at all, you can cook anything you want.  So why do you need this book?  You don't.  Cooking for yourself is a personal hurdle that you either accomplish or you don't.  If you can get to the point of cooking at all, then you don't need this book...the world is at your dutch oven.  The advice in the book is nothing that you haven't read in ANY magazine that you can pick up, whether it's a men's health magazine or even any ladies magazine.  The recipes may as well have been gleaned from the same pages as those same magazines.  There was NOTHING in this book new.   This was a major league disappointment 
 The book talks about body language in general terms.  I wanted more practical insight that I could apply immediately in my interactions with people

 Having written one of the outstanding books in Christian studies, Misquoting Jesus, all of Bart Ehrman's future works will be compared to this exceptional piece. Unfortunately, the present book compares unfavorably. Very unfavorably.  The idea is brilliant. Let's learn about the early Christians by studying what they said about Peter, Paul, and Mary. Rather than hope to extract some historical kernals, Bart Ehrman seeks to learn how their tales, regardless of how wacky they are, tell us something about the needs of the era. Great idea. And in the first chapter, on Peter, he succeeds admirably. Then he appears to run out of steam, and Paul and Mary get short changed. For example, on page 223 he starts his final intro to the section on Mary by saying - "Were they [MM and the other women] really there to see these things happen, and if so, what role did they play in the events?" You can see he has completely forgotten his original premise of what the accounts tell us about the writers and listeners and is once more plowing the familiar field of "is it true or not?"  Worse still, there is a lack of precision throughout the book which makes it practically impossible to read through without stopping and thinking: "Now why does he say that?" Here's a partial list of the errors in this book:  "For Mark, Jesus was a suffering messiah..." (p. 17) Search as you will, you won't find the word "messiah" in the Gospel of Mark.   "...when Jesus declares that Simon will be called Petras...[and] will build his church." (p. 22)  Ehrman, more than anyone else, knows this is a later addition since Jesus had no intentions of building his own "church".   "After Jesus' death, his tiny band of followers..." (p. 23) Jesus' band consisted of thousands of people. It couldn't be described as "tiny"   "There's no archeological evidence to suggest any synagogue structure at all in Simon's day..." (p. 25)There is such evidence and scholars have debated whether or not this is a "public building" that was used as a synagogue or just a "public building". The issue is still debated, so it's misleading to offer Ehrman's blanket statement.   "...there really wasn't much choice for someone living in a poor village such as Capernaum. There weren't any condominiums for rent..." (p. 26). No, but there were many choices: houses, communal living, tents, caves, etc. The choice was not simply house or no house.    "...Jesus himself, a lower-class peasant from the hinterland" (p. 30). There is no reason whatsoever to assume Jesus is a "lower-class peasant" It is some people's theory, but there is little evidence that Jesus came from the lower classes. Indeed, his extensive religious training indicates otherwise, as does his familiarity with the issues confronting land owners and the wealthy. As does his presence at the wedding at Cana.  "By the time Jesus arrives at the house, the girl [Jairus' daughter in the Gospel of Mark] has already died..." (p. 31) What Gospel of Mark is Ehrman reading? Here's the actual quote - "And when he was entered in, he saith unto them, Why make ye a tumult, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleepeth." (Mark 5:39) Does that sound dead to you?   "...taking with him only Peter, James, and John, before whom he becomes greatly agnonized..." (p. 31) Again, Ehrman must be reading from the Secret Secret Gospel of Mark. If you read Mark (14:33-41), you'll find that the disciples are asleep when Jesus becomes "greatly agonized"   "Has there ever been a Christian figure as controversial as the apostle Paul?" (p. 89). Duh. How about Judas? How about Mary Magdalene? Surely they are as controversial as Paul, if not more so.  "...including those of Greek and Roman mythology, such as Zeus, Apollo, and Athena..." (p. 103) All 3 of these Gods are Greek, not Roman.   "We have only one surviving author...from among the Pharisees before...70 CE...it's the apostle Paul." (p. 105) Really? Did Ehrman ever hear of Josephus?   "...one woman is called Mary Magdalene (literally, Mary of Magdala)." (p. 188) No, not literally. Some authors believe that the name meant Mary "the Tower" (Starbird) or Mary "The Great" (Baigent). It's possible it did mean Mary of Magdala, but it's certainly not the literal meaning.   "...this sinful woman who anoints Jesus in Luke 7 is not Mary Magdalene, because Mary Magdalene is actually introduced by Luke in his very next story..." (p. 189). Ehrman knows as well as anyone that gospel pericopes were moved around, so there can be no valid argument that her "introduction" in one verse precludes her appearance in a prior verse. Take Mark 3:21, for example. Here the translation reads that the family is upset with Jesus and then the family shows up a few verses later. Yet if 3:21 is correct, they are already there and can't possibly show up later (Mark 3:31). Pericopes do not offer chronological order, and Ehrman should know better.  "Mary was a Galilean Jewish woman..." (p. 195). There is no evidence that Mary came from Galilee. She is mentioned as having traveled with Jesus along with other woman from Galilee (Mark 15:41), meaning only that she had been in Galilee (although, strictly speaking, one can interpret Mark as meaning that only Salome was from Galilee). There is absolutely nothing that implies Galilee is her home, only that she travelled from there.   "Jesus, of course, abandoned his livelihood as a carpenter/woodworker..." (p. 198).  Of course NOT. There are many definitions of tekton, only one of which is carpenter. He could have been a builder, a general contractor, a scholar, a stone mason, etc.   "...it's virtually impossible to explain the rather troubling circumstance that he chose 12 male disciples to be his closest followers." (p. 200) Ehrman mistakes what the gospels say with what Jesus did. The gospels say he had 12 disciples but no gospel ever lists all 12 names. Some gospels list as few as 7 names and the most names are 10. That leaves plenty of room for women to have been named as disciples and for their names to have been edited out of the gospels, a practice which Ehrman, as much as any other scholar, is aware of.   "Jesus established a solid...reputation for attracting... prostitutes..." (p. 201) Search as you will, all 4 gospels, you won't find the word "prostitute" in any of them. Sinners, yes. Prostitutes, no.   "In Mark's account of the passion..while being nailed to the cross..." (p. 219). Jesus is never nailed to the cross in any version, much less Mark. There is a reference to the hands in Luke (24:39) and in John (20:25) they mention nails, but not in Mark. Mark's version says nothing about being nailed to the cross.  "...all our accounts agree that Jesus was crucified..." (p. 222). Actually that's not true. There are several accounts that indicate that Jesus was hung from a tree (e.g., Acts 5:30, 10:39, and 13:29; Galatians 3:13; 1 Peter 2:24; Polycarp's letter to the Phillipians, etc). I'm not saying that's what happened, but it's simply not true that "all our accounts" say he was crucified.   I could go on, but you get the point. And I've only selected the obvious errors here.  Bottom line - this book was an excellent idea, but the execution was flawed and the enormous number of errors precludes me from recommending it. 
 I was a huge fan of the jam , but Ive grown to despise Paul Weller and this CD strengthens my view. This is a covers cd and hasn't got a patch on albums like all mod cons or sound affects.With paul weller everything is about a  quick buck and ripping off a loyal fan base , with over a dozen jam compilations ,rarities, box sets and dvd's in the last few years.[since he bought the exclussive rights to all the jam recordings from the rest of the band].This album is bland  so give it a miss and spend your money on the new stiff little fingers cd which features bruce foxto 
 The legs were a bit tricky to put down, and when I did, I busted the mounts. Never even used this thing & threw it away. Coleman makes one that I bought that's better built, and Excalibur Electronics has one available as well that I also bought - I like Excalibur's better, but both are better than this piece of junk. All 3 brands are in the same price range. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of portable ac/dc fan options out there... I bought these for camping in Florida 
 We collect a lot of DVD's!  I was quite excited to file them in this system. We have a smaller version that DOES have the three rings. Huge mistake in changing that.  It is extremely difficult to file in DVD's in this storage system (the smaller one is great).  Also, to ensure the movie is protected we like to place the whole sleeve on top of the player and then refile after viewing.  Can't do that with this system.  Buy the pages individually and put them in your own three ring binder.  
  ...as noted in other reviews here, hydrogen is simply an energy carrier (not a source) -- like a battery.   Here is an interesting quote:  " ...hydrogen offers little to no potential to produce oil security and reduce climate change risk in the next 20 years.  (Changing the infrastructure for using hydrogen fuel cells for transportation)  ...is a many decades undertaking.  Hydrogen fuel cells for transportation, are in my judgment, a snare and a delusion..."     -- James Woolsey, former CIA Director.  
 Perhaps English majors will enjoy this book, but I didn't. The author constantly draws parallels between encryption and totally unrelated literature. Treating foreign languages or the Bible as a type of  cryptography is going too far. If you're a Poe fan, this book is for you,  but if you'd rather learn something about cryptography, find another book 
 Although Goodman is generally attributed as on of the leaders of the Anti-Realist position, Ways of Worldmaking does not provide a good argument for that position.  Goodman's talk is highly open to interpretation, but  most interpretations lead to trivial truth or outlandishly bizarre  scenarios.  The lack of detailed argument makes refutation difficult, but  still it is a must read for those interested in what Anti-Realism is 
 I'm not going to say I'm a long-time Death Cab fan, but my fondness for the band has led me through their entire catalogue, from Transatlanticism all the way back to You Can Play These Songs With Chords, my personal favorite being We Have The Facts... I tend to prefer lo-fi indie rock, though the sheer strength of Death Cab's songwriting kept me a fan up through Trans.   A lot of people will think I'm ridiculous for saying that this is Death Cab's worst batch of songs ever. Sure, the lyrics for Follow You Into The Dark flow perfectly from one line to the next and are even visually vivid, but it doesn't even sound like Ben Gibbard is trying anymore. It's the distillation of all the clever word-play he's been perfecting over the years, and this is the pinnacle, except the key ingredient - emotional conviction - is noticably absent. That seems to be the best way for me to describe Plans - perfectly clever and absolutely predictable songs that rely on studio polish instead of sincerity.  This is fiction, not fact, for the first time in years.   It's a trait noticable down to the CD cover. Something About Airplanes comes with a textured CD book with holes punched through so you can see the subsequent pages, where-as Plans comes with a glossy, plasticy booklet. It's an entirely different aesthetic at work than on the previous albums that seemed so uniquely vulnerable.   To be fair, there's only one other person I know who detests this album like I do, so odds are, if you're reading this review, you will in fact enjoy Plans. My guess is that most Death Cab fans have already purchased this and made up their minds, or have decided to steer clear altogether. If you heard DCfC on the radio, it's more than likely that big studio productions don't grate on your nerves the way they do on me, so you probably won't have the same qualms with the album I do. I just had to throw in my two cents and hope that some of you will check out Death Cab's earlier work, because this is far far far from their best. And if "lo-fi" scares you, check out The Photo Album. It's a good example of polished integrity 
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 Picked it up at Tower the other day ($9.99),because I like the DMB and now I see you can pick it up at Amazon for a $1.36.  At that cheap of a price,that should pretty much clue you in that something was up.  Not a very good outing(bad production).  Murky.fuzzy.lacking in general fidelity.  It sounds as if it were dubbed to death.  Were these guys even together in the same recording studio ?  DMB is a "jam" band, and this album just sounds as if that magical element is missing.  When I listen to other DMB albums,it sounds(and feels)like everybody is having a good time.  Kind of wooden and by the numbers on this one.  When DMB is on ,they are as good as it gets,but when they are off...  I wanted to pick up the newer DMB,but since Sony pulled the DRM incident,that album will not be on my playlist ANYTIME soon 
 Steven Pinker lost me as a buyer of his thesis with the very second sentence of his book:   "For you and I belong to a species with a remarkable ability: we can shape events in other's brains with exquisite precision".  It you take that for granted, Pinker's book will seem compelling and not especially controversial. Steven Pinker clearly takes it for granted, perhaps because he can't conceive of how we could possibly communicate effectively and coherently if it were not true.   Consider the following, which I think perfectly encapsulates the world view Pinker can't conceive of, by Ogden Nash:  Caught in a mesh of living veins, In cell of padded bone, He loneliest is when he pretends That he is not alone.  We'd free the incarcerate race of man That such a doom endures Could only you unlock my skull, Or I creep into yours.  To my way of thinking, it is the very fact that we *can't* "shape events in other's brains with exquisite precision" - or with any reliable certainty at all, that describes the human condition. The frisson created by precisely that ambiguity underpins all communication; it is the source of irony, tragedy, comedy, invention and imagination. Any theory of language which denies that fundamental contingency of human communication (as this one does) is going to have to prove it, and displacing that onus is a heavy task indeed.  Pinker's psycho-linguistics makes precisely that denial, by holding that all human communication - every language - shares an inate, evolutionary programmed Universal Grammar, precisely because Pinker can't conceive how else human communication could be possible.  I'm no academic, and certainly I have no background in linguistics. Given that this theory - which is from the same tradition as Noam Chomsky's - has been the ascendancy amongst academic linguistics for the best part of the last thirty years, Steven Pinker being one of the leading "normal scientists" within the paradigm (if I should be so bold as to use that word), and that The Language Instinct is considered fairly widely to be his magnum opus, I was expecting to have my naive relativistic assumptions carefully and systematically dissected, then annihilated, one by one.  So imagine my surprise to find that in the place of carefully drawn arguments and compelling statistical data, one finds a tissue of anecdotal arguments carefully selected to fit the theory, arguments from authority ("Chomsky is one of the ten most cited writers in all of the humanities"), dubious suppositions in place of statistical data (the "it is difficult to imagine the following grammatical construction being used" sort of thing),  begged questions, non sequiturs, and Roger Penrose-style irrelevant scientific waffle - especially as regards evolution - and a decided absence of any consideration of competing theories of linguistics - and straw men versions of those which do rate a mentioned.   In short, Steven Pinker employs just about every illegitimate arguing technique in the book. His theory completely fails to account for metaphor (metaphor is barely mentioned in the book), nor the incremental development of language, the evolution of different languages with different grammars and vocabularies. At times Pinker is forced to argue that the grammar of our language is sometimes different from the words we actually speak and write, containing unspoken "inaudible symbols" representing a word or phrase which has been moved elsewhere in the sentence, so the sentence "The car was put in the garage", according to Pinker's Universal Grammar should technically be rendered as: "was put the car in the garage", and the construction we use can only be explained by movement of "The car" and the insertion in its place of an inaudible "trace":  "[The car] was put [trace] in the garage".  Now, again I am no technical linguist, but this has all the hallmarks of pure bull manure to me.  Finally, Pinker is at pains to point out that Universal Grammar is only ever applicable to oral language: written language didn't arise for centuries after oral grammar "evolved" as a phenotype.  But this hardly helps Pinker, since (as he himself points out, with reference to a transcript of the Watergate Tapes) when people talk in ordinary conversation they almost *never* use complete grammatical sentences: they interrupt themselves, they rely on physical gestures, they break off in mid stream and start a new thought, they don't punctuate (there's no unequivocal punctuation in spoken English), all the time.   As is fashionable amongst the "reductivist" and "evolutionary" set these days (a set I would otherwise, in general terms, consider myself in agreement with), relativist arguments are scorned. But Pinker's paradigm implies that, provided we are competent in constructing our own sentences, we should all understand each other perfectly, all the time: there should be no ambiguity; no room for miscontrual; no possibility for evolution in ideas or language. It is difficult to see how anyone could believe such a thing. But neither the structure of language and grammar nor its practical use needs to be perfect for effective communication *at some level* to be possible, and surely that is all that is needed. The beauty of the contingent view of language, which Pinker seems unable to appreciate, is how it can account for the missed margin of communication which might explain the everyday cultural and interpretative problems we all face, and the figurative and metaphorical power we all find at our disposal. Ogden Nash's dilemma is our dilemma, however much Steven Pinker might wish it were otherwise.  An earlier reviewer has mentioned Geoffrey Sampson's "the Language Instinct Debate" as a compelling antidote to Pinker's world view. Having recently read it (on the strength of that recommendation), I would firmly agree. In perhaps an ill-advisedly grumpy tone, Sampson - whose position at the University of Sussex inevitably means his academic profile is lower than Pinker's or Chomsky's - systematically and convincingly annihilates many of the arguments (such as they are) in Pinker's work.

 I used this book as a resource on a Global Warming paper I was doing in college. While some of the information in the book is useful, most of the book is a transparent attempt by a couple of democrats to bash the oppositions leader.  The authors often abondon intellect and quality prose for childish and mean spirited cheap shots at the Bush administration. I don't agree with Bush's environmental policies either but authors of a book should be more careful about how they let their emotions play out 
 This is a good book for those gardeners with lots of experience under their green thumbs. However, being a novice, first time gardener I did not find much useful `growing' tips here. Of the 200 tips I found only 1-2  dozen tips that actually pertain to the beginning and raising of plants.  The book is loaded with suggestions for designing garden layouts  (aesthetic), plant combinations for color, contrast, texture and form. The  author gives numerous suggestions for different species of perennials, and  some of their characteristics.  If you are like me, a first time gardener,  looking for tips on growing in general, I would not recommend this book. I  just want to grow a few Ipomoea (wink) violacea in my back yard and this  book is not very helpful. If however you are experienced and have a yard  full of perennials already, if you are looking for new color schemes,  garden layouts or yard presentation, then this book is more geared toward  you 
 It does cool your coffee by tipping the mug to fill the reservoir -- not something you want to do while you are driving.  The more you drink the further you have to tip the mug.  Also, the lock position on the mug does not work causing coffee to spill out if the mug is tipped over.  
 When I try to watch this, I have to turn the sound on my TV all the way up to hear it and even then it's still too low. Some parts are better than others, but I was not pleased with the sound recording quality 
 I love Putumayo Kids collections because I find them to be great for adults too, but this is an exception.  This CD is the only exception, I don't find the instrumentals or lyrics fun, or interesting on this CD- not something I want to listen to 
 Berenstain bear books are usually great reads, with a good lesson within the fun and enjoyable text.  This story had a good message, but wasn't a fun book to read.  I lost attention, and attentiveness.  My voice as i read it became slowly more monotone.  If you want a strickly educational book, its better to read them the dictionary 
 I get the impression that the reader from NH is the only reviewer to have tried to solve some of the problems in this book.  There is no possible way to solve these problems.  They are on subjects and situations not covered in the book, and even if they were, good luck in understanding Bejan's writing.  He skips massive steps, giving only solutions and equations without explanations.  Not everyone like reviewer Jeff Booth was born understanding convective heat transfer, so some of us must learn from books.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy this one.  I only hope that Dr. Bejan reads these reviews and that they discourage him from making another failed attempt at text book writing 
 I'd think if I were Dyson, I would recall all of these. Big, Bulky Pricey, and worthless. I thought turbines were designed to spin? It certainly does not compare to the vacuum at all.  Bought a real one for $17 (shiping included) Eureka Power Paw, Dyson should be ashamed 
 This is maybe a 4 Star book - IF, and ONLY if, this is the first book on Jack Welch and GE you have picked up.  If you have already read "Jack" skip it.  There is nothing here that hasn't already been said elsewhere. I was disappointed how little "new" information was presented in this book.  If you are looking for something on the topic of controlling your own destiny this title is somewhat misleading.     
 I have to say that I was not familiar with any Darkman comics, or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot compare the character to other sources. Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" Darkman prior to the film I have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment! There are the obvious comic book characteristics that one finds in these types of movies, like the Shadow, Batman etc, which is interesting.   Nevertheless, Darkman was quite a disappointment considering the make-up of the cast: Liam Neeson, Larry Drake, and Frances McDormand among others.  It is the story of a scientist who falls victim to a group of gangsters resulting in his horrendous disfigurement.  In an effort to exact revenge, he makes use of his latest invention in order to appear like his targets/victims....   In short, the acting and the plot are average (nothing great), while the dialogues are way below average.  The movie falls into the action/adventure/horror type of category.   The characters are, overall, bland and just plain uninteresting (e.g. Rick Anderson played by the "fool," Ted Raimi, from the Xena series). Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...   In a nutshell, it's not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.  No masterpiece here... 2 Stars 
 Badly organized book.  Repetitive text and graphs.  Stretching theories.  Bad analogies.  Hardly provide any useful framework can be used in real life.  Like the auther is sitting in a small dark room and murmuring to himself 
 This is not a good book.  The time I have spent reading this book has been mostly wasted.  It does not compare to say, Bury's writings 
 Burke's "Connections" is an excellent reference source. It aroused a passion within the reader to progress further with this fascinating subject, of how significant events were connected, and how technology devolped from them. The Pinball Effect is a good example of an author, that like Clive Custler, should have stopped writing while they were ahead. A very boring rea 
 This toys purpose is to sort your change, and it performs poorly. In mine, the quarters get stuck unless you pour coins in one by one, which takes forever. If you pour more than one coin in they get stuck or little coins fall into the slots for bigger coins. In mine the quarter got stuck in the dime slot blocking it, it no longer works 
 I would love to try this. First one was shipped broken (make a clanking noise and woulnd't work). Sent it back and got a new one that didn't read a DVD.  I may try one more time. Its pretty heavy, but I am hoping the larger screen is better then other small portables or i-pod type machines 
 Even though I have never read the book I found this Production very good. I would recommend this to any one who is a Dickens Fan but do youself a favour and dont buy this DVD release. As a British review on Amazon uk site indicated this DVD looks as if it was copied straight off the TV and also the commentary in the beginning and end of the movie telling us about the Great Expectations novel made the DVD worse. Masterpiece Theatre has spoiled this Great BBC Production of Dickens Great Expectations with it's Commentary (even though they think they are being helpful- but are not) and poor DVD.  Four Stars for the Production itself but giving this Two stars because of the DVD quaility. Wait until BBC Release a DVD of the Production and the DVD quaility will be much, much better. I will be selling this DVD and wait until BBC release the DVD in Australia.  
 If only you knew what chiropractic was really about. It's not just about getting your back "cracked" when your in pain. There are hundreds, if not thousands of applications of chiropractic to the human body. One of the biggest secrets of chiropractic is it's proven success to help women conceive children -- yes, you heard right. While attending Palmer College (my first year -- 2004) I came across the book: Soup for the Chiropractic Soul. As I read, I was amazed at some of the wonderful stories of people healed through chiropractic. None more though, than the several stories of woman conceiving after years of trying without success with other "help". Chiropractic is often seen as a last resort (this is starting to change). You see, the nervous system controls the entire body and how it responds to stimulus (temp regulation, hormone regulation ...) and if in any way the electrical messages sent from the brain to organs are disturbed by what chiropractors call a subluxation (less than a luxation -- a small dislocation in the spinal column) you can have problems (in this case conceiving -- you know that conditions have to be optimal to conceive). The nerves which innervate the reproductive system (found passing through the lumbars L2, L3) must stay clear of interference (because of subluxations), otherwise disfunction of the body can occur. Still don't believe -- that's your prerogative, but I've got a 20 month old daughter that tells me otherwise (we tried for years to conceive before giving chiropractic a try -- and in only two months she was pregnant). I'm one of the biggest skeptics out there -- I need to see something work before I believe in it -- Well, I'm convinced; chiropractic works. Check out the soup for the soul on chiropractic, you'll hardly believe it -- but I swear it's true.    Chiro200 
 Man oh man...I love documentaries and character studies.  Crumb, Capturing the Friedmans, The Thin Blue Line etc...  But THIS...my god, the mind boggles at the level of pretentiousness of the folks who claim to "love" or "get" this horrible mess.  Over an hour and a half of two crazy women who are essentially shut-ins rambling on about nothing at all in what looks like an abandoned shack surrounded by vermin and garbage a foot deep.  The two women in question are "Big Edie" and "Little Edie", the aunt and cousin of Jackie O respectively.   Let me sum up the whole 100 minutes for you;  Little Edie: I hate it here. I had to leave New York to come here and take care of my mother. Big Edie: I was fine. I used to have a lovely singing voice. Little Edie: But I missed out on my big chance to make it. Big Edie: Oh well. You missed out. Little Edie: I miss New York. I hate it here. Big Edie: Did you feed the cats? Little Edie; YES!!! I fed them!!! Big Edie: I used to have a lovely singing voice.   Now imagine this being repeated over and over again for 100 minutes.   Do yourself a favor; Before you let anyone talk you into seeing this piece of dreck just go sit on skid row for 2 hours and listen to the rambling of the hobos and mental patients.  You'll save the money and get some fresh air at the same time.   Horrible. Just plain horrible 
 I would avoid these discs.  I have been using these discs for some time doing backups.  Recently, I've had a few problems and decided to look at these further.  I noticed another review that said that the discs are made by multiple companies under the Memorex brand as are others like TDK, etc..  I used to DVD info and noticed that my most recent purchase is made by CMC and I'm having problems with some of the discs including burn errors. One disk has strange ring in the die.   I have the NEC 1300a burner.  I also having some trouble playing backups on the same drive on my computer. Less trouble playing on my Sony DVD player. Just based on this (not a clear indication of what you're getting when you purchase), I would go with something else. These discs are not cheap enough for this reason. 
 I have wanted to read this book since I first heard of it. A timely Christmas present solved the first part of the problem; I eagerly jumped in immediately. And found many many problems.  The book is badly organized, repetitive, tedious, cliche riddled, prone to tarring with very broad brushes, and outrageously oversimplified. In fact, the book tells a great story in a terribly flawed way, much as the history books she reviews do. But she has no one to blame but herself. I could list many examples, but some of the other reviewers have done a good job on that. Let me just tackle one.  When knocking the attacks that originate on the "right", she lumps all manner of wildly divergent groups together. Names are strung together as if they all believe the same things, seek the same limitations, oppose the same passages. The "right" is a block of thinkers all trying to squelch evolution (which she blithely dismisses), ugliness, Satanism, secular humanism, on an on, blah blah blah. She never addresses whether the objections of some might be more valid than others. Whether the virulent anti-Christianity she so properly complains about later in the book might not be worth questioning and opposing  No, she knows the perfect answer to every problem, she knows the proper amount of negotiation required, she arrogantly can determine just where the proper "middle" path is.  Just as the windbag authors she excoriates know. It is hard to keep your voice out of the discussion when you feel passionately.  A limitation I didn't see mentioned elsewhere is pedagogical. The kind of teaching she imagines cannot happen in high school. Read two textbooks? As a former teacher, if I could have gotten my students to read one book I would have been thrilled. But two different books describing the same facts? In a single year? With students three to five years below reading level? Whoa...not in 50 minutes a day, lady. Not happening 
 After buying, reading and finally discarting a ton of books on Astrology, card and hand reading, Nostradamus, you-name-it: the best way to take control of your life is to steer away from this kind of quackery. There is no such thing as destiny. If you believe in destiny and it being writen somewhere and predictable you'll live a slave of such archaic notion and people like these.  If Grant Lewi has ANY proof that there is any truth to Astrology, he should contact James Randi and claim his $1 million prize. It should be so easy. One has to wonder why hasn't he done so already.. 
 I don't remember seeing Isild Le Besco in any other films, but she does look a bit familiar.  If I have seen her elsewhere, it must have been in a role that she performed with much greater insight and finesse than Gwen from 'Girl's Can't Swim', or I definitely would remember.  I'm still not sure what the title actually means... something about young women struggling to find their way... blah blah blah... but, it actually wasn't a terrible film.  Nevertheless, Le Besco's performance is one of the most irritating I've seen in years.  I was reminded of Dorothy Parker's cutting remark when critiquing a Katherine Hepburn film: 'She runs the gamut of emotions from A to B.'   Le Besco was either shown with an extremely obnoxous smile plastered on her face, or she was smacking her friends or family in a 'hissy fit of rage'.  These tantrums always ended with Gwen running off to the sea with all the grace of a three-legged moose.  What made LeBesco's performance stand out even more was the fact that everyone else's performances were nearly flawless. This film was recommended to me after purchasing 'L'Effrontee', a truly marvelous picture.  While watching the first 30 minutes of 'Girl's Can't Swim' I could see that I was not the only person who admired 'L'Effontee's' subtle brilliance.  Obviously the director and/or screenwriter of 'Girl's Cant' Swim' intended on building upon the other film's message, but as a lark, they subtracted all of its poignance and sensitivity. I give the film 2 out of 5 because, despite its flaws, it is still superior to the vast majority of 'toejam' that hollywood produces each year 
 I'm a sucker for these "social satire" type novels, especially when they skewer the rich pretentious people in New York City for whom only the Ivys are good enough and who start with the fierce competition in preschool.  This book sounded like it would deliver that, but unfortunately, it bored me.  I was never really clear on why Laura wanted to be involved in this mess in the first place.  She is presented as having good, solid values, but she gets caught up in the competition madness anyway.  Which she admits, but then her claims to be somehow "better" or have "more common sense" than the other characters do not stand up to scrutiny.  But then there was the book itself...boring.  A major mystery revolves around who kills a hamster.  Could there be a sociopath-in-the-making, some "evil" young child who is a hamster-murderer?  Which children attend therapy?  Could a child have some awful disorder that would make him or her do this?  Obviously, since the hamster-killer will be rejected from the exclusive school, it is imperative to find out just who wrung the hamster's neck, and as soon as possible.  Competitive parents are trying to lock other children out of the prestigious school by falsely accusing other children of hamster-murder.  I mean, come on.  Could this happen?  I suppose so.  Is it funny or satirical?  No.  It's not portrayed well enough to be funny, and it's much too l-o-n-g and drawn out to be good satire.  I got really tired of hearing about the darned hamster.  Maybe the point is that these parents will freak out about everything, but unfortunately, the reader gets dragged through a bunch of "is it him?  is it her?  will my child be falsely accused?" hamster-murder BS until I was thoroughly sick of the whole thing.  It seems to me that good satire is not boring, but boy, is this preoccupation boring.  When we finally find out who killed the hamster and why, I was completely underwhelmed.  I didn't care about anyone at that point.  Of course there are the requisite "secrets" about the upper-crust parents, but I'm afraid they bored me as well.  I'm learning the hard way that just because a novel is described as satire, and the situation sounds very interesting, that does NOT make it good reading.  I'm having a similar struggle getting through Claire Messud's latest, but I will try it again.    Satire should be interesting, and the fact that so many authors fall back on the Candide device (wide-eyed innocent observing a bunch of weirdos) is getting extremely tiresome.  Especially when Candide compromises her principles to be part of the popular crowd and then has an unrealistic "revelation" at the end.  Please, give me Edith Wharton any day over this 
 Well, I read this "gem" because my 8th grader had to for class. Was the pig-rape scene or the graphic butchery of a beloved pet the most disgusting part?  I guess it's supposed to show  historical life in rural Vermont but I sure could have lived without it.  "Becoming a Man"?? There are far better books out there than this that can fit that bill. Long before my daughter remembers any "lessons" of this book, I'm sure the lingering descriptions of the rivers of blood and stench will stick with her. Plus, inbetween the great lessons we got about pig farming/butchery it's a pretty dull story. 
 Saw this on TV while Puppy sitting.  I have no love for comic books and their simple stories and two dimensional heroes. B-Film Movies based on their format are worse.  Made like the B-films of the thirties and forties, this film wreeks. Costuming is great. Its brilliance is in the technologies that created it but gets low marks in stories and characters. From the hansom heroic Sky Captain and his specially made P-40 sinister and mysterious Mad Scientist Professor Totenkopf whose robotic drones are robbing the world of materials for an unknown purpose while assasinating his former colleagues, this is really pathetic junk. The heroine or Love interest is clueless, slightly airheaded and not trustworthy. In one scene she walks through jungle on high heals. The sidekick is rayguns on the brains. Plot is plotless.   Overall, this film is interesting technology but otherwise awful. 
 Not exactly the "vaults" blowing open, as stated in the promo.  These are mostly leftovers and one-offs from the late 1990s, when the group was on hiatus from serious recording.  That's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows, literary journals and graphic design firms.  Whats good is the material that was recorded for albums and subsequently rejected, such as "Reprehensible", "Rest Awhile" and "Certain People I Could Name".  But there are too few of these real songs, and they'd have fit a lot better on that long-awaited b-sides collection from their major label career 
 I don't mind that the original bleeped-out words are still bleeped on the DVDs... that's how the show was. (For example, I think the Viva La Bam DVDs would, for the most part, be funnier with the original tv bleeps.)  I don't mind that the original blacked-out and pixelated views are there... that's how the show was (and trust me, we're better for it).  With that being said, here's the real problem -- this is not presented in an as-aired episode format. Of course I should have realized that "volume" does not mean "season", but "season" is what everyone expects from a tv show DVD. That's how every other tv show is realeased; even the Wildboyz and Viva la Bam DVDs are presented in episode format.  This box set lacks because the bits are somehow funnier when viewed in context of the original episode. The recurring themes within the episodes are funnier. It's also much more convenient to sit down and watch an episode or two whenever you want. Instead, it all gets lost in the 2-hour marathon format of each "volume". Additionally, as many reviewers have mentioned, many of the classic bits are absent from this set.  Bottom line is, before you purchase this set, realize that many of the bits you remember may be missing. Also realize that each "volume" is a marathon of strung-together bits, and you will not see the actual episodes.  I suggest that die-hard Jackass fans actually not buy this set, because I think you will be more frustrated and upset in the end. Because of the "volume" format, you will probably only watch each disc once, then quickly retire it to the shelf. I regret that someone spent some good money buying this as a gift for me. I would gladly return it for only half it's original price if I could 
 Well, this book was a let down. It is a stereo typical book where all women are needy and all men sexed up and too blind to see anything..... The basis of this book seems to be affairs so if you don't need help getting past an affair, don't waste your time.... 
 The words are so crowded. So I won't suggest this one 
 This book is geared for someone that has alot of free time to herself. Perhaps someone that is a stay at home wife or has retired and has all the time in the world to do Mariel's suggestions. If you are busy with a job because you have to work like most people, than this book is not for you 
 I, also, must second Mark Twain. This book is a waste of time! Why do teachers make us read it when we should be reading Tolkien, GK Chesterton, CS Lewis, and the like? Agh. Then, that could just be my wacky taste in novels...   But this was bad. Oh my gosh!!! The descriptions were ALWAYS needlessly long, the conversations ALWAYS needlessly long, the... blah, blah, blah, blah. That's what the whole thing was. Blah. The whole plot could have been totally condensed to a hecka short 200 pg novel and it would have been a million times better! Maybe even good! And I like long books!   This book is terrible. Listen to the warning of a fellow voracious reader and do not waste your time! 
 i was given this book read it and was sad telling my best friend who understands my fascenation with tesla how bad this book is do not buy this book. if you have access to a collection of patents by tesla so much the better 
 If you're interested in a short, quick/easy read with insight into the conflict of modern Indian women, then this book is for you.  I was only slightly intersted in the topic but purchased the book based upon the glowing reviews and because I enjoy reading an author's first work. I thought it was sad, but interesting, and thought the author did a good job portraying the conflicts experienced by modern Indian women, in terms of tradition, expectations, family and cultural influences.   While I thought the characters were well developed and enjoyed how the novel was written through differen vantage points in terms of time and characters, I thought the storyline itself was a too underdeveloped and finished the book wanting something more and feeling unfulfilled.   
 The National Enquirer has gone off the deep end and beyond the point of common decency.  To now attack a sweet, wonderful, charitable guy like Clay Aiken is very very sad.  To go after celebrities whose lifestyles are sensationalized is one thing, but to go after a quiet humble guy like Clay is another.  And now what? Is he supposed to justify their existence and have to defend this garbage.  Their story is ludicrous and they owe Clay, his family, and all of his fans a big apology.  I will not buy this filthy rag or any American Media products ever again 
   First, I know this review looks too long, but it might help you out. So please, read on.  I read a few of the "chapters" (exercise sections) of this book and found it to be a little too conversational. Sure, we all value a charming and witty instruction book to a dry academic one, but I still think she brings nothing new to this genre of book.    It seems like she could easily have gotten all of these ideas from other writing books, seminars and articles, and frankly, most of them are better written than this one. You've probably encountered most of the ideas put forth in this book, beginning with an intro akin to:    "Oh, we all say we're going to write, but we never get around to it. Well never, fear, because [insert generic writing guide book title] is here to kick your rear in gear!"    Something like that.     There are really so many different types of books, kits, articles, memoirs, classes and manifestos on the subject of writing, exercises, inspiration and so forth. (Just do a search on Amazon for Writing Instruction or Writing for Publication.)  I really can't recommend this book, though.      Unfortunately, the author also thinks it's cute or somehow necessary to write quite a few words in ALLCAPS to add emphatic notice to the concept. Personally, I think that WRITING like THIS every few PAGES looks unprofessional and can be quite IRRITATING. This stylistic flaw alone makes me wonder whether she's a very credible source. Is font manipulation creative? Sure, to an extent, but "all-caps" serves no purpose, and it's easy to do and banal.     I think that this work misses a point about writing: it requires self-discipline as well as inspiration and talent. It's easy and sometimes fun to get caught up in books like these, but really, if you just read a varity of nonfiction, novels and periodicals for a few hours each week you can begin to understand observational skills, and you won't need these silly little exercises.  You'll be inspired by what you read, and how the articles or whatever you read remind you of your own experiences.    So, the point is, if you feel that you need to spend money on a book like this, perhaps you don't have the ability to discipline yourself into a steady routine of journaling and writing. Buying a book like this one will allow you to read some tips and eventually forget about it. After brief excitement and productivity, you'll be back to square one; with no self-discipline, you'll never apply this book to your life week-by-week as you should. It will collect dust next to your yoga books.  I offer this criticism not to sound nasty, but to make you think about what you are buying.   It's simple to buy a Men's Fitness magazine, for instance, but it won't help you unless you actually work out routinely. Same thing.   I guess the bottom line is that this book is okay for a casual read, but look it over in a bookstore first to see if you really want to pay the price of owning it.   I give it about 2.4 stars. 
 I skipped the movie version of Ghost World when it came out because I could tell from the previews that it wasn't my cup of tea; stories of suburban angst make my skin crawl (ie: I hated American Beauty), suburban teenage angst even more so. But, I convinced myself a while back, there's no way I could NOT read the critically acclaimed graphic novel it was based on, right?  Best friends Enid and Rebecca are two unappealingly self-absorbed teenagers who project their own self-loathing onto everyone around them, stumbling through their final year of high school while slowly drifting apart from each other. Daniel Clowes chooses to tell their story almost too-subtly, offering discordant slice of life vignettes that attempt to illustrate their "growth" but mainly serve to remind the reader how annoying and shallow they are. It falls into the same trap many autobiographical efforts do, in every medium, of believing one's life is more interesting than it actually is, and I came close to putting it down, unfinished, several times.  Clowes' artwork is the main highlight here -- clean and, at times, unexpectedly emotive -- but it's neither enough to inject life into his dull, plodding story nor make his lead characters the least bit interesting. Charles Burns' Black Hole covers similar ground in a much more intriguing fashion, with a compelling story that is equal to his impressive artwork.  Ghost World: Don't believe the hype 
 Most of Ballard's books are large, well illustrated, and to the point. This one however spends most of the page count on his thoughts about the veterans aboard Ballard's research vessel, the battle itself, and WW2. I wouldn't mind reading about his thoughts in another book as he is usually very insightful but it wasn't what I bought this particular book for.  After Ballard's commentaries and the history sections we see only very little relating to the Yorktown and underwater archeology which is rather disappointing 
 This is required text for a graduate course I am taking, and I want to pull my hair out while being forced to read it. The political correctness in this book is overdone. One serious problem I had with this textbook was the way in which it seemed to start off on page 100 instead of page 1, because there is no introduction to Organizational Behavior. I don't know what to make of chapter 1...an HR manager's guide to political correctness on the job? The need to promote for diversity rather than for work performance? That is certainly what I got out of it. (Down with all white male CEOs!). It certainly doesn't introduce the diligent student to this subject. Sentences are long, drawn out, wordy. Concept paragraphs take a long time to come to the point.  I find myself daydreaming by the time I've read half a page and have to start over, and part of this problem is that every page includes at least one sidebar. On page 40 of this text, the author talks about Feng Shui and it's three C's of design: clean, clear, and comfort, followed by this question: "What about the chi in your work and personal spaces--are you taking best advantage of "good" chi?" I do not recommend this book either for personal growth or for use as a textbook 
 The title was the best part of this book.  Not worth purchasing - if you MUST read it check it out from the library or borrow it. Don't ask me for it - mine is headed for Goodwill because I can not stand to burn or trash a book. It was awful and vulgar.  Very disappointed. I hope someone else writes the book to fit the title.  Unfortunately I bought two books by the author and was disappointed with BOTH 
 I love Maysa's voice, but this CD is nothing special. The songs just aren't that good.  None of the songs made me want to listen twice.  I am disappointed with this effort 
 It is difficult, nay, impossible, to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious, money worshipping parasites, and that is exactly what we have in this novel.    Out of the blue a godfather appears, a deus ex machina, who offers an idealistic lawyer, Clay Carter, more wealth than he can imagine or use.  Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait, a very sharp, very large hook.  With apparent ease, this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble.  Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him, he immediately loses sight of reality.  What a hollow and useless individual he is, as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.  Whether or not there are such individuals (Enron?) is beside the point.  They may exist, but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories. The atmosphere in which they live is boring, as are their conversations, their lack of values, their hobbies, their sex lives, and their comeuppances.  Somehow, even in their fall, they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.  Having read most of Mr. Grisham's other books, I expected better from him.  
 ...and forgotten. Raw and ragged. Cliche-ridden. I consider albums like "Highway 61 Revisited", "Bringing It All Back Home", "Blonde on Blonde", "Blood on the Tracks" and hell, even "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" as worthy of five stars. Sorry, but this is just not in the same class or anywhere near those masterpieces. Those albums are deemed 'classics' for a reason. That said, I'm not at all a fan of the Band or many of Dylan's love songs so please take these things into consideration when contemplating the worth of both this review and this album 
 Maybe my rating is unfair but I expected a little deeper treatment of the topics mentioned in the title. Perhaps the title should give an indication that it is a broad treatment for the layman. It is a good book for an advanced high school reader or college freshman Most of the personal explorations of the author's musings required the use of a program that would have been only fair to include with the book or made accessible via the Net 
 I really like Scissor Sister's self titled album. Songs like "Take Your Mama" and "Mary" and their respective remixes will have me coming back.  That said, this utter piece of trash is bad enough by itself, but the fact that it's a cover is an insult to all that is Floyd. It's like Scissor Sisters sat down and tested out different annoying voices until they found one sufficiently annoying and grating enough to knock Syd Barrett into an even deeper level of insanity.  For a great cover that does PF right, check out Easy Star All Star's Dub Side of the Moon 
 I found this book to be offensively un-American.  The characters accuse our country and our government of all sorts of nefarious acts.  The best spy thriller fiction is based on fictional characters and actions in a world not totally removed from reality not an agenda of false premises.  I think the author is the real conspiracy theorist not the characters. 
 I did this program instead of my regular program with some interesting results.  My golf was about the same, but my feel in my short game was better, which I attribute to moving in different directions in the program.  I might have gotten the same thing from basketball, I don't know. However,  after 2 weeks of this, I felt my overall strength and endurance was down  from previous.  So what I did was borrow some of the movements, added them  back to my regular routine of basic weight training and cardio work. Borrow  the book from a friend or library, copy the best exercises and don't bother  with it after that 
 I was initially very excited to see this book was available.  The Komsomolets was the advanced technology "Mike" class submarine.  Designed with a titanium hull and advanced hull design, the submarine was a worry for the US Navy in the closing days of the Soviet Union.  However in 1989, a fire broke out on board while in the Norwegian sea, and this drove the submarine to the surface.  The fire spread and the submarine floundered and eventually sank, with considerable loss of life.  The present book's author, D. A. Romanov, was one of the designers of the submarine.  As such, he is ideally placed to discuss the technical issues and aspects that lead to this tragedy.  Unfortunately, a better title for this book might be "Lost in Translation".  It is immediately clear that the translator has no knowledge of submarines, and the translation appears to be almost a literal word for word version, with little regard for idiomatic phrasing. The result is an extremely awkward, and in many cases unintelligible book.  Two examples: "The supply of oxygen in these compartments was provided by the periodic opening of the corresponding valves in the oxygenated collector of the electro-laser in the electromechanical air regenerating system located in the second compartment."  A little further on the same page: "In accordance with the RBZh-PL-82 (appendix 15), the watchstander of the compartment must control the content of the oxygen in the atmosphere of the compartment no less than six times a day by use of a portable apparatus, independent from the condition of the automatic means of control." These border on some of the best technobabble since Star Trek: The Next Generation.   The official investigation by the Soviet Navy of the Komsomolets accident basically exonerated the crew and the leadership, instead blaming the accident on numerous "design pecularities" and "technical imperfections" of the submarine.  Romanov's thesis is that crew training and readiness were woefully inadequate, and the failure to routinely monitor oxygen systems led to a fire that started in compartment seven (the aftermost compartment at the stern).  The failure to control the fire by promptly discharging Freon -based extinguishing materials into compartment seven led to the fire spreading forward, and smoke spreading through the ventilation system. Confusion reigns in the few minutes after the fire develops, and precious time is lost in attempting to clarify the situation aft. Romanov systematically goes through the accident timeline and testimony and points out step by step how the crew and officers lost several chances to control and contain the fire and save the submarine. He defends the design of the submarine and condemns the poor casualty training and especially the lack of officer leadership in the disaster. Even when the decision was made to surface the submarine and discharge life rafts from special canisters built into the hull, the lack of training and preparedness conspires to kill additional men in the icy waters.  The deployment canister is designed to rapidly discharge the rafts into the water by having the bottom of the canister drop away and release the rafts. This operation is totally misunderstood, and instead the crew tries to lift the 200 lb rafts out of the top of the canisters.  Romanov also devotes a section near the end (Assault of the Pundits) to answering specific criticisms leveled at the submarine design.  I suspect that there may be a decent and intriguing story struggling to get out of this book; unfortunately, it didn't make it!    I was extremely disappointed in this book overall.  As noted above, significant sections of it are excruciatingly difficult to read and understand.  The language is extremely stilted, reminiscent of Cold War Tass press releases. There are a number of rather complicated block diagrams of key ship's systems throughout the book; these are labeled in Russian and there is no accompanying explanatory text.  The diagram titles are minimally helpful (e.g. sources of smoke and gas in compartments two and seven).  As such, they just fill space and do not aid the reader at all in understanding the technical arguments. The book does have some photos, although many were taken underwater after the sinking and are extreme close-ups.  Without some sort of context, it is next to impossible to say why any particular photo is shown and what the reader should take from the picture.  Unless you are an extremely hard-core Russian submarine fan, I cannot in good conscience recommend this book to you.     
 Being a specialty roaster since 1975 and being part of a local specialty roaster group. I can tell you that starbuck's main accomplishment is their marketing ability. The coffee they distribute is garbage, and this doesn't have to come from my mouth, it comes from people who come to me after tasting their supposed "specialty coffee."  Starbucks lost their specialty status the moment you could find them on every street corner and/or supermarket. Where they beat most is their non stop advertising and brainwashing of people. The reason starbucks got big was because there was noone around to fill that demand, or more importantly, due to the nature of the specialty market, noone who wanted to fill that position.  The amount of coffee they are forced to produce lead to only one scenario, inferior quality.  Concepts of mass production. Economics 101. The higher the demand, the less likely quality is to have influence. 
 Disappointed. As an English teacher, I expected a more compelling and less hokey use of Whitman.  The first story, of the deformed Whitman loving boy, was utterly unbelievable and the continuity was incredibly challenging 
 In my opinion this book is mostly circular advice. It's like coaching a basketball player on foul shooting and telling him little more than "make the shot."  There is a useful checklist on page 52.  I think the Falk and Fajans book is a better purchase. I recommend reading this book in your law school's library. I'm not sure why you would need your own copy 
 My son and I had great expectations for this game; our expectations quickly turned in to disappointment.  This "game" is really hard to call a game.  It's more like one long reading exercise.  Unlike many of the other L-Max games, wherein you learn the modules through interactive play, with this one you have to read and read and read the same story over again.  Once you complete the story, you can then go to another area to "unlock" the game.  Then in order to play the "game" you have to read some more. This is not the type of game where you can standby and provide guidance when needed, I found myself reading page, after page, after page, just to figure out for myself the objective of the "game" and then try to explain it to my son.  I felt the money I paid for this game was a waste, no wonder when I went to purchase it, it was the only one in stock. Buyers beware 
 This book went right off tangent, after the brilliant writing that started the series.  The side-story is pretty bland, doesn't provide insight so much as it rewrites the backstory, and the overall plot isn't expanded, it sounds like he mostly ran out of ideas and started to drag his other books into the story. 
 For those interested in the story of this war, go elsewhere. It is not here. The book is a speculation on the motivation of participants in the cultural conflict, and its consequences. I did not like the frequent suppositions-often they seem to be a figment of the authors imagination though no doubt founded in her vast knowledge of the subject. It just doesn't hold up as an historian's analysis 
 This book is a perfect example of people in ivory towers, and those who are afraid to admit they don't get it, jumping on a 5-star bandwagon. Faulkner titled this book perfectly, calling it The Sound And The Fury, while leaving out the rest of the phrase: signifying nothing. The first chapter is a noble, but failed, attempt at creativity. But almost no one, even the most well-read people, understands that the first chapter is written out of chronological order until they find out someplace else. The chapter's main point was as an excuse to get in Faulkner's description of what instigated the novel, a somewhat kinky description of looking up at the girl Caddy's muddy panties. A fatal flaw in the chapter, which never achieves a rhythm, is that Benjy, whose thoughts comprise the chapter, apparently has a photographic memory and thinks in completely lucid, complete sentences despite being an idiot. Caddy, the main character in a novel of stereotypes and pitiful prose, is actually a despicable trollop. She's characterized as Benjy's friend, but a careful reading shows that she only befriends him when it's convienent for her. Other chapters are even more sick than Benjy's castration, including the one with Caddy's brother lusting after her, or the hackneyed, cliché chapter with the old slave showing how much wiser she is than folk she serves. The Cliffs notes and other reviews perpetuate the idea that the book's theme is the downfall of the old plantation system. This is an invention; not found in the book. S&F, as Faulkner loudly hints in the title, is about nothing other than his infatuation with Caddy. It has no plot. And it is far from a great insight into the way people think. Only perverts think as these characters do. In the end, this novel is just page after page of sheer boredom. It's supposed to be a great book of human tragedy, but to feel tragedy you have to sympathize with the characters ... and all of the white characters in this novel are disgusting. All of its supposed great meaning, and the flip-flop in reviews from castigating to praising the experimental style, weren't dreamed up until 15 years after the first printing flopped, by literary professors who have to keep coming up with new ideas under the "publish or perish" law. It was only revisited because Faulkner did, eventually, write some good books. You want truly great writing? Try Steinbeck, Welty, Hemingway, Harper Lee, Dickens, Twain, Tolkien, Melville, Dostoyevsky, O. Henry, Wells, Verne, Maugham, Crane or even Rowling (Yes, Rowling. Her Potter books are complex, effortlessly intertwine several story lines and sublimely combine strong characterization, suspense and humor) 
 This is very expensive for what is essentially hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. which would cost the average person about 3 dollars. 
 Based on the novel The Big Arm by Clark Howard with a screenplay by Robert Roy Pool, this drama directed by Ben Bolt feels like an adaptation of a large canvas novel with all the detail left in, so that everything reads as subsidiary. Set in the Chicago of the 1950's, Matt Dillon stars as a dice player from Indiana seeking the big time. However, when you're juggling at least 4 plots it's only natural that not all of them will come together for a satisfying conclusion. The most promising one concerns Dillon's Hustler-like competition with Tommy Lee Jones as the owner of a strip club, with Jones having the same spot between the eyebrows as Dillon. The problem with filming dice is that the actual game is monotonous, so the best Bolt could do is create tension by delaying the next roll or the raising of financial stakes, though he does provide an early montage of Dillon with David Marshall Grant on a winning spree and falling dice and money to the sounds of Shake, Rattle and Roll on the soundtrack. The only other visual trick is the sparks of an overhead train on it's tracks as Dillon and Diane Lane as Jones' stripper wife kiss to Fever. The best of the screenplay is a laugh line of sarcasm and forboding given to Meg Hogarth as Dillon's mother re his dice mentor's funeral "I nearly got crushed in the crowd", and Cherry Jones as a Patsy Cline-like singer who sneaks up behind Dillon, covering his eyes with a guess who? Dillon says her perfume gives her away and she replies " Aint nobody gonna give me away but my daddy". This use of eyes and the eyes of the dice are also parallel with Bruce Dern as the husband of Lee Grant, Dillon's employer. Dern is a former dice champ who has been blinded, but unfortunately this plot point gets no payoff. Dillon is also given two romantic partners in Lane and Suzy Amis as a mother of a child out of wedlock. The madonna/whore dichotomy is rather obvious, and the symbolism worse, with Amis' child scoring points for her and the way Lane is presented so unflatteringly scores points against her. Lane's fan dance doesn't help, since the focus on the scen is more Dillon's twisted attraction/repulsion. The 1950's period works for Dillon's razor etched beauty, the perfect locale for his photographer Bruce Weber appeal, and he even gives a Method touch to the way he hits his own face with a restaurant menu. Watch for Lolita Davidovich as another of Jones' strip club entertainers 
 Yesterday I gave up on continuing to read this book. I gave up on page 228, after a completely exaggerated scene did little to alleviate the general atmosphere of long-winded boredom in the book.   My main problem with this book is that far more room is given to the personal problems of the police people and the doctor involved in the crime than to the crime itself. The crime itself sounded interestingly enough, but in the first 228 pages at least, it seemed to be a mere sideline. When writing crime stories, it is always a problem how to handle the personalities of those that are solving the crime. Of course they shouldn't be completely "anonymous" people with no life of their own, but on the other hand the reader buys the book to read about the crime and therefore doesn't care too much for reading about the police person's problems with his mother. In Kisscut, most of the people don't even have one private issue to deal with, but several. Highly annoying because it takes away from the real story.   The most annoying intrusion of private life is that of the highly unlikeable policewoman Lena. She suffered a terrible ordeal in the past (apparently covered in a previous book by Karin Slaughter) and the reader is constantly reminded of this ordeal. There are passages in the book where it is mentioned on almost every single page until I at least felt like shouting "Yes, allright, I got the point!"  So, maybe the crime story was good. But it is buried until so many other stories that the reader doesn't even get a chance to read about it. I do not recommend this book. 
 I started reading this book because I found the plot amusing...but the middle seems to really drag, and the end is down right AWFUL.  As an American, I kept reading this book and wondering, "are the English REALLY this nuts?!?!" I'm also really sick of every book I pick up being set in London with the heroine working for a publishing house.  Is that all they do?! If you are really intrigued by this book, read a few chapters and skip to the end. About the only thing that really made me want to stand up and cheer through the entire book was when Christopher put Jane in her place.  He and David were my favorite characters 
 I took the author to long to get to the point.  She went all around in circles to get to the poin 
 Suzanne Somers apparently has no use for modern medical science. Especially as a survivor of breast cancer (although of a very early stage) she is putting her life in grave danger by taking hormones. Recent studies have shown that women who were taking HRT for protection from heart problems actually had MORE problems than normal menopausal women. This is an unbelievably destructive, horribly dangerous book for people to take seriously. Being skinny is NOT more important than being alive. If you want to get the real scoop on hormones, talk to a doctor at an academic medical center (in other words, one that isn't going to mislead the public for personal financial gain) and see what she or he has to say. Chances are excellent that you'll be told to avoid them at all cost. Look at it this way: are you going to put your very life in the hands of Suzanne Somers? I'm sure she's a very nice person; it's just that she has no medical training whatsoever. *** writing from an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center** 
 Whoa!  I rented this movie, because I can remember seeing publicity photos and/or previews, of the tall actor, with his nose in some sort of bandage. I expected this to be some sort of screwball comedy, with physical comedy thrown in for good measure!  Damn, I almost fell asleep.  I am like the review before me; except I was alone.  I kept looking around mouthing the words:  "Is it me?  It's them, right?" as I gestured toward the convoluted conversations coming from my home viewing screen.  Sorry, but watching two white guys discuss wine for 2+ achingly boring hours is not my idea of an award winning movie!  I guess the saving grace is seeing the Asian woman, and imagining the "freaky" activities going on behind closed doors.  But what a schmuck that guy was, as it was the weekend before his wedding.    Also, I didn't appreciate how there was no damn explanation of what these two goofballs were doing, driving across California, to various wineries.  What the hell was going on?  This is how some horny white guy spends his last weekend of freedom?  How about living a little, going to a strip club, or even taking in a Broadway show?  But sitting in restaurants, and tasting booths?  Nah ahh!  Homie don't play that.  And neither does MC White  MC White said: an extra star for the Asian hottie.  Other than that, two thumbs WAY down!!!  Please note: it was this movie that caused this reviewer to go through his 300+ queue of on-line rental DVD movies, and delete all non -Absolutely sure I want to watch them" stinkfest movies.  I'm not taking a chance on any movie again!  So glad I don't go to the theater anymore and pay outrageous ticket prices for this garbage!! 
 Yeah, it's the Arms & Equipment book for the 3.0 and probably the 3.5 series unless Wizards decides to update it to 3.5 with new wacky items. Basically the book is a little handbook of mercenaries and followers, gadgets like spyglasses and wacky little knives that your characters hold in between thier fingers, and other strange equipment like that. There's also rules for mounts and vehicles. However, this information is fine and dandy but I couldn't justify paying the price the Wizards wants for this book for some wacky gadgets and expanded rules that are already explained in the PHB and DMG. If you have the extra cash, or someone is looking to give you a gift, ask for this book but don't expect much. But if you're spending your own hard earned cash, look somewhere else. This isn't like the 2nd edition Arms & Equipment book that gave rules for cool thief tools and castles. It's just a DM guide to wacky gadgets, vehicles, and mounts. Oh yeah, and how to hire hirelings and mercenaries. Whatever... 
 I couldn't even finish this movie, it was just aweful, please avoid this.  I found myself skipping through the chapters waiting for things to happen.. 
 I wasted time reading this book that I will never get back.  It was repetitive, predictable, and drawn out.  I only finished the book hoping for a twist in the ending, but it turned out the way I thought it would.  Buy this book if you want to feel good about yourself for finishing it quickly, and for predicting how the story goes.  But, I would not waste the time if I were you 
 The last known living thylacine - the proper name for what is often popularly (and mistakenly) called the Tasmanian tiger - died in a Hobart city zoo in 1936. It was already an old beast, and the Great Depression had worsened its condition through neglectful care. Two months before it died, the Tasmanian parliament gave the species full protection - a delayed counter-response to earlier Tasmanian and Australian policies that for decades put a bounty on its head. But the change in policy came too late. In all the years since 1936, there has not been a single piece of solid evidence the species still exists.  Most experts guess that a few thylacines lived on in the wild for some years after the mid-30s before succumbing to the problems of low population numbers. But many Tasmanians, and a few experts, continue to believe the animal still survives in the wilds of Tasmania. There are a number of reasons for this. Thirty percent of the island is a wildlife preserve. There have been over a hundred reliable sightings of the animal in recent years. And the creatures were nocturnal and shy, even when populations were abundant.  If the thylacine does survive, it would be a remarkable story, for it was a remarkable beast. The largest marsupial predator in modern times, the thylacine took its popular name from the stripes that covered the back half of its elongated frame. Without those stripes, a thylacine would have had some resemblance to a long, skinny dog or wolf, except for two obvious features: its enormous jaw, which the thylacine was able to open to an angle of nearly ninety degrees, and its sloping back, which was somewhat similar to a hyena's (another dog-like creature that is not related to the canines). But whatever resemblance existed between thylacines and the family of canines was superficial -- a matter of convergent evolution, not relatedness. The thylacine was a marsupial, with its pups born and partially raised in a poach.  Most eyewitness accounts said thylacines were neither fast nor ambush predators. The creature's sloping gait, that so resembled a hyena's, was built for endurance not speed. A thylacine would give chase to its prey over long distances, tiring it out, before catching up with it and pinning it down with the enormous jaw and sharp teeth. The preferred prey seems to have been kangaroos, wallabies, wombats, and, a few years after the arrival of white settlers in 1803, sheep. The thylacine's taste for sheep, however, would end up spelling its doom as settlers - many of whom went to Tasmania to raise sheep - grew to hate the beast.  David Owen, a Tasmanian novelist, and the author of "Tasmanian Tiger", argues that the thylacine's reputation for eating sheep was probably undeserved or at least exaggerated. Feral dogs also inhabited Tasmania, and in some cases were known to attack and eat sheep. But whoever the culprit, the "tiger" - as the thylacine was known locally - was blamed by most Tasmanians and bounties were put on its head. As a result, by the early twentieth century, the writing was on the wall for the beast. From 1878 to 1896, more than 3,400 tiger skins were tanned and made into waistcoats. In 1902, 119 thylacines were presented for the bounty. In 1906, just 58. In 1909, the last year any tigers were presented for bounty, only two were given up. The population had been decimated. It was now only a matter of time.  Owen's book is fairly dry, considering the rich nature of the subject matter. David Quammen, in his "The Song of the Dodo", has a far more interesting section on the thylacine, filled with fascinating facts and a strong narrative, covering almost all the ground Owen does in much less space. Perhaps because he is a novelist, Owen has little new to add. He has read the necessary books and source material, but unlike Quammen, and many others who have studied thylacines, he has no scientific background or interest. Quammen put the extinction of the thylacine in perspective by showing its similarities to other extinctions elsewhere in the world; Owen simply portrays it as a sad story in the history of Tasmania.  Owen does add one interesting twist to the story by telling of the project to reconstruct a thylacine using the DNA from a dead fetus preserved in alcohol for several decades. Most scientists think it's an impossible scientific feat to pull off, but Owen interviews a couple of bright-eyed, true believers who think otherwise. The project has found sponsors and some small progress has been made. But with Australia still losing species, counter-arguments have been voiced that the money - which will run into the millions of dollars per thylacine, assuming they are ever successfully cloned - could be better spent saving creatures that still exist.  The same general argument can be made for the money spent on this book. "Tasmanian Tiger" is a dull study on an interesting subject. Owen is an experienced novelist, but you wouldn't know it from reading this book. The narrative never gets going. For a much better book, one with a superb section on thylacines, read David Quammen's "The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinctions." 
 Professor Mack posits the existence of an anterior "book" to the Synoptic Gospels, "the Book of Q," yet he can support this supposition only through deducing such a creature through his own predisposed notions about what such a "book" SHOULD have been, and in tune with his own idea of a classless, pre-socialist fraternity, in which Jesus becomes a social revolutionary, a glorified teacher, but little else. If this is all there is to Christianity, then give me unadulterated Marxism or Fascism any day. Poorly argued, and obtusely expressed, to boot 
 Bdd acting, bad directing, bad plot, bad script.  An okay way to spend a couple of hours if you like the genre and keep your expectations low.  No way in the world is this a "modern classic," though.    Contrary to what Hollywood thinks, and contrary to what many in the audience may claim, many people DO get their history from the movies (just read a couple pages worth of reviews on any such film listed on Amazon), and that alone would take at least one star off of this film.  Sure, you sometimes have to use a little poetic license to dramatize real people and events in a film, but when you start to resort to outright fiction to give a different impression than the facts would, you've failed.  If you're going to tell a fictional story about four kids who grow up to take over organized crime in Prohibition America, then go all the way and don't use real historical figures as characters.    The even more unforgivable sin that this film commits is that it doesn't even attempt to demythologize organized crime.  According to this thing, these four guys were working class heroes!  Meyer Lansky always prided himself on never having personally taken a life himself -- but like Frank in "Scarface," he just had somebody else do it for him.  Gotti and his ilk love this sort of crap, because even if they don't see themselves this way, they at least want the rest of us to see them this way.    If they had at least tried to show the true nature of these people, rather than glamorize them as antiheroes, this could have been a good film.  As it is, it almost seems as if the script was written by a ten-year-old who dreams of someday growing up to be just like Lucky.    Somehow, I doubt the people who Luciano and company killed, raped, robbed, extorted and terrorized, etc. would find this a fair treatment of the times 
 I didn't think I could be unsatisfied with a paper towel holder but this one was annoying enough to write a review. The main rod would not screw into the base as described in the instructions. Maybe the screw hole was just faulty in this one but ended up having to use use my own nuts/washers to tighten the holder.   Also, when replacing the paper towels, you have to unscrew the  top "knob" which is not very convenient.   
 Looking for a bit of sea adventure?  Fancy a run with some real life salts who face whatever the hurricane ravaged winter seas throw at them?  Well don't go looking to Redmond O'Hanlon's "Trawler".  O'Hanlon takes two potentially fascinating subjects - trawler fishing and the biology behind the creatures of the seas - and blends them into a putrid stew of nothingness.  This is a very difficult book to read. Physically difficult! Aye!  O'Hanlon's pointless, manic use of exclamation and emphasis - EMPHASIS! Aye! - lends nothing to the story but then there is so little story, it's really no loss.  "Trawler" dredges the bottom of literary technique and hauls up nothing but stream of consciousness drivel.  I found the book a total waste of time and will certainly never read another piece of work by O'Hanlon.  Aye!  I won't!  Never! 
 Im comparing this album to social distortions self titled album so of course it is not near as good.  If you are going to buy this album make sure you listen to this BEFORE you listen to social distortions self titled because if you dont your gonna hate it like i did...honestly i wouldnt even buy it.  the songs are so-so but i think they could have done way better.  only two stars for me 
 This book was not in the least bit helpful.  It is more like "listening to a speech" than reading a USEFUL knowledge giving book. I believe most of the ideas are now in practice, and are commonplace in birthing pratices. After reading this book I was disappointed. What the book had to say I believe is useful but they use too many unneeded words and waste paper 
 I am way disappointed in these sheets I just got them and read the instructions on how to wash them and I did so, I put them on my bed and they feel like paper. I thought they were supposed to be soft???? they are 800 thread count but I am new at this. maybe if I keep washing them they will get bette 
 My dog (80 lbs.) liked this toy when it contained a treat but within a week it was beginning to come apart so I threw it away.  Maybe she needed the black kong 
 When Cass leaves after being accepted to Yale and living what is described as a perfect life, Caitlin is left to pick up the pieces. Her mother has always fawned over Cass and now it's Caitlin's turn. She's encouraged to join the cheerleading squad she has no interest in and soon meets up with Rogerson, an abusive drug addict who soon has her flunking out, drinking and drugging and getting knocked around. I don't think the author did a good job making the reader understand why Caitlin stayed in the relationship as long as she did. And, though I understand the mother had to be portrayed as someone who would needle until someone would want to run away, the mother irritated the snot out of me. When Caitlin did think her mom had finally figured out her secret and was going to confront her, the mother was simply confronting Caitlin on the lack of color she had been wearing in her wardrobe. Not much of a plot here. Can't say as I enjoyed the book at all 
 I can't speak to how well it functions as a network printer for Windows users or as a local printer. When I could get it to work, the print quality was pretty good (for the price). But I had constant problems getting the Macs on my network to find the printer. You have to use Bonjour (at least if you just want to configure the printer with the OS X printer setup utility). I downloaded the latest driver from HP. The first computer to print had no problems, but after that it was very hit-or-miss. The print job would try to start, and I'd get a message "Trying to find printer 'HP LaserJet 2600n'" - the printer never would be found. The printer has a control panel accessible via a web browser, but the built-in web server would often not respond when the printers IP address was entered. The printer uses DHCP. I also tried giving it a static IP address (both via configuring the printer itself with a static IP, and with configuring the router to assign it a static IP via DHCP) - none of this worked. I finally took it back. I'm still looking for a reasonably priced color network laser for Macs - maybe such a beast doesn't exist. This definitely isn't one 
 I bought this DVD because it features Alan Rickman. I also purchased it because of someone else's Amazon review (They sounded like they really knew what they were talking about). I am glad I bought it used, because if it were new, I would feel that I'd been cheated.  The movie was about as suspenseful as waiting in the doctor's office. There was no sense of suspense, and I was about as thrilled and chilled as a lukewarm cup of tea (Mind you, I'm NOT the type who requires non-stop action and special effects to be happy).  The dialogue throughout was tedious and trite; the scriptwriter should be on the unemployment line, as well as the director and the editor.  The plot was, in some respects, totally illogical, and at other times nonsensical. Even previous scenes don't tie in neatly enough at the end. The plot is entirely unconvincing and implausible. The choices the characters make - whether restless, bored, frustrated - don't tie in the the normal patterns of logic and suck all realism away from the film (Like a greedy, unwashed vampire).  The movie features a wealthy, bored couple. I was also bored. But I'm not wealthy.  However! All the actors did their best within the limitations of this film. Polly Walker was very convincing as a sensitive, but hypercritical wife. In fact, I'd say she provided the best performance, and her character was the most three-dimensional and human. They should have provided more time to make the audience more sympathetic to her character.   Norman Reedus was fairly genuine as the young man, although he seemed more creepy and psychotic than attractive. He failed to grab my empathy. Which makes the plot of the movie more implausible ... that a jaded, wealthy couple would have allowed him into their environment.  Alan Rickman did his usual subtle work, but it was so subtle that I thought they might have not let him have his morning coffee before filming. His attempt at an American accent did not fly too well. Later in the movie, however, he becomes much more interesting.   The end lacked passion and was not surprising at all; it was entirely predictable.  For Rickmanistas, yes, you get to see Alan naked. So, just fast forward to the end of the movie and you will be happy.  I have always admired Alan Rickman - I'm a big fan - but he would have been better in a more skillfully scripted & directed film.  So, I give it two stars. *Yawn 
 Simply had little to do with Ben Franklin. Wanted a historical  tale of intrique and got little of any interest.  Do not want to ruin it for those that have not read it, but if you are looking for anything of any content about Ben Franklin, this is not the book. Left a few things open, lets hope it is not for a sequel 
 If you have read about the Civil War in depth you will find this book maddening. The stories lurch between naming the regiments in a battle line to skipping over large portions of each battle. There seems to be no rhyme or reason in the approach to the information. I suppose I expected a battlefield book that would give me a topographical feel for the battle where in reality the bulk of the book is a synopsis of larger events and in some cases the battles themselves.  Another problem I had with the book is the general point of view that the Yankees were a bunch of bumbling drunkards who by happenstance were successful and the Confederates, especially Lee, were brilliant, noble leaders who at critical moments the fates intervened to ruin their otherwise perfect battle plans. I literally had to reread the last page of the Gettysburg chapter four times to finally come to the conclusion that the author states the Lee won the battle! 
 Like the idea of getting some samples, but once you refrig these it is tough to get the sauce out of the small bottles.   Do not buy. 
 Note: This review reveals plot points.  This shouldn't matter too much since my advice to you is - don't read this novel.  Okay, I realize that this is a `beach novel' and that it isn't meant to be particularly insightful, realistic, or memorable - but come' on, even beach novels should meet some kind of standard.    Short Straw is just plain dumb.  It wouldn't be so bad if the characters in the novel were supposed to be stupid (I'm a big fan of novels featuring dumb criminals) but much is made about how smart these characters are; despite all the evidence to the contrary.  Case in point:  The Santa Fe police department arrest a man for murdering his wife and her lover and the DA is ready to go to trial on the case, but no one thought it was necessary to interrogate the alleged killer and to check out his alleged alibi.    Are we supposed to believe that the Santa Fe police department is that inept?  I could be wrong here but I think the police would interrogate the man repeatedly for hours, grilling him about his movements that day and following up on any inconsistencies in his story.  They would sort through his phone bills, business records, and computer files, and interview his friends, neighbours, and associates.  It's ridiculous to think that in a case like this the DA wouldn't even know where the defendant was on the day of the murder.  But that's only one example in a long list of grievances.  For example....  1.	Why does Big Bear tell Ed that he left the worksite to buy an auto part (effectively putting hole in his alibi)?  He doesn't object to lying to Ed about his innocence, so why tell the truth on this point, especially when he has to know it will affect his alibi.  Why doesn't Ed (who is a brilliant legal mind) realize until later the significance of this fact?  Answer:  The author wants Ed to get Big Bear off, but then have an epiphany later when he remembers what Big Bear said about the auto part store.  It will be in this moment that Ed realizes, for the first time, that his client is guilty after all.  2.	Why doesn't the DA make any effort to  effectively cross examine the sole alibi witness in the case?  Surely the witness couldn't have been watching Big Bear all the time (didn't he have to go to the bathroom or make a sandwich or something?)  Answer:  The author wants Ed to get Big Bear off and then have an epiphany later, realizing that his client was actually guilty (see point 1).  If the DA did his job and actually cross examined the witness, this might not happen.  3.	Why does Barbara steal Ed's money AND try to have him killed?  If she was going to have him killed, it would have made a lot more sense for her not to go running off with his money, casting suspicion on herself.  Answer:  If Barbara had Ed killed she would inherit his fortune, get the life insurance money, and the novel would end on page 3.  4.	If Barbara is so smart, why does she use the PI's cell phone to call the spa where she plans to hide out, when the call can obviously be traced?  For that matter, why does she use her own name at all the hotels she booked in Mexico?  Answer:  The author needs the PI's to keep finding her so that she can keep giving them the slip.  Much of the novel is spent having Barbara escape and hide somewhere (but not very well).  The PI's then find her, only to have her slip through their fingers again and again.     5.	Why does Barbara change her appearance?  It would have made more sense for her to have plastic surgery at the beginning of the novel.   Once her plan to steal Ed's money falls apart, she returns to the States, waiting for an opportunity to kill Ed or have him killed, so she can claim the insurance money.  There's no need for her to change her appearance until it is time to disappear.  There is no point in disappearing until she has the money (or if she has reason to believe the police will arrest her - which she doesn't).  If Ed is murdered and she gets away with it (presumably that's the plan), there is no need to disappear at all.   Answer:  The author has planned a scene later in the novel where Ed enters a bar and doesn't recognize his own wife, but she sees him.  In order for this scene to work, Barbara can't look the same can she?  6.	If Barbara is so smart, why does she keep the gun she used to kill the couple in the hotel?  Answer:  It's the only evidence that can tie her to the crime.  If she gets rid of it, Barbara will get away with murder.  We can't have that now, can we?  7.	For the love of God, what did Ed see in this woman in the first place?  He says that he loved her but there is no evidence of that (he doesn't seem heart broken) and given that he is supposed to be a reasonably intelligent man; couldn't he tell that she was a cold blooded self absorbed sociopath?    Answer:  I think the author was just too lazy to delve into any emotional issues or provide any insight into their relationship.  The bottom line is; this could have been a decent novel if Woods had put some effort into it.  If he asked himself these types of questions while he was writing the manuscript (and trust me - there are more) he could have come up with a stronger plot that made sense.    I realize I have been ranting (this is a long review) but for whatever reason, this novel really frustrated me.  Mostly because I know Woods could have made it a good novel if he wanted to.  He just couldn't be bothered. 
 I was very disappointed in this product. I wanted to use them for snacks and pie crusts, but they are too stale to use. They are NOT crunchy as advertised since moisture has definitely entered through the packaging. Unfortunately Amazon will not let me return them, so I'm out $20. I was going to try some other products by this brand, but now I will not 
 Have you ever heard how an artist has a particular strength and weakness? For example, being able to draw really good faces, but not-so-good hands or feet? I feel that Ian Irving is like that -- he writes a good, entertaining read (obviously, since I am going through book #4), but his "weakness" is character development, particularly romances. I know romance plays a pretty prominent role in most fantasy and sci-fi books, but this is not Irving's strong point. The romances seem shallow, improbable, and rushed. I had a hard time enjoying the story because of them. But as other readers have mentioned, there is "something" about the books that make you coming back for more.  So what is Irving's strong point? Food descriptions -- pay attention to every meal mentioned in the books. You will learn the texture of cheese, the ripeness of fruit, the grains in every bread mentioned, etc., etc. It's almost humorous how much detail goes into food, but not character development.   If I had any advice to give, it would be for Irving to to write a cookbook, or perhaps a Zagats review or two. I'm sure they would be captivating, and right up his alley. 
 Ed McMahon is a wonderful talent, just ask him.  Don't waste your time with this book.  When Ed isn't talking about himself, he relates (verbatim) scenes from the Tonight Show that you can watch and enjoy on the DVD 
 The magazine is great!  The problem is, I am not receiving them. I ordered a subscription in January and have received 3 issues only!!!  All my other orders with amazon have been received, I have no idea what is happening with my magazine subscription. I wrote to amazon to ask if there was a way of tracking my order but haven't gotten a response 
 There's some good music on this but I was expecting more of a lounge feel. This is closer to being regular jazz. There are a couple loungey vibe songs but they aren't exceptional. If your looking for jazz, this is ok, if your looking for moving groove, this is not worth it and is waay overrated. Check Bargrooves series, that's got the jazz and the vibing groove 
 I didn't realize when I bought this book that it was first published back in 1968. I'm not a Peters expert, but this must be one of her very early works, before she honed her craft. It is short and would be even shorter if it didn't fall back on annoying misunderstandings among the characters to maintain the tension. I didn't find the characters to be appealing, and the book lacks the wit and verve of her later works. Personally, I don't think this measures up to the Peabody books, although I notice several other reviewers differ. What can I say? I'm right and they're wrong, naturally 
 [...]  R. Kent Hughes provides us with another entry into the already very crowded market for Christian books that are a mile wide and an inch deep.  He covers a tremendous variety of topics in an incredibly superficial fashion.  The book reads more like a PowerPoint presentation with  occasional witty anecdotes from the presenter.    My disappointment with this book set in with the reading of the second chapter entitled "Purity."   Now there's a topic that an entire book can be written on, but the author gives us a mere eleven pages, using the famous example of King David and his adulterous relationship with Bathsheba to present us with a five-point sermon on what David did wrong.  He begins the chapter with the usual rant about how the church is no different from the world in regards to sexual sin (true enough).  He then tells us about what David did wrong, and to conclude we get seven subdisciplines to practice in order to keep pure: "accountability", "prayer",  "memorization" (of scripture), "mind" (don't look at pornography), "hedges" (keep away from women), "reality" (you are a sexual being), "divine awareness" (practicing the presence of God).   Each of these subdisciplines gets a short explanation, never exceeding 300 words in length, and  "reality", the shortest of the seven, is explained in mere 52 words.  Brevity can be a wonderful thing, but there are times when it can come off sounding rather superficial.    The problem is that all these subdisciplines will not work if a person has emotional and personal issues that need to be overcome first. Any man can partake of these seven practices and still fall into temptation with the greatest of ease, as long as there exists issues in the heart that have never been fully dealt with.  Instead of dealing with the deeper issues regarding sexual sin, we get pat answers to apply to a wounded psyche, which is like applying band-aids to someone who is suffering from internal bleeding.   It's not always pride that causes a man to fall.    Another problem is the loose fashion in which Hughes uses the term "discipline."  For me discipline is a nearly synomous term with training, and in the Christian walk, there are just a few key disicplines that bring the greatest benefit.  But Hughes brings up many, many "disciplines" that just aren't true disciplines.  "Mind" and "reality" from the purity chapter are just two examples, and even purity itself.  Purity in the Christian sense is the abscense of sin, but not doing something isn't exactly what I would call a discpline.     Another mistake is the egalitarian nature in which Hughes presents all his various discplines.  No prioritization or hierarchy is given, he presents them in such a way that they all seem equally important.  But those who are succesfully living the Christian life only practice a few key displines, some of which are more practical than spiritual, like time management and goal setting.  In my own study of spiritual discplines, I've found there are three areas that are the most crucial: personal devotions, self-examination and spiritual direction.  While Hughes has some things to say concerning devotions, there isn't much, if anything concerning the other two.        Hughes also discusses the discipline of "church."  A very interesting topic, and one where he tells us that the church is "the grandest institution that the world has ever known."  But this statement demonstrates that Hughes has bought into the lie that the church is an "institution."  So are prisons and mental hospitals.  The church was not founded to be a grand institution, but to be a life transforming force on this earth.  The fact that we have institutionalized the church to the point of irrelevance is why Christianity is becoming a passing fad in so much of the Western world.    As it is with the church so should it be with Christian books: they to need to help be agents of change and transformation, not just a list of do's and don'ts.  Sadly Hughes' book is more along the lines of a moral dictionary.  Such a book might be helpful for a brand new believer who wants a type of encyclopedia of all the different aspects of Christian culture, but there isn't much meat there for more advanced believers to chew on.  But even a new believer might be quickly overwhelmed with all the various disciplines that Hughes brings forth.   If you are looking for a book that will act as agent of transformation, I highly recommend any of the books John Eldredge has written, especially "Wild at Heart." and "Waking the Dead."  One of the best books about true inner transformation is John and Paula Sanford's "The Transformation of Inner Man."  And for a book about discipline as a means of transformation, I highly recommend Foster's classic "Celebration of Discipline."  And of course the best book of all in regards to transformation is any good translation of the Holy Bible.    Personally, I really like Pastor Hughes and think very highly of him.  I even agree with most of the points he makes in his book, but this is not one of his better efforts, to put it mildly.  So upon returning this book, I purchased a different one that Hughes can rightly be proud of: The Holy Bible: English Standard Version.  Hughes served as a member of the ESV Translation Oversight Committee.    "Superficiality is the curse of our age"  - Richard Foste 
 I'm addicted to bad movies. Really bad movies. Ones that make you laugh at its pure inadequacy and the ones that are so cheesy that you can't help but be entertained. Then there are ones that are so bad you would have to be a masochist to sit throughout the entire duration of it. Ed Wood's "Bride of the Monster," "Burial Ground," and "Manos: Hands of Fate," are three classic horrible movies that I have had the dishonor of seeing and will never forget the pain and boredom that I felt while suffering through the viewing of them. "Hell of the Living Dead" is definitely one terrible zombie flick that certainly and positively belongs among the worst movies ever made. First of all, it basically covers all of the zombie cliches ever created throughout the history of zombie movies. Jungle savages, mad scientists, a little gore, a little blood, extremely fake looking special effects, a random soldier dancing in a green tutu, top hat, and cane, and really really bad zombie make up makes this movie well worth watching. Also, I can't understand why this movie is on the video nasties list. "I Spit on your Grave" and "The Last House on the Left" are much more disturbing than this movie. In any case, you should check this movie out if you want something to make you fall asleep quickly or if you are a true masochist and desire great amounts of suffering and pain 
 After volunteering to look at this play for my Classics degree, I started out with high hopes.  But after opening it and dicovering how boring it was, my hopes faltered.  I still gave it a go though and a couple of hours later when I finally got ready to start writing whether it was actually good enough as a play, my problems started.  Bearing in mind that it was written 2500 years ago, i was intrigued that a play could last for so long.  But honestly, thats where my interest stopped.  It's lenghthy and dull, and although I know that it is a very historical and precise play, I just couldn't follow it.  If you want bedtime reading that will send you to sleep, this is the one, sorry 
 are the words that describe this book.  I am studying for a test right now and I can't bear to read even one more page.  I'm not just saying this because its a school book and school is boring...this book is really excruciatingly repetitive and horribly worded.  I gotta read alot of the stuff multiple times just to understand what this [guy] is trying to say.  He could have simplified the book so it's half the length that it is.  Ravi Sethi, the author, sounds like a [conceited person] who thinks he's so smart...He should be fined for writing this book and making poor college students like me read it.  This book is causing me much mental anguish 
 Senator Obama'a latest screed is a book about politics, common gound and reclaiming the American Dream. People looking for some deep thought that transcends our political, social, and foriegn policy issues are bound to be disapointed, especially if you are a progressive who swooned over his Speech at the Democratic Convention 2 years ago. The book breaks down into his childhood in Hawaii youthful indiscertions (a little coke, herb etc..) and the transition into the man he is today. Obama's centrism is really oft- putting to someone like me who feels that partisonship is a good idea (At least your enemies know where you stand)he would rather work the middle ground and find soloutions to our problems that are at it's heart does not lend itself to a 'gray area'.   The chapter I found on race is  typical Clinton doublespeak, As an Afro- American His appeal to 'universality' is trite at best because in one minute he knows he does not live an "authentic" cultural black expericence  Obama who is mixed is doing what Shelby Steele calls  " racial negotitating " making whites feel comfortable around someone like Obama who trusts that white america will do the right thing and he believes in the moral goodness of the majority white population and this country's ethos thereby he is liked for not challenging their morality. Obama tries to have it both ways empathizing with  the Afro- American and Hispanic  struggle (the vote he really needs to win election if he chooses to run for the Presidency)and he unlike many black intellectuals knows that the conservative movement used the symbols of the great society progress to butress their arguments in a "racial cold war". Obama fails when he lectures Latinos on Immirgration and by trying to find common ground he ends up alienating those who challenge this society's attitude about both blacks and Latinos.I think he is naive about race in this country, I for one do not trust the majority society to treat us with brotherhood and charity (after 389 years Afro- Americans ought to know better)I look at people as Enemies or Allies and white conservatives are the enemy of Afro- Americans or do we have to go to New Orleans for the Genocide (I see dead black people floating) they attempted last year.If Obama wants to negoitate with conservatives and find common ground that's his right, I would rather have power because it is the only thing White conservatives (and their minority allies) understand.  The last chapter he talks of his wife and her family that is the most touching thing in the whole book, his love for her seems genuine and you can tell he has empathy and concern for her and children in general. I feel that his book is just  and average at best. Maybe he might be President but he will not be the 'first black president'. But if you are a believer in Obama's charisma and think he can rise above petty politics and bring people of different races into a common American ideal then this book is for you, But if you do not like " Colorblind Centrists" like Obama and Harold Ford think they are weak 'Uncle Toms" then this book will to you be just average 
 All this box does is make tones to slow down your breathing. I looked at it for a long time, I never found a clear explanation of what it actually is.  So I tried it and it seems like it should cost about $11.99. Save your money 
 A great idea, and a fun coffee table (bathroom) book. I am, however, disturbed by the omission of Phish's rhythm section. Michael Gordon and Jon Fishman are undoubtedly more talented than half the people in this book.  It would also have been nice to explain the true heritage of the many musicians listed in the book.. 
 Forget this Cliff Notes crap! Just read Night. It's a great book and it won't even take you long to read. I wish I could give this Cliff Note book zero stars 
 I purchases this karaoke machine for my daughters' 5th birthday.  I gave it to her first thing this morning only to be very disappointed and sad to find out that it too, like the other two people that purchased and reviewed it, didn't work.  The CDs didn't even turn around.  The microphones worked.  My daughter was very sad that we had to return it.  I think that it should be recalled.  I purchased it at Toys R Us and they took it right back without any problem.  I wish I had opened it to make sure it worked after I read those reviews.  
 Social neuroscience is an exciting and important topic of study.  This book does it a disservice.  This book is poorly organized and presents only brief summary of many fascinating ideas.  You might find something that interests you, but you're unlikely to find it in enough detail to get a clear understanding of it.  Honestly I expected better from Daniel Goleman and I was quite disappointed by this book.  Unfortunately I don't yet have a better book to recommend instead 
 Content is too short. Examples and questions are too simple. Does not add anything to an avarage experienced programmer 
 If you expect quality metal, do not waste your money on this one...All songs sound the same, the vocals are terrible, the guiter work is mediocre... Of course I enjoy the likes of Metallica, Megadeth, Overkill, Sepultura etc., and this is arguably one of the worst Metal CDs I have heard 
 Not funny enough to succeed as satire, and certainly not erotic.  When I read the blurb annoucement that this was a satire on Voltaire's CANDIDE, my first reaction was, "How do you write a satire of a satire?"  The answer is, you can't; and CANDY ends up as just another tired, outdated...book.  Don't judge Southern by this novel... 
 I purchased 2 sets of these earphones for a 2 hour flight. My husband and I both used them, and we both took them out of our ears after 20 minutes. They were great at first, but after 20 minutes they really started to hurt our ears. The inside of my ears were so sore I couldn't even adjust the earphones when they started coming out, that's how bad my ears hurt. I had the foam pad over them too, and it made no difference. I would not recommend these 
 I've read a few books of all kinds.  "Modern Pace Handicapping" is one of the worst, frankly, which makes it definitely the worst racing-related book I've ever read.  It's particularly sad when it is supposed to be teaching you something and not just narrating a story.  I understand the concept of pace handicapping, but the nuts and bolts hardly fit together in this work.  I'm surprised I got any theory out of this book at all.  It is truly one of the most poorly written/edited/formatted/arranged books I've run across.  It is shocking this book gets so many rave reviews.  "MPH" is so badly written I can only assume the people giving it 4+ stars are already well-versed in pace handicapping and skipped over all the incomprehensible stuff and the myriad mistakes and horrible copies.  If I wanted to spend more time I could give specific examples by leafing any given page in the book.  However, I'll just sum up by saying this book was riddled with:  -typos; -chopped-off paragraphs (turn the page - what happened?); -confusing mish-mash of decimal system proper, and using decimal notation to represent FIFTHS (i.e., 1:35.3 = 1:35-3/5 in one section, and in another it represents exactly what it looks like to an engineer like myself - 1:35-3/10); -many extremely poor (completely illegible, high-bleed) copies of old race charts; -poor math-checking - both of equation form and of results in examples; -disconnected charts to text (text discussion on page X, charts were on page X-5, etc); -poor explanation of either general theory, methods or examples - especially - WHY SHOULD I PICK THIS OR THAT RACE AS A TYPICAL PACELINE?  Author acts as if it is so obvious and simply states "this should be the paceline" too many times.  I could probably go on; I always manage to find a new glitch when I recommence reading.  There are so many categories of problems that I cannot keep track of them all.  I'm not sure if "Modern Pace Handicapping" is so poorly edited and explained that I find it hard to pick UP (as opposed to "hard to put down!"), or if I can really say the narrative style itself is so dry as to have made me take 2 years to read it on casual time.  (Not finished yet - a few more chapters, which may mean another 6 months.)  I have started and finished a couple other books on casual time in that period!  It is almost with dread that I attempt again.  I give it a 2 only because I could actually get the general idea from MPH.  I think I could handle calculations, but I'm still confused as to why a particular race in the past-performances is good to use as a predictor for the future race analysis.  The Andrew Beyer books are based on a different concept, but despite involving math and what could be a dry subject, they were definitely better written and MUCH better edited (and as with this subject, I knew little about it when beginning but was curious) 
 All songs are transmographied, nothing sounds like the original. I need my money back 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 The client has never received the book.  We have checked with USPS and they do not have a record of the book being delivered.  Who do I need to talk to?  Thanks 
 If HZ's sensationalist title gives you pause, you're on to something.  The "story" Preston narrates is, indeed, terrifying.  It is a story about disease, politics, epidemiology, history, geography...  So much could have been made of this story (and so much has been, by far more capable writers).  Preston, it seems, is only capable of going for the jugular.  HZ shows no evidence of research (it lacks even a trace of a bibliography), and attests little more than a rudimentary grasp, on the part of its author, of the history, epidemiology, or politics of Ebola (no more than one might glean from any half decent article on the topic).  From its opening page stroll through the air-lock doors of a bio-containment research lab, to its closing page 'death-defying' romp through Kitum Cave (how very brave of you, RP!), HZ is in full pandering-for-the-cameras mode.  If this book was not a thinly veiled Hollywood screenplay, I'll eat my proverbial hat.  Even this might have been tolerable were Preston a remotely thoughtful observer or a marginally adept writer.  HZ is all cliches and lazy reporting.  It is an embarassment 
 This has a nicely varied assortment of projects, not just wearables, but it is nothing too fantastic-- car lot pennants? Placemats? They may be celebrities, but they arent doing any mind-blowing design.  Another problem with this book is that some of the projects require a wide-spread crafting knowledge (screenprinting and crochet) and the supplies for those things (screen and ink, squeegee, etc) which could get a little spendy.  the wearables are not that cute or inspired (applying rows of snaps, embroidering on the shoulder? children could have come up with this stuff.   check it out at the library first.  This wasnt at all what I was looking for, but it might inspire you.  It did have great photos 
 Warner Bros is putting out a series of "Signature Collections".  They are nothing of the sort.  They are studio collections. The word signature implies the best of the best. A signature collection of Hitch's work would not include several of these titles. The rarely seen Foreign Correspondent and I Confess. The failed comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith. The experimental Dial M for Murder and The Wrong Man.  The middling Stage Fright. Only Strangers on a Train and North By Northwest are signature Hitchcock.  Where are Psycho,  Vertigo, The Birds, Rear Window, Notorious, Shadow of a Doubt, Rebecca, The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes and, purhaps even, The Lodger?  A signature collection would include all or most of these titles with North by Northwest and Strangers on a Train.  Of course this would oblidge the different studios to cooperate with each other. God forbid. Warner Bros is developing a reputation for shortchanging and lying to its customers.  You're much better off buying your favorite Hitchcock titles individually new or used 
 This book is a revision of a German edition first published in 1971. If that were not enough to put the book out-of-date, the author's writing style certainly would. Her prose is "romantic"  English:  "She offers him [a man who changes her flat] 'tyre' an embroidered handkerchief, which he politely refuses. He makes no reply and, as she gets back into the car, gallantly shuts the door for her." (p. 4). To the extent that the author received death threats, one may have come from a paperback writer whose books sell best in drugstores. 
 Shoddy. Cheap. Glue-bound. Spine-cracking.Short ribbon marker. Junk. But, inside this inferior piece of work lies one of the finest English translations of the last fifty years. However!! Customers be aware!: In Summer, 2005, I, and many others, received an e-mail asking for suggestions for changes, because the English Standard Version Translation Committee is now working on a revision already!!!! It will probably be out in 2007. Everything is pretty hush-hush. The egalitarian folks on a few websites are probably pushing for more inclusive language. So, maybe purchasing ANY ESV should wait until the revision appears. Back to this edition. The print is fairly large(12.75),a better font could have been chosen, and could be darker. The ribbon marker barely extends beyond the bottom page. The spine cracks easily in front and back(already sent one back to Crossway for this). It has book intros and a fairly concise Concordance. Most Crossway Bibles are garbage. HEY CROSSWAY!!  If you can't make a decent Bible, give the rights to folks who can and will!!!  As for me, I love the ESV, but I'm using real quality editions from Foundations Publications who do the NASB 
 This is one of the worst books in the world---in my humble opinion!  OK, I'm in the minority.  Most of the reviewers LOVED the book.  I think this book is a waste of beautiful words!  Yes, Conrad had a beautiful English vocabulary.  But, the "story" is "encrusted" with so many words you'll tire of it after awhile. OK, try the book, but now, at least, you won't feel as I did,  "What's wrong with ME that I don't like this book."  You won't feel "alone" in your reaction.  I think "Heart of Darkness" is a much better book.    Comments?   boland7214@aol.  PS:  As of 1-15-07 I see that I have ZERO "yes" votes for my review.  That's "mean".  I'm just giving my honest reaction.  You don't have to agree with me but why not give me a break for spending the time and energy just to write my thoughts----thoughts which MIGHT help someone....maybe not you....but someone.  Thanks.  
 This book is impossible, complicated, and confusing. Good luck to anyone who tries to figure it out.  Zizek careens through film history, haphazardly - and sometimes carefully - appropriating examples in order to make various 'post-modern' and Lacanian points. It almost seems like parody, but ... it's not 
 I was very irritated to see "artists" like ludicris. the rap guy and other rap artists and many more sub-par so called "artists" in this "ROCK"  discography,  has the author ever heard of "the carpenters  "jimmy buffett"  the guess who" and many many others he left out of this book??  and almost every "one hit wonder" group too so many I don't want to type.  the reason I gave it one star is because it includes rap "artists"  augghh 
 This science movie would make anyone go to sleep, I think COSMOS did it better 
 Ms Estes book is pernicious nonsense. She is a shining example of new age muddleheadedness. Such pretentious intellectual blather so easily leads to unadulterated self indulgence. That her "work"  is a hit makes me  shudder. Jack Rosenbaum, aka Werner Erhard, pulled off a similar financial  coup with EST. ESTes, with an e, is right in the soupscam with EST and the  bucks that follow. At least Shirley Maclaine did it with a smile 
 I agree with the other customers of this guide that there is no detail except for in a few spots at all. I mean what do you do after you defeat all of the  the elite 4? And when you walk up to a trainer his pokemon could stink or they might whip yours. So whatever you do DON'T by this guide. Please 
 I was extremely disappointed by this book/pamphlet, being misled by the other favorable reviews.  It is completely lacking in information.  It has 51 6"x8" pages with huge font and too many cartoons.  It successfully defines what is good and bad posture, but does not provide excercises to improve it (it simply states to "practice" good posture).  There are much much better alternatives.  I have read "Posture Alignment" and recommend that, and have heard of great reviews for "Posture, Get It Straight!" 
 Although it gives some style suggestions it is almost useless if you have less than 500 square feet (whichs studios in NYC generally are smaller than). If you are looking for some helpful ways to reconsider your small space, I'd recommend "Apartment Therapy." If you want some nice photos, then try this book 
 After reading "The Kite Runner" - a deeply involving and heart wrenching story of friendship, loyalty and forgiveness amidst the backdrop of life in Afghanistan during the Russian war and the Taliban rule, I set out expecting more of the same from the Swallows of Kabul.  The latter was quite disapointing.    The Swallows of Kabul focusses on 4 main characters struggling to maintain their dignity and humanity amidst the violence, cruelty and desolation of their surroundings.  The dismal context of this story is properly set up.  Enough time is spent in illustrating the violence and suppression of human rights by the Taliban and the desperation of the Afghan people is clearly communicated. Unfortunately, the novel reads like a short story.  Proper character development is not established, so the reader ends up having little or no sympathy for its key characters who want for more redeeming traits.    The novel is successful in  painting a truly depressing picture of Afghanistan, making us thank our lucky stars for being far removed from such a place.  But if you're looking for an inspiring tale of how the human spirit triumphs over such dismal circumstances, then I wouldn't recommend this book for you.  I was glad to have turned the last page and put this book down 
 I, too, received this item with chipped corners, scratches, and broken pieces. Unfortunately, the cost & hassle of shipping it back is not worth it, so we'll have to live with the damage.  It's a nice-looking desk otherwise, but beware that the keyboard drawer does not fold down completely and may cause problems typing on the keyboard for long periods of time 
 Out of the Furnace was the assigned "text" for the first half of a 3-unit American History (after the Civil War) class. As a responsible and voracious reader, I bought and began reading the book. I found the style conclusory and turgid--this happened, that happened, something else happened--without any real character development to differentiate between and among the characters and clarify their relationships. As another reviewer observed, names kept changing and keeping the people sorted out was nearly impossible. Facts and emotions were asserted without textual basis or amplification, making it difficult for this reader to get interested in the book. For example, one plant was deemed "more dangerous" than the others--What does this mean? How was this known?  The cover lines on this book read "Long out of print" and I would say, "with good reason." Because the book was produced in 1941 by a writer describing life two generations earlier, there is not the detail and immediacy the reader gets from "Grapes of Wrath," for example, for which Steinbeck did actual site-visit research. Needless to say, the "direct" writing of "Furnace" makes it, as another reviewer noted, stultifying reading.  Further I seriously question the assignment of a novel written so long after the events "described," as the ONLY assigned text for this period in a history class. A variety of first-person reports (letters or other documents), statistical descriptions of wages, housing conditions, hours worked/injury rates, profit statements of the corporations, plus photographs of the living/working conditions would be more effective inconveying the same message.  I will confess I did not finish the book. Having determined that it was, in my opinion, unreadable, I dropped the class 
 I was very excited when I finally received this CD because of all of the great reviews. I listened to the first song- it was good. I listen to the third- it was okay. By the time I reached the very end, I realized all of the songs sounded the same except for one.  The music is mostly composed of the traditional rock guitar with a combination of techno sounds. The melodies have been slightly changed, and some have a slower tempo than the originals. I don't mind any of these things. The problem I had was with their lack of a variety of different instruments and styles. All of the songs are semi-hard rock with techno sounds from late 80's music (I can't stand those cheesy saxophone sounds).   I wish they added a few vocalists to the music, used a combination of styles, and not try to fill every second with a barrage of sounds. I suggest you buy a couple songs, but not waste your money on buying the whole CD 
 The song that is played in the background while Paul Walker is driving his red pickup truck towards Torreto's deli is called "Deep Enough" (Remix) by the band called "Live".  The album is called "V".   [... 
 Judith Butler is out of her depth in her discussions of Israel, and (the new) anti-semitism.Readers searching for understanding of post-9/11 politics will encounter lopsided arguments here 
 I really wanted to like this novel.  It had a clever name, an amalgamation of the Great Schism that separate Catholicism and Protestantism, and Matrix, like the movie with the same title.  (Note: the novel is pronounced Shiz-mat-rix, with a short a, rhymes with schematics).  A classic cyberpunk title.  However, this novel is anything but user-friendly.  I don't know if pharmaceuticals are needed for appreciating this novel, or if the author used them when frantically writing, in between vacuuming the roof of his house and such.  The novel moves at such a frantic pace that within one sentence the entire setting can change and this happens more than a few times.  It's difficult to know the point of the plot; perhaps that life is worth living.  The novel is a cross between Heinlein's Time Enough For Love, Bester's The Stars My Destination, and petting a sea urchin.  In a shocking act of consideration, the publishers have included all of Sterling stories related to the Shaper-Mechanist War.  That would be the full length novel, plus five stories.  The stories were written before the novel, which was the order I read them in, although after reading the novel last, I can't say whether or not to recommend reading in that order.  The stories are interesting and enjoyable.  In fact Sterling seems to excel with his short stories.  His story "Flowers of Edo" is where I got interested in his style.  I would recommend his short stories, but this novel is another matter.  Humanity has balkanized into a number of factions, with the Shapers and Mechanists being the most powerful.  The Shapers have reshaped their bodies genetically.  This includes such drastic things as replacing all the E. Coli in their intestines with enzymes.  The Mechanists are like the Borg of Star Trek, they use mechanical prosthetics to enhance themselves.  If you think the Mechanists are the cleaner of the two, think again.  Cockroaches and bacteria are prevalent in Mechanist environments.  Every five years the Mechanists need to have the bacterial growth scraped and UV-burned off their skin.  That's one thing prevalent throughout his writings, this sort of creepiness.  Expect more of it.  However, don't let the war make you think this is some majestic good vs. evil epic space war.  Battles are mostly low key.  There is lot's of narration and dialog.  Sterling self-claims his crammed prose.  No kidding.  Adjectives rule supreme in this novel; as many as possible are crammed into each sentence.  If one would do a histogram of adjectives, this novel would be on the far right tail of the bell curve.  Here's an excerpt: " He always wore his spacesuit, [something something], and [multiple length modifiers] body odor came through its [multiple adjectives] collar with [multiple adjectives] pungency."  Sentences like this go on and on and on and on and on and on and on throughout the novel.  And there's no shortage of hyphenated words, like long-fermented, eye-watering.  On one page, there were no less than 11 hyphenated words, plus one triple one.  Similar to the prosthetics of the Borg, the sentences themselves seem interchangeable.  Here's another excerpt of a dialogue: "What was your brigade? I'm no Cataclyst. I have your weapon here. Constantine pulled a ... vial from his ... jacket ..." You may as well interchange your own sentences: `The tree fell in the forest; it made no sound' or `the space ship went into orbit; it's boots were muddy.'  Give it a try. It'll make as much sense.  There are times when the novel seems profound.  I would find myself backtracking at times to understand some point, and I would go back 5, then 10, then 20 pages to try to understand something and would just give up and go back to where I was.  It's hard to say you read this novel, it's more like your eyes glance over the words, and on occasion you absorb some of it.  Since the novel fluctuates from the profound to the mundane an average of 2-1/2 stars seemed appropriate 
    A Virtuous Woman is a book by Kaye Gibbons and is about a woman named Ruby Pitt who meets a guy named Jack Stokes one day when he spots her sitting at a picnic table. She was much younger than he was and was raised much differently than he was.Ruby was a widow but ends up married to jack.Jack was so in love with his wife through everything they went through even when she was diagnosed with cancer.They were opposites and when Ruby dies Jack is lost without her.They seemed to have an unusual relationship in my opinion. It was actually really hard for me to keep reading each page as i went on.It just wasnt a story that kept me wanting more!and that is why i gave it only 2 stars. i didnt even want to finish the book and that is why i think it took me so long to read it.It really dissapointed me seeing as how i loved Kaye Gibbons first novel, ELLEN FOSTER.i think that another reason i didnt enjoy the book is that there were too many characters to keep track of and it made the book a bit confusing.i really didnt like the transition of chapters either. it was a bit unorganized.There was no action in this novel and i'm sad to say that i dont reccommend it to anyone really 
 I read the reviews and believed them.  When I read the book to my 2 1/2 year old, I felt weird.  First of all, the mother has a habit of 'crawling' across the bedroom floor to get to her son in the middle of the night while he's sleeping--as a baby that's fine, but when he's a grown man?  And, to be rocking a grown man in his sleep???  And then, the son, now a grown man, rocks his aged mother in his arms as well.  I can't do justice to how creepy I found the book.  After reading it, my son pleaded with me not to read it anymore and said he found the mother in the book "SCARY!"  So, I'm returning my book and the extra copy I had gotten, thinking I would keep it and give it as a gift 
 ...because I thought White Oleandar was brilliant. But this book? Not so much. I would not be surprised if Paint it Black were something Fitch wrote before she got her bestseller published. It felt much less fully realized. I found the text to be sprawling, unedited, self-indulgent. I generally have no problem with unreliable and/or unlikable narrators, but this one was more tiring than she was menacing. The whole book was written in one note, so I, too, agree with the "flat" description. I found the characters (the distant, brilliant, rich mother; the sassy best friend; the beautiful, troubled boyfriend) to be very stock and borderline cliche. I absolutely savored every word of Fitch's first book; reading this one, unfortunately, was like returning to a restaurant where you'd had the most amazing creme brulee of your life, only to find it cold and runny the second time you ordered it. 
 I love the Cinnamon Buns shower gel, so I thought I would try the lip gloss. For one thing, it smells/tastes nothing like Cinnamon buns. I don't know what the flavor is, but I don't like it. Maybe they have added almond or something. Secondly, it's way too sticky. My hair kept getting stuck to my lips. It reminds me of vaseline. Since I got this product in a kit, I cannot return it, but I will not be using it again 
 This book makes a lot of assumptions.  It assumes that the reader is EXTREMELY well versed in corporate tax advantages.  It assumes that the reader already owns a corporation.  It assumes that the book will be read with a dictionary of financial terms close at hand.  (It should be.  The book is poorly written, with key terms lacking adequate defenition.)  I support the Rich Dad series.  It is a great way for a beginner to get their feet wet.  This book assumes that the reader can already swim!  Even the seasoned incorporator would probably not be pleased with this book.  Tell you what, if you are considering buying this book, save yourself some money and just send me ten bucks.  I'll then call you (on my own dime) and summarize the book for you.  Oh, what the heck, I'll do it now, for free...surround yourself with a competent team of advisors 
 sstephen king can blame no one but himself for this missfire of a movie,because HE WROTE THIS JUNK! never finds it's feet, horror,comedy,drama,fantasy,adventure,and even thriller,it tries to be all and fails at each one!!! skip it!! 
 Recently I got into a conversation with the guy next to me on the plane about some of the memorable books we had each read in the past few years.  Unfortunately, I had to recall `Confidence'-easily the worst book I've read in years.  To describe it as disappointing is to go easy on Ms. Kanter.  It is far beyond that, and altogether abominable and embarrassing.  That such a prestigious business school like Harvard can tenure a professor who writes such insipid pablum boggles the mind.  Let's start with the central (and only) idea of the book--that winning begets winning and losing begets losing.  This of course strikes most people as fairly straightforward and unworthy of a book's worth of elaboration.  Yet Ms. Kanter tumbles all over herself to spell out the details: why this is the case (as if someone with an ounce of inferential ability couldn't figure it out in a couple of minutes), how it affects team morale, how it self-perpetuates, etc...  And worst of all, endless, endless, endless examples that do nothing or very little to elucidate; rather, they simply restate what has just been said.  And they restate and restate and restate.  Tautological (I think the word was invented in anticipation of this book), boring, tedious, insipid, stupid, unthoughtful, unenergetic, disengaged, disrespectful.  All these adjectives apply forcefully to the book.  Most of all, though, it is utterly uninventive and cliched.  Turn to any page and you'll find such gems of penetrating insight as (forgive me, but these are so funny I have to quote at length):   "Winning feels good, and good moods are contagious.  Success makes it easier to view events in a positive light, to generate optimism.  It produces energy and promotes morale.  It is easier to aim high and expect to reach the target."  (P. 29)  "Overcoming obstacles, leaping over hurdles, and recovering from fumbles can strengthen a team that has the discipline not to panic under pressure." (P. 71)  "Once the 'loser' label gets slapped on, those suffering losses are set up to fail.  They find it harder to get support, harder to get opportunities." (P. 115)  "Various turnaround tasks operate on different clocks.  Bold strokes are fast and can be done by one powerful person; long marches to change culture and behavior take more time and the commitment of many people.  Execution is play by play, game by game, while strategy is season by season..." (P. 178)  "People embodying the pathologies of the past can always be replaced, but eliminating the bad does not automatically produce the good.  It takes a major effort on the part of leaders to foster confidence that a demoralized company or group is capable of working together and succeeding at it.  Restoring people's (sic) confidence in one another requires four kinds of action..." (P. 241)  "Confidence is an expectation of a positive outcome, but what happens when outcomes are negative?  The dividing line between winning streaks and losing streaks is the choice of behavior in response to setbacks...  That decision to build rather than retreat, to rally rather than get discouraged, involves viewing setbacks through an optimistic lens, as an opportunity to learn and move on." (P. 357)  And it just goes on and on, mercilessly and cluelessly.   The wisest, most incisive business people read, study and think about far more than just sports and business.  I would recommend Ms. Kanter first enroll in a decent freshman-level literature or history seminar.  There she can learn to write and, with some effort on her part and perhaps a bit of luck, to formulate some imaginative approaches to problem-solving.  Beyond this bilge, I have had the good fortune to come across many books that have helped address confidence.  These are: selected essays by Montaigne and Emerson, `Hamlet', Whitman's "Song Of Myself", David Herbert Donald's biography `Lincoln', `Emotional Intelligence', `Flow', and Jack Welch's `Winning'.  `Confidence' inspires confidence only in the realization that you (no matter who you are) are at least intelligent enough to be the "Ernest L. Arbuckle Professor" at Harvard Business School 
 The purpose of all truly good poetry is to reduce stress in readers or listeners, calming them both physically and emotionally.  This has been proven in many scientific studies, but these poems only create more stress  due to their subject matter, which is source of anxiety and tension for all  but the luckiest of mortals. The filmmakers would have done better by their  fellow man had they refrained from reprinting these misguided poems from an  earlier, more insensitive era in our species' history 
 I didn't think this was that great.  I read this in one night and I was not impressed at all 
 The only reason why I finished this book is because I held out hope (even till the last 10 pages) that the entire 600 pages would actually explain what the whole "Game" and "secret" was (because there was no POINT to the entire plot - it was almost like 5 year-olds in a sandbox seeing who could collect the most lego pieces, except this was a really really big sandbox), and would have somehow been worth my time. No such luck 
 The best part of this book was the cover. A wonderful picture of a sunset in the mountains. Had the cover made it clear that the "author" did nothing more than take excerpts from other books I never would have  bought the book. The excerpts were taken so that you never really knew who  you were reading about. His choices left me feeling used and I am sure he  ruined several good books for me. None of the stories related in  "Wild" has convinced me to read the whole book. What a shame 
 I purchased the Alex Watch for my 8 year old daughter as a gift from Santa.  The watch face has a small round purple piece that sits in the center of the wathch face where the small and long hands are positioned.  This piece came loose and is floating around the watch and jamming the hands.  So, the watch hands cannot move forward.  Frustrating and useless, since I cannot return it 
 I am giving Truffaut's interview with Hitchcock a single star because it has been revered as "the" book on this master director for way too long.   I first read this book years ago as a new student of film and Hitchcock.  Since that time I have read lots more about Hitchcock and with each new piece of the puzzle, have determined after re-reading it recently that there is little that is new or exclusive to this book.  Hitchcock often told the same stories elsewhere, both before and after publication of this book some thirty plus years ago.  The books sole value is as an entertainment, or as a Hitchcock-primer.  This book merely provides what Hitchcock wanted to say of himself, the packaged image, just like his famous caricature.  There are many other books to choose from which offer a more complete portrait.  Seek them out .. 
 DVD came in the mail ripped up.  DVD lose inside package 
 My question throughout the book was "Why?".  This was not a story that screamed to be written.  There was no uplifting message or eye-opening resolve.  I can't understand why a talented writer would waste her valuable time writing it or why I wasted my time reading it.    The characters aren't sympathetic or real enough, the story manages to be syrupy and tawdry all at the same time, and the ending wasn't an ending - just more of same.  It's not a bad book - it's just not a good one 
 If you are interested in learning about the *actual* science of food, but don't want to learn any science, at least read a book by someone who *did* learn it.  There is so much grossly erroneous information in this book that he discredits himself entirely.  "Oil is more dense than water-- and that's why it can be heated to higher temperatures than 212".  As a chemist and formulator I can assure you that nearly all oil is lighter than water, and even if it weren't that's *not* the reason it has a higher boiling point.  Ever make oil & vinegar salad dressing?  Ever seen crude oil on the ocean?  How about the funk on top of old greasy dish water?  Folks, oil floats on water... and the earth is not flat.  Either this guy is a complete moron, or he is a very clever con artist.  Either way, save your money... and buy that blind Amish author's book "Semiconductor Microengineering for Dummies" instead.  It's better researched 
 I bought this book based on its rating. Unfortunately, virtually every page of this book is half blank. Furthermore, there are many unnecessary blank lines within the text page. The format of this book is like for third grade. Also, the author uses Java code along with his text. But at the end of each chapter, he uses C++ code as a duplication of the Java code.    If you want to know and learn Design Patterns, make sure you look at "Software Architecture Design Patterns in Java" by Partha Kuchana. This book covers 42 design patterns including the 23 GoF patterns. Also, you might like to look at "Core J2EE Patterns" Second Edition by Alur, Crupi, amd Malks 
 to be honest I expected a little more from the movie.  it was too mellow and somewhat boring.  
 A light, light, light book. The best that can be said is that it's a good book for when you're totally brain-dead; it gives you something to look at that doesn't take much intelligence. Slightly escapist.  Other than that, it's a mess. The characters are basically modern people set back in the 1800's, with token allusions to the era. The way they spoke and behaved, aside from overused exclamations such as "Zounds," was much more 2004 than 1804. Others have spoken of sloppy history; I don't know enough to critique that, but it wouldn't surprise me. I grew increasingly irritated by the anachronisms.  In short, I have a sneaky suspicion the author has good connections. To get not only this book published, but an entire series?? Zounds 
 I'm a senior at Oglethorpe University, minoring in English, and I have to say I was disappointed in having this text as my last assignment in our class "The Child in Literature" and as my last English assignment ever.  I found the characters flat and the symbolism overt and unengaging.  At first I thought that the children acted the way I expected them to because they are children.  Children are easily manipulated by their environment.  But as the book progressed, the reader could see each character take the expected turns, and land in the expected outcomes.  Cody needed a father, throughout the entire novel, so obviously he will emulate his father in his adult life.  Jenny is a brilliant girl searching for real companionship, so her end is just as predictable.  And Ezra.  From the monopoly scene in the beginning to defeat in his love life, I never once thought he would veer from that path, and end up any differently than he did.  A book that does not challenge it's readers, and does not invoke any hope in a different outcome, is a very flat and disappointing book.  Even the food symbols, or the name associations, or the exact mirrored images of some of the characters (Luke and his game, or Luke and his recorder, anyone?) are blatently handed out and explained.  I like what Tyler was trying to do, and I can take the characters for what they are, and maybe enjoy them, but as someone who loves to remove the author's intention and just delve into a text, this book upsets me.  Tyler leaves literally no room for interpretation at all.  That might make her a "good" writer, but it certainly doesn't make it a good book.  A book you can't discuss or argue over the meaning of seems pointless.  I can see myself in every one of those characters, but I didn't learn anything from it.  This, to me, seems like light beach reading.  Though the subject is so dark, I don't think I could even recommend it for that. 
 I have always hated the coy sex comedies of the early sixties -- men "taking advantage" of women who had to protect their "virtue".  Who could possibly have thought a remake would be a good idea?  This is no tribute, its a virtual copy of something that was witless and offensive to begin with.  I watched this on cable just to see if Renee Zellweger really took part in a movie as bad as this looked, and she did and it was.  No update, no twise, just a pastiche of bad movies.  Even the clothes were so over the top that poor Renee looked like a child playing dress-up 
 The depression era introduction was the best part of this movie as another reviewer mentioned. From the moment they reached King Kong's island the movie quickly spiraled to a painful viewing experience. I felt no sympathy for the big stupid ape. How can anyone feel anything for King Kong? He keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island, forces them to provide him sacrificial women, and tortures the female star of the movie. It seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking King Kong. The villains of the movie were my heroes. I kept hoping they would succeed in killing him so the pain of this awful movie would end 
      I wish I would have came here and read the negative reviews before I ordered this book. Buried underneath all of these glowing reviews are a few that were much more appropriate. This book is almost like studying German in order to learn English. One of the key reasons for wanting to learn about notes, scales, chords, arpeggios, etc., is to be able to communicate with other musicians. Like one of the reviews said, unless the people you're with know this system, it's not going to help. I'd recommend the Hal Leonard/Musician's Institute book "Guitar Fretboard Workbook" by Barrett Tagliarino. It's available here on Amazon, and is the best written book I've come across. I gave it a quick first read-through, and everything made enough sense that I fell that once I read it a few more times, I'll understand it all thoroughly 
 My mom has her BA in child psychology and she thinks this is a great book, my sister with two sons loves it but I as the aunt with no children dislike it. This book tells the story of three baby bird who wake up to discover they are alone. The best part of this book is that there discussion about where mom has gone keeps them from getting into mischief. The worst part is that it gives the impression that mom will sneak out during the night without so much as a goodbye-I don't personally know a good mother that will do that as it just increases the anxiety experienced by a child.  Gave it 2 rating because somehow my nephews love it. I personally prefer other books like the editor said that create a better scenario to help children cope with separation anxiety 
 Dragonheart did not need a sequel. The story was told. It is over. The first movie peaked therfore, end of franchise. This has bad acting, terrible C.G.I., and stupid story. Stick with the first 
 Keegan started out years ago with a bang with The Face of Battle, in which the post-Vietnam and, for the UK, a post-Empire spirit made for a genuinely innovative military history.  This early promise has NOT been fulfilled, and Keegan has declined considerably in quality because he's become co-opted by the Establishment, a post-Empire, Blair establishment every bit as corrupt as Haig.  Keegan has never served in combat yet loftily recommended in the 1980s that the "tempo" of the next war (which as a Sandhurst insider he was probably planning) be increased to 24/7. In this, he gave NO consideration to the high levels of post-traumatic stress and the war crimes that have resulted from the US policy of "no sleep until Baghdad" in the second Iraq war.  Keegan is post-Sixties, all right, but instead of peace and love, he's a Nietzchean who'd wage war with the poor man's body.  His "war" is chateau generalship by the rich, actually fought, 24/7, by British working class lads, blackfellows from Britain's few remaining colonies, and of course Americans.  Keegan popularized and made respectable for a new generation the old lie, subtly and over time, dulce et decorum. Precisely by foregrounding war's utter brutality he made it somehow acceptable and ONCE AGAIN a test of manhood, and this has gotten people killed.  His book on Military Intelligence managed, idiotically, to dismiss MI as secondary and not critical precisely, almost to the day, when the American and British MI was declaring victory (remember Mission Accomplished?) and failing to see how disbanding the Iraqi army would create the insurgency.  The Iraq War recounts the war as a board game with neither any anticipation of the postwar mess nor any compassion whatsoever for the men and women who fought it, or the Iraqis brutalized. At key points, it expresses a puzzlement about the failure of Iraqis to greet their "liberators" which shows a willful incomprehension of anything outside military science.  Ignore all writings by John Keegan until he issues a public apology for the lives this twit has destroyed while sipping pink gin at Sandhurst. For a good history of the Iraq War cf. Thomas E. Ricks, THE IRAQ WAR 
 I have read this book, Mr. Moon's "Divide and Quit", Mr. Khosla's work, "Stern Reckoning" amongst others on the subject of the Partition. Ms. Butalia's work is so saturated with her personal opinions and idealogy, that it almost ceases to be a work on history than the airing of one's thoughts and mindset. Almost a diatribe, if I may. I will agree with what john_galt_who has written. I think he has hit the nail on the head. I did not consider this book worth either the money or the time 
 I've heard this book on tape, which, poor writing aside, is more horrifying to actually hear O'Reilly read in his own voice. The gratuitous sex (which can only be appreciated if you also enjoy harrassing others with phone sex and falafels) is enough to turn anyone off, but THAT VOICE narrating the suggestive scenes is waaaay too much to endure. A sad, sad example of narcissism at it's very worst 
 I found this "How To" book while researching shop tools to purchase on Amazon.  Hey morons, this stuff is ILLEGAL! I hope the FBI / CIA and every government agency in the USA and elsewhere is keeping tabs on the purchasers and authors of this crap. Keep sending in those cards and letters so those of us with an ounce of sanity can keep track of you.   Something I am sure the author forgot to mention:  "Please stare directly into the barrel when testing these products" 
 The good first. There is a lot of good. I enjoyed and agree with every chapter except the chapter about men keeping a visual rolodex of sexual images for their perusal.   My husband and I have a great marriage. He knows I have the utmost respect for him and he has great love for me. He is certainly not ever wanting more sex, just complaining about how he feel like a piece of meat sometimes. (In jest I'm sure.)I say that to show, that not coming from a prude, the author puts for the idea that men just lust and fantasize about women nonstop and it's normal. I am quite sure she used the word normal at least twice. It was dealt with like, it's a fact so get used to it.  Your man might chase women around home depot to get a better look, or go out to dinner with you and remain preoccupied with the hostess all night. The men give accounts of this, like, oh well, doesn't mean I don't love my wife.  In my opinion, just b/c they aren't willing to risk actually acting on those thoughts, doesn't mean it's ok.   I found the book to be very very discouraging. That a bunch of married Christian men would unapologetically (key word here)see a woman in a fitted worksuit no less (we're not talking lingerie here) and think about what she's like in bed or what her nipples look like. There's no mention that maybe this is lust or committing adultery in your heart. Or maybe they should not do this. It really threw me for a loop! I guess I didn't realize just how insecure or sex crazed men are. Not that I think they don't want a lot of it. But I found it discouraging for Christian wives to think that their husbands can't go to work without picturing everyone naked.  I found it disturbing that the book is purporting this is giving the idea to men a lisence to do this since it's "normal" and women just need to get used to the idea 
 Some years ago at a friend's house with whom I was in a Bible study, I picked up an old edition of Halley's Bible Handbook, and thumbed through it. It appeared to be a great resource with lots of useful and interesting cultural and textual background on the entire Bible. I decided I needed to get myself a copy. What I found in a Christian bookstore was a new edition of the Handbook that was distinctly different from the older edition I had looked at, in both style and substance. The book is attractively presented with photos of the regions pertinent to various parts of the Bible, with text "chunked" out into digestible sections and sidebars. As I started to read through it, though, I realized how different this really was from the previous Halley's.It appears that what happened is that after Dr. Halley passed away, those who continued in his estate, including subsequent revisions of the Handbook, replaced what was an informative and useful guide into something that is instead distinctly fundamentalist and anti-intellectual in tone. You should realize that I am an evangelical Christian, so when I say "fundamentalist," I mean just totally ignorant of modern scholarship, evangelical scholarship or otherwise. Other reviewers have already pointed out this general and widespread characteristic, and I wanted to register my agreement while making it clear that I'm not coming from some "liberal," loosey-goosey perspective.An example: in introducing the book of Daniel, it starts right off the bat with something like "Unbelieving minds deny the authorship of Daniel, but..." and then proceeds to be simply dogmatic instead of presenting the perfectly respectable scholarship which defends the authorship of Daniel in the era when it was purported to be written. This kind of tone is present throughout the book. Looking at Amazon's offerings, I see another edition of Halley's Handbook dating from 1961, and it would appear that that is more or less the one I was originally attracted to. That one I recommend, and that much more than this 1100-page tract 
 Bev Harris, Black Box Voting: Ballot Tampering in the Twenty-First Century (Plan Nine Publishing, 2003)  The first thing that needs said about Black Box Voting is that Bev Harris has some things to say that people certainly need to hear. And since the release of this book, things certainly haven't gotten better; electronic voting machines of the type Harris talks about in this book continue to proliferate, and politicians continue to use the system to their own ends. (Anyone shocked by the recent Rolling Stone article about the theft of the 2004 election simply wasn't paying attention; those of us in Ohio were well aware of Ken Blackwell's underhanded tactics throughout 2004.) There's a lot that the average American can learn from this book. However, it has one massive flaw that will keep it from ever being effective: its presentation of those facts.  Technical books, as a rule, should not be written by non-technical people. Harris makes some mistakes that are especially confusing given that she does seem to know, sometimes, what she's talking about; for example, she explicitly defines the term open-source as it relates to software, and the definition is correct, but every other time she uses it in the manuscript, it's misused (open-source software, for those of you who don't know, is software whose source code is generally available, and is usually built and maintained by a community of developers, most, if not all, of whom are unpaid; Harris mostly uses the term to refer to Diebold software that was left on a server accidentally, was never meant to be available to the public, and has never been built or maintained by anyone but Diebold employees and Diebold-maintained consultants). She also mistakenly uses the terms PCMCIA card and memory card interchangeably despite noting in at least one place that a PCMCIA card can also be a modem. I've never seen a modem with its own memory before.  Aside from that, there's the issue of Harris' prose style. Nonfiction writing, be it boring or readable, always maintains at least some minimum standard of professionalism. Harris is quick to throw professionalism to the wind too often here, and as a result comes off sporadically as the schoolyard bully chanting nah-nah-nee-foo-foo at teachers while across the street from the school.   Both of these shortcomings hamstring what would otherwise be a very important, valuable contribution to the world of the political expose. I hope there is eventually a second edition, one that has been attacked by an overzealous editor. That book, if it is ever brought to light, could well change the face of American politics. As it is, it's far too easy to write it off as the ravings of a crank. * 
 I bought these walkie-talkies for my daughter.  Neither the text nor the walkie-talkie part works.  Save yourself the aggravation 
 I thought this movie was absolutely awful.It is one of the worst movie's I have seen in quite a while.You keep waiting for the movie to get interesting, but it never does.I don't recommend this movie, especially not to a guy, he would be bored out of his mind by this one 
 This book is simply awful. I gave up after a hard slog through ninety percent of this dreck. The author simply can't write. It sounds callous, but after enduring this book I feel less sympathy towards the yound Marines fighting and dying in Iraq. No wonder they call them grunts. I made a resolution long ago to never read books by the enlisted and this book reinforced that. That Mark Bowden of Black Hawk Down fame endorsed this book is unfathomable to me. Read 'A Rumor of War' by Philip Caputo if you want a superbly-written account of war. On the other hand, if you want to waste time and money, read Jarhead 
 I always complain about how CDs are unoroginal but this one is,but a little bit to much for me.I know an entire album devoted and sang by cheerleaders,wow! but i just don't buy it,even if i already had,which i regret bitterly,lol.I just thought the first tracks were catchy but the rest of the CD is simply painful and boring.Anyway if you love it,good for you,but for me,not a chance,such a shame!.. 
 On one hand, this book makes useful points and divorce and its impact on children and offers better alternatives. The problem with it is that most of the evidence is anecdotal. I don't think a lot of the problems the people in the book had were due to divorce, but to the way their parents handled the divorce. Many of them either leaned on their children too much for support or they went from giving their children attention and affection to ignoring them in favour of work and other mates. A lot of the problems could have been lessened with more care. Especially in the case of the fellow who had a congenital heart defect. He needed attention and help, he didn't need to be shunted off to the side. I'm also reading about attachment issues and how they can impact a person from the time they are a baby to an adult. If a person has to divorce, they should ask themselves if it is the right thing to do and if all other options have been exausted. Forcing people to stay together in a stagnating marriage seems a bit cruel to me, like in the case of the intact family she used as an example.  Also, I do not agree with her stating that children don't notice the tention and fighting in their family. They do. Children notice more than people give them credit for. Like so many experts she paints with too broad a brush. She uses too many generalizations. It lessens the impact of her argument. But, a lot of the advice she gives to the system could be used to make divorce easier on parents and children. Divorce isn't going away anytime soon, but, with responsibility and care perhaps it can be easier on children. It is hard for children to adapt to changes. I suggest looking at the advice she offers, but question her methods and conclusions 
 This book is a pice of crap. Is a construction paper catalog with a few words!!! 
 This was the first book I ever read that was written by SM Stirling. Now that I have read it, I wont buy any of his books again. The book was so long and dragged out to explain every minute detail that had absolutley no connection with the story at all. About half the book as explanation, and the plot was dry when it surfaced. Sace your money, don't by this horrid book! 
 This thing doesn't massage, just vibrate, and two of the motors died quickly. Although the product is supposed to be covered by 2 year warrenty, the customer service is non-existent. Stay away from this, definitely not worth the money 
 Inspector: Deux Deux, we place loser gangsta rapper Juvenile under arrest. Deux-Deux: What are the charges Inspector. Inspector: First, he trashed our President and FEMA on Get Your Hustle On. Deux-Deux: That is treason. Inspector: Rodeo and the rest of this album degrades women(Rodeo), glorifies violence and praises chronic and looting! Deux-Deux: In addition, he advocates domestic violence, robbery, murder and illegal substances. Inspector: Finally, he degraded his own fans at a record launch party by a)telling a girl at his album release party that "he didn't give a f--k about her and none of ya'll b*tch*s and just want you to support my music and buy it" showing he is a greedy money hungry thug, b) this loser got into a confrontation with a female at the club exposing him for being an insensitive hypocrite and finally got into a fistfight with a white DJ. Deux-Deux: Proves he is a bonafide racist(like Kanye West) with a very nasty and abusive attitude. If you want rap, buy Run-DMC or The Fat Boys 
 With that one line, Jessica Simpson went from being a D/C grade level celebrity to being one of the most beloved, well known airheads.  The show itself was kind of lame, neither she nor Nick is the sharpest tool in the shead, but they at least have a few entertaining moments here and there.  I don't care for reality TV shows at all, but I gave this one a shot.  I gave it 2 stars for the chicken or fish comment, and that one scene where she spent $2000+ on underwear and pissed him off.  Otherwise it was just another show that you watch because it's on 
 First let me say that aside from any of the ideas presented, this book deserves a low rating just because of how horribly it is written.  Skinner has no real style and simply rattles of declarative sentences at such a monotonous pace that I was practically tearing my hair out at the end of the book.  And for all the mechanistic nature of his writing, he's suprisingly inept at conveying a point.  But getting to the ideas contained therein.  This book combines the very shaky "science" of behaviorism with the silliest doomsday rhetoric that was so typical of the decades following the invention of the atomic bomb.  Skinner starts off by talking about how horrible the human race has thus far managed itself, how we are in danger at any second of annihilating ourselves.  This kind of alarmism was probably very convincing in the 70s, but it hardly has any force with reasonable people today, who realize that, despite our flaws, we seem to be pretty good at surviving.  Skinner then goes into the meat of his book, which is pretty much summed up by saying, "There is no circumstance under which humans are not controlled.  It's just a matter of the form the control takes, and there's no such thing as an autonomous agent inside us.  We need to accept that and engineer the perfect society by devising ways of control that are better."  If you read those three sentences, you don't really need to read "Beyond Freedom & Dignity," but for those who are curious, I'll say a few more words, mainly criticism.  The first criticism is that, of course, Skinner just constantly and tediously repeats that it is an established scientific "fact" it is that we are purely products of the environment (whether personally or through evolution) without justifying it very well.  Paradoxically, he admits that the science of human behavior is poorly developed compared to, say, biology and physics, and in fact hasn't progressed much since Aristotle. He is oblivious to this contradiction.  On the one hand, he wants it to be certain and unquestioned that a human can be completely explained by his science.  On the other, his science is underdeveloped (because people have not accepted that it is true yet).  He seems to think that behaviorist science does not need any sophistication or development in order for it's most weighty premise--that humans have no autonomy--to be an accepted fact.  Skinner puts the cart before the horse.  The second criticism is that Skinner never really gets down to any even slightly useful details on what his Utopia will look like.  His excuse is, again, that behaviorist science is still not developed enough, I guess.  But it seems like someone who says, "We must change our culture so that it has the best possible effect on our lives" isn't really saying anything profound.  In other words, his dramatic plan for the human race reduces to nothing more than saying, "Let's do things better."  In a book of 200 pages, Skinner really doesn't give much information at all.  It's worth mentioning that after every chapter he gives a short one-paragraph summary of the ideas in that chapter.  He could have simply published those summaries and retained about 90% of the real content of his book.  Thirdly, Skinner is oblivious to the inherent contradictions in his position.  If man is just a product of his environment, with no real autonomy, no inherent ability to act in and of himself, then how can we even "plan" anything for the future?  If a superior culture does develop, it cannot be considered anything but a happy accident.  It can't even be considered "happy," since that term implies some inner agent who is happy.  I guess we would just say, "It would be favorable for the participants."  There is something just simply idiotic in saying, "We should design a better culture, because none of us have free will and are just products of our culture."  I suppose Skinner only wrote his book due to the stimulus of his environment and thus can't be blamed for the inconsistency... But the point I'm making is that in order to act for positive change, you have to feel like you have some autonomous capacity to change things.  All in all, the book is rather dated.  The idea of man as simply a machine that converts stimulus to response, with emotions and thoughts (if they exist at all) as mere side effects is absurd to anyone who does a little introspection instead of, say, studying figures on how incomes and education relate to robbery convictions.  And the doomsday scenarios that motivate the work are much less compelling (to reasonable people, at least) than they used to be.  I don't recommend this book unless you have some scholarly need to read it.  On final reflection, it appears to me as simply an attempt by Skinner to profit off the anxieties of his times rather than an earnest attempt at offering useful knowledge to mankind 
 It's very good, and I only give it one star because my teacher ruined it for me.  She analyzed everything Arthur Miller wrote in it, whether the lights were to be dark, or bright, how he shift time, how the instruments played, believing symbols of all of them.  Contrary to Arthur Millers own statements which I printed out and gave to the class, that he didn't plan on anything, he just wrote.  Let people do with it what they do.  In that affect, the teacher took a great play, and ruined it with her ideas of what he meant.  
 "Salvador" completely discredits Joan Didion and all of her books. The two weeks she is believed to have "lived" in El Salvador was actually a mere four hours. Any truths in this book, and there are but a handful, have been obtained by outside sources, not by her own "research." I lived in El Salvador when she came in to gather info for her story. It is an outrage that she so flippantly used the sufferings of the Salvadorans to effect personal gain. If you want to read fiction, go ahead. She's a good storyteller. As a service to yourself, however, keep in mind that the author has almost zero first hand knowledge of what she writes. The only reason I have the book at all is that my father gave it to me. What a shame that he wasted his money on this piece of trash 
 Certainly the first page had me tempted to throw the book into the nearest recycle bin! Only trash begins with 'The girl sat mesmerized by fear in the big chair. Please does that interest you in the character? Oh and fear lit her face, excuse me, fear never lights up a face, it drains it of color, makes it ridged, stretches the skin taut against fragile bones. Has this writer ever seen true fear on someone's face? The antagonist calls her a silly child, then launches into a moronic monologue. How corny and melodramatic. All these offenses to the storyteller's art in less than a page! Did Norton truly edit,look or even glance at that first limp opener? I've read better lines in a first grade primer! If I could do so with out causing copyright infringement problems, I would take every page and rewrite the entire thing. Unbelievable what tripe is published now. Please tell me, in all seriousness, it was just a matter of wanting the royalties from the use of the famous name on the cover. For using a challenging fantasy world created by that well known writer. I could forgive that. I can not if anyone truly thought there was even a hint that this other individual could write anything more engaging than a toilet roll wrapper. An award winner? It must have been a very low turn out of talent that week. I will not pick up another book by this 'other' writer again. I've read the works of great writers and fair, but this was inexcusable 
 I enjoy reading Sylvia Browne, Sonia Choquette, Deepak Chopra, Christiane Northrup, and Dr. Wayne Dyer, but Doreen Virtue seems to miss the boat on these other authors. I am not quite sure what it is...I believe in the rising of the feminine principle--not to overtake the masculine principle but to balance it. However, if one wants to learn more about angels and goddesses, I believe there are better books out there. There has to be...I am going to continue to search. If you want to read a book to base a comparison to the above authors or other Hay House authors, then I would get it from the library or browse through it at a book store first. 
 This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.  Sweetie, written and directed by award winning filmmaker, Jane Campion best known for the film "The Piano" is the story about a young couple in a distant relationship. One day the womans mentally ill sister Dawn "Sweetie" breaks into their house and lives with them. She is not on her medication and creates havoc. When her father visits after his wife leaves him, he tries to calm her but is unsuccessful.   It is never mentioned what kind of illness Dawn has. I thought the film was too graphic and recommend eaisliy offended people not watch it.  The DVD has some great special features. There is a theatrical trailer, behind the scenes photos, audio commentary by director Jane Campion and director of photography, Sally Bongers and screenwriter Gerard Lee. There are interviews with lead actresses, Genevieve Lemon and Karen Colston. There is a 1989 conversation between Campion and film critic Peter Thompson made after the success of her short films.   Finally, there are 3 of her short films made as a student. The first film, An Exercise in Discipline: Peel, is about a man and his son and sister out for a drive. The son has trown orange peels out the window and his father stops the car and demands he pick them up. The second film, Passionless Moments; is a series of short scenes about various situations. The third film, A Girl's Own Story, is about schoolgirls who do various activities.  This film is ok but is not appropriate for children 
 I watched the early episodes of "American Gothic" when they first aired, mainly because I liked star Gary Cole's work on the unappreciated "Midnight Caller."  He's great, and the stories were eerie and creepy, but I felt the show lacked suspense. To me, it needed a strong character to oppose Cole's Satanic sheriff. Watching him get his way each week got boring and predictable with no one trying to thwart him.  I eventually stopped watching the series after about a dozen episodes because of this 
 We bought this for our 7 months old and she did not like it at all. There was really nothing to amuse her. We had placed some toy's in it, but that still did nothing for her.If you are looking for somewhere to place your child and listen to them scream of boredom ... then here are your two stars. As far as bouncing, this was not a good idea. There was really no support to the walls of this item. Bouncing for a 18-20 pounder was not a good idea. The bouncer never sat straight, it always had a tilt to it. Maybe from the packaging. Also,the toy's hung wrong overhead as well. We are now 4 months later (of not that much use) throwing it out!!! Somewhere, it has sprung a leak and we cannot seem to find it either. So, overall ... this was not one of our better choices 
 So little is written about the Nagas - Tangkhuls, Maos, Kabius etc living in the Manipur State, or elsewhere in the north-eastern states of India. So this book doesn't represent 'all of the Nagas'. The modern-day Nagas are  warm, friendly, very hospitable and peaceful folks. Music runs in their  soul and they've got the voice to match! Yes, they are indeed, beautiful  people 
 I ordered this teapot because at the time it came with a free tea infuser. When it arrived, the teapot was broken, with a large section missing from the side. I returned it and had to pay the shipping to the company to reorder the same item after I received a refund only for the items price. After receiving my second teapot, it was cracked in the exact same spot. I returned the product and complained with no response. I was refunded the price for the teapot, but I am out $10 in the cost of shipping. It seems highly unlikely that two teapots would break in the exact same spot, so I would try a different product. 
 Predator is the worst book I have read in 2 months (I read a lot of books).  It is too dis-jointed and incongruous and lacks cohesiveness of plot and events.  The characters are poorly drawn (I hardly recognized the Scarpetta and Marino of earlier books).  The transition to reveal the perpetrator was abrupt and weak, leaving me feeling: "HUH??" This the fourth (and it will be the last) book by Cornwell that I have read.  It was totally disappointing and I spent extra time on it just so I could complete it and "Forget about it" 
 Tried attaching this to my tile sink splashboard... never would hold. Tried reattaching several times and would consistently fall off 
 The sound of fingernails scraping against a blackboard doesn't bother me.  However, the thought of having to read this book one more time to my 2 year old daughter causes me to shudder uncontrollably.    This book was given to my daughter in a secret gift exchange at her school (and I wish I knew who the secret gift giver was so I could return the generosity by giving them a DVD box set of The Wiggles).  And while she does like the pictures, I dread having to read this story to her whenever she asks.    Do me a favor and read the following sentence out loud:  "Baby Baby Baby Baby Please Baby Please Please Please Baby Baby Baby."  Isn't that annoying?  Well, that's pretty much what drives the story; the parents get on their daughter about different things throughout the entire book, and that's how they end every single sentence - "Don't be so slow, baby baby baby" "Don't splash the water, please baby baby baby please baby please please baby."  GRRR!!!!!!!!!!  Thank goodness it's short, but when has anybody ever tried to coax their child into doing something by saying, "Please eat your peas, baby baby baby baby?"  I read this and I feel like I'm reading about a family living in a mental institution.  And on the very first page of the story, the clock on the VCR is reading 3:00 AM; why is the child still up and the t.v. on at that hour??  I know that children are rambunctuous and full of energy and all of that, but I'M more awake at 3AM than my daughter is.  Now, why Dr. Seuss doesn't annoy me and this does, I can't tell you.  Maybe it's because I found the Mars Blackmon character from "She's Gotta Have It" so overwhelmingly annoying.  And someone came up with the idea that that character should provide the narration of a children's story.  He was the one who spent the entire movie trying to get into Nola Darling's pants, right?  Okay.    I'm sorry; I like an actual "story" when I sit down to read my daughter a bedtime story.  If the idea is to entertain children with annoying repetition, well then it succeeds.  But I think it's possible to create a story without having to sound like an idiot while telling it 
 What if I had made a horror movie in high school? It would have gone something like this..  My best friend Tara, an aspiring thespian who can fake cry really well, would be my star.  Before filming, we'd make sure to touch up Tara's delicious golden locks.  Oooops, A little bit too much bleach!   My story would revolve around a group of teenagers trapped in a strange house where they'd stumble upon an eerie, comatatose man wearing a bathing suit (Tom from the swim team would be a perfect fit...of course we'd have to shave his head...I wonder if he'd be willing?). The strange house will be dark and water will be dripping from everywhere, maybe in slow motion.  Tara and my other friends/actors will be extremely dim witted, and mostly deaf so that they can't hear each other very well.  My characters will then die one by one in entirely standard an unoriginal death sequences.  I'll think of some totally absurd story to tie everything together later, but it is sure to be absolutely terrifying. I'll save money by using a lot of stock footage, staging the car accident just "after" the accident occurs, and  scoring the music myself on my Casio at home.   Genius.  I'm going to be the most popular guy in school 
 Just a warning - 8 minutes doesn't count warm up, stretching, or the time it takes you to get up from the floor and situated to the next exercise (something that I find really annoying and ineffecient!).  I have not read Jeorge's book.  I got the routine from an excerpt in O! I don't understand why he doesn't pair exercises that are both on the floor or both standing - it's such a pain getting up and down, up and down.  Plus, I feel like you lose that whole idea of "no rest".  I'm sure I expend more calories to get up an down, but it's all too easy to take a sip of water or just in repositioning yourself.  I have been following WW while I have been doing the 8m workout (more like 10-15 for me), and I have not lost one pound.  I'll keep doing it, because it's probably better than nothing, but I'm not impressed so far (about 3 weeks) 
 I bought this book expecting to immerse myself in an epic struggle of Good vs. Evil.  I got a facile tale of the Southwest.  Buyers beware!  This is not the Miltonian epic, but rather a wolf in sheep's clothing 
 Our entire book club disliked this book. We had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters. Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did.   I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable!  It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness.   Aaaargh...must go and re-read Howard's End to dispell the queasy feeling left by On Beauty 
 I think this movie is so incredibly contrived and just so damn cutesy I don't know why it has gotten so much critical acclaim, especially about how it's all just so devastatingly human despite everyone acting like a cartoon character?  But being in a liberal arts college I have to listen to almost every other student rave about it so it must have some sort of generational following.  The characters and the situations remind me of the short stories I would write in the sixth grade when I was around 12 years old, where all of the characters have a bunch of dumb, absurd eccentricities that anyone could come up with if they wanted to because you're wanting so badly to be inventive and unique but in hindsight they make you cringe and tear up all those old notebooks full of such irritating, inane nonsense.  The whole movie feels like ones 12-year-old self trying to write about adult problems that they're distanced from yet infatuated by.  This movie appeals to the type of people who like to read Catcher and the Rye so they can either consciously or subconsciously think of their chain-smoking, wannabe-depressed but more like "I'm so sad 'cause I don't have a girlfriend" indie-rocker lives into some sort of literary wellspring.  I think the visuals in all of his movies are so tremendously appealing, it's unfortunate he can't just do fantasy films or something instead of these barely funny yet barely dramatic "subtle" messages on the human condition or whatever those critics say.  Hipster drivel - look for something else to watch 
 Transit station letter-writer-for-hire, Dora (although she writes letters she never sends) is relatively closed off from the world around her but is forced to open up when she is begged to write a letter for a woman to her young son's long lost father. As Dora witnesses this mother get hit by a bus in the next moment, she realizes the young son is basically orphaned for the moment. So she opens up, but not in the feel-good, maternal-instinct-to- spare way American viewers might expect. No, Dora is keen to exploit this find, and tries to sell Josue (the little boy) for a television. Eventually, though, Dora forms a kind of bond with Josue and goes out searching for the boy's father. Unfortunately it seems too easy for Dora, who is obviously hardened to life and all its sensitivities, to break down all these carefully formed barriers. Her emotion somehow does not seem authentic toward the boy. As a result, the performance is nowhere near the triumph most reviewers have claimed, and the film lacks a certain credibility. Sure, the film is watchable and somewhat interesting, but it was overrated. 
 I found this book to be unreadable. If most people are like me and hear a little voice in their head as they are reading, the parentheses the author uses in practically every paragraph means a constant interruption of the flow of the idea and presentation. O'Hanlon seems to believe (or maybe assumes) that we are interested (and need to know) in what the heck (hell?) he is thinking (doing, looking, analyzing) every minute as he sails (vacations perhaps?)across the Atlantic. He should just tell me what he wants me to experience; there is no need to suggest alternative thoughts. 
 I read the book only in part and I wouldn't buy it again. The author tries to "teach" with stories and anecdotes. Very basic.. 
 This album is seriously bland.  Smulch in spoonfulls.  I can't understand how JT's record label would allow him to release music so lacking in any spirit whatsover.  God only knows what encoraged me to buty it.  My advice to you is keep well away 
 The "Gold's Gym Nutrition Bible", while comprehensive in its approach to bodybuilding nutrition, is nonetheless vague and outdated.  Most of the nutrition advice offered is basic, beginner-intermediate level, and very little scientific research is quoted to support its claims.  A good point of departure for anyone seeking an introduction to bodybuilding nutrition, but not detailed enough to make a useful compliment to training and diet.  Most of the information between the covers of GGNB can be found on the newly mandated food package nutrition labels -for FRE 
 Blah blah blah... this guy is full of it! Not helpful-- this stuff is obvious.  I think this kid is actually helping the author to feel better about himself, not the other way around. Basically, it's BORRRRRRRRING!!! 
 This is another in a long line of works that try to deal with consciousness by dismissing it via some variant of eliminativism (e.g., "mind" is an epiphenomenon of "brain"). In other words, in this book consciousness is virtually ignored--the currently fashionable, pseudo-scientific position. As an antidote, read the works of Raymond Tallis (especially his "The Explicit Animal", and "On the Edge of Certainty"), a British physician who is not only a crack neurologist (he writes textbooks on this subject) but also a savvy philosopher who understands the severe limitations of what he calls the "neurophilosophies" such as the type espoused by Damasio.  (Look also at my own "The Unboundaried Self." 
 I would have been fascinated to read a comparison of how Protestants are treated in, say, Italy, Spain, Portugal or France.  What's that you say?  There Are no Protestants in those countries!?  They were tortured, murdered, driven out of their homelands or forced to convert to Catholicism many centuries ago!?  Wow.  I guess in comparison, American Catholics should consider themselves extremely lucky to be allowed to immigrate to a land founded by Protestants, to practice their faith, to get rich if they work hard, and to share every freedom that people of other denominations enjoy.  And, being so grateful for this freedom, I have no doubt that they all work hard to ensure that Protestants in Catholic countries have the same rights and privileges, right?  uh... Right 
 I see, some guy kills 7 people, and we're all supposed to be in awe of his many followers who write him love letters.  You gotta be kidding me?  I don't know what's worse, the fact that hundreds of people write to him to profess their admiration or that his lawyer published a book his letters. Would all of these Christians be so forgiving of Berkowitz if he hadn't converted to christianity?  You know the answer to that one.  What a waste of paper, and a pathetic reflection of our society 
 This had some great moments: better understanding of animal behavior, the debate between different religions.  But the only way I could finish it was by speed reading.  It's claim to be a story that will make you believe in God was the most unbelievable part.  Where did that even enter into the book?  Pi was spiritual and loved God but there wasn't anything that made this survival story make you believe in God more that the next 
 I found this book discouraging...depressing. The information may be of value to students of psychology but not to people who prefer a postitive outlook 
 The author should have stated that this book was fictitious rather than stringing the reader along.  The first few chapters are engaging, but it is unrealistic that she would leave her family and, on a whim, travel with "K" to his old Rhodesian War haunts.  It was also a fallacy to suggest that she was so naive as to not pick up on his attraction for her.  I was truly dissapointed by the self-promoting arrogance of this author and the trivialized generalizations that were haphazardly made about Africa.  A true waste of time 
 I have liked other Shari Tepper titles (especially "Shadow's End") but found this to a a huge disappointment.  Major plot elements concern U.S. domestic politics but these are unsophisticated to the point of being cartoonish. I can appreciate works by authors with a different political philosophy, like Ken MacLeod, but Tepper's Washington is so out of tune with reality that it's an impediment to the story. The bad guys -- conservatives all -- are really bad. There is no room for nuance or genuine differences of opinion. For instance, these characters are opposed to abortion because they're anti-woman, not because they object to the taking of life (I'm not advocating a view here, just objecting to her one-sided presentation). Later on and with no basis, conservative Senators grill the sole well-defined character, Benita Alverez-Shipton, as to whether she's had sex with the President. Does any reader believe that would come up in congressional hearings about alien visitors? To the book's detriment, Tepper can't get over the Clinton impeachment. These are ongoing annoyances.  Beyond the political, most of the men are dumb or evil; those that aren't still only care about physical beauty in a woman. There's also some creepy social engineering that wouldn't get the eager acceptance Tepper envisions.  These weaknesses caused me to think "this isn't the world I know." And that's a problem, for it distances you from the action.  I might have gotten over this black and white characterization and plotting. There is an interesting idea in how the 'good' alien's have developed a belief system and culture based on the illegible fresco of the title, and what happens when those beliefs are challenged. Unfortunately, that one thread was insufficient. The threat to their civilization and the simultaneous threat to earth by the predator alien species were not explicit enough, and combined with the "that's not my planet" feeling discussed above, it left me slogging to the conclusion rather than racing to it.  Tepper can do much better 
 This book came out at the same time that Judith Miller was doing the incredibly bad reporting for the NYTimes that lead the US into the Iraq War. Much of her reporting on WMD spurred interest in her book and increased its sales. I wonder how much her incredibly bad reporting that the Times has now repudiated as false and misleading can be credited to unconscious credulousness centered on the knowledge that more WMD fear would increase her book sales 
 What really struck me on first listening to this, was the superficial resemblance to old Weather Report recordings (this was before I actually got to the WR cover of "Boogie Woogie Waltz"; I subsequently listened to the original on Sweetnighter, which turned out to be far superior in every way). Part of the problem with this recording seems to be the ... musical ideas expressed on here; subtract Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul, and various WR drummers; replace them, and this is what you come up with. I almost had to turn it off when I heard those "cheezy" electric keyboard settings on a couple of tracks. A second listen (I always listen at least twice before getting rid of a recording), confirmed my initial assessment. Mr. Mcbride is a monster bass player, but this was almost embarrassing; he would have been much better off actually hooking up with Shorter, Zawinul, and company in a Weather Report revisited project. That would be really good 
 The John Carter of Mars series of books, by my favorite author of all time,   Edgar Rice Burroughs,  is his best series. I was so excited to receive the audio version of this book, but when I listened to it, I was hoorified !    John Carter sounded like a wimp.  A girly Southerner, not at all the swashbuckling hero I envisioned.   Now, maybe I'm spoiled by the narrators of other books, but even the weakest, most boring readings have not turned me off in the way that John Bolen has.   Please Tantor audio,  get some one else to read this, and make sure it is a Manly-Man ! 
 I love historical novels.  I really like a good romantic tale woven into those stories. For that reason I read and enjoyed "Katherine" by Anya Seton.  I later tried "Green Darkness" and was disappointed... and then tried Seton's "Dragonwyck" and really didn't care for it either. I saw these rave reviews over "Avalon" and decided to try another republished Seton book one last time. People, it is a chore to finish. I am doing so out of a sense of obligation... this book can't hold my interest at all.  The writing is simplistic.  The "romance" is dull.  The story is painfully slow. The characters are FLAT. I just don't get it. There are so many wonderfully written historical romances out there - all I can think is that the reviewers who've raved about it aren't regular readers of this genre and therefore aren't comparing it to other books & authors such as Sharon Kay Penman, Nicole Galland, or even Elizabeth Chadwick (more pure romance set against history than a blend of the two). I just can't recommend this book 
 The Charlie Moon series is getting more amusing and more "spiritual", for lack of a better word, as it evolves. Certainly, Moon has become a more interesting character.  He was always more interesting than the earlier protaganist in the series Scott Parris. I enjoy the series but it is not my favorite reading. I find hiding of clues and information from the reader irritating.  
 I did not care too much for this book.  I closed it wondering if I perhaps missed the point of it all.  It seemed more like a character profile than a novel.  
 The book is systematic, clear, quite concise, full of motivating examples, and full of practice exercises.  It is an effective training technique.  However, most of the info about reading potential is wrong, and it systematically trains you to miss important material.  As far as has been measured by professional reading experts, speed reading experts are unable to read at over 700words per minute at any more than 50% comprehension.  Buzan claims that you can.  To prove it, he sets up some nice and clear exercises and comprehension tests.    The reading tests are concocted by him.  They have all the main info to be tested in prominent places, written in a concrete way so they are easier to comprehend, and they repeat info that is written all over the book including the back cover.  The tests themselves are so easy you could get over 50% correct even without reading the material.  Some are common knowledge, and others can be worked out by looking at the other questions.   He breaks every rule of comprehension testing in an effort to make his methods and seminars look like magic.  Please do not be fooled!  If you do not like reading and you want to train yourself to misjudge comprehension, this book is for you. If you want to get a book for improving study reading, just get a good book on study techniques (sq3r etc)).  If you like reading, just get one of those nice helpful books on how to understand and appreciate novels.  Cheers D.Ray 
 I like Glenn Gould.  I didn't care for this movie however. 1)  The actor does not look like Glenn at all in my opinion, which I find distracting. 2)  Its very disjointed, and a lot of the components offer very little insight about Glenn or his life.  One scene was Glenn simply going into a restaurant and listening to other people's conversations.  Big deal, this is not interesting.  I know this was supposed to offer a subtle insight into his personality, but it's boring and it comes across as pretentious filmmaking.  Another example; Glenn is listening to a record with a cleaning lady.  Thats it. Why is this interesting?  Someone could film my uncle in Wal Mart, but would you care?  Hey, look...My Uncle Carl is buying batteries.  Now he is putting his change in his pocket.   How utterly profound....  In my opinion, you will learn and understand more about Glenn Gould by listening to his music than watching this lackluster, uneventful movie 
 I bought this book while researching the Logarithmic Spiral.  There were only a few references to the Logarithmic Spiral, so it wasn't spot on with what I was looking for.  However, I stayed away from this as a source because the text was difficult to read 
 reviewer PTR said it right, but i'll say it myself: this great, ingenious novel, when we cut to the chase, really s*cks, is really beyond brutal. the writing isn't bad, it's frightening, reaching new heights of convolution and impermeability. i've read Faulkner and liked some of his books. "Light in August" was powerful and hypnotic, and I did the obligatory The Sound..., As I Lay, and another of his earlier novels, the title of which, for the moment, I'm forgetting (but I swear I read it).  Absalom Absalom, assuming you're not a Faulkner cultist, will drive you to near suicide, so keep away any nearby guns. In other words, you may be tempted to take yourself out of your misery, forgetting you've got the freedom to put the book down (i finished it, aware that it was taking months, if not years, off my life). Go ahead, Faulkner fans, rip me a new one.  I can take it 
 I used this book in an MBA International Marketing course.  The text is a very cumbersome read.  While the book contains adequate anecdotal information, the information is poorly organized and often fails to engage the reader.  I routinely found myself searching for more concise supplemental materials for concepts the book failed to develop.  The narratives are extremely wordy and consistently obfuscate salient points.  If I were using the book as an instructor, I would use the country notebook section as a course guide and scrap the rest.   
 i tried the program and had a big disc blowout while performing these ultra aggressive exercise 
 A Natural History of Rape: Biological Bases of Sexual Coercion. All I can say is how can anyone think this way? It certainly is not based on scientific research. Children are not of child bearing age yet there are thousands, male and female, raped all over the world every year. How can the authors explain that? Is the act of raping children practice for men wanting to sharpen their rape skills in anticipation of raping an adult woman for sexual or reproductive reasons?   I do not know the root cause behind the act of rape but I am only too familiar with its consequences. The authors attempt to scientifically legitimize such violence against women and children was completely unconvincing. Now days it seems anyone can write a book and get paid for it. The more extreme and bazaar, the title and content, the better it sells. The authors surely had that on their minds when they came up with this absurd hypothesis. Just think of all the men buying this book. Now they can rape and feel justified by spending just a few dollars to clear their conscience. This book is ludicrous and dangerous in my opinion.   
 This book is a knockoff of PLACES RATED ALMANAC, a superior book that has gone through several editions since 1981.  The authors obviously weren't speaking to each other when they wrote this turkey.  There are too many incredible mistakes and contradictions.  Previous reviewers here have had a good time pointing out many.  Let me weigh in with more.  Rochester, Minnesota feels like a small town, "although the population exceeds 1 million."  Huh?  Rochester's metro population is 130,000 according to the book.  Could they have meant Rochester, New York?  For Rochester, New York, we do see that its metro population is 1.1 million and that one of its big negatives is cost of living.  Yet the book rates cost of living there at 90 percent of the US average of 100.  How is that a negative?  Could they have meant Rochester, Minnesota?  They also say Rochester, New York is the "fourth rainiest place in the country," yet the book's data show annual precipitation there to be well under the US average.  You want rain?  Let's travel to the Gulf South.  Houston's annual rainfall is well above the national average, which the book notes.  But it also notes that greater Houston "covers 900 miles, more than twice the size of Rhode Island."  Could they have meant "more than half the size of Rhode Island?"  Look it up: Rhode Island covers 1,545 square miles.  Further east on the Gulf, New Orleans has annual rainfalls well above the national average, too, and the book notes the area's flood-prone conditions and hurricane risk.  Yet the New Orleans's "inland water" is just 10 sq. miles, according to the book.  New Orleans was just drowned by 600 sq. mile Lake Pontchartrain, an inland body of water that is completely surrounded by New Orleans's parishes.  Still further east, Gainesville, Florida, "does not have serious problems with hurricanes."   On the next page, however, the college town is rated much worse for "hurricane risk" than New Orleans.  Whoa!  Nitpicking?  Not at all.  I'm just casually paging through this book, getting pretty uncomfortable with the multitude of mistakes.  One of Wilmington, Delaware's negatives is a lackluster forecast for "future job growth."  But the book says the area, "led by the chemical industry, became a prosperous industrial center and remains so today with a healthy future job outlook."  See what I mean?  The book is totally unreliable 
 It's still friends so its still good, but please don't waste your money on this season guys. I have seen every season of Friends and own most of them except for Season 4 and this is the worst! If your looking for a good season of Friends, I suggest 2,5, or 6 
  The first two "Anne of Green Gables" movies were terrific. Interesting characters carried you to a nicer place. This movie has more turmoil, rather than charming predicaments. This movie did not continue the characters of Green Gables for me.   This movie should have been made with new actors, rather than the Greene Gables cast, so that fans would not expect the charm of Avonlea to continue; which it does not here. However, if you have not seen the first two Anne movies, this film may be fine for you, and better than other things on TV today. I first recommend "Road to Avonlea", seasons 1-6 
 I am an avid Michael Crichton fan and have read pretty much everything he has written aside from his nonfiction books.  Crichton's writings are often full of action, complexity, character development, as well as a deeper underlying theme or message about society, technology, and human nature.  The Great Train Robbery was either lacking or painfully deficient of every one of these elements.  As I expressed in the title, it is written more as a historical documentation of an event rather than a traditional novel and is frequently interrupted by lengthy explanations of historical perspective.  The Victorian criminal slang used (although brilliantly) to tell the story makes it a slow, and at times, unintelligible read.  I give it two stars because it is obvious that Crichton has written a well thought out, well researched book; I only wish it didn't feel like I was reading his history report 
 I have read every Leaphorn/Chee book by Hillerman more than once and am a great fan. I just finished this book and discussed it with a friend.. we both agreed it was so disappointing.. we cannot believe it was written by the same person. The writing was awkward and heavy-handed... by the second page I suspected something was wrong here. It reads like some cheap Harlequin mystery/romance. The sensitive handling of Navajo spiritual beliefs, the beautiful rendering of the landscape, the terse but meaningful conversations are all missing.  All I can say is, the publishers need to pay more attention to future manuscripts and insure that a writer of Tony Hillerman's caliber is not allowed to decline in the public eye... he has given us much enjoyment.... he deserves better.  And if someone else is fleshing out Hillerman's plot lines.. the public should be warned 
 I recently bought this "Swing Time" CD as part of an eBay shopping spree. (I know, "fool me once," etc.) I saw that the disc had rave reviews here, and so I was willing to take a chance. Plus there were numbers on it that greatly appealed to me. ("Miss Annabelle Lee" by Mike Speciale was the clincher.) Well, I'm afraid the disc has that "Hebden touch"--that tell-tale sound of digital hedge trimmers above the music. Being more confident and resourceful now in the thick of middle age, I immediately ripped the disc to my hard drive and equalized it in Wavepad (though I imagine Audacity would work well also), cutting all frequencies above 4600 hz. I have to say that except for the one or two that were processed beyond recall (with that lovely underwater digital sound), I managed to create a quite listenable disc. No more loud, screeching, piercing digital noise.  Mr. Hebden always finds such delightful, rare records--and vandalizes them.  Good stuff here, hence two stars rather than one.  Still, I can't recommend this CD unless you are willing to re-equalize out the higher frequencies and you particularly wish to hear some of the selections.  
 I bought a KX-TG5100M and in 30 days, it died.  The phone battery not only died, but then it would not charge properly with an approved new replacement battery.  The base could not locate the phone handset.  So, purchase #2... the exact same thing happened, except this time it lasted 33 days.  The price for this phone should ensure that the thing works and works for a period of time more than a month 
 In today's world, various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism. These forms of parochialism may be ethnic, "cultural," religious, nationalistic, etc., depending on where you look. On one hand, ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups; on the other hand, multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace.  Example: the Turks and the Armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict ("Jihad" is Barber's label for this); yet they see the same Pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local Pepsi bottling plants ("McWorld" is Barber's label for this).  That's the book.   This might be a useful resource for writers of term papers who need to endnote something fairly obvious. Outside of that, it would take an observer from another planet to find this book's insights novel or pointed. If you're new to planet Earth, by all means pick up a copy. It will catch you up on a few useful truisms.  As others have pointed out, the "terrorism's challenge to democracy" subtitle seems intended to capitalize on 9/11, but doesn't accurately reflect the book's content. "Jihad" is deployed as a synecdoche in this book; Muslim extremism is just one of the book's many examples of parochialism 
 This could be the dumbest movie ever made (and that's a bold statement to make when one considers that "Underworld" also exists).  Sadly, unlike "Underworld" there is no leather clad Kate Beckinsale to drool over. Instead, we are treated to a movie that could easily be confused for a map of the human DNA (but a human with an extra chromosome).  Jason Statham, so likable in "Snatch", "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "The Italian Job" is thoroughly wasted in this flick.  When he's not busy escaping from his tricked out house, driving fast whilst looking cool and beating up on clichéd Euro trash delivers lines such as "Rule #1. Never change the deal" and is expected to act with a straight face when he's the recipient of this type of drivel - "You're always complaining, except when we make love. Then you say nothing.".  Thankfully, the one thing Stetham is great at is keeping a straight face. But you won't.  Not if you have a brain, that is 
 Quine tells a fascinating story about translation.  His is not a lazy mind.   His assumption (or belief) that language is learned completely through experience is simply false.  Ample evidence drawn from experiments in psychology, neuro-physics, and even common sense demonstrate otherwise.  Like the English philosophers who wrote about language and cognition centuries before him, his work will be found to be historically interesting, but ultimately dated; one might say, in the field of linguistics, pre-Copernicus.     
 Author is a Financial planner and recommends no self management of your own money.  Contains little original material most charts and tables are from the author's employer, Amex.  You will notice that each previous reviewer has only written a review on THIS book, and most reviewers are located near the authors home town in Michigan  What are the odds?  There is no over all plan in this book to manage your money, much less an original thought. Logic is heavily tilted towards using a planner and often nonsense. As an example on page 2 the author exhorts the value of Certified Financial Planner (CFP) with taken classes and exams, but on page 5 the reader will learn that a CFP takes a 2 day class and one test.  There are no impressive reviews or any review on the book cover except from the authors employer, Amex.  This book does not contain unbiased information.  Update:  The author is a part time professor at a local univeristy which 'encourages' publication  as a prof he might be great but as an author much room for improvement...  
 This poetry has no redemption or beauty. It is dry, sarcastic, dismal, and plain out unhealthy to the mind. It's not worth it. Read poetry that moves you to understanding, not this 
 I read this book after reading "The Wal-Mart Effect" (by Charles Fishman), and I immediately noticed that I didn't like the writing style in The Google Story (and trust me there was an extreme contrast between these books).  I think the title sums my aggravations up nicely: "The Google Story: Inside the Hottest Business, Media, and Technology Success of Our Time".  It seems to me that Vise is always trying to inflate the facts and turn them into some sort of sensational story (when he even bothers to use facts instead of a bunch of editorial).  Another thing that bugs me about this book is how Vise tries to inflate the "battle" between Microsoft and Google and make it sound like they are arch-rivals.  Google and Microsoft are operating in different spaces in the technology world currently.  Microsoft's bread and butter is Operating Systems, professional office software, IDEs, etc.  Google's bread and butter is advertising.  Sure, there might be a battle for the best corporate culture, but it's not like Microsoft releases Windows Vista and the Google team scrambles to release Google Earth 4.0 to show them up.  Vise also cites a speech given by Eric Schmidt at a school in Washington to illustrate this "battle" between companies.  I personally found Eric Schmidt's speech to be banal and irritating, and a mark against Google rather than for.  He sure did "attack Microsoft on their home ground", but how cool is that?  Schmidt pretty much acted like a jerk and tried to snatch up the best and brightest from a school in Microsoft's back yard so he could "flip the bird" to Steve Ballmer (who by the way is also a big jerk, so no big deal there).  But Vise makes it sound like it was some covert mission into enemy territory to make the world a better place.  As others have noted, there's no real wealth of "insider" knowledge on Google here.  I was hoping for a more technical book (e.g. I wanted more info on their clustering technology and less info on their investors).  He mentions that there was a fire that wiped out one of their data centers and their search engine coped with no problems.  How?  Doesn't it seem as if there would be a problem if a data center was taken out?  What about the search requests that were being processed by that data center at that time?  Still, I gave this book 2 stars.  Larry and Sergey were the saving grace, because their charisma and story somehow manages to shine (however dim or brief) through the pages of this book.  Because of that, I was able to get some value from this book.  But, I was able to derive value in spite of the author rather than because of the author 
 I really wish I could recommend this book. I love the idea of capturing Romans and using them as soldiers on other worlds. However, the writing style is so disjointed and hard to follow, that I found myself struggling to stay with it, instead of flowing with it and really enjoying myself.  Drake will begin a paragraph with a sentence describing some object in the scene. Then he will start writing about something completely different for the rest of the paragraph, and maybe a whole page, before going back to the original object. By the time he gets around to writing about the object, you have started to forget the original context. Reading this book requires a lot of re-reading to make sure you follow what is going on.  Another problem is that there are no chapter breaks. The book is divided into mini-books that are much longer than most chapters. So there aren't many good places to take a break and rest your tired mind (and it DOES get tired after struggling to follow the text).  Finally, the book doesn't have an interesting pacing structure. Until the final 50 pages, the book feels very monotone, empty of build ups, climaxes, dramatic slow moments etc...  This is another factor in the difficult reading. without the minor buildups, fast-paced action, and slow dramatic moments, it all starts to blend together into, one, long, droning, narrative.  And then the end hits you.  Its like Drake came back after a long recess. The writing style seems totally different. The final 50 pages are actually entertaining and much easier to follow than the vast majority of the book. But then it ends. Its so suddenly that I was angry. I plowed through all 250+ pages of mediocrity, finally hit the good part, and then it ended in what seems like mid chapter.  I can not recommend this book unless you are a die hard Drake fan 
 Ernest Hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300-page book and so does author Valerie Hemingway's story. For that reason this book merits only two stars. Early in her story of meeting Hemingway in Spain in 1959 at age 19, Valerie is aware of the author's magnetic and dominant personality, "Around him everything came to life....There was an urgency and vitality that...did not ebb."  When she stays focused on the story of Ernest Hemingway, this is an endearing look at the older, struggling Hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent Irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of "A Moveable Feast."  But the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject. As a result, her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as A. E. Hotchner's "Papa Hemingway." The two years she spent living and traveling with Hemingway through Spain, Paris, Key West, Cuba, and America, share as much space as her weird marriage with Hemingway's strange son, Gregory (apparently the other "bull" referred to in the title).   It shows the continuing vitality of Ernest Hemingway - even in death and over 40 years later - that a Valerie Hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man 
 I bought 2 charges to try and save a buck, but they are complete junk.  They worked, but never well, for about a month and then the metal charger tip totally pulled apart from the unit 
 I bought this book becuase I read Lets Get Real or Lets Not Play by Mahan Khalsa and was very intruiged by it.  Lets Get Real is a TERRIFIC book.  Little did I know that BusinessThink is basicly the coles notes version of Lets Get Real with two other names plunked above his.  There is little additional value added here.  If you want to get the same material but more of it and better presented, buy Lets Get Real 
  If you respect animals this book is not for you.  Putting aside the "glamour" that goes with the english accent and the cultural association that these authors have with that country, this book is really full of misinformation, and throughout the book there is a definite and marked slant against animals, this in my opinion separates us from nature, instead of uniting us with it, which should be one of the main purposes of wicca.   In the chapter about reencarnation, the author writes "non-human animals!??,in general, again perhaps excluding cetaceans, are not self- conscious, they are only dimly aware, if at all, of their own separate individuality. Psychically, each of them is part of a group soul. One theory is that on phisical death the non phisical elements in an animalare reabsorbed into the group soul of the species, which "buds off" new individuals from the common pool of physical manifestation.  This ludicrous theory reminds me of the attitude Christians have had throught the years, postulating that animals have no souls and exist only for our consumption, use and benefit, as written in the spiritual exercises of a very well known saint.    This attitude has lead only to exploitation, cruelty, and ecological imbalance,having had multiple cat households since I was a child, it is very easy to see, even for the non-psychic, that no two cats are alike, they have a definite individuality, and if someone is so callous, insensitive and bruttish, not to realize this, I really doubt they have any psychic powers whatsoever, so how can this authors claim to teach a skill they do not have?   A wiser, more logical approach is to be found in books of theosophical literature, in which they acknowledge the fact that animals will eventually incarnate in humans, (and my own observations seem to corroborate this fact) and that our present attitude towards them will be reflected in the kind of humanity that they will make.   Another major problem I found in this book is their approach to magic, amongst other things, they seem to raise power and direct it towards individual issues as different as "Bridie's persecution compex", "success in an interview for a job I applied for",  " my sister's missing cat" etc.    Bridie's paranoia, a successful interview, and the sisters missing cat, are very different problems which require the aid of very diferent aspects of deity, and in consequence, diferent incenses, colours, candles and ritual arrangements. I remember Dion's fortune reference to the parable of "the pearl of great price" regarding this topic, in which she mentions only one magickal goal is possible to be attained per ritual. And this is the same approach I've found in all books except for this one.    Their disregard towards animal rights is evident throughout the book.  In one of the plates they proudly display an athame made with a deer's foot!!?? 
 Twenty-something Bette lives in Manhattan, has a close knit group of friends, enjoys romance novels, and apparently possesses little fashion sense or celebrity IQ. Everyone Worth Knowing is the story of how she becomes an accidental success in the surreal world of celebrity public relations, and finds romance--real and fictional--along the way.   Maybe it's just me, but Bette seems to have problems many people would love to "suffer" through. Although told a lot of things about her, I never got the feeling I could really picture Bette or understand what she wanted, even in the end. Her story feels underdeveloped and many of the events predictable or random. Still, if you liked The Devil Wears Prada and enjoy modern formulaic romances, you will probably enjoy Everyone Worth Knowing 
 This book was so full of a trying-to-hard Austen language that  it was very annoying.  I didn't get past the first chapter.  The development of Margaret seemed fake and not in a way Austen had her heading in her novel.  Margaret desired to travel, but nothing is said of this.  Something like this would not disappear in three years.  Authors shouldn't stray from the original author's intention 
 The cover states the book is for "students and nonspecialist", which I found to be not true.   The best example was in the chapter Metaphysics, if you do not already understand the concepts and especially  Aquinas` arguements before reading the book you will definitly not  understand them after reading the book.  I felt the book confuses much more  than enlightens 
 I normally enjoy the Cussler books, especially the Dirk Pitt stories.  This one, however, is especially contrived and very confusing.  There is virtually no character development, so keeping track of the various pieces of the plot is difficult.  I felt like I was in the "fog of war", seeing hundreds of snippets and just hoping it all came together in the end.  Will the real Clive Cussler please come back?  
 This book is good if you are looking for comfort, it is disappointing if  you are looking for information. Advantages: It gives simple and clear  explanations about pregnancy complications with some background, so it can  be understood by almost anyone. Disadvantages: There is hardly any precise  data (for example: what level of protein is considered dangerous, what is  the reoccurrence rate of pre-eclampsia, etc. ).  The main advice of the  book is to consult your care giver, well, I bought this book because I  wanted to learn more myself and ask my doctor less questions... The book  has very little additional information above a normal pregnancy guide book 
 I adore the books written by David Grossman. This is, to my mind, by far: the worst he's ever done. It was panned in other countries for good reason: It's absolutely juvenile and puerile and all the run on sentences that worked in See:Under Love do not work here, in a story about Nothing, one lonely guy's neuroses. So, I think it's his name, a great writer's name, that is selling this book. Not the content. It's awful 
 If you're considering this book, you're probably like me- concerned about the continuation of societal complexity in the face of fiscal irresponsibility and the end of cheap oil.  You probably want to find that perfect place to buy cheap land, produce your own food, and in the event of calamity, escape the hungry hordes.  You're probably hoping this book will help you find that place. Trust me: it won't.  This book provides a stage for Joel Skousen to drone on and on about his conspiracy theories (Russian communists have gone underground and are preparing to nuke us!) and crackpot and racist ideas.  One could probably have gleaned at least a little information from the maps, but they are of such poor quality as to be almost useless.  Don't waste the money 
 I purchased this book when I got my first pressure cooker, and I was unimpressed.  First, the general discussion of pressure cooking isn't that detailed, but most of all, the title of the book is misleading - I thought that I was getting a book with "general" recipes - but the book is limited to just mediterranean recipes.  The book cover does not reveal that the recipes are limited to such recipes, and I think that it should.  Had I opened the book and paged through it, I would not have purchased this volume 
 I like Evanovich novels for a light read and a few laughs, and usually her hero and heroine are downright combustible - the Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli relationship, sustained through 12 books so far, being a case in point. But Full Scoop was actually a trial to get through. I could hear another voice in there which was distracting and interrupted Evanovich's comedic rhythm. The whole tone of the writing was down about five notches from what I have come to expect from Evanovich. The silly villains were either being too goofy or too violent, leaving us wondering were we supposed to be amused or frightened? The least forgivable of the sins committed in Full Scoop was the fact that there was absolutely no chemistry between Maggie and Zack. None at all. So it's hard to label the book: a sort of but not really romance, an almost but not much of a woman-in-danger.... maybe a new genre altogether - the slapstick thriller 
 I read a lot, and more than a few books by academics. But even though I was keenly interested in the subject of this book, and what Fenster would have to say about it, I found the reading so utterly dry and boring that I couldn't get even a third of the way through the book. I put it down and came back to it several times, trying to bring a freshness to it. But each time I was drugged to catatonia within a few pages. I gave up trying to read it straight through, and tried skimming and jumping around to get some key points. It didn't help. The author appears more intent on scholarly notes and quotes and references, than on making a clear and readable narrative. Unless you are an academic doing research, or a lay reader with an iron stomach for this kind of material, I would find another book 
 "The Lady with the Torch" is the new recording from Patti LuPone and it does a nice job of parading out every maddening vocal mannerism Ms. LuPone has polished over the years (inexplicably to the delight of many of her fans).  Her notorious mush-mouthed diction is particualrly noticeable on this recording.  The first line of "Early Autumn" is virtually indecipherable and the problem persists throughout the rest of the track.  Time and again, consonents are glided over as if they're in the way of the song as Ms. LuPone continues in her career-long quest to completely do away with consonents from her repetoire.  Then there are the vowel sounds, and I believe she covers every possible (and many impossible) vowel sounds currently existing in the universe.  A's sound like E's, O's sound like U's -- this CD should be retitled "What Did She Just Say?"  You don't need a lyric sheet for this recording; you need an interpreter.  "My Buddy" comes out "My Body" and "Body and Soul" comes out "Buddy and Soul."  Maybe she's hidden some sort of sudoku game in the recording so listeners can have a little fun.  For much of the CD, LuPone sounds like she's holding her nose.  Add that to the other two problems identified in this review, and interpretive style simply "fies ou the winno."  I'm sorry, that's "flies out the window."  "I'm Through with Love" is another example of mush-mouthed delivery wrecking a song, but special mention must be made of "Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry."  Her phrasing here is not only odd, it's unprofessional.  Taking a breath after the word "guess" is singing lessons 101 - you don't break up a phrase with your breaths.  And she does it three times!  As Patti says in the liner note, "oy vey!"  The sad thing is, Ms. LuPone possesses one of the greatest vocal instruments on Broadway in the last 30 years.  Just listen to the recent cast recording of "Sweeney Todd."  Her mannerisms are kept to a bare minimum (no doubt with help from skillful director John Doyle) and her voice soars and entices in ways many singers will never be able to approach (her losing the Tony was a sin).  So what gives here?  She sounds more tired than on the "Sweeney..." recording, so maybe it was a case of overwork.  Overwork or not, this recording does not present the lady at her best.  Paging Bernadette Peters 
 while i was watching this movie i thought to myself, "am i going to die?  have i gone to horrible movie hell?"  you see i was trapped in a theater.  it's like being tortured by some horrible nightmare but you can't leave cause B actors are pretending they can act just because they're fat.  the in crowd gives you that feeling like when it's grossly bright outside and it's a sunday afternoon and you're in a car and you've been sitting for 6 hours and you feel sweaty and there'a a football game playing on the am radio and you want to escape.  in conclusion, this movie turns me into melting snow.  but i suppose there are worse movies-- (see my review on gummo) 
 I was using this unit to hold CD cases, which I admit can be heavy.  But if you say your product can hold 280 CDs, it should be able to hold 280 CDs.  As a matter of fact, well before I reached that point the weight of the CDs caused the sides to bow outward, causing the "adjustable" shelves to fall.    Very disappointed with this product 
 The author should be sued for deception.  The biggest blunder I've ever made was buying this book 
 Dave Barry's Bad Habits has comedy fiction writer Dave Barry trying his hand at the non fiction market.  Although he achieved quality work in this genre with later attempts such Homes and Other Black Holes, this book was clearly just cashing in on the success of his fiction with little effort put in whatsoever.  There's lots of references to Commies which either means Barry was extremely paranoid and brainwashed by his government of the time or he is retelling the same joke over and over again throughout the book, a joke that isn't that funny the first time and is really irritating when repeated and repeated and repeated.   Barry also insists on telling us his personal stories in this book, obviously the publishers had a word in his ear with future non fiction books as these stories are hardly evident in those books but unfortunately they are here and aren't that interesting.  Dave Barry can write some really good stuff, both fiction and non fiction.  Dave Barry's Bad Habits unfortunately is not one of those occasions. 
 Robin Gibb has one of the most distinctive voices of the 1960s. With the BEE GEES or as a solo artist he has enough hits to make his own live show. However, in this LIVE recording he chooses to recreate mostly BEE GEES hits on which he had a secondary role on their famous three part harmonies. Thus he needs the help of another lead singer, chorus and The Neue Philharmonie Frankfurt Orchestra. But everything goes wrong here: Robin's voice remains buried among a real bulk of unmixed music; the lead singer (no list of credits) is a poor substitute to Barry Gibb's famous falsetto; the female voices are not very inspired, to say the least; while the orchestra is frequently out of tune and noisy (the winds on Juliet are really unbearable). Post-production seems to be non-existent and the overall sound is chaotic. Lines notes by experts Andrew Mon Hughes and Ann Grootjans are interesting and illustrative, but they seem to belong to another album. The message from Robin Gibb seems to be clear: "I can do it all by myself". Well, he cannot. He should re listen to ONE NIGHT ONLY (1998) and check for sound, harmonies and production 
 Saddam was a horrible tyrant, there is no doubt about that. But I dont think many Americans have the right to say that. We supported Saddam all through the 8o's even after he gassed his own people. Now, we are waging a war to get rid of him and try him for war crimes. How do we do that? We commit a war crime, aggression, and kill 20,000 iraqi civilians to get rid of him. Funny how we are trying him for a crime he committed in the 80's considering afterwards we supported his regime. 
 I am sad to say that I wasted precious summer leisure reading to this book, suggested to me by my wife.  She was not sure what to think of it, and I was to confirm what she couldn't say.  She picked it up because of its "National Book Award Finalist" stamp on the cover and the novelty of the back cover abstract.  The novel begins with so much potential and the writing is especially competent that I couldn't help but feel let down when the whole thing begins to fall apart.  When Egan throws in a wild internet scheme and a mysterious possible terrorist, it is easy to see that she has let the book wander away from its premise.  What could have been an intelligent book about identity gives way to a cheap thriller. 	It makes one wonder about the books chosen for book awards. While this book was only a finalist, I still have to wonder why it would have been in contention.  I certainly don't expect my personal tastes to match those of these committees given the task of choosing the best books, but I do expect to be able to understand the merits of a chosen book, to see what others might see in it.  Did the National Book Award folks decide on ambition alone?  I certainly think Egan began with a topic challenging to author and reader, but doesn't the fact that she fails in her task weigh in the decision?  I suppose I hadn't been let down more by a book in a long time and much of the reason was because of that silver stamp on the cover 
 For those of you that haven't heard of me, I have studied Serrada extensively in Stockton, California.  I read the other reviews, and Master Khlid Khan, should not have complimented Mark Wiley.  He did so to promote the book because he is in it.  Guru Dennis Servaes, also in it and has trained with Grandmaster Vincent Angel Cabales and gave a review which tells it like it is.  I would also advise against the purchase of books by Mark Wiley, or anything to do with Daren Tibon.  Angel would not have authorized either book, and I cannot recommend either of wiley's books!  Too much misinformation.  I understand Daren is no longer recognized as a Master 
 I had very high expectations for this movie, especially given a great Director, Robecca Romijn, and Antonio Banderas.  Way wrong!  The movie has a bit of a european flair due to much of it being filmed in Paris - however - the movie plot is very difficult to follow, and takes too much effort to try and understand whats going on.  Please let me save you the money - select another movie 
 This is one of the few books on DoDAF.  But it looks like it is mostly about their product.  On the recommendation of some other experts (Oh, you didnt by that book, did you?  Dont bother wasting your time.) I returned it.  I recommend reading up on UML-2 and get the DoDAF spec 
 I am sorry, as much as I love historical fiction, and as much as I LOVED Shadowbrook, I could not get into this book.  While I appreciate the amount of research the author did into medical history of this time and treatment of slaves, the gore factor is WAY OVER THE TOP. Page after page after page, compounded with unappealing characters who even if one started to care, disappeared into another generation.    I gave up after 200 pages.  I give the author kudos for the well done research and keeping with known facts, but as stated before, the gore factor is way over what I can stomach for 600 pages.  If you are not sure if this is for you, I suggest you check it our from your local libary.  Then, if you absolutely love it, buy it.  JMHO 
 I'm going to be straight up, the title says it all. Thrice was a great band, Illusion of Safety is one of the most incredable albums ever. Now they sound like every other band out there today. Personally I Hate emo, I grew out of that crap along time ago. I'm sorry if I offend people in saying that. I just dont see any talent in it. Thrice used to be my favorite band. Being a guitarist myself, I enjoyed Identity Crisis' true hardcore sound, and Illusion of Safety's amazing creativity, but the Artist in the Ambulance and this new CD are crap. If your emo, then give it a shot, but if your sick of the new-age emo crap you can't avoid every time you turn on the radio, put this album back. It's time to move on Thrice fans. They came.. they rocked.. there done 
 Well Mobb Deep is another example of trying to make a comeback.  They had their classics with The Infamous and Murda Musik   Now they hope to hit it big with G-Unit on their debut Blood Money, but after a listen I'm wonderin to myself where's the old Prodigy and Havoc?  There are some flashes on here like on the forumlatic lead single "Put Em In Their Place" and "The Infamous" which takes you back to when the pair was at their best on classic albums like The Infamous and Murda Musik.  However you can tell that Mobb Deep is trying to go commercial at times with joints like "Let's Have A Party" and "Give It To Me".  Of course the formulatic problem with signing with G-Unit is on here: TOO MUCH 50 Cent.  It doesnt help when he goes to his routine of dominating the songs with doing his chorus on songs like "Creep", "Pearly Gates" and "It's Alright".  And there's the usual bling-bling track on here ("In Love With The Moulah").    Nothing else on the album really stands out here leaving fans with a not so good look on Mobb Deeps legacy.  And Prodigy really needs to work on his rappin style now.  Blood Money is just another example of rappers that have gone on the downslide going to G-Unit 
 After 350 miles of moderate usage (6.5MPH average at fairly low resistance for 40 minutes daily) a piece of metal snapped on one of the arms, rendering the trainer inoperable. Unfortunately this was considered a "wear item" and was not warrantied by the manufacturer since the elliptical was used *very* lightly (perhaps 20 miles max) during the first year of purchase (warranty period). I put the majority of mileage on the machine over the past four months and, while it was great for burning calories, I never really felt that it was a "quality" piece of equipment.  It appears that the manufacturer knows what parts of the frame are likely to break first and conveniently labels these "wear items" , thus making repair expensive and difficult... this is in spite of the fact that the piece that broke was a non-moving, load-bearing support piece. Seems a little fishy to me.  Throughout the life of the machine I was constantly tightening bolts to fix the popping and banging sounds that occurred after moderate use, and observed that the wheels would often attempt to jump out of the tracks with heavier use. After about 70 miles I noted that the wheels were leaving large greyish streaks in the tracks from where they were wearing down against imperfections in the track surface. I believe this was also partly due to too much "play" in the interaction of the wheels and tracks, allowing the wheels to jump the tracks a little which each revolution.  This machine does not feel very sturdy and, throughout the last month of its very short life, gave me a creepy sense of impending doom whenever I used it... somehow I knew it was about to break and, unfortunately, it did. My hunch was real enough that I began shopping for a replacement several weeks ago.  Please shop around... I would not recommend this machine for people looking for a moderate to high intensity workout, but it may be fine for slower walking or jogging paced routines that place less stress on the machine's mechanical components. If you are an infrequent user this model may be OK, but if you plan on using it every day I would recommend that you keep on looking.  Note that my machine was a 428P which, at the time of purchase, differed from the 418 primarily in the computer and heart rate monitoring. The frame is identical in the 418 and 428P, which appears to be no longer sold. Since the problems with my machine were directly related to body construction, they are appropriate for a review of the 418. Unless the manufacturer has made major improvements the problems I experienced are likely to still occur. Visual inspection of the pictures here leads me to believe that no major changes have been made to the frame construction 
 Deep play (aka "Flow") is a valuable concept, but don't expect to find any intelligent exposition of it here. Instead, prepare for confusion as seemingly disparate phenomena -- rituals, hallucinations brought on by starvation, and Sunday morning reveries in the park -- are evinced as examples of "deep play". Just how and why these should be lumped together with creative flow is never adequately explained.   All in all, this is a rambling, entirely unsystematic and underresearched book, notwithstanding the author's credentials as a naturalist.* Worse still, as Wolfgang Pauli would say, it is "not even wrong". It has nothing to say, for page after page after page.   Well, not nothing exactly. As an indulgent exercise in vanity, it's worth a titter or two. The author, whose photo reveals a woman of a certain age in King Charles-style tresses, loses no opportunity to remind you the reader that she knows how to live. "I hate the fearful trimming of possibilities that age brings. If you lead a relatively narrow life, I suppose you never notice. But I've always been athletic"... etc etc. Mostly she goes on in this vein, larding up her exploits with new age musings that even I --liberal, female and eco-minded-- found eminently gagworthy. Reader be warned, though: a dark episode intrudes on page 100, as Ackerman takes NASA to task for having had the temerity to reject her for the Journalist in Space program. Her explanation: NASA feared she might say something "wise and profound."[!]  Whatever the case, don't hold your breath waiting for her to say it in this book.   *Serious readers of psychology would do better to consult Czikszentmihalyi's outstanding research on "Flow", while those interested in play in the natural world will adore Bernd Heinrich's Mind of the Raven 
 Book has much useful information in it. However, from a "how to" perspective the book has enough faults that I would choose another. The tree felling portion seemed particularly bad: a couple of horror stories on tree felling are followed by some sub-par descriptions on tree felling methods -  the part on "bore" cuts is especially badly described and illustrated - it should have been better handled or left out entirely. Quite frankly, the authors frequent citing of OSHA as an authority on cutting methods made me a bit nervous too. Somehow, I think I would prefer cutting advice from a professional lumberjack than a governmental bureaucracy....but thats a matter of taste I suppose.  
 This movie is almost too easy a target, and I don't want to spend much time on it as the essence of this film has been captured effectively by many, many other reviewers.  At heart, "Date Movie" is just a bit of silliness--it has no ambition, no goals other than to showcase its preposterous spoofs.  Truth be told, I usually don't mind silly escapist fun--as long as a picture knows it's not very good, you can't really hold anything else against it.  My issue with "Date Movie," thus, is more complex.  Movies like "Scary Movie" or "Airplane!" have done a great job skewering other films and pop culture icons--but the primary difference between those films and "Date Movie" is that they frame their spoofs and gags around an actual plot.   My irritation with "Date Movie" comes from its absolute laziness in not even attempting to tell a story.  Heck, it doesn't even fake it.  No, apparently the sheer delight at seeing someone in a fat suit is supposed to carry us through an entire film.  The gags are so random--and don't get me wrong, you might chuckle occasionally--they end up making no sense whatsoever.  Have we gotten so jaded that we don't even expect a rudimentary storyline?  It's sight gag, after sight gag, after sight gag--with a sound gag thrown in for variety.  And it's not even as if these jokes are clever.  By shooting at the easiest pop culture targets and liberally adding unnecessary bodily function humor--it's as if the filmmakers expected us to lap all their "hilarious" antics up.   There are talented people in the cast.  Surely Alyson Hannigan (a star of the small screen) deserves better.  But at least she, and the others, are game and throw themselves into the proceedings--but to little affect.  If I wanted to see sketches and skits with no connection, however, I'd watch SNL or MadTV (which might actually be more entertaining).  "Date Movie" misadvertises itself in the title--there is no movie here!  Normally, like I said, I wouldn't judge an inoffensive bit of nonsense like this so harshly--but this negative review goes out to all the creative screenwriters who couldn't get decent projects greenlit due to this example of filmmaking by committee.

 This study guide is just ok. There are a lot of typographical errors which sometimes make it difficult to follow the solution. Be wary of this book = 
 this is not a good book to find a hawaiian name for your child. i have a better and older one that was only $1.50 and it has been much more helpful. i wouldnt but this one if you are looking to find a name and learn how to pronounce it 
 I feel I have been ripped off. I thought I was getting a new Stuart Woods book and come to find out Dead Paradise is two of Woods' existing books combined in one-both of which I already own.  Now I have to pay the shipping to return a book I obviously don't wnat or need.  
 I had to read this book because of a school project. This was a terrible book. I hated it from the beginning because it had no plot, story line, or good characters. About halfway through the book, one of the main characters, Mando, just left. it didn't say where or why he left, but Scott O'Dell didn't bring him back in the book. I am a little glad because Mando was just a pain. But unfortuanatly, Zia stayed. She was in every scene and was very boring. If anyone wants to read it, then i hope this helps you... THROW IT AWAY!! 
 So you thought that the advent of DVD would give us beautiful, clear copies and eliminate the trash that was floating around on some of the budget VHS labels? Think again. Don't be fooled by that very slick and professional-looking sleeve art. This is perhaps the poorest quality DVD transfer I've ever seen. Any enjoyment that might have been in the movie is ruined by the atrociously low quality of the sound & picture. It is strictly for die-hard collectors which is the only reason I'd keep a copy of it. It has every appearance of a third generation tape transfer from a TV broadcast or a very bad original print. Both the opening titles and the ending are cut short. Nothing is in focus and the sound is out of sync. The sound quality is simply awful. I can't say for sure, but the film seems to start somewhere well into the plot. Instead of its original 89 minute running time, this version comes in at 78 minutes. 11 minutes is a lot to cut from such a short film. The movie itself is only so-so and just isn't able to get beyond some pretty bad acting from Jayne and her equally untalented co-star, Carl Mohner, though maybe some bad cutting should take much of the blame. A valiant effort by the great Anthony Quayle and a first-rate supporting cast of British character actors just can't save it. There's really nothing to recommend this picture. If you need it to round out a collection then I'd advise you to buy a used copy (a good used copy or a bad used copy - makes no difference here ... a very good clue to the value of this DVD is that there are oodles of new and used copies available for less than $5). BEWARE! (a.k.a "The Challenge" 
 The price seemed great and I really liked the modern look. When I took it out of the box got disappointed by how cheap everything looked. Assembly was very easy - it took my boyfriend about 15 minutes (the most). The design is really great - it's very compact, perfect for small spaces and would look awesome if materials were a little bit better. Great idea - poorly executed. Would gladly pay a lil more for this futon if it was a better quality product. My main concern is that the construction seems like it wouldn't last too long. I feel like I should attach "sit carefully" tag to it before anybody comes over 
 I don't know what is up w/ Marilyn Lee when it comes to her black heroines. They are so weak minded and pitiful. Sharde has been pining for her boss from afar for years. She decides to take advantage of their retreat at Jeff's cabin and seduce him. Although he tells her he's not looking for a serious relationship, she lies by saying she can respect his feelings. However she plays along in a deceitful manner resulting in immature head games and shameful manipulation. Her deception was so bad that she drove Jefferson away because her dishonesty from day one about her true intentions with him. She was truly unlikable.   Another thing, what's up w/ these black women characters who fail to use protection and coerce these white male lovers not use a condom? With the terrifying stats on black women contracting HIV I find this appalling. I understand this is fiction but I think it really does send the wrong message. Lee has done this before with previous black female characters who seem to have an aversion to safer sex. The best love story she wrote was The Talisman where the lovers used protection and the story still came off erotic.  My friend forwarded me her followup to this book and unfortunately Darbie her faithful assistant has followed in the same footsteps of not wanting to use a condom, and this is from a woman who is having a one-night stand with a strange man who happened to share her hotel room by accident. I won't give anymore away but the man in question is already in this book.   I also feel Lee needs to move beyond the taboo factor of white men and black women being romantically involved and just tell a story where race is not being analyzed to death on the black woman character's  part. It will improve Lee as a writer to deal with men and women relationships w/o the black woman having all these kind of racial hang-ups . Lee also makes these black women violent, oftentimes they are hitting their white male lovers. She is a black woman herself so I don't understand why she falls victim to the historic racist sexual stereotypes black women have been given by white society. 
 What a joke. Liberals are wonderful people, really. Ha, NOT! They can't argue good politics so they attack someone who can. Nice..what looser 
 Correct me if I am wrong, but a mystery is suppose to be a "mystery". It is suppose to be hard to figure out for the reader, not impossible, but hard. This was not hard to figure out. Even the good reviews admit, there was not much mystery in this book. If you like MYSTERY, do not touch this book!!  He is a good writer, and most of the characters were developed well. (Except for Wu, who was a shallow stereotype.) Halfway thru the book, i am thinking "Are these characters stupid?" A blind man could see the connections. It was an insult.  Wu is suppose to have an IQ of 150, so she is trusted with her FIRST murder trial with no help? That would NEVER happen!!! NEVER EVER! And she makes stupid comments to Hardy, asking him why would the judge not let their client go free? it is the right thing to do. Hardy, then lectures her on how the system works. LOL. It was laughable.      Andrew's story? "i made it all up!" Give me a break!! And the cowel that he wore, just happened to be the same. LOL. And the eye witnessess could not tell the difference between a black guy and a white guy!?!   Did anybody notice. That all the victims just happened to be the one who answered the door, even when others were at home.   The ending had ONE small surprise. But most of Part 3, was a waste of time. Brandt just happened to guess who the executioner was??? What a stretch!   His ability to write good prose and give details, and create a degree of confusion by overloading the story with too many characters is what helps him. But you have to suspend any rational thinking to think this was a good mystery. 
 The book basically covers three subjects.  First, a political and historical background of Iraq and Saddam - Excellent.  Besides the history primer, Mr. Keegan also has some thought provoking, if negative,  remarks about Islam (or at least some of its variants) which I may research later.      Second, the events leading to the second gulf war - Poor at best.  I agree that Saddam had to go, preferably sooner than later.  Failing any political progress, war was a likely outcome.  Having terrorized his citizens, started two major wars and having a record of NBC/WMD weapons research he wasn't someone anyone felt comfortable having around.  The UN embargo wasn't working and medical/food shortages were killing up to 50.000 civilians a year, according to some pre-war estimates.  Mr. Keegan jumps firmly, but clumsily, into the pro-war bandwagon.  The issue of missing WMD is never really addressed very well.  Did the Western intelligence agencies really drop the ball?  Or did the US and the UK lie to their citizens in order to drum up support for an unpopular military intervention?  If it wasn't a lie, could the intelligence agencies have done any better?  If not, what lessons to learn from that?  His characterization of opponents to the war is lame.  Mr. Chirac?  "A braggart".  Europeans? "idealistic Olympians who do not recognize the need for force".  And so on...  Now, I dislike Chirac myself. But a skilled author owes his readers some balance and, especially, more justifications.  The French do have a long and shameful history in Iraq.  Selling weapons.  Having their defence minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, refer to Saddam as "a new Napoleon" (which is praise, in France at least) after 1988.  Looking happily to the end of sanctions to sell more stuff in an area without US competition.  Given all that, France deserves criticism, but Mr. Keegan doesn't bother to argue his case by mentioning any of it.  The BBC also gets nailed for its "biased coverage", again without any arguments to support that position.  Personally, I rather liked their coverage and thought its bias less visible than Keegan's.  And, no, I don't think that hoping for a future without wars is silly.  It might not work out, and sometimes (Rwanda, Kosovo, Bosnia) it is better to go to war after all.  It is necessary to resist dictatorships such as Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, North Korea.  But you can't fault pacifism as being only for silly idealists.  It has, for now, all but stopped wars among Western nations and it has instilled a healthy distrust of "colonial interventions" by most of those nations' citizens.   Third - the war itself - Not all that great.  There is some high level analysis of what units were moving where, and what they did.  Some coverage of local action, plenty of other interesting stuff.  Keegan is in in element here.    What there isn't is any interviews of Iraqis.  Or any detailed info on Iraqi activity during the war. No Iraqi is mentioned by name outside the usual suspects covered by CNN.  Everything is from the Allies' viewpoint.  I don't blame Mr. Keegan for staying out of Iraq right now.  But it makes you wish that the book was written ten years from now, with Keegan having been able to do his usual world class research.  Nor is there any analysis of how the US should face the Iraq insurgency, despite the 2005 addition to the book.  With current events being what they are, we need people like Mr. Keegan to reinvent themselves as analysts of low-level, guerilla warfare, terrorism, etc...    But this book is more informative about the perils of writing history books too soon, before the facts emerge fully 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" puts this novel to shame. It has an interesting premise, but it's so unbelievable (even for fiction!) that I could hardly get through to the end. Gregory is a capable writer, so the descriptions are good, but despite some promising fictional characters (like Hannah), I found the novel dead boring 
 There is nothing memorable in this score to the musicalized version of the Garbo film NINOTCHKA. Astonishing that Cole Porter wrote it.  The show and the resultant film were hits but terribly mediocre.   Why this score is on  CD is a puzzlement when more worthy ones are not 
 I have tried to pick up this book twice and tried reading it sincerely but I couldn't go past chapter 2. I couldn't understand Tilo's worlds (more of a fantasy) and I felt very bored very quickly, which is usually a big sign for me to get rid of the book in my hand and find a better replacement. Now I have even viewed the trailer of the film made on this movie, acted by Aishwarya Rai...I couldn't bear to watch it! I'm sorry Ms. Chitra, this one didn't digest too well. Better luck next time, hun 
 OK, I had heard "Annapolis" was a pale imitation of "An Officer and a Gentleman"--but I still went into it with an open mind.  Just because a film shares similar plot points or qualities with another film doesn't mean it isn't worthy of a look.  There are only so many plots to go around--take romantic comedies, for example.  If you got rid of those that copied other movies, we'd be left with about six total in the history of cinema.  If something is done well, it can defy its limitations and seem fresh.  Heck, it isn't even as if "An Officer and a Gentleman" was a novel or new story--it played by fairly conventional storytelling rules, it just did so exceedingly well.  So, trying as hard as possible to offer a different perspective--I, too, feel that "Annapolis" borrows heavily from "Officer."  It's all here.  Boy from wrong side of the tracks makes good in the service--check.  Cadet who can't complete obstacle course helped by hero--check.  Cadet who doesn't succeed attempts suicide--check.  Hero's tension with superior leads up to big fight--check.  Mutual respect, triumph over adversity--check, check, CHECK already.  By jettisoning the romance at the heart of "Officer," "Annapolis" is left with only the cliche'--becoming a good person through military service.   But even that pales in comparison.  James Franco is a good actor, but he is becoming increasingly expressionless.  It's as if he thinks a dour expression equals seriousness.  Richard Gere (in "Officer"), meanwhile, ran a real emotional gamut--rage, passion, heartbreak.  He made a very typical story moving and powerful.  But, of course, he had Louis Gossett, in an Oscar winning performance, to play off of.  Let's just say that Tyrese Gibson isn't in that league.  As the female lead, we've got Jordana Brewster.  She is appealing and likable, if not particularly believable in this role.  One of my main issues with "Annapolis" is its sloppy character development.  Franco is regarded as the worst cadet in the unit, and as such is really ridden by his superiors.  He is a loner, doesn't ask for help--so you know a valuable life lesson will need to be learned.  Gere, in "Officer," was just such a recruit.  But the moment he is broken, the moment of his realization--it is a brilliant and emotionally devastating scene played to perfection.  In "Annapolis," though, blink and you'll miss it--there's no catharsis here.  One night he just decides to be a great recruit.  He then studies all night to improve his scores, trains for boxing all day and night for a big tournament, and helps his roommate on the obstacle course all day.  I don't know when he sleeps or does any real "soldiering."     "Annapolis" is, essentially at heart, a chaste and glossy remake.  But lacking the dynamic performances and the realness, it just falls short as entertainment.  No deeper than a typical music video, it's all surface--pretty to look at, but ultimately forgettable.  KGHarris, 12/06 
 you'd be much better off to buy other volumes in the series.  This two-volume anthology is generally a two-thousand page waste of time.  Most poetry is consigned to oblivion for a reason!  What is here rescued is frankly not worth it, and the "literature" here is of historical  rather than intrinsic interest.  A monument to "inclusivity" and  "diversity," but full of poor writing, the Common Reader is here  advised to invest in Library of America's wonderful volumes of the poetry  of Frost, Stevens, Whitman, and, whenever they finally appear in the  future, Dickinson, Melville, Eliot, and Bishop 
 I was quite disappointed with this book. I hoped for more to look at and less to read in a garden design book. It is more of a text book than a book for inspiration. If you are ready to sit down and read the basics on garden design, then this is for you. If you are hoping for inspiration from looking at photos of beautiful gardens, then look elsewhere. There are only 8 photos - before and after photos of the author's own garden 
 The universe described in Moreland's "Creation Hypothesis" is... well, I'm not sure it's the same one we live in.  The Big Bang, as we define it, was an explosion.  For a few minutes, all matter in the universe  was so hot, it existed as plasma.  Then, millions of years later, stars  began to from.  As some stars grew older, they produced elements (other  than hydrogen and helium) through nuclear fusion.  These stars then  expelled these elements, possibly destroying themselves in the process.   The debris cooled to form our planet, which has a core of iron-nickel.   Now, exactly where is the "evidence" of a "designer" in  that process? If I detonate a nuclear device, knowing that it will produce  a mushroom-shaped cloud as the heat rises into the atmosphere, does that  mean that I "created" the mushroom cloud?  The evidence suggests  that some remarkable things happened.  But does it suggest that this  universe was designed for our form of life?  No, it doesn't. The current  concept of a "personal, transcendant" God who wants to be our  best friend, doesn't describe anything in the evidence.  It seems that God,  if God exists, is hiding and doesn't want us to see or communicate with  him.  If God wanted to talk to us, there wouldn't be any doubt about where  the message came from, and I doubt that it would be to give a plot of land  to the Israelites.  There are simply better explanations that cover all the  evidence.  This book presents "pseudo-intellectual theories,"  theories that may match a few pieces of data, but not the Big Picture of  what our universe really is 
 I noticed there were not many new items in this game, I found this the advertising for this game to be deceiving.  This expansion ws not worth the money 
 The early descriptions of Sarah's life in South Africa were fascinating, a window into another world and time. But once the story line moved to Europe, there was little to hang onto: what it was like for Sarah to live in a "zoo", to be treated as a scientific specimen, to be deceived and abandoned by her husband-in-name, to be lost in a card game, to be sold from one man to the next. I skimmed the last 200 pages and even then, could barely stand to finish it.   
 I find an interesting Joseph Smith Jr. quote in The Pearl of Great Price. In the 1851 edition he claims that it was the "angel" Nephi who originally brought him the "divine" revelation of the Book of Mormon in 1823 but originally tells us in the Book of Mormon that it was the "angel" Moroni who delivered this "divine" revelation in 1823! What's it going to be? Moroni or Nephi! God tells us in the Bible three facts about "truth". 1. It never changes. 2. It stands on its own merit. 3. It reproves itself over and over. On the other hand, lies are constantly changing as they are revealed to be lies. To have received a "divine" revelation from God himself in 1823 and then to have been convicted in a court of law in 1826 (New York vs. Joseph Smith) in Chenango County, New York state for "glass looking", fortune telling or prophesying from gazeing into crystal rocks when God forbids this practice and finds it an "abomination" in the book of Deuteronomy would seem quite a "paradox" for someone supposedly "divine" and so close to God! This book reveals itself for exactly what it is. The continueing Mormon lie and deception 
 That is what this book deserves, a big fat zero. This stuff was treated in much greater depth by business thought leaders several years ago. Notions of inter-enterprise process engineering, powered by the Internet, were rigorously documented several years ago. This professor turned management prophet must have spent his millions derived from his previous book of "stories" --circa 1993-- and needed a new source of funds as the world went far past him and his business process rengineering (BPR) stories, long ago. This guy writes stories, not first principles upon which companies can act. Ever tried to "implement" a story? Save your money --buy Tapscott, Fingar, Weil or Hagel books on the subject 
 While the product I received was identified as red imagine my surprise to find a white petite casserole. Like the many others who have had this problem I assumed it was just a "freak" accident. No accident. I am still looking for someone who actually got a red one. Very disappointed. Bummer!!!!!! 
 This book has a touchy-feely self-absorbed New Age feel to it. I see that most reviews for this book are positive but this one is not. If you lean even a little toward the evangelical and/or fundamental, please consider the following:  Walsch claims God could be a woman (or without gender). He refers to God as "She" and "Her" in spots.   There are too many references to all of us being One. We are not "one"; we are individuals, created by God to be individuals with different gifts to use in His service. It is He who equips us, not we who fit God into a "friendship" relationship -- this is simply not scriptural. In John 15:14, Jesus says, "You are My friends if you do whatever I command you." This denotes a higher-to-lower hierarchy, one which is repeated throughout the Bible. Jesus (God) clearly states He is in charge and in a superior position. But Walsch's writing does not convey this. It conveys an equality, implicitly, that he and God are on equal footing. This is offensive.   In his hubris, Walsch writes, "It has been two thousand years since the birth of Christ, twenty-five hundred since the time of the Buddha, and more since we first heard the words of Confucius, or the widsom of the Tao, and we still haven't gotten the Main Questions figured out." [We haven't?] "Will there ever be a way to turn the answers we have already received into something workable, something that can function in our day-today lives?" [Many of us have done so by following the Bible.] "I think there is. And I feel pretty certain about it, because I've discussed it a lot in my conversations with God."  [I see.]  Walsch calls himself a Christian but places other religious figures on equal footing with Christ. Jesus never left open the option of truth claims to ANY but His own. Christ never offered a one-from-column-A, one-from-column-B faith. In the guise of thinking outside the box, Walsh reveals his own religious pluralism.   In Scripture, God tells us to fear Him (not a craven fear, a Godly fear). God tells us to worship Him, obey Him and come before Him in humility and in supplication. I see none of this reflected in the pages of Walsch's book. God is my Creator, my Saviour, the Love of my life Who loves me. But He is not my friend; He is God, far above friendship. On this earth a father can be a friend. In God's realm, God is God and not on equal footing with anyone. From Walsch's writing, I got a creepy feeling he was lecturing and explaining to God things God may not have known.   The last straw was the following paragraph where Walsch is justifying the large profits he makes on his books (not that profit is a bad thing): "Is Ted Turner less valuable than Mother Teresa? Is George Soros less of a good person than Che Rivera? Are the politics of Jesse Jackson, who appears to have plenty of the good things in life, less worthy than the politics of Vaclav Havel, who may have less? Should the Pope, whose very garments cost more than it would take to feed a poor child for a year, have his words called blasphemy because he lives like a king as the head of a church which owns billions? Ted Turner and George Soros have given away millions of dollars. They've empowered the dreams of humanity with the rewards of their own dreams, lived."  Turner, Soros and Jesse Jackson are not role models for most people I know. Walsch seems to set them up as such.  Walsch writes the following self-absorbed, misguided statement: "It's as if we somehow know that if we can learn more about one another, we can learn more about ourselves. And the yearning to know more about ourselves -- about Who We Really Are  -- is the depest yearning of all." No, Mr. Walsch; the deepest yearning of all is not to know more about ourselves: It should be to know more about GOD. It is He Who will teach us what we need to know about ourselves, if anything. Americans are already too self-absorbed. We don't need more of it.  Perhaps it is just me but I found this New Age claptrap just a bit over the top, not biblical and certainly not the kind of Christianity I'd like to see spread around. 
 Eric Hobsbawm, dedicated to applying the none too convincing idea of "scientific" Marxism in its traditional petrie dish of history, wields the critic's pen more like a butcher's cleaver than the rapier with which he believes, a la Don Quixote, he is thrusting. So it falls upon this reviewer to stand in faithfully as Hobsbawm's Sancho Panza. As such I appeal to you, Eric, not to begin a work of historical analysis with an invocation to an intergalactic historian, for it is the most preposterous thing I have ever encountered. Perhaps you were intrigued with the Greeks' romantic, albeit "unscientific," appeal to the muse for inspiration? How else can we, your faithful followers in the pursuit of truth, justice and the human way in the study of history, explain this unhistorical incantation? Have courage, though! We know that your unwavering adherence to the "scientific" precepts of Marxism will excuse everything. In short, Eric, we know that you have been writing too much while watching Star Trek 
 Ed Greenwood has lost whatever he might have had. The man is responsible for killing my interest in Forgotten Realms RPGs. He has turned magic into somethat that can be bought for a few pennies out of a vending machine. Everyone in the realms seems to have some uber powerful magical item to make free use of. The history of the place has been way over developed and the creatures that are running amok across the countryside, its amazing that there is anyone left alive, but then if someone does die no big deal, just raise them so death does not matter either. Also there are way to many gods, as pointed out in some other book its amazing there is not a god for dinnerware. Also I fully agree with previous article about the man being obsessed with naked women oddly attracted to fat bushy old men, I noticed that in Spellfire and he repeats it in every one he has written, is there one of the Seven Sisters that Elminster hasn't scored with? 
 This book has no ideas that I didn't already find on free sites on the internet.  What a disappointment.  Ultimate Birthday Party, My Aunt Fanny!!!Save your money 
 I started my own business and purchased this item because of my past experiences with HP laser jets.  One year later, I'm about to throw it out the window and buy a new printer.  Why?  First of all, even when printing in black and white, the device uses color ink.  Approximately 97% of my printing is black and white, yet the color ink cartridge levels are consistently depleted.  As a result, I have to purchase (what a surprise) HP color inks even though I don't ever use them.  I estimate that's cost me about $150-200 over the last year.  The second reason I despise this machine relates to its annoying warning message pop-up boxes.  When ink is running low in any cartridge, a pop-up appears.  They cannot be disabled.  They appear until the ink cartridge is completely empty.  Since the machine depletes color inks at such minute levels, these messages can appear for days (or until you replace it with another expensive HP ink cartridge).  Lastly, the machine will not operate if any of the ink cartridges are empty.  I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to print a simple black and white document but could not because the machine was out of pink or yellow ink.  Clearly HP has decided that the best way to make money is through ink sales.  If they'd focused more on the customer's ultimate experience, they'd have secured me as a repeat, long-term customer 
 this is basically a personal journal. The artist's ruminations about art and life - very dry reading. Rothko often contradicts himself. There are several books available (such as those published by Taschen) which are much more readable and are filled with beautiful illustrations of the artist's work 
 Sit down under a tree, give it a big hug, fire up you bong and go to sleep. That's what I was waiting for Freeman to do all movie. It's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this Sci-fi Hippie flick. I'm surprised that Freeman's suit wasn't tie-dyed. Keep your money say no to drugs! 
 Adds volume but overall I would say the sound quality is very similar or not as good without this device. I use it with my Olympus WS-300m. Maybe it would work better with a Sony. It is also more prone to have interferance and it will make a loud noise when it picks up on something. I don't use it just in case it makes that noise I don't want it to ruin my recording. 
 This is not necessarily an indictment of Aimee Mann or holiday music....though I do find such disks as being cheesey. I was a bit surprised when I heard Mann was coming out w/a holiday album.  It seemed a bit above someone who has based a career on not only  original material, but non-mainstream music.    It has also always surprised me that at the plethora of holiday disks that are out there and how many more come out each year.  Is it just me - or are there only 18 holiday songs in existance to begin with?  There is only so many different ways to cover "I'll Be Home for Christmas", "Winter Wonderland" - all of which I believe are covered by James Taylor, Sarah McLachlan and Better Midler, all of which were released this month.  I'm guessing they are cheap to produce and easy to pull in profits.  That being said - I still like Mann's voice and she comes through with 3-4 songs that are above the fray.  "Whatever Happened to Christmas", "Christmastime" and her original "Calling on Mary".  I also liked the fact that she covered "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch".  That seems to suit her more.  Not my cup of tea - but the songs I mentioned are the reason the disk gets 2 stars 
 I was thoroughly disappointed with this book.  Not only did it lack in technical medical information, but I found it to be harsh and unsupportive.  The author's attempt at humor was, to me, offensive and harsh.   If you are looking for the medical technical side of infertility, pick up Dr. Sherman Silbers book.  If you are looking for lighthearted emotional support with excellent tips and coping tools, pick up IVF The Wayward Stork. Save your money on this one. 
 It is a bad book.  Yes, it is that simple.  If I were to write in the stile of the book, I would say something along this line:  "I tested the theory on super mainframe personal computer to realize that it is wrong for our times."  No, I did not make a mistake.  Author actually alleges to test his theory on super computers at some places and super mainframe computers at others.  As far as I know, when mainframe computers were the main part of computer departments super computers were not.  Super computers cost millions of dollars and were not available to business people for trading testing.  Our days, of cause, most PC (personal computers) are much more powerful than old mainframe computers.  Servers in IT departments use PC based technology working on the networks.  So, why does the author used this archaic terminology instead of telling you to test it on your home computers?  Did he what to empress you or instill the need in his "super mainframe computer" service?  OK, so author is not exactly on the cutting edge of technology.  But maybe he knows trading as it applies to chaos theory?  No, he does not.  The book uses moving averages crossovers and a variation of MACD (as difference between two moving averages) as the base of the trading method.  Of cause moving averages are transformed into the alligator and MACD into some new indicator.  How innovative is it?  He also uses a variation of high point definition with a chaos name of a fractal.  Well done!  Now most of us will think it is a trading chaos book.  If you are not familiar with MACD and moving averages there are better books on the subject.  Do not buy this one. 
 It's bad for learning, bad as reference, and not even close to addressing real C++ issues. "Author": If you put Templates as the last chaper to just mumble through it, stick to Visual Basic. Don't waste the reader's time. 
 If "Havoc" was Anne Hathaway's "all grown-up" vehicle, she needs to check the engine.  Hathaway heads up a cast of almost starlets such as Bijou Phillips and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in this drivel.  Hathaway and her friends, the "PLC" as they call themselves, are products of upper-class Palisades in California.  Bored with their seemingly bland lives, they adopt the "gangsta" mentality of the rappers they listen to and idolize.  In truth, they're nothing but a bunch of unlikeable, snot-nosed posers.  We've all encountered this type before.  You see them at the mall wearing the most expensive "Rocca" wear and and "FUBU" even though they have no clue as to who or what they are actually idolizing.  They think that they have no identity of their own, so they latch on to the nearest cultural group that they can find in hopes to be something that they are not and never will be.  In this tale, Hathaway's group has a run-in with a Latino gang.  Drawn to these outlaws, Hathaway and a few of her female friends join the gang for an all-night party.  Hathaway then returns with one of her friends (Bijou Phillips), and the two take the downward  spiral into supposed gang life.  In the end, however, something happens to them when they decide to actually join the gang.  Their actions cause a number of things to occur.  The results of those actions are status quo for their social status.  Although the film is pulled down by a lot of over-acting (Gordon-Levitt seems to have channeled Jamie Kennedy's "Malibu's Most Wanted" character, B-Rad), the real deal killer is the actions of the supposed street-tough Latino gang headed up by Freddy Rodriguez.  First of all, I'd think that a real gang would have taken out the "PLC" without flinching.  Secondly, had four "innocent" little girls actually made it into the gang's party, I'd think that they would have ended up either raped and dead or strung out on some sort of illegal substance.  Instead, Rodriguez backs off on the posers of the "PLC" and seemingly falls for Hathaway's character enough to let her and her friends live out their fantasies of being in a real gang.  Full of characters that warrant no sympathy and an overly nice street gang who allows little girls to live out a lie, "Havoc" is a dud.  Unbelievable, uneventful and definitely a rental 
 I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks, guys talking BS, fights, shootouts, blah, blah, blah. I guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch. This script was mediocre at best. Give me a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film any day over this tripe.  
 Last week, I happened to come across this book in the library. As I had recently bought "Writing a Book that Makes a Difference" and "Writing Creative Nonfiction: Instruction and Insights from Teachers of the Associated Writing Programs" by the same author, I thought it would be good to read this book to get a feel of what's in store when I finally get down to reading my own books.  Gosh! I hope the other two books are better than this one. I tried hard to read this book, but I had to give up finally. Call me a philistine, but I just could not "get into it" (I'm at a loss with words to describe how this book simply could not grip my attention).     
 I wanted to like this book as it is so highly praised by people I admire.  It was a selection for our church book club and I'm glad I had exposure to Father Nouwen's interpretation of the message of the Prodigal Son, one of my favorite New Testament passages.  Unfortunately it did not arouse much spirituality in  me.  I felt that Father Nouwen overworked the connectedness between his own experiences and the biblical message.  It was a long slog  to finish the book which engendered guilt in me for not being more moved by Father Nouwen's words.  He was a dedicated and thoughtful Christian who lead an exemplary life of charity and service but his message here was diminished by repetition.  Prudent editing would have resulted in a more readable and inspirational book.   
 Back in 1996 I was at a CE seminar presented by Barkley, a smooth talker with lots of fancy graphics and research references, not to mention ties with pharmaceutical drug marketers.  However, most of what he presents is distorted, superficial, and contains numerous false statements about the implications of research and about the causes and treatments of ADHD symptoms.  Barkley is still "bark"ing up the same tree he was several years ago, making money by telling people what they wish to hear to absolve themselves of any responsibility in having fostered ADHD behaviors, or having to do anything more than use some fancy reward system sold by Barkley's associates or dispense some pill marketed by Barkley's benefactors. Barkley's approach has become widely adopted, thereby perpetuating the patterns of behavior labeled ADHD.  Barkley's behavioral approach discourages thinking and creativity in children, instead making them focus on rewards and discipline, making their lives more stressful.  The reward systems he recommends are also flawed from a behavioral psychology perspective, as psychologist David Stein has observed, and actually promote continued ADHD behaviors in a significant portion of children.  This system is so flawed it's no wonder that the studies show drugs suppress ADHD behaviors better than Barkley's behavior management approaches.  Unfortunately, the drugs can either aggravate ADHD symptoms over the long term or promote depression, bipolar, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depending upon the individual's internal reaction to the ingestion of disruptive chemicals.  Barkley ignores better behavioral and parenting approaches as well as research confirming the benefits of approaches like neurofeedback, massage, acupuncture, nutritional supplements, sensory integration therapies, progressive educational settings, and treating for adverse reactions to exposure to environmental hazards, such as heavy metals, allergens, processed food ingredients, and synthetic chemicals.  ADHD is a label for a pattern of behavior that is typical of a tendency to not filter stimuli as social settings often require, with a great many factors influencing the development of this pattern, and a great many factors having the potential to help the individual shift toward a more socially acceptable pattern of filtering stimuli, without suppressing one's ability to be creative, intuitive, or spontaneous.  Barkley's approach does nothing about underyling factors contributing to the dominant pattern of diminished filtering, and directs the person to be highly reliant on external controls and manipulations, since Barkley assumes there is some inherent biological abnormality in people labeled ADHD, ignoring the interaction between the individual's personality, genetic potentials, social environment, biochemical environment, and educational environment.  If you took a brain scan of someone with an ADHD label you could match it with patterns found in scans of anyone, depending upon what mood, activity, or state of focus they are in at the moment of the scan.  Only 24 hour monitoring of brain activity would have any relevance to assessing ADHD patterns, and even then it would only show a pattern of brain activity initiated by psychological and chemical factors, which are variable, just like behaviors are.  Barkley has no clue what the brain really is - a transceiver/transducer for information processing between the mind/spirit and the body embedded in the physical reality matrix.  Conscious and subconscious psychological factors greatly influence the pattern of activity exhibited in the brain, as do nutrition and drug ingestion.  Barkley promotes external locus of control, assuming something is inherently/genetically "wrong" in persons exhibiting ADHD patterns of behavior and attentional filtering.  More enlightened approaches help the individual develop self-mastery in balancing their body, mind, and emotions to facilitate any desired state of consciousness, recognizing that taking in great amounts of stumuli data or seeking out the most exciting or novel stimulus to focus attention on is not a defect, but a way of interacting with the environment that may need to be used less frequently in order to function in some settings.  If you want your child to be a drug dependent, order-following worker, then follow Barkley's approach.  If you want your child to be intelligent, creative, thoughtful, and self-empowered, then I suggest you look at some holistic approaches 
 I don't normally write reviews on Amazon without having read the book.  However, in this case I'm going to make an exception because of the factual misinformation and distortion, not only from the book but the reviews themselves.  First, a word on my qualifcations.  In addition to possessing both a CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) designation as well as a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) degree, I have managed portfolios for 2 decades, including in excess of a billion dollars for individuals and institutions.  As for the comments offered by some reviewers:  (1)	Social Security is a Ponzi scheme.  There are no vested benefits as with private retirement accounts (defined benefit or defined contribution).  All future benefits depend on the promise of politicians - some in office today, some in office 50 years from now.  You may find this reassuring - I don't.  (2)	Privatization does not mean investing 100% of your FICA contributions into stocks.  It means having the CHOICE of investing in stocks, bonds, CD's, treasuries, etc.    (3)	Nobody says that earning 7-8% in excess of inflation is necessary for privatization to work.  If stocks can return 6-8% nominally over the next 10-30 years, and if bonds return 4-6%, then privatization makes sense for most people.    (4)	The real return on Social Security contributions for anybody reading this review who is under 50 years of age is close to 1% a year.  For anybody under 30 years of age, the real return is probably negative.  (5)	Some people should NOT leave the Social Security system even if it was allowed; I know this is true because I understand the basics of financial planning.  Individuals who are risk-averse, who do not have other defined benefit pensions, and who have minimal other assets might prefer the security of a traditional Social Security pension to investing in private accounts, even with a lower assumed rate of return.  That said, the benefits should still be accrued and have more of a vested property right than the current system.  (6)	Proposals to rescind tax cuts or to increase the wage base upon which the FICA tax is levied are nothing more than socialist band-aids designed to prop up a failing system.  It's like saying that there was nothing wrong with Enron that a $20 billion bailout from the government couldn't fix.  Increasing FICA taxes or the wage base would be a massive tax hike on small businesses and middle-class Americans.  Bill Gates and Warren Buffet aren't affected by FICA - working class and middle class American are.  (7)	Many American families pay $10,000 - $20,000 a year in FICA taxes to Social Security.  For them, this is a lousy deal.  Nowhere in these books do the authors even attempt to show how Social Security is a good deal - because they can not.  The only people for whom Social Security is a good financial deal are lower-income Americans, those with dependents, and those who tap the disability fund because of health reasons.  If the government wants to continue this safety net for them, fine.  But why should the rest of us have to suffer?  (8)	I have run the calculations for some current Social Security retirees who started receiving benefits in the last 5-10 years.  For almost all of them, they would have done better in a classic pension-style 50-50 asset split between stocks and bonds with their FICA contributions than sending it to Washington politicians.  In some cases, the monthly benefits would be 3X higher than they receive right now from Social Security.   Prior to 1983, all municipal and state employees had the option of opting out of Social Security and having their employer set up private-accounts (a few did).  The reason that was not extended to private employers is because the private sector (employers and the financial industry) did not at that time have the mechanisms in place to offer the choices available today:  401(k)'s, ESOPs, Roth IRA's, thrift saving plans, etc.  The 1983 Greenspan Commission eliminated the municipal/state opt-out; it should be rescinded and extended to the private sector, as well.  Social Security reform needs to have only four basic planks:  ·	Allow any individual to opt-out of the current system, with accumulated benefits frozen.  ·	Individuals who prefer the current system of a defined benefit plan with a guaranteed payment at retirement can stay in the current system.   ·	Individuals can elect to save the entire 12.4% of FICA taxes in domestic and global asset allocation stock and bond mutual funds, treasury bonds, or bank CD's.  They would also be allowed to save half their FICA taxes in personal Social Security Retirement Accounts (SSRA's) while sending the other half to continue funding a reduced Social Security benefit. ·	Any shortfall in revenues will be met out of general revenues, which can easily finance the shortfall from individuals opting out of Social Security by instilling spending limitations on future spending.  As I have stated, not everybody should have private accounts, even if they were made "dummy proof" so as to practically insure long-term positive real returns.  The current system takes so much in FICA taxes from individuals that they cannot meet basic living expenses and save money in an IRA because they don't have enough money left after all their taxes.   This is grossly unfair.   All for benefits that are not defined, have no vested property rights, and which could theoretically be eliminated in the future for any individuals based on their future income levels or the whims of Congress.  This is the real outrage - not the Bush plan, which despite it's many flaws, is at least a step in the right direction. 
 This book is doctrinally-slanted in favor of Arminianism.    One example: The author's entry for Acts 13:48 goes out of it's way to specifically warn you against the "Calvinist" interpretation of this verse.  The book suggests that Acts 13:48 should be properly translated: "As many as *set themselves* unto eternal life were saved".  There is nothing in the Greek that would call for such an interpretation, and none of the mainstream bible translations have such a wording.  The author implies that all mainstream bible translations (NASB,KJV,NIV,NKJV,ESV,etc.) of this verse are wrong, and that he is right.    Another example of the author's eisegesis is in his translation of Ephesians 1:4 for the words "Chosen in Him".  For this verse he quotes Cremer as saying "This verse cannot be taken to imply a division of mankind into two classes according to a divine plan before history began".     I would highly suggest looking into alternative resources which do not exhibit a traditional bias, and where the author is committed to truth in translating.  This author is not trustworthy 
 We bought this chair/ottoman about six months ago.  It looks quite nice but we find it pretty uncomfortable and the quality is fairly poor.  The fabric doesn't hold up well - the cushion looks pretty saggy and the fabric is stretched already.  It filled a gap in our living room furniture set-up after we moved into our first house but we're looking at paying some additional money for a hardier piece of furniture and moving this up to our bedroom.  It's okay for the price - but nothing to write home about.  We've gotten better quality furniture from Target 
 The album is only 37 minutes, which is the first disappointing thing about it, but not the only. Unfortunately, a lot of the humor seems timely, as in: it wasn't funny to me because this isn't the sixties. I think a lot of the references and humor are based around  issues of that time or characters of that time. Our concepts of folk  singers, of artists, of actors have all changed--perhaps not terribly much,  but the cultural landmarks have shifted since this album. The 2000-year-old  man is pretty good, but not even that was as hilarious as I had been led to  believe. I'm going to give the album to my dad, as he knows the times (and  the material) first-hand and I'm sure would appreciate  it much more than  I

 The remix is totally devoid of any taste:First the vocals are completely-off;the mix levels of vocals is far lower than the new musical dressings. Secondly,there is absolutely no respect on part of the "mixing DJs" for the great vocalists:there  is no melody and absolutely no 'jelling-together' of the music with the vocals. I was deeply disappointed with this cd.If you are into remixes get The Rod Stewart "Do ya think i am sexy" single cd instead 
  In the bokk Space Station Seventh grade by Jerry Spinelli a kid named jason wants to build a space station.Ididnt really like this book because the author made the main idea hard to present.I thought that the author jumped around from one subject to another.For example one chapter was talking about football then the next was about halloween.The author focuses on other subjects and doesn't realizes theres not enought infiormation about the main idea  
 This movie does not even lead up to the game. The plot isn't good at all. Terrible acting performances by most of the actors/actresses. I was surprise to know that Kylie Mingoue was Cammy. The fight scenes were fake. My favorites in the game were Ken and Ryu, and they made them unreal. And for the rest of the other fighters, their background stories are also fake and very hard to believe. Basically, the whole movie from start to end was very boring. In my own opinion...they SHOULD MAKE A REMAKE OF STREET FIGHTER!!!! SAVE UR MONEY!! 
 i was so disappointed in this book, it made me angry. It was the first time I ever wanted to rush out and buy a book and pay full price upon hearing reviews. People were gushing over this thing. While Messoud is a beautiful writer, I beg to differ. This was stinky chic-lit. I was insulted by the stereotypical characters and didn't really see any "twist" to them at all. I thought the use of the events of Sept 11 to be really blah. The characters don't seem to grow. they all just seem like whiny, pathetic, bougie snobs. I really expected more. Don't bother buying this book. Just drive by my house and pick it up out of the trash. 
 BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER, the textbook currently used in my Introduction to Management class, does not effectively convey the important fundamentals of business management.  The book is structured around eight 'roles' of an effective manager, and each role is further broken down into a number of competencies that are functions of that particular role.  While I appreciate the effort to organize a relatively broad subject, I do not feel that the book is necessarily easy to follow.  The reading is constantly being interrupted by assessments and applications for each competency, and while meant well, they are usually skipped over in an attempted to finish the reading and they seem to me to be a large waste of paper.  Furthermore, BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER stresses models and theories of management that I find useless without the necessary fundamentals of management, which are not adequately presented in the textbook.  Some of the models and theories have merit and should be discussed more in depth, but in a more advanced level of business management.  And while BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER is the official textbook for my management class, I have relied heavily on a different textbook for my information, and only the eve of a test do I bother to look over BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER, I do not recommend this textbook for an introductory class at all 
 "If a nut on the wall is a walnut, what is a nut in the bathroom?  A pee can."  "Why did the baby cross the road?  She was stapled to the chicken."  Billing itself as "the mother of all joke books", The Jokelopedia has the apparent goal of turning your child (or grandchild, etc.) into a comedian.  Categorized by subject matter such as a monster jokes, classroom distractions, family funnies, etc., the book contains riddles, jokes, cartoons, and tips from famous comedians.  Many of the riddles have pun-ch lines consisting of puns:  some that I consider funny, and many of which adults will consider groaners, but will get a lot of giggles from 8 year-olds.    Although I tend to like puns more than the average person, as a practitioner of non-violent communication, I don't recommend giving this book to children.  I am concerned that roughly up to 10 to 20% of the laughs come at the expense of becoming desensitized to the suffering of animals and humans.  For example, there's a joke about a woman who buys a parrot, and to get the bird to talk, she buys a mirror, a ladder, a bell, etc.  She goes back to the store and reports that the parrot died.  The clerk expresses his sorrow over her loss and asks if the parrot ever said anything to her.  The woman replied that just prior to dying, the parrot said, "Doesn't that store carry any food?"  So the joke is that the parrot starved to death because the woman was too stupid to buy food in addition to all the accessories.  There are riddles that have punch lines at the expense of animal suffering, for example, "What's black and white and flat? A panda that's been run over."  And the tacky frog in a blender joke, mentioned by a previous reviewer, could give a child the idea to actually try this (likely very few children but it's possible).  Although much of the egregiously tacky material is in the "Snot funny" section, there is some in other sections of the book.  Another reason I don't recommend the Jokelopedia is because of the practical joke recommendations.  The child who tries out these suggestions will probably think he or she is being funny, but those laughs come at the expense of being rude and crude to other people, and insensitive to their feelings.  For example, one of their slumber-party jokes is to pour cold water over the shower curtain rod on someone using the shower.  Another is to put another child's hand in a glass of warm water to get him or her to wet the bed.  Yet another is to put some fake plastic vomit in the sink.  One of the elevator practical jokes is to bet the other passengers that you can fit a quarter in your nose.  Yuck.  Another joke encourages lying:  "Tell [your big sister] that one of her friends called (for this to work, be specific--use the real name of someone your sibling is close to and say one of the coolest kids in school is having a party tonight, but you can't remember all the details."  In case your budding comedian runs out of practical ideas to play on siblings and parents (yes, a parental practical joke idea involving the kitchen sink sprayer is provided--don't say you weren't warned!), there are five suggestions for tormenting the pizza guy.  One could, as another reviewer did, rip out some of the pages prior to giving the book to a child, or perhaps cross out portions with a thick dark marker like it's a government document.  (But if you rip out the page of slumber party practical jokes, the blurb on Lucille Ball is on the other side.)   Had I received this book as a child with pages ripped out, I would have been extremely curious about what was missing and sought out another copy!  Unless the authors write a new edition that takes out the practical and insensitive to suffering jokes, I don't recommend rewarding them by purchasing this book.  That's unfortunate, because I think some of the puns are very clever, and encourage children to have fun with the language. 
 I wasn't feeling the storyline and altough it may have been a  true story, this book put me to sleep.  It was boooooooring! 
 I picked this book up last week at a homeschool convention.  My oldest son is very interested in history and learning about the explorers.  We have enjoyed books by this author before, so I felt like it was a good buy.  I can't believe how blatantly anti-Christian the author is in this book.  She makes Christians sound like the wart of the world!  She makes it sound like the world progressed in knowledge and achievements in spite of Christianity.  Although I am no history expert, some of her statements just didn't sit well with me, and I would really question whether what she wrote is fact or just her ignorant, prejudiced opinion.  I will never purchase another book by her again 
 People were talking about this movie as if it were the next Silence Of The Lambs.  There are several reasons why this is not so.  1. The Dumbest Cop In The World:  This character never calls for backup, and is too slow to think of the most obvious clues.  At the end, he even throws down his gun to have a fist fight.  He'd never survive on the Sopranos. 2. It's sooooooo 1998.  This movie assumes you know nothing about the internet.   3. It tries to be cool by combining BDSM, body modification, and rituals, but in the end it just makes all these things look bad. 4. It's inconsistent.  The Dee Snider character "retires" all his piercings for a few years, and then suddenly they're all back in the next scene.   5. It's unrealistic.  Where the heck did Snider get that second dungeon from in just a day? 6. I won't even get into the gaping plot holes.  The acting, pretty bad.  The dumbest cop in the world character has just one mood:  Grumpy.  Amy Smart is totally wasted in this movie.  Snider's pretty good though.  Actually he's really good.  Really, bottom line:  You have only two reasons to buy this movie. 1. You are easily entertained and you have no problem with plot holes so big you can drive a Twisted Sister tour bus through them with room to spare. 2. You're a Snider fan and you must own this.  If you belong to one of those two groups, go for it.  For Sister fans, they'll enjoy how the movie roughly follows the plot of the song Captain Howdy/Street Justice.    You've been warned!  
 Stop me if you've heard this one:   So these girls go into Afghanistan, then one of the most repressive theocracies in the world.   They are -- get this -- missionaries, and they wander around trying to convert the "heathens" to Christianity, which is a little like opening a synagogue in 1930s Germany.   It would make a good sitcom, in the tasteless manner of "Hogan's Heroes," but it makes a lousy book.  Religious zealotry is the worst thing on the planet and these two crullers merely wanted to exchange one type of fanaticism for another.   
 I agree with the premise that America is poised on the edge of a financial apocalypse and bought the book looking for strategies for "battening down the hatches" with the coming inclement financial climate.  However,  the actual investment advice given here is pablum:  since large cap stocks are headed for a prolonged decline,  cash will be a better investment than index funds.  Buy some gold and oil stocks,  but not too much,  and be prepared for volatility. I didn't need to spend $55 to hear that advice.  The book is full of grammatical and spelling errors,  which detracts from its authoritativeness.    Are there some good observations here?  Of course.  I like his analysis of real estate appreciation and why real estate is the only physical asset which appreciates with time (because of the time/value effect of mortgage expenditures) while its constituent parts depreciate.  Overall though,  I don't recommend it. 
 hurts to wear and u can barly see out of it dont get it 
 I agree on the following points:  Great concept. Great writing style. Good command of language.  But for the rest - the stories were too bizzare.  They were too warped and ugly to fall into a category of good reading.  They were neither original or imaginative.  Dasgupta's formula seems to be - take a well known fable/fairy tale like "Rapunzel" and "Bluebeard" - set it in one of the world's well-known capitals (Paris, Tokyo, Delhi)- and then throw in some sci-fi events, make a series of progressively darker and bizzare events happen and then either provide a sadistic ending or a nice "happily ever after" ending.  In one case he has twisted the story of the sailor and the albatross - to convert it into the story of a wingless bird that unites two lovers.  There is too much of gross descriptions and stuff in the book as well 
 This book is a decent story that reads fairly well, but the four most important words I can include in this review are "graphically depicted zebra sex."  Yes, you read that right, and yes, it is in the book 
 this is a boring book that gives some insight into the period.  Most of it is filled with uninteresting dialogue that gives very little insight into anything.  You have to skip through to find historical interest. 
 Vercollone et. al. provide some very helpful information, but they suggest that you should not tell your child that s/he was the result of donor insemination.  They spend a great deal of time discussing the stigma attached to DI, yet they seem to be perpetuating this by suggesting that the child should not know about it. Also, this book's focus is on heterosexual couples using DI.  It does not claim to be for lesbians 
 I'll preface this by saying I'm a cryer.  I cry at movie previews when they simply look entertaining.  I cried all the way through Superman Returns.  I did not, however, shed one tear during Message in a Bottle.  In English class, I always learned to "show, not tell" when writing.  When that is your rule of thumb, you'll write a moving piece of literature, even if you're not completely skillful.  Sparks is the master of telling without showing.  I'm honestly baffled by all the good reviews it gets.  The story is somewhat engaging, but with no payoff.  But the work is filled with passages like (and these are from memory; if I picked up the book to look for verbatim examples I'd have to type the entire thing), "He went to the refrigerator, opened the door, and took a beer.  After opening it, he sat down on the back deck."  Or, "Though she was overweight, she moved quickly around the table."  "She got out of the shower, dried off, and put on khaki shorts and a white cotton shirt."  Have you read enough yet?  I'm new to the romance genre.  My mother-in-law recommended Sparks because -- I think she was trying to imply -- his sex scenes aren't too graphic.  They were to me, but then, I'm new to romance, and spoiled by the masterful, unequaled storytelling skill of Stephen King.  Please hold your New York Times bestsellers to a higher standard.  Let's hold on to whatever quality control we can in music, movies, and literature 
 Seasons 1 and 2 of BS were interesting and informative. They would say "Look at this: It's not what you think it is. Let us show you what we mean." Season three was basically Penn saying "Take a look at these idiots." There are a few things in season 3 that ARE informative, but most of it is either obvious "Wow, you mean God ISN'T showing up in grilled cheese?" or opinionated "Hey, I never finished college, and now I'm rich!" And they included more gratuitus nudity just, I assume, to fit into "Showtime."   So yeah, BS has jumped the Shark 
 I didnt think the book was bad until the further I got.  I could understand why Rose decided to leave California.  I was glad that she decided to keep the baby.  Even when she married Son I thought for sure that she would finally grow to love someone, including her daughter.  The fact that she remained so flat and uncaring really bothered me.  I would have loved to see Thomas show up with no warning and finally see all the truth come out and see some resolution for all the caracters that Rose touched.  I almost felt that Patchett lost her steam, and found it easier to let Rose disappear and end the book than to deal with what was really happening.  At the very least, I would have liked an explanation from Rose at the end as to why once a again she couldnt stay and deal.  As far as being a Saint, I didnt see any redeeming quality about Rose for that kind of title.  It was frustrating and disappointing.  Its the kind of book that leaves a bad taste in your mouth 
 The only reason I am giving this 1 start is becuase of Amazon's poor service, otherwise I would give 5 stars for the product.  I placed this order more than 30 days ago.  Amazon still has not shipped the item so I cancelled my order and placed it with J&R.  If Amazon did not have the item in stock, they should have stated on their web site or at least communicated with me that there will be a delay in Shipping 
 After reading the first 56 pages of this book, I'm done. It has  extremely little to do with Bicycling, rather it's more about an aimless man who is having sex with multiple women and the book is mostly about how he cycles through them. I think that's why the title "cycling"  If youre looking for a book about cycling try The Race. It's worth reading again and agai 
 The written directions were not always clear. The illustrations did not correspond to the written notations. I was unable to use this book when making my lined drapes. I had to resort to another source 
 This has to be one of the worst written books I ever read.  I can't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing. So far, Danielle Steel has found a way in the first third of this book.  I just can't read the rest of it. Generally, if a book isn't very good I can suffer through.  This one has gotten on my last nerve.  I had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable.  But, I don't think I will be reading anymore of her books.  It's an insult to Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown for her to be ranked with them 
 My friend was going to toss this CD but gave it to me. As the title suggests, something revolutionary was supposed to happen.  Unfortunately, DJ Spooky's efforts are a mish-mosh of noise, tired AOL samples, video game  music & wrecked techno 
 The quality of the pictures need significant improvement. As an artist you need all possible details for the best results 
 I keep reading and listening to his books because everyone says how good they are, but I have never found this to be so.  He always strikes me as someone who potters around never really interacting with people who then goes home and writes about it.  He seems more at home studying statistics (which he includes everywhere) and drawing his own facile conclusions from these statistics.  I always imagine him stuck in his room reading his newspaper, surfing the net and smugly summing up his brief interactions with people in the real world.  All his travel books are equally awful as he never really interacts with anyone - just comments on them later.  Still lots of people think he is grea 
 ...designed to lift money from the wallets of the American public.  If one is to transmit digital signals like those that come from the back of DVD and CD players reliably, 100% shielding is a basic requirement. This cable is not 100% shielded; look for foil in addition to the copper braid. Further, digital signals don't care about super low resitance or impedance.  If the bits get there, the amplitude is incidental once a sufficient level is achieved.  Over a distance of >10feet, big and fat are just to make you feel good about spending $40 on a $5 piece of hardware. *see below for a possible exception to this.  Thirdly, if you don't have balanced electronics, what difference could an unbalanced cable with RCA interconnects make? RCA connectors will never be 75ohm connectors; they will never be balanced.  The arrows are mostly to make you feel good about your purchase.  Usually it simply indicates the company specs that any drains are attatched at the end to which the arrows point.  If you have such a grounding problem as to cause interference in your playback, an RCA will never cure anything. As a feel good genuflection to the audiphile gods, attach all your arrowed interconnects with the arrow pointing the same way.    And lastly, look into VSWR and how the design of this RCA affects it.  The large diameter of this cable and therefore the diameter of it's dielectric might help here, but if you can see the solder job, the chance of unhealthy levels of VSWR is greater in that once the signal reaches this RCA, the differences between the RCA's shielding, and other properties, and the properties of the coaxial cable are sudden and definite.      If you have the money to spend and like to massage your cables as you install them, this company makes some nice looking/feeling stuff. Not surprising in the world of audio--big marketing hype over substance 
 I did not like this craphead book at all. I was not excited to pick it up and could not find myself getting hooked in its non-existant story line. The characters were unrealistic and undeveloped. Is"Kit" a good guy or a bad guy? You just can't root for him throughout the story because he is just an unfinished sketch on a chewed up piece of paper. 
 This could have been a very exciting book if it had been written by someone such as James Dodson instead of by Mr. Palmer.  Although he shares with us information about many exciting moments of golf matches and  facinating individuals, the book becomes incredibly boring because of all  his first person I-Me-My references 
 this bratz looks very pretty but she is fianna she shound  not have blond hair she shound have brown because i have  funk out fianna wild life safari fianna and flash back fever fianna and they all have brown hair 
 The authors provide a lot of sophisticated-sounding analysis to substantiate their "novel" approach to market timing.  As evidenced by some of the reviews on this site, this approach succeeds in garnering the authors their share of believers.    However, their analysis is in reality quite unsophisticated.  Scratch beneath the surface and you will come across profound breakdowns in logic and a host of invalid analytical techniques.  Some of the book's most egregious failings are detailed by reviewer Gaetan Lion.  I recommend you read his review---he hits the nail right on the head.   
 I once saw this movie seven years ago and really liked it.  Hey, I was young and naive.  I recently rented this movie to see it again.  I was once again robbed of my money. Cameron's Closet is 90 minutes of pure boredom.  The acting is horrible, the monster is laughable, the writing is unbelieveable, I could just go on and on about how terrible this movie is. Cameron is a young boy who has telekinetic powers.  He then brings a demon to life through a statue his dad gave him.  Then people begin to die.  A detective and a psychiatrist begin to investigate. I can't begin to comprend why I liked this movie the first time I saw it.  This is just one big laughfest from the start to the end 
 the description says it has the pratchett story in it, but it doesn't. it only has 4 of the original 11. what a rip-off! 
 After really liking the Bourne Identity movies I figured I'd pick out a Ludlum novel because it would be good.  I got this from the library to check out and figured it would be a good read while I was on vacation.  I was very disappointed.  I barely got through it, but it helped me get to sleep so I plugged on.  First off, to reload a pistol you use a MAGAZINE, it's not a clip.  To hear some super special forces secret agent type calling it a clip takes all credibility away from the author to me.  It is soooo painfully obvious that the writer Gayle lynds has done no research whatsoever into weapons or combat and has never fired a firearm.  If you're going to write an action/thriller type novel, at least write like you somewhat know what you're talking about.  An MP5 is not going to slam anybody's body back like a sack of rice, it fires 9mm rounds.  Bullets do not push people back, not even a little bit, unless it's from a cannon of some sort or some other huge weapon designed to attack tanks or buildings.  Also, nobody is ever going to win and/or escape any firefight when they're armed with a 9mm Glock and a 9mm Beretta and they are facing off against a force that outnumbers them 6 to 1 and is armed with assault rifles.  The writing was poor, the dialogue was unrealistic, and it is littered with things that just make the author lose credibility (clips).  I will give Ludlum another chance by reading another novel, but Gayle Lynds is a very poor writer.  And what is up with her constant use of the word "too".  She has sentences like "And I better get over to the building, too."  Why is there a comma there Gayle, it doesn't sound right.  It should be "I'll get over to the building too."  It takes away the choppiness.  I did not get the sense at all that the main character was tough, it was clearly written by somebody that has never done any of the things she writes about.  Seeing that such poor writing gets published is actually a good thing, it gives me hope for my novel.  I give this book 2 stars, and overall rating of "Extreme Cheese".  
 The book started out fairly well, but the amateurish writing really did start to get to me after awhile. The murders the story hinges around get dull and tiresome, and I actually began rooting for the unidentified killer to do away with Kate Paine, the undeveloped and boring heroine of the book. When  finally learned who the culprit was, I had totally lost interest and felt that the author just pulled it out of a hat without any reason or logic. And there is nothing more annoying in books than the killer explaining to the victim (who is tied up and forced to listen to the obligatory rantings) all the reasons he has done such terrible deeds. For a better story, read "The Firm" by John Grisham, or "The Job" by Douglas Kennedy 
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 I have never been so disappointed in purchasing books that I have owned in the past as I have been with this book!!  I have probably bought about 20 copies of this book over the last 20ish years.  This used to be a wonderful book, now it is nothing but advertisements for other books about similar topics.  There is not even mention of the loss of a phone call in there.  Not only will I never purchase this book again, but I will also quit referring it to people that have loss in their lives.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!! 
 The author of this book is expressing his method of piano playing or technique. "The present treatise explains the method of my piano playing, that is, what I consider to be the foundation of my pianistic  technique". If you are an advance play or teacher you might find this  1932 book useful 
 This is undeniably the worst book I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Even more offensive then the monotonous writing technique, the story line is excruciatingly predictable, with muddled unidentifiable characters, all of which have vague personal motives devoid of genuine emotional profundity or complexities. For the most part, the characters behave like complete idiots. They do not translate to real life. The writer's lack of bias comes across as feeble narrative. I don't recommend this book. I especially do not recommend it for adolescent readers because it falls perilously short of realistically articulating the horrors of actual drug addiction. 
 As advertised on the cover of this book, anachronistic me-generation guru Peck and his wife Lily set off on a tour of Britain's legendary stone circles, right? Wrong. Peck and Lily do visit some circle sites but this book is about 1% stone circles and 99% Peck going on and on and on and on and on and on about himself, his life, his beliefs, his personal health, and why faithful Lily forgave him for all the pain his freewheeling, skirtchasing lifestyle as one of the "it" crowd of the '60's and '70's self-discovery movement caused her. This is not about Britain's heritage sites, or even about self-help, it's about Peck patting Peck on the back for being such a smart fella. A bad book without any redeeming qualities. A waste of money and time. Oh, and Dr. Peck, Scotland is not, as you claim, "larger than all the rest of the United Kingdom combined." Jeesh 
 This book stretches reality to the point of absurdity.  I won't give anything away, but something happens at the end of this book that I find completely improbable.  Also, I don't particulary enjoy romance novel type sex scenes, of which there are a number in this book.  I'm very suprised at the high customer rating of this riduculous book 
 Having read a few Bosch books already (The Closers and Lost Light), I realized that I should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how Bosch became the Bosch I was reading in the later series.  However, I was very disappointed with this book.  One of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors (mispellings and such).  I found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages (before I stopped reading)!  I thought it was ironic that Connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book, because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book.  Also, I found the book to be too gritty.  It lacked the emotion and soul that I found in the later books.  It seemed that Connelly was trying too hard to make Bosch fit this certain mold, but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that I read.  So it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because I just finished reading The Narrows and loved it, and will probably pick up some other Bosch books and just read it out of order.  Connelly's writing seems to be getting better and better, which should explain why I didn't enjoy this book and couldn't finish it.  I gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe I was too impatient.  This is one of those series that seems like it is better to read out of order 
 The size of this book and the subtitle give the impression that this book covers the whole field.  It doesn't.  This hodgepodge of Ordinary Language and other approaches to the philosophy of literature is not the whole picture.  See "A Book Worth Reading" for a different and systematic approach to this new branch of philosophy.   The articles in this anthology are almost all by philosophers who have only a passing knowledge of literature.  The results are sophistic and at time sophomoric.   Missing also are some famous contributions to the field, such as Sartre's What is Literature? a book which raises some serious problems for literature.  Also, the work of John M. Ellis.   If you can afford it, buy all four books.  If not, you're better off with A Book Worth Reading.   
 This book was simply not up to Baldacci's usual quality.  The story goes all over the place, but doesn't get anywhere until the last 50 pages.  Even after 200, 300, and even 400 pages we are still chasing dead ends and no closer to figuring out where this thing is going.  I don't mind suspense, but you can stay "suspended" only so long until it becomes boredom.  The main character is the worst one Baldacci has ever created.  One minute she is crying her eyes out, and puking her guts out totally paralyzed by fear, and the next minute she is tracking down trained bad guys and saving the lives of the inept FBI agents and police.  This is repeated throughout the story.........I would think she had worn out all the emotional crap by the end of the book.  She makes one blunder after another resulting in the deaths of innocent people, but at the same time comes up with brilliant deductions that help her stay one step ahead of the mastermind killers.  By the end of the book I found myself pulling for the sadistic killer to finally finish this stupid [...] off.    This is one of those books to keep next to the bed in case you are having trouble sleeping. 
 I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I.  Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship.  And the writing isn't so hot, either.  If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad.  The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort 
 This text is by far the worst college text I have encountered in my educational career.  Where most texts stick to relevant facts and figures relating to their area of study, this text delves into opinion coupled with unbridled conjecture.  The text is littered with political opinions and political assumptions made about its reader, while listing irrelevant facts and theories that support a socialist Democrat view of the society of the United States.  Karl Marx and Socialism are continually defended as just economic forms of society while Capitalism is openly bashed at every page turn.  Conspiracy theories thrive in this book as it even accuses the United States' representational democracy as being ineffective, and that the country is actually ran by a conspiratorial "power elite."  The author often inserts personal opinion and biased so-called "personal experiences" with social issues as facts, and assumes the reader is a freshmen student unable to discern his fact from his fiction.   Here is a short excerpt from page 189, contained within a chapter dealing with social class:  Like many people, you may have said to yourself, "Sure I can vote, but somehow the big decisions are always made despite what I may think.  Certainly, I don't make the decision to send soldiers to Afghanistan or Iraq.  I don't launch missiles against Kosovo, or Baghdad.  I don't decide to raise taxes or interest rates.  It isn't I who decides to change welfare benefits."  I think it is clear here and in other excerpts from the text that the author should be writing editorials for his local newspaper instead of college texts.  It seems to me that the author intends to mold the minds of the college youth in his political image under the guise of giving a factual accounting of the field of Sociology.  I absolutely do not recommend this book to anyone, and think it is time to inform my university of the contents of this text before more students are forced to purchase it in its next incarnation.  Thanks for taking the time to read my review.  If you feel the same as I do about this text, then please speak up at your local university and here.  
 I first viewed this as a VHS about three years ago as part of a research project. Not only is the Tai-Chi and Yoga useless, and the girls completely ineptÑthe girls also spend most of their time covering their genitals with their hands whenever they go into an open-legged squating position as if they are frightened and embarrassed by what they are doing. If the DVD is the same low-quality production as the VHS, I would not waste my time and money 
 I thought this DVD series would have the full season of season one, but it didn't.  All of the early shows were not there.  I will not buy any of the other seasons of baywatch 
 Information you already know, mixed with the same retro style as a dozen other books you can buy more cheaply. YAWN 
 Ethan Canin is a great short story writer, but when it comes to novels, he misses the target.  His short stories are great because they are brief, and are told through actions and conversations, not sentimentality and excessive introspection.  Blue River, like For Kings and Planets, are undisciplined works, perhaps too ambitious, with overwrought language and too much filler material.  A much better story with the same theme appear in the Palace Thief, called Batorsag and Szerelem 
 I bought this book for my husband, thinking 'aww' a book especially for him. My husband hated it. And on reading so did I. The author obviously has a very usual relationship with his wife as he often talks about feelings of jealously between them. Its very unusual. For example "when you feel the baby kicks your wife might feel jealous as so far its been her private pregnancy"! How ridiculous how would jealousy ever come into it! The book assumes all men are concerned about is finances - it has pages and pages on money, insurance etc. there is nothing much about the joys you feel as a father. If your husband is kind hearted, honest and is truly looking forward to pregnancy and the birth of his child I would advise not to buy this book. The tone is very negative and some of the statements and assumptions about what "men" and "women", are very generalised bordering on ridiculous ie "your partner might be worried that you're going to leave her" what the heck?. It seems very personally related to the authors experience, and is simply selling because it is one of the only books packaged to be directly aimed at men.  I would suggest the book "the birth partner" it is for men/the partner and is written in a matter of fact and open way (the author is not overly emotionally involved) - getting you to ask questions about how you would feel about certain situations rather than dictating how you do feel. READ THE OTHER 1 STAR REVIEWS AND YOU'LL SEE EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT 
 i gave it 2 stars as i felt that overall i would not recommend this book 
 When you call your book true stories, especially in this year of heightened awareness about what is truth and what is fiction, you should expect a higher level of scrutiny from your readers.  As such, I have to admit that I'm highly dubious as to the legitimacy and honesty of some of these stories.  I'm sure that they are all based on some grain of truth, but the specter of exaggeration lurks in the background of many of the stories.  Am I to really believe that people were punching him in the kidneys because he was walking around Seattle in a dog suit?  The height to which the story goes on-and-on seems like a rant.  Other stories also come across as rants.  The writing workshop story comes across as being written by someone with a big chip on their shoulder, a frustrated writer, and comes across and quite demeaning actually.    Many of the stories are down right obnoxious and boring.  Some are interesting as a brief diversion perhaps before bedtime.  Bottom line, I'm not sure if it was the attack on Seattle, or the underlying obnoxiousness and seeming exaggeration, but I found myself hating this book and hating its author 
 Watched it 2 days ago and could not believe how much they copied/stole from "For a Fistful of Dollars." Just about everything. What a letdown... 
 It sure sucks everything up including carpet itself.  I'm concerned that my carpet will be paper thin in few years.  Long cord is good, but both body and wind tunnel part are so heavy to carry around the house and it is not made for wood floor at all.  I don't think it's worth the money and I don't recommend anyone to buy it 
 My mother gave us our Rival F69204 Electric White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer, which worked well for three seasons.  Yesterday, I made a batch of frozen custard for company for dinner.  The result was terribly salty and had to be thrown out.  I filled the stainless steel container with water, which seeped out overnight.  Apparently ice cream salt bled into the custard mix while the ice cream was making.  Online, I discovered (1) that Mother paid much too much for this item and (2) there seemed no way to order replacement parts--as in a new tank.  Can you help 
 this is not the eric clapton i know. when he does blues that is clapton. i wish he would do another blues like "from the cradle. 
 It was ok, if you like that kids of movie, but not for the mother in me 
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing 
 Quigley was a Georgetown professor who was permitted access for two years in the early 1960's to the private archives of the Committee on Foreign Relations, a Rockefeller internationalist organization that compliments the work of the Trilateral Commission and the Royal Institute of International Affairs.    It is difficult to determine what the author is trying to communicate.  There is no continuity to the book; nothing ties together Quigley's version of the past and of the future.  It's like reading about the solar system and finding out that the conclusion of the matter is that the sun will expand and burn everything up.  You are left wondering, what is the point?    We are left with the suggestion that the elite should continue to guide us in the same direction that we are traveling, but avoiding some of the monumental blunders that they have made in the past.  Quigley's version of history consists mostly of unquestioning repetition of propaganda.  Quigley did a superficial job of analyzing history, and he is even worse at sociology.  He touts Inclusive Diversity as our great strength and greatest gift.  Perhaps he should have considered the aphorism, "Divide and conquer."  The West, or any other empire, can only flourish when it concentrates on matters of common concern, not divisivness    Quigley does slightly better with economics and foreign policy, which are more in his area of expertise.  He correctly observes that British and American "victories" in WWI and WWII resulted in the almost total destruction of international law.  Quigley is in favor of the idea of continental blocs replacing national states.  As globalization unfolds, Quigley exposes some of the hypocrisy and bungling, yet  he inexplicably remains committed to the overall plan.  So, what is the point of all of this costly meddling?  Quigley predicts success...and then failure.  "We shall undoubtedly get a Universal Empire in which the U.S. will rule most of Western Civilization.  This will be followed by a period of decay and ultimately by invasions and the total destruction of Western culture."  Couldn't we save ourselves the trouble and just mind our own business?     Minding our own business is a concept based on the idea that the electorate is in control of the government, and that we have a choice.  However, Quigley admits that international financiers influence and control governments.  Quigley says that the internationalists, who prefer to remain in the background, should be known for their "valuable" contributions.  What these contributions amount to is that they want world government, and they intend to cram it down everyone's throats.  As we slouch toward financial, industrial, and government monopoly the author reminds us of some of the casualties.  "As economic enterprises have become larger and more tightly integrated into one another, the freedom, individualism, and initiative traditionally associated with the modern economy have to be sacrificed." Quigley acknowledges that in our future, "In general, there will be a very considerable modification of the areas and objectives of freedom in all societies of the world, with gradual reduction of numerous personal freedoms of the past."  To add to this loss of freedom, Quigley bemoans our loss of a spiritual mooring and suggests a return to the values of Christianity!   His version of Christianity, of course.  Still full of contradictions, Quigley cleaves to relativism rather than absolutes, approximations rather than final answers-not realizing that the adoption of these mindsets are what weakened the appeal of Christianity.  Finally, as we follow our present course, Quigley predicts an age of conflict characterized by class struggle, war, irrationality, and declining progress. Obviously, we're there now.     Rather than attack his sponsors, who are bringing us this New World Order, Quigley vents his frustration on the middle class.  Quigley touts the moral superiority of both the rich and poor, but he asserts that the middle class consists of poorly-informed, neurotic, bourgeois, radical-right Republicans. Worst of all, they have Puritanical attitudes toward sex.   The many internal contradictions in this book indicate a confused mind or a shallow thinker.  The author's history is mostly stale propaganda, spiced up with occasional pro-government cheerleading or tales of government boondoggles.   Maybe if Quigley had broken this monstrosity into several different books, he would have had something coherent to say.  In this book, Quigley's  conclusion is almost totally divorced from the rest of the book.  This effort spanned 20 years, and possibly senility was sneaking up on the author.    
 I'm not sure Byatt had in mind as a prospective readership for this novel.  I read a lot and am not a stranger to the world of literary criticism, but this tome was virtually unbearable once I hit about the halfway point.  The first half was somewhat interesting and I had high hopes.  But as the book quote-unquote progressed, there just was more and more nothin'.  Endless, lengthy quotations and, frankly, boring observations.  I'm not sure I have anything of value to comment on, specifically, but I would like to forewarn readers:  this is one of the most trying, pretentious, uninteresting books I have ever read, and I think it would not likely appeal to the vast majority of readers.  It could conceivably appeal to lit crit buffs but even then.  Yuck 
 This is Randy White's first novel and it shows!! Read the Introduction. He gives the read sufficient notice so you have no excuse 
 Ughh! I was so frustrated with the main character of March in this book that it made it hard to enjoy anything else about it. She was whiny and selfish and abandons all those who truly care about her. It was impossible to have any patience or sympathy for such weak character. You wanted to tell her to grow up and start putting her daughter's needs before her own. Instead, she puts her daughter's life at risk by moving her in with a sociopath. The daughter, Gwen, was very interesting and you felt so sorry for her for having such a terrible mother. I also enjoyed her "love interest", her cousin that lives with Hollis, as well as her relationship with the horse. For me, these were the only redeemable parts of the book 
 If it wasn't for the fact that I listened to the audio book version during my daily commute to work, I probably would have abandoned this book halfway through.   The end is confusing, and I'm left wanting more, not in a good way 
 I read the other two reviews on this soundtrack and had to agree with them. I also wondered who this Jessica Harp is? I can't find anything on her, but I did like her sound and the cover of kinks during the credits of the film. Speak up if you know something I don't 
 I picked up this short crime novel 'cause I was in a rush and it had a nice blurb on the cover from George Pelecanos (one of my favorite writers). Well, haste definitely made waste for me, and I'm sad to report that Pelecanos gave me a bum steer. This story about a murder trial in Brooklyn is an utterly tepid and uninteresting piece of work. Part of the problem is that a lot of the backstory to the protagonist Giobberti, a 40-year-old homicide prosecutor for the District Attorney's office, resides in Reuland's debut, Hollowpoint. Apparently in that book Giobberti screwed up so badly that he was exiled in disgrace to the backwater of the Appeals Bureau. He also either then or subsequently lost his daughter in a traffic accident and his wife walked out on him. Now, some 18 months later, he is unexpectedly told to take over a routine case involving a teenager who killed a bodega owner in a stickup.   Already on the case is inexperienced junior prosecutor Laurel Ashfield, who's never tried a homicide. Most of the book revolves around Giobberti and her getting a feel for each other and the case. Almost immediately, Giobberti (and the reader) realizes there's something not quite right about the case, and it takes an awfully long time for the specifics to be revealed. Once revealed, the specifics end up being woefully uninteresting, revolving around the completely unshocking reality of cops and DAs playing fast and loose with the truth in order to put away bad guys in order to score political points. The theme of corrupt a corrupt legal system and bent cops has been exhaustively explored in film and fiction for over a century, and Reuland brings nothing new to the table here.  The author was himself a lawyer for the Brooklyn DA's Homicide Bureau, so the book does benefit from a certain authenticity of detail. Reuland is particularly strong in describing places and creating vivid mental images of the courtroom, apartments, bathrooms, offices, and so on. Unfortunately, the people moving through these spaces don't talk or think the way real people do. The dialogue tends to be so clipped and elliptical that one wonders if the author is trying to parody of pulp films. At one point Giobberti actually addresses Ashfield as "sister" and another character laughably tells Giobberti to "take your meathooks off me!" Worst of all, there's no suspense and no dramatic tension to be found anywhere in this entirely skippable book. 
 Mr. Winchester takes an interesting subject, collects enough material to make a fine article in, say, National Geographic, and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length.  (Case in point, a chapter devoted to how he found an interesting fossil by the seaside while a kid, but loses it, and his journey back to the site of this failure of his to wallow in the misery of this horrible loss. Ick. Self-induldgent.  Boring.)  Worse, still, even where there is a potential for interesting and enlightening material, such as relates, say, to the subject's wife, all Mr. Winchester bothers to give us are some gossipy speculations.  I guess extensive research might have been too time consuming.  Numerous times I considered stopping reading the book because the writing was so dreadful, but the subject was just interesting enough to keep me going, hence my review of two stars.    John McPhee could have covered the actual science of geology way better than Mr. Winchester, and just about any other author could have done a better job of telling the personal story 
 My son received this as a Christmas gift. He and his brother and Dad were excited...got all set up to build it...and got nothing but frustration! These are really mechanically minded guys too. Very disappointing. I was especially surprised because of the Smithsonian name on it -- you'd think they would test this stuff before allowing their name on it. My guys never got as far as the reviewer who eventually got it assembled. The screws stripped and we didn't have the appropriate glue to even attempt a rescue. It simply would not assemble the way it was advertised. I am calling Amazon tomorrow about a refund. 
 Note: This is for anyone contemplating purchasing the new 2006 travel guide of Spain by Frommers. Don't waste your money. Although I have purchased over 30 Frommers books in the past and enjoyed each one, the Spain book was awful. In Madrid, the book lists 20 or so "Top Attractions" (which is customary for Frommers). However, try to read about these attractions (e.g. what they are, hours of operation, etc.) and you can only find about half of them in the book. How do you know if it is worth treking across town for something that has no description?  In addition, some attractions in Barcelona are not correct on the map (literally they are across town from where Frommers puts them). I ended up stopping in bookstores and reading Eye Witness in order to see what I was missing.  Save your money. I am also sending a complaint directly to Frommers as well. For the rest of the reviews (prior to mine) on this page, note that they are for other Frommers Spain versions (not the 2006 book) 
 This game was a little too hard for my tastes. Despite the fact that I played at the junior level I managed to get killed shortly after starting out. I also had to restart the game to figure out what my room number was because once I left the room I couldn't find my way back (all the corridors look alike). So far I've fallen down an elevator shaft, gotten caught breaking and entering, been crushed by an elevator, frozen to death and been hit over the head...I've got to ask is this really appropriate for children 
 After hearing mountains of praise for Discworld, I thought I'd give it a go. This book has completely turned me off to continuing the series. Pratchett has failed the fantasy genre where Adams has suceeded for sci-fi. The humor was helter-skelter and it seemed that Pratchett tried (too) hard to offer nonchalant zaniness 
 I was very disappointed by this book. I can only say that this book was shallow at best and a complete waste of time at worse. The many stories in the book are unrelated to television and one must ask why this book was published under such false pretenses.If false advertising is a crime, this book would certainly merit a felony conviction for duping its audience 
 Koontz is one of the best writers of fiction today, but Cold Fire and Hidaway are two of his worst books in my opinion.  Not much there.  Readable but I would check these out from the Library before you add them to your collection.  Ironically I own Hard Cover copies of both of these books.  I made the mistake of buying them when they first came out because I was a big fan of his other works.  I don't own  much fiction in my library and I would gladly swap these two books for Hard Copies of Dragon Tears or The Bad Place.  I will trade both for a Hard copy of Swan Song by Robert R. McCammon 
 J.R. Nelson is correct!! Half of the movie, or DVD, viewing experience is the sound!!! This DVD is in mono!!!!!!!! All the positives about this series remains - the best of all time. But, the 3 Cruise versions all have way, way, better sound, and DVD extras. I fully recommend the 5 "Alias" seasons over this package because of the far superior sound, and obvious similarities to the original Mission: Impossible tv series. 
 I thought the art had a certain charm, and used strictly as a picture book for children who can't yet read, I think it's quite nice.  (Too bad you can't make up your own story to go with it.)  The moment the child starts to read, though--better hide it quick, because...  Unfortunately, the book reads like a condensed Communist Manifesto for kids (as others have noted), or a Socialist agenda primer.  I don't know for sure that's what Marcus Pfister had as an aim, and I'm not going to speculate on his politics.  He has three kids and may raise them as he likes, and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat.  Yes, I suppose sharing is nice.  Certainly sharing one's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing--but in America, we get paid for that (charity is voluntary, not coerced).  Furthermore, stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting (not necessarily BETTER, just unique and interesting), or giving away all your possessions, is a lousy way to make and keep friends, isn't it?  Is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy (a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change, not pandering)?  Is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad?  Almost seems like it, at least to me.  Furthermore, there's an overtone of "only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth," which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever I've seen.  Of course, people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me, but that won't make them right.  (The two stars, if you must know, are for the art. 
 This so called director should be sued. As a 30 something who loved the original every friday night from season 1 through 4 (before Coy and Vance).....Coy and Vance look like gods compared to the cast of blasphemous characters to a classic and timeless show. First off....why was Burt Reynolds and not Danny De Vito casted as Boss Hogg? Why not Chevy Chase instead of an overweight villain known for playing a violent middleaged nut in "Breakdown" and "Conair"...(MC Gainey)...MC... you are a very good actor in your niche...just not turning James Best's character upside down. I refused to see this in theaters and rented in (regrettably) even after hearing the derogatory reviews with an open mind.I can write a book about character mistakes and ruining the "originals"....but I'll end it by saying the following to quote "You took the name of a classic to sucker fans and boost ticket sales for what would have been a straight to video bomb if it was not titled "Dukes of Hazzard." 
 Mostly touchy feely pointless antedotes.  At most one page of useful information 
 This book looked like it may be pretty funny to read, but unfortunately it was not.  I generally try to be kind in my reviews but I found this book to be so nauseating that I just had to write a negative review.  Mr.Stuever may be a talented writer technically, but the content of his articles is pretty pathetic.  He spends so much of his time being critical of others, that it leads me to wonder why he feels it is necessary to degrade others to help his own cause.  If you enjoy reading articles that are a constant derision and mockery of others, then this is the book for you.  If not, there are plenty of other funny reads out there.    
 This book would only be tolerable if you like romance novels, but in that case you'd be better off buying "The Notebook". - This book has no practical business value at all. I find its popularity to be deeply troubling. There is apparently something in the current business culture that makes people not want to think. They just want to feel good. The story presents "facts", but no sources. It presents inspiration, but no critical thought, and it doesn't prepare the reader for the real challenges that they will face in life or in business. Rather then presenting Vision from the appropriate management perspective, it presents it from a marketing perspective. This is how we want the public to feel about Vision. - Even from the viewpoint of `inspiration' it fails, because it's fictional. ANYONE can succeed in fiction. No 
 I purchased this book as part of a required reading for my high school honors geometry course. It is perhaps the most utterly boring and fanatical piece of fiction I have ever read. Not only is the book completely devoid of plot, it is lacking in all aspects of what a true work of fiction should include. This book has not educated me further on geometric concepts, nor has it enlightened me of any time period of which this book is said to be mirroring. Instead, it has wasted my time, which is precious to me now, and has completely confused me. Do not purchase this book. Do not assign it as required reading and most definitely do not read it for pleasure. There are other 80 page books that you can spend your time on.  Read anything else before you read Flatland 
 Henry Morris is neither a scientist nor a theologian. He's a hydraulics engineer-turned-author who's obsessively promoted the 7th Day Adventist doctrine of a "young earth creation" far outside the SDA denomination - doing nearly incalcuable damage to many churches. He's since gone on to promote the "King James Only" cult group which further seeks to spread 7th Day Adventist false doctrines among Baptist Fundamentalists, and even promoted a sort of astrology among Christians! Jesus said we'll know them by their fruits - Morris' fruit is churches ripped apart over the age of the Earth, and seekers convinced that the Bible isn't true because of Morris' bizarre interpretation of Genesis. Morris deserves nothing but a firm, unsympathetic rebuke for distorting the Bible, slandering other Christians ...and lying about science 
 I bought this DVD in september, 2006. But I have never received it 
 What in tarnation is this?  And who listens to this?  Are you like rolling down the street with your windows down.  Yo check it.  Sufjan...kicking it out.  Heck no.  I would be embarrased to have anyone see me and hear these sounds.  It's like...I don't even know...like a bad production of Jesus Christ Super Star.  ? I can't even beleive it.  I feel like an idiot listneing to this garbage.  Who rocks it like this.?  Where do they find these people. And there are like mad people dying in Africa and stuff...what would they think of you if they saw you listening to this...They would know that they are really going to die.  Oh no.  Look at those crazy Americans.  We are dead for sure now.  No way they are gonna help us, when they can't even help themselves. People. Please.  
 A lot of people are meriting Ja's credibility on all his albums because he has been able to keep his voice on the airwaves since 1998. So he released his sophomore album Rule 3:36 in Sept 2000, that is one of the worst Ja albums I've heard (not the worst, The Last Temptation takes that title).   Ja tries to be "gangstafied" on this album but fails terribly. Starting with the first single "Me & You" thinking his thug style can attract women. I haven't bought the concept in 2000, and I'm still not buying it six years later. Or how about the flat falling track "F*** You" featuring Vita and 01?  Or as many revewers have pointed out that he tries to boast his singing vocals on this album, which seriously damages his creditablity. How about the song "Put It On Me" before Lil Mo joined song. Sounds wack(er) with out her. Or how about the late Barry White imitation on the song "Extacy" (and thats one of the decent tracks on this album). Oh and remember when "Between Me & You" was highly antacipated that you downloaded the single on Napster? Well do you remember that the origonal/demo that some of you downloaded didn't have Christina Millian singing the hook, but had Ja singing it himself. Thank god that wasn't on the album.    Now there are some listenable tracks on this album that I would like to point out. "6 Feet" is a standout track, and is possibly the best track on this album and my personal favorite. "Watching Me" is another tight track, as Ja spits with a load of energy within him. "I Cry" and as mentioned earlier "Extacy" are decent at best. Other than that, most of the tracks on this album are skippable.  Overall, a sub medicore Ja Rule album. Most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers are either big time Ja Rule fans or just in love with mainstream overrated rap ("Put It On Me" [Remix]). To me, this album is nothing else but a pop rap, falsafied thug rap album that just doesn't appeal to me. I recommend this to hardcore Ja Rule fans if they don't have this already.  Lyrics: C Production: C+ Guest Appearances: C- Musical Vibes: D-  Favorite Tracks: Watching Me, 6 Feet, Die, Extacy  Honorable Mention Track : Chris Black (skit 
 I haven't read this book. I ordered it as a gift. When it arrived chapter 35 was removed and a slip of paper was inserted where the chapter should be stating, "A chapter was removed from this book because of the cost of litigation. Free speech is free as long as you have the money to defend it." If you order this book, expect to receive it without a chapter. The website doesn't say anything about this so beware. Amazon sent me another book after the first one and this one also is missing the chapter. Keep this in mind before purchasing this book 
 OK - I went into this book hoping it would be a James Michener-type epic with sweeping characters and a grand sense of the rich field of Middle Eastern history since World War II. What I got was a romance novel about 3 men's boring love lifes and their boring affairs with a little war thrown in for spice.   The book starts out well but becomes hopelessly sappy. In addition, I was irritated that the story was told exclusively from the Israeli point of view (undoubtedly since I was hoping for the more-inclusive Michener-type approach). I stopped reading about halfway through.  My grade: F 
 This book proved a great disappointment. It contains nothing new, and completely fails to interpret either Daniel or Revelation. The author comes across as blinkered, bigotted and arrogant - a self-satisfied member of the 'elite' who gives the impression he will spend eternity smirking from his guaranteed high place in heaven at the rest of us, who will presumably be burning in hell! He is mistaken in thinking Daniel and Revelation only have any meaning for the present generation - didn't they have any meaning to those for whom they were originally written? His theology appears limited and narrow-minded. Don't waste your money on this book. A more scholarly and balanced view of eschatology is given in Craig C. Hill's book 'In God's Time' 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 A couple of days ago I depressed the switch to begin toasting a piece of sliced bread, when all at once a blue flash jumped out at me, thus causing the demise of my applicance. I now realize I paid far too much for this unsafe piece of junk that lasted about two weeks short of a year 
 This classic text of the environmental movememt has influenced groups as diverse as The Nature Conservancy, Greenpeace, and Earth First!  Devall and Sessions explore the emotional and spiritual underpinnings of hamanity's  ties to the earth in this deeply philosophical work.  They link a plethora  of sources in their exploration of Deep Ecology, including numerous  religions, the words of such notables as David Brower, Aldo Leopold, and  Edward Abbey, and the perspectives of many cultures.  Despite all of this,  though, I found it somewhat lacking.  Not present is the graceful beauty of  Aldo Leopold, nor the raw passion of John Muir.  Perhaps this book might  grow dog-eared with use in the library of a Philosophy Professor or a  career activist, but I suspect that most people, like me, will find this  book a bit dull.  Call me simpleminded, but I was more deeply moved by  Leopold's heartfelt musings on the chickadee in "A Sand County  Almanac" than by Devall and Sessions' philosophical ruminations 
 This is a warning.  This is an atrocious translation and should be avoided. Hopkins, who translated this work in 1906 is either sloppy or just a poor translator.  The English is awkward, and what is most reprehensible, Hopkins just plain omits two of the most important factual items of the entire play--1) Gone is Pepel's admission that he spend time in prison because he murdered a man, and 2) and this is the most grievous of all, the fact that Actor hanged himself at the play's cnclusion (almost the last words of the play which produces an immense impoact) is also omitted.   There is no good reason other than monetary since all copywrite is probably gone for this edition, to republish it.   I learned this the hard way, using it in a class amd now have subjected my students to this particular translation.  It is a wonderful play, but this edition should be taken off the market 
 I was required to read some of this book as part of the U. of Washington's "Freshman Interest Group" program, and I find it difficult to believe that it is getting so many good reviews.  Though I'm sure Prof. Light means well, it is little more than a summary of statistics gathered during his student interviews, and many parts of the book don't even seem to be addressed to students.  The only "advice" offered is based on statistical trends from his research with the result that it is extremely vague.  Furthermore, the book is so impersonal in tone that there was nearly nothing I could relate to as an entering college student.  Some accounts of individual students' experiences are used, as well as direct quotes from the interviews, but for the most part, these are chosen just because they enthusiastically back up one of Light's points.  If these heavily sugar-coated quotes reflect the majority of the student interviews, I have a hard time believing they were very candid.  Though I don't mean to completely lambast this book, because it could be of value to college teachers or administrators, and it does have a few interesting sections, I can't imagine it actually helping very many students.  The sections on diversity, effective classes, and effective mentoring are completely useless from most students' perspective 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 The book was ok but lacked enough to keep me interested. It kept going over the same old stuff that most paintballers know allready. If yer a newbie who has money to burn and time to waste, get this book 
 Why do I call this nu-anime?  Because its like nu-metal, its watered down anime made extremely stupid and annoying to appeal to the masses, just like nu-metal.  FLCL is overrated by a bunch of fat, zit-faced goth girls in high school who can't get laid, listen to nu-metal, play DDR, hate American cartoons for no good reason, and think Hayao Miyazaki is god. Male FLCL fans are pretty much the same but 100 pounds lighter. FLCL belongs in the "nu-anime" category, along with InuYasha, the Boondocks, Samurai Deeper Kyo, and the various anime s*** thats aired on Adult Swim.  Back to the show, there's nothing special about it, its basically like Excel Saga (at least that show was funny) but extremelly stupid and annoying (like SpongeBob). You basically have this retarted alien girl who hits everything with a guitar and can't play it for s***, she "spices" up the lives of everyone in the town it takes place in. The rest of it is a bunch of retarted pop-culture references mixed with "insane" scenes and a HORRIBLE J-pop soundtrack, yet there's legions of fickle Americans who think this is genious.   If you want to watch REAL anime, not this pop garbage, watch these instead:  Akira Armitage: OAV series Ghost in the Shell Doomed Megalopolis Ninja Scroll Hellsing Steamboy Astroboy Transformers Wicked City LaBlueGirl  Watching this show doesn't make you different from the jocks or preps, it makes you retarded 
 Gets a star for pointing out that writing is scary, but has nothing to offer in terms of advice beyond "do it anyway, risk-taking is good."  So now we need a writer oriented book on risk-taking, I guess 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 Mr. Wilson.... you should be ashamed of yourself. Based on the enjoyment I derived from reading all of the "Jack" series, I ordered this rip-off. Buyers Beware 
 I wanted to like "Star Trek III," but it was bogged down by a thin plot-line, weak action, a story that was too interpersonal between the principles, over-the-top humor, some scientific/technical absurdities and weaker special effects than the two previous "Trek" movies.  A story based solely on finding Spock's body and putting the spirit back into it, is just too interpersonal and small a story for the big screen.  A big screen "Trek" movie should involve a larger set of circumstances involving Starfleet and others in the galaxy.    Scotty sabotages the Excelsior's warp engines so they wouldn't be able to pursue the Enterprise when Kirk steals it from spacedock.  Once outside spacedock, the Enterprise goes to warp one (with light streak effects very inferior to those of "The Motion Picture") from an almost standing still position.  No more having to first go from warp point one to warp point nine, before you can achieve warp one, as it was in TMP.  Welcome to the subsequent "Trek" movies where even if you're standing still, just push one button and you're off to ludicrous speed in a flash.  The Excelsior pursues and tries to go to warp drive, but konks out due to Scotty's sabotage.  It then immediately comes to a complete stop (which would not happen in space), but it first makes a sound like a car breaking down.  Oh, what a knee-slapper.  Humor in Star Trek is fine, but not spoof humor.  That should be reserved for movies like "Airplane."  And the Enterprise is being operated solely by Kirk, Scotty, McCoy, Sulu and Checkov, when it normally requires a crew complement of hundreds.  Well, I guess it was all about forgetting serious sci-fi, just do whatever you can to appeal to the casual movie goer and the non-"Trek" fan.  And the action in "Search" was few and far between.  And unlike TMP, it didn't really compensate with any kind of intellectual journey or many interesting things to look at.  Well, buy if you must, but the problems with this movie all tie in to the unfortunate direction the "Trek" movies went in after TMP.  They should've stuck with real sci-fi and exploration, which is one of the main things Star Trek is supposed to be about.             
 I don't even own this CD, and after seeing the reviews I don't want it.  90% of the "5 star" reviews are people with ONLY ONE review.  Suspicious?? Look for yourself, it's right there to see.  I have some other meditation CDs that are very repetitive, I'm not going to make the same mistake here, especially with such SHAMELESS self-promotion 
 I bought this book hoping that it would, through a good mix of principles and case studies, help me understand the private equity industry betther.  The book does not live up to these expectations.  First, it is written badly, and seems more a series of preliminary notes than a well thought out book.  Discussions are short and often repetitive.  The analytics are extremely simplistic and are essentially a regurgitation of elementary finance theory (things like valuing a company with a fixed dividend growth rate).  There is very little in them that is specific to private equity.  The book gives the reader absolutely no sense of what makes private equity different from other forms of finance, or the history and prospects of the industry.  A quick review of the bibliography suggests that most of what the author has to say is already outdated and irrelevant.  I haven't the heart to sells my (wothless) copy:  I wouldn't want someone else to waste his or her time with it (let alone his/her money)!  A much better book is Venture Capital & Private Equity by Lerner and Hardymon 
 Okay, now, for all of you who are expecting a book that teaches interesting morals and cool things in it, put this book away right now!!! Put it into a dusty corner and whenever you may catch a glimpse of it, laugh in a malicious tone because you haven't feasted your eyes on the most stupid book ever written!! This book ends with such a melancholy abruption that I thought I might be witnessing the severe chopping of a movie gone over far too many minutes. This book...is horrendous. -ANGRY READER 
 *WARNING!!! This critique contains major spoilers!*  Sometimes I wonder if I read a different book than everyone else, that just happens to have the same title.  Everybody seems to love this book, but I really hated it. The basic story idea was good enough, but the ending came off to me as a cop out because Dekker just couldn't thing of anything else to write. Also, am I the only one who noticed the big plot hole that the ending created?  The girl that turned out to be a figment of the main guy's imagination, was in earlier parts of the story, without him, conversing with other characters.  How can a figment of one man's imagination be so involved with other people?  That just really bugged me. Now on to the cheesy, cheesy, freaking cheesy dialog. My pet peeve in any book or movie is cheesy dialog. I can't stand it. First of all, let me say, I think it's wonderful that this guy doesn't use profanity. But what was with the ridiculous insults he used in place of the curse words. If you don't want to call someone a $^!/head, God bless you, but come on "toilet water," "squat."  Jerk would have worked just fine.  Or, who says that you have to use any insults at all. Bottom line, I thought this book was really stupid, and because of it, I am very hesitant to ever read anything else written by Ted Dekker.  I'll just read John Grisham, and mark over the swear words with a sharpie 
 This is a story book!  I usually give books the benefit of the doubt but this book flat out sux.  All this guy talks about is how he is some hot shot sports agent and the lessons he supposedly learned through the years.  Let me tell you something, this book got old after the 2nd chapter.  Every F'in paragraph has to do with one of his golf clients and bla bla bla.  Its ridiculous.  The title is true, they dont teach this at Harvard because they're stories of an individuals life which completely put me to sleep.  But im not going to leave without giving some positives, like saying you should check out Automatic millionaire and the 12 critical factors books.  Those are worth reading.  Peace in the middle east 
 i love danielle steel! i`ve read ALL of her books so far.but secrets was a big disappointment to me.as far as i am concerned,ms.steel tried to change her style of writing in this book more to the kind of judith krantz or jackie collins (some explicit "parts" i didn`t like at all).simply NOT the danielle steel we like. the story itselfs is ok(gives the readers some "insights" behind the scenes of hollywood)but.... some of her books i`ve read over and over again. i am not going to touch secrets for a second time,however 
 This vision of the future reminded me of common errors on physics tests where the student leaves out a variable or two and makes a wildly incorrect prediction of an object's future behavior.  People have many connections to a place, which do not depend merely on their own security or on currency fluctuations.  These emotional and cultural connections will keep people from being entirely atomized and "at-will" citizens for a long time to come.  In reading the book, by the way, the style will annoy some rewaders in that it is not written in the modern, American style where predictions would be tied back to and grounded in data and trends.  It's much more in an old fashioned English amateur gentleman scholar style where nothing is substantiated by anything and it's all sort of breezy.  Some may like that.  
 this just sucks the main person just keeps running around. He just keeps running and or walking which is controlled thru the key board.no fwd bike control,he won't peddle, but gos backwards quite well.Tryed different setups reloads and nothing worked. Atleast I bought it used and for not much money.Maybe ill find a fix and try it again later 
 'Advances in Agronomy, Volume 73', left me bewildered. Nowhere in the text did I find reference to the well-researched fact that those who practice agronomy, and who have been convicted of it, are usually recidivists who can never be rehabilitated. So therefore, how has the topic been advanced? Society should be protected from agronomists and their vile deeds. I might sound harsh, but I say that all agronomists should be locked up for life and rendered hormonally inert through the administration of impulse-destroying chemicals. 
 I bought the 3.0 Arms and Equipment Guide because of the new armor, adventuring gear, clothing table, food and drink prices table, poison table, vehicles, and creatures (mounts, pets, etc). I did not buy 3.0 Arms and Equipment Guide because I was expecting a miracle.  Good thing, too, because the book didn't provide much more than I wanted. Yes, there are hundreds of new weapons and  other random things, but everything blurs together in one run-on list. I'm not that fond of the magic weapons list, but the things I did want were there, thus I bought the book.  If you're looking for random information to throw at your DM or include in the game, this can be a helpful book. Don't buy it if you're looking for an awesome addition to your equipment and arms collection, because it probably won't help you much 
 He's The Boss. Spokeman for the underdogs and working class. Great. But it doesn't excuse the fact that he can't write a melody to save his life and he sings out of tune 
 people need to get the message and realize that commercial rap is not benificial to hiphop culture. these songs are weak, don't purchase it unless you're buying for someone you hate.. 
 This map  is a cruel $9 joke by Lonely Planet: central area only, major streets only, selected hotels only. Maps in their guidebook are superior, or simply use Google Earth 
 Sorry, but I can not recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an agile way of handling schema evolution.  To me the style of writing is boring and in no way adaptable to a real word model.  
 This book was so different from the usual NR story.  The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic.  If you want romance, skip this.  It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
 Ehrenreich and English's book has been highly influential in some feminist and New Age circles since its publication in the early 70s.  Its thesis - that the women persecuted as "witches" in the Witch Craze tended to be midwives and healers - fits neatly with some ideological views of the suppression of women and has since been seen as historical confirmation of a patriarchal desire to control science and medicine and maintain control over birth, healing and women's bodies.  As a result, their thesis has become orthodoxy in these circles and has recently been given a popular boost via Dan Brown's pseudo historical thriller, *The Da Vinci Code*.    Unfortunately, Ehrenreich and English's research was selective, incomplete and ultimately false. Their study was subjected to critical analysis in later decades and found to be deeply flawed. Ehrenrich and English had taken a few isolated cases, assumed they were the norm and then extrapolated from them to conclude that healers and midwives were a particular target of the Witch Crazes. In fact, the evidence indicates otherwise.    David Harley systematically examined the evidence in his article "Historians as Demonologists: The Myth of the Midwife-Witch" (Social History of Medicine 3 (1990), pp. 1-26.) and found that being a midwife actually *decreased* the chances of being charged with witchcraft. Many accusations of witchcraft centred on still-births and infant deaths, with the blame for these occurrences being put on the malicious magic of witches. Far from being more likely to be accused of witchcraft, midwives and village healers were more likely to be the accusers, or to be witnesses summoned to support such accusations. In *The Witch in History*, feminist historian Diane Purkiss writes "midwives were more likely to be found helping witch-hunters" than as victims of their inquiries.  As a result, this book's value lies mainly in its indication of how some early feminist views of history were marked more by ideology and enthusiasm than rigor, comprehensive analysis of the data and objective methodology.  It's value as a work of history is minimal 
 I had read the reviews about this book being a bit disturbing, but decided to give it a try anyway.  My daughter loved the pictures of Carl, but her father decided to ban it, taking it to work to share with his coworkers.  The illustrations are great, and most of the story is cute, but the baby falling two stories in the laundry chute, and falling into the fish tank were not so cute 
 I was quite disappointed by this book - its like a 19th century history with a shallow retelling of the names of Sultans, dates and major battles. I would have expected a greater analysis of the socio-cultural milieu in which the Ottoman empire arose and the institutions it spawned. I kept reading on hoping that this would follow but its really just a chronological listing of sultans, the major battles fought - if you want a political history of the empire, this may work for you. But when, why not just read the Wikipedia entry if you have no interest in the socio-political institutions.   
 Boring, outdated ex-patriate story of life in Paris between the wars, focusing on a young American actress, a psychologist Dr. Diver and his wife, an American baroness with issues.  Lots of drinking and gossip 
 I am very disappointed in this book.  I bought it specifically because I wanted to continue with Pilates even with two bulging disks.  Unfortunately, this book includes positions that my physical therapist said are most stressful on the spine.  He said never to use the "V-shape" position and that very position appears on several pages of this book.  The book includes the basic Pilates exercises that probably contributed to my back injuries in the first place.  My therapist had recommended a Pilates class taught by physical therapists.  I could not take that class and was hoping this book would be along those same lines.  It was not.  
 Don't get me wrong, this is a good band, talented musicians. I think they're trying too hard to sound "classic-rock". Every song on this album sounds exactly the same. You heard one, you heard them all. I got rid of it the next day 
 This book was good but not terrific. after reading best sellers like Why we want you to be rich by Donald TRump and God Doesn't run a $2 Shop by Sage Saint Francis i found that this book just was not in the same leauge.  This book,for me,just did not live up to my expectations of it, i mean the two books mentioned above changed my life, and actually got me the result and financial freedom i was after but they are not for everyone.  In this book I found this information to be very simple and at times misleading...at best!  I do not feel this is the authors best work, however i still believe it is a good investment and a descent place to start. 
 The collection of stories in this anthology are pitiful not horrific.  This book opens with 90 pages of an intro that provides a chronology of "events" for the genre for the year.  An absolute waste of paper and ink.  Neither interesting nor relevant to a good horror story.  Finally the book opens with the first of "The Best New Horror", a triffling werewolf story that left me wanting.  Better stories are told by 6-year olds.  But I had faith and kept reading and was further disappointed by the quality of the stories that followed.  Don't waste your time, your money or your shelf space.  This book is not worth any of them 
 This book was a big disappointment. You spend the whole book waiting for the main characters to get back together, and you don't even really like them. If you're looking for a fun chic lit book, this is not it! 
 Blowback follows very well trodden ground. A standard cop vs. serial killer movie, it sticks to the cliches of the genre.  The killer's "twist" is that he kills each victim in the style of a martyred saint, with a bible reference in a test tube placed in the mouth. Perhaps the intention is to echo other recent screen psychos like Seven's John Doe or Silence of the Lambs' Buffalo Bill. Blowback's villain is, however, like all the other characters, lacking in character depth and ultimately unconvincing.   Mark L. Lester, the director, has been a prolific producer of mediocre action movies, notably Commando and Big Trouble in Little China. Some of these can perhaps survive as late night movies to be watched over a few beers. Still, even among the lesser cop movies, there are a lot that should be seen before this one. Try Fallen or Bone Collector. Regarding the DVD, it's 3:4 format, with no features (not that you'd want them 
 Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of fiction, but regardless, good fiction is engrossing with dynamic characters and a well-told story.  With that said, Maguire has a strong command of language and is a great writer when you examine his technique.  However, I DESPISED this story...I am familiar with the original Wizard of Oz story, and the potential of turning a classic on its head was alluring to me in addition to all of the attention that the musical is getting.  In spite of my better judgment after the first 100 pages, I kept reading.  I hated this book.  It is one of the worst stories I have read in years.  I am so mad that I paid for this.  Even worse, I wish that I had not given it a chance and saved myself 400 pages of a warped, pretentious story that attempts to question the nature of good and evil.  It fails miserably 
 This movie had a lot of potential.  I did not even mind the changes in the movie from the stage production.  BUT, any one with any singing experience knows that it is IMPOSSIBLE to sings these songs without opening your mouth!  The leads are all running around singing intense songs with their mouths open a crack.  I could not enjoy this movie at all because I knew they were lip syncing.  If something like this bothers you, I would avoid this movie.  The acting definitely falls flat. 
 This magazine is chock full of supplement advertisements.  Advertisements in fashion magazines are annoying, but supplements can be unhealthy and dangerous.  These ads may have something to do with the target audience of the magazine...  It seems to be directed to women who are hard core about weightlifting and fitness, to the level of competition.  A recent article in the magazine was talking about what percentage of body fat was too low for women.  Some of the women had body fat below 10% - I'm trying to get mine below 30%.  It's just a different fitness/weightloss league completely.  I like magazines like Fitness and Shape better because it sets more reasonable goals and provides more reasonable advice.  I can substitute toast with jam for bagels with cream cheese.  I can't drink protein shakes for breakfast and lunch, eat 10 servings of protein a day, and pop potentially dangerous pills.  I am very disappointed with this magazine.. 
 We bought this item for our son's birthday. We assembled it exactly as shown in the directions.  The cars do not launch properly into the loop - we have yet to have one car make it through the entire track. Also, when you place cars to "launch" and "crash" they shoot clear across the room. One knocked our daughter in the chest!   Not worth what we spent on the item and we are finding ourselves increasingly dissappointed with Hot Wheels items. 
 This is one of the few books where I can honestly say that the movie was better...  much better.  I was not impressed with Koontz's bad guy who was not very well developed at all.  The world is not so black and white, which makes things far more interesting 
 If you are reading this book, you probably fit into one of two categories. 1. You are a local from the region surrounding Coney Island or 2. You were assigned the book as required reading from a college History class.   While Kasson has certainly done his research on his subject, he struggles at times to find a story with some drama where very little drama exists. To make things more difficult, the reader is subjected to a sort of bastardized version of early twentieth century verbage throughout the text. For example, Kasson is particularly fond of the word "gentry" and uses it and other arcane terms frequently in presenting the story. Most likely, the intent was to give the reader a sense of the period in which the story occurs. Unfortunately, the effect is confusing, dry, and alienating rather than engrossing. Kasson does sucessfully connect individuals who have their own places in history to Coney Island, which is most likely why the book is cited so frequently in other books (132 at latest count) regarding this segment of history. The book is very difficult to read cover-to- cover. It appears that the auther intended for the reader to skip back and forth throughout the text. The final pages end with a one sentence wrap up and a picture. It is almost as if the author himself lost interest in his subject and called it a day. File it somewhere between an antique store and your Grandparent's family photos. Nice for a curious Coney Island history buff. Otherwise, a pretty dull and tedious read 
 This was a terrible disappointment. DO NOT BUY IT. The tracks are clearly copied from original recordings, but a result of this is that they are almost impossible to understand. Lyrics are inaudible in places. I bought this to play for the history classes I teach but I think that this will be a bad idea. I would rather have modern performers recording the songs, as is done with music from before the phonograph. I want to hear this music, not scratchy noises 
 LIES, INC. was thoroughly distorted by the screwy editing.  Despite the declaration in the last paragraph of the AFTERWORD by Paul Williams, the insertion of 100 pages into the middle of Dick's novella, THE UNTELEPORTED MAN, couldn't be the way PKD intended.  It makes no sense as published.  The reader should skip from page 73 to page 173 and, thus, read one coherent story.  Then, as Williams fails to suggest, read the 100 page insertion (P 73 to P 172) as a second novella.  It is two books in one. Yes, there are overlapping characters in both books, but it just doesn't fly as published.  Each story has a different plot.  The broken up 100 pages of THE UNTELEPORTED MAN tells the story of ben Applebaum attempting an 18 year journey to the planet, Whalesmouth, in a regular old space ship.  Applebaum wants to prove that the one way teleporting is a phony, German scheme to start up a military force that could one day conquer earth.  The other inserted 100 pages tells the story of the same character being teleported to Whalesmouth, then shot up with a drastic hallucinogenic.  The LSD visions open up the possibility of inhabiting several gruesome paraworlds.  The theme there was to fit in or die.  There really is no coherent plot flow connecting the two stories.  The naive attempt to combine them amounted to an unforgivable distortion of both.  Someone must speak out for the deceased Dick. 
 The Down from the comforter is coming out,causing lot of discomfort and allergy...... 
 Terrible. This album is terrible. All tracks the same. Terrible take off on the song, the dance. Wow, it's so bad, don't know where to begin. Awful. Simply disgusting, this musician should play different music with his talent. Awful. Terrible. Disgusting. No musician in the world would recomend this album for anything. Disgusting. Little tinkerbell chimes in background of songs. So ridiculously bad it's not even funny. If you buy this. You just wasted some Money. needlessly. I bought it. Terrible mistake. Disgusting. might have made me laugh from stupidity if it was a little better. Terrible. Awful. Disgraceful.  WOW WHAT A STUPID C 
 Sony Disc player does not work. It won't recognize disc in player.  Currently trying to get it serviced under warranty 
 This is the sixth book in the Left Behind series. It is also the first one in the series I did not finish in one sitting. It did not flow as well as the others, so as to lend itself to a complete reading in one evening. The book also spends a lot of time re-telling what we read in previous books. I felt this time like I read half a novel.  The book starts in the thirty-eighth month into the tribulation. But most of the characters seem a little too self serving in this book. Allowing their own desires to guide their actions. Whether that desire be derived from rage, revenge, self pity, or even guilt. Rayford spends most of his time focusing on Hattie or his desire to kill the Anti-Christ. Though I do like the description of the handgun that Rayford procures. And when the time comes for the assassination, there are a few characters to chose from.   The book ends in an old time cliff hanger where you are left guessing who it is that assassinated the Anti-Christ. Stay tuned for the next volume. I have read this far, so I will finish the series. Though most people my find this book suspensful, I did not 
 In this book you'll read about a love story. Pathetic but at least a love story. You'll read about New Orleans, a nurses's life, a hit man that blunders once and again. But what about the main plot? Why everybody was interested in Karen's life? Why, you'd read about that at the last 50 pages or so. So if you only read the last pages you'll save a lot of time.  I think LH can write better than this. 
 Mckenzie, A.K.A, NO MORE FAKE REVEIWS! Is right,my dad works for Amazon too and is constantly having to talk to people on the phone about making any more reveiws. I finally stopped, i was the one who posted: SO YOU WANT TO BE A BANANA! But from doing that i got grounded for a year with NO Christmas presents 
 This book is a real shame.  So many kids, including my own, love Thomas and his friends.  But this book teaches nothing but how to lie, laugh at another's shortcomings, and foul language.  One engine tells the train cars to "shut up!" because they are picking on another engine.  That is supposed to teach a moral lesson to my children?  I don't think so.    Another disappointing note: my son received the engine named "Diesel" as a gift.  This book makes him out to be a bad engine.  How is my son supposed to feel about his gift now?  I do not recommend this book to anyone 
     If you are looking for any sort of objective presentation of Quantum Physics you've come to the wrong place.  What you will find are cherry-picked Quantum-moments of lucidity, punctuated with the wolf man's brand of metaphysical interpretation.  Unless you have a firm grasp of the concepts being presented you may find yourself easily lost in this very biased, " Physics for Nonscientists. "  I give this one star for those poor flatlanders who may never understand the pyramid, as being more than triangle or a square respectively. 
 but if they don't send you the magazine, then there are no way that you can contact the publisher about it. I didn't get the magazine after about first four issues. First, I didn't notice that I wasn't receiving my issues, but after three months, I found out and tried to contact the publisher about it. They don't have e-mail to contact them, but only automated phone number. If you call there and waste about 5 minutes to reach section "I didn't get my last issue", then you get about $.60 refund.  No further explanation or guaranty my next issues. and I'm still not getting any issues.  If you go to ripoff website, you can find the publisher was registered as ripoff company 
 "A Dour, Hectoring Treatise..." says the reviewer from Publsihers Weekly.  It is an entirely just criticism, as this is possibly the most downbeat book on achieving business success that I've ever read.  While the premise is intriguing, the actual substance of the book is pretty thin.  Yes, we know that details are important and that the little things do matter.  Yet, the author's idea of good business practice seems to be to obsessively micromanage every aspect of your business and of your employees' behavior.  Do yourself a favor and read anything by Seth Godin, instead of this condescending drivel.  Seth says, "Stop trying to be perfect and start being remarkable."  I couldn't agree more 
 I can only say that the effort was obvious but the information was hard to use.The research was solid but lacked common usage for slugs like me 
 I wish that tCoJCoLDS was as good at applying these principles as GBH is at writing them.  "He can talk the talk, but he doesn't walk the walk."  I'd be glad to provide anyone with details, andersandrobintronsen@yahoo.com  Love & Honesty are the Foundation of Christ's work here on earth, NOT endless, mindless details such as earrings, piercings/tattoos,'pretty' clothing: suits & ties, floor length dresses/skirts. It's thoughts of Kindness, Mercy & Forgiveness that count with Heavenly Father, NOT what we wear, how we look. Have a Great Day, God is Love.  
 After having bought the first edition and read numerous other Finance & Strategy texts (in addition to having graduated with an MBA in Finance), I think it's fair to say this Grinblatt book is rather superficial in its coverage of technical matters e.g. options, financial engineering etc. and poor in its treatment of real life contemporary issues e.g. M & A, bankruptcy etc. Plus I still can't see what it has got to do with Corporate Strategy. Something is still missing here....  Most of the write-up are kind of basic (i.e nothing oustanding) explanation of issues, concepts or techniques in Finance, which you can easily find in other texts with much simpler names. The title of this book is catchy but MISLEADING. Priced at $120, this is really a rip-off. I just don't understand how other commentors could give a 5-star for this "shoddy" piece of work. Reference manual for corporate boardrooms and Wall Street? Come on! You guys must be joking! No offence but is this what they'd call "cutting edge"?   Compared to classics like Copeland's "Financial Theory & Corporate Policy" or slightly less-advanced Brigham's "Intermediate Financial Management", this Grinblatt book really falls short of the standard and needs a lot of catching up to do. Hopefully, the authors will take serious note of this in their upcoming edition. Unless of course, they still want their book to be just another "appetizer" for business undergraduates....  In short, NOT worth buying. And NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER or in this case its rather appealing TITLE 
 Superheroes escaping impossible situations.  Villains dreaming up new threats.  Existing threats constantly working to get enough energy to become dangerous.  SSDD.  Pretty boring.  If not for the errant knight, this wouldn't have been worth reading 
 This flick has all the sophistication of a music video. It is basically an excuse for the director to show guys getting drunk and shooting off guns in a village in flames at night time, while Yugoslav rock music blares. The relationship between the Serb and Muslim boyhood-friends-turned-enemies should be the crux of the movie but it is never adequately explored.   It is no different than every other movie on the Bosnian war, with the exception of No Man's Land. It does not show the geopolitical situation of the time or the machinations of elites but rather assumes the bloodshed was the result of ancient or grassroots ethnic hatreds. Obviously there were "ordinary" Croatians, Serbians, and some Bosniacs involved in atrocities, but this is only part of the story.  I got the feeling that this is the kind of movie made by a director who spent the early 1990s in Germany. 
 This book has fabulous marble illustrations, but absolutely no cross-referencing so a user can look up the description of the marble pictured. The author pre-supposes you are an expert and know what marble  maker and type you are looking for. Illustrations are grouped together in  one section of the book and each is identified only by the auction number  and lot number it came from. Unfortunately, the descriptions of these  marbles are not in the same order. Descriptions are ordered by marble  manufacturer and type of marble.  Even then, the auction numbers within the  types are random.  The book is only useful if you know what kind of marble  you have and want to see what some similar marbles by the same manufacturer  sold for. It bogles the imagination to understand why any sensible editor  would not cross index this publication, so a person finding a marble they  like in the illustrations, can then go read the description. It could take  you a week to find the matching description.  The sad thing is, that data  was readily available to the author and the illustrations could have been  keyed in a day! Worst example of editorship I have ever seen! Totally  clueless! They never thought about, or cared, how a person might try to use  the book. Save your money!  I wish I had 
 Too bad the the images, film direction and photography were not on par with the music. The sound quality is outstanding, but the video is downright BAD! Many scenes were shot looking at the backs of the subject being shot. Other times I thought my TV was broke when there were many seconds of total black and no image. Worst of all was the amaturish usage of every concievable video gimmack in the book. It was hard to look at this music video for more than 15 minutes as the shots bounced around so often and never gave me a chance to settle in and enjoy the concert. Did I mention that the composition and camera angles were not well thought out either. If you are looking for a really good DVD get the WE LIVE HERE, LIVE IN JAPAN. I wish I could get my money back for this non professional attempt to record a concert. 
 Pullman has no understanding of Milton, actually he can do nothing but project his views on to Milton and Paridise Lost. This does neither he or Milton any good. I think if you want to read Milton then one should read Milton, I really think that after all these years he can stand on his own. But if you are impressed by the cover and the looks of a book, then this shallow self adualtion will do 
 Although I myself confess I am no great fan of Heinlein's, I found it hard to believe this was written by the author of "Stranger in a Strange Land" which is a masterly work. The idea behind "The Number of the  Beast" is appealing: a vast number of alternative universes, endless possibilities for exploring mysteries and opportunities for a real sense of wonder. Unfortunately this is all wasted as heinlein trawls seemingly without purpose through an interminable series of unfunny jokes and mundane inanities. For example he invents a universe just like ours except with no letter J. He indulges his predeliction for creating middle aged women referred to as "Auntie" and adopts a writing  style which actually manages to parody his own already flawed and overly jaunty mannerisms. The satire is lost in a tale that is quite simply, utterly lifeless. In short , "The Number of the Beast" is a disaster and caused me to avoid Heinlein for years until I read "Stranger in a Strange Land." Even though I don't really like his works as a whole, even I was able to recognise the extent to which he has fallen below his own standard with this trash 
 This book is offensive and you can tweak and make up numbers all you want. African-Americans have a strong tradition of passing on oral history to their children. We know the truth and our truth does not have to be  validated by anyone. Further, de facto slavery continued well after the  civil war through the use of Jim Crow, where black women were still forced  to work like slaves and were sexually exploited. We know this because our  grandmothers told us stories about being maids and nurses for white folks.  We have an up close and personal view of white folks and your revisionist  theories are not going to wipe these memories away. If you want evidence of  exploitation, just look at our skin color. We didn't get so many mulattos  and quadroons through artificial insemination. A lot of "white  folks" are mixed and they don't even know it. The ignorance in this  country is simply astounding. One can only hope that this ignorance is not  passed on to young children. I would assume that this author also believes  that that the holocaust didn't exist; the jewish survivors are just making  up a bunch of stuff. I guess being in a gas chamber and providing slave  labor was good for Germany's economy, so hey that makes it o.k., right 
 It's truly mind boggling how this book got the reputation it now has.  I finally read it after being encouraged by so many of my friends who considered it genius.  Simply put, the writing is immature and pointless, full of "craziness for its own sake" with a few lame attempts at cultural criticism thrown in to try to give it some legitimacy.  The only thing I can say for this book is that perhaps it was somewhat original when it was written, but that hardly qualifies it as great literature, or even as literature.  If it weren't so horrendously overrated and made no further pretentions than to be a mildy amusing story, it might have found a semi-respectable place in some obscure niche as comedy writing, but as it has been trumped all around as some groundbreaking example of an insightful cross-breed of journalism and literature, I can't bestow upon it any higher title than "Garbage."  I suggest reading this only in that it is necessary to understand the infantile minds that cling fervidly to its pages.  You will learn something about our culture, yes.  What you will learn is how terribly the idea of literature has been degraded that such a book could be so praised by supposedly literate people 
 This is such a waste of talent.  It was only published because Shiley Hazzard has written a better book.  The story was dull, the unkindness of the parents most unreasonable. What kind of people would ignore their children this way?  Depressing and a waste of time 
 I thought the book was a bunch of bolagna. I didnt care for it at all and someone should burn it. The only reason i liked it was because it had a bunch of short stories and not just one big book with a bunch of chapters. It had a lot of truth in it which is the only good part of the book. The book was basically about kids that dont fit in and are outsiders. Who ever get's this bpok should throw it away or tearit and burn it into peices 
 Dilvered quickly in time for Christmas. Sweatshirt was great quality 
 How could the author of so great a book as "The Company" draft such a mediocre cliche-ridden effort as this.  One reason, I submit, is that he couldn't make up his mind if he wanted to write a historical novel or a spy novel.  He had a similar dilemma in "An Agent in Place" where he couldn't decide whether he wanted to write a love story or a spy story.  "The Company" was a whole dimension above most spy novels.  "The Once and Future Spy," sadly, is simply a uninspired work. The plot was highly improbable, the characters lacked credibility, and Littell resorted to too many cheap plot tricks to speed the book along, at the cost of believeability.  Even the whole theme of "whose truth?" also is not all that unique.  Don't want to give the ending away so I won't say any more about that except that, personally, I found the ending to be highly unsatisfying. I still have a few more Littell books to read and I am hoping that I will get from them the deep pleasure I got from "The Company."  Littell's capable of much much better work than reflected in this novel.   
 are you serious?  I bought this a while ago to see if it was cool. It is a piece of junk, u can barely get any channels, and even if you do, you can barely see them and it has loud static.  dont buy it its garbage 
 We got this in lieu of another similar one because it was in stock, but lo and behold it only lasted a week. Our son lays on his back and kicks everything in his crib, so when he kicked this, the knob securing it to the crib through the strap broke off. Luckily the broken piece fell on the floor and not into his crib, where it could have posed a choking hazard! Pass on this and get a Fisher Price one - Ocean Wonders or the one we got, Flutterbye Dreams, which he loves 
 There's some interesting anecdotes in the book.  The anecdotes seem good, but when it came to the conclusion of the book, and things that I actually know about, it threw everything into doubt.  From P194: "When you download a song from eMule, you just never know- it could be fine, or it could contain a malicious virus."  This is total nonsense. Songs are data, they should not contain any executable code, and therefore it's impossible for them to contain virii.   From P200: "... The Maginot Line might have worked well in World War I, but twenty-two years later it was no match for the German army and its new weapons. The expensive, old-fashioned trench system was useless. Technology had changed the rules of warefare, and within a number of weeks the Germans had full control of France."  So this is true, but they don't mention why it's true. It's true not because the technology was bad, but because the Germans went around it.  [...]  The topics of the book are interesting, but it seems like the authors play fast-and-loose with their interpretations, instead of sticking to providing the reader with as much unbiased information as possible. 
 The sliding measuring spoons were very difficult to slide even for someone not having arthritis making this item not very user friendly. The big measurer did not easily expunge the food I was measuring and with having to grease the plunger to make it move easily added to prep and clean-up time. Liquids tended to leak. I think I am better off with a regular set of measuring cups and spoons 
 If you like the music of George Winston's earlier albums, especially the "seasons," December, Plains, Forest, Montana.....you will probably not like this one.  Unfortunately, it is nothing like his earlier works.  I would never have fallen in love with his music if it was all like Gulf Coast Blues.  This new one is way too heavy, loud, and generally abrasive.  I am very sorry to have to say these things, because I am such a big fan of his.   
 I have been a student of Dr. Palmer's at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, and while I admire his ecoanthropology teachings, this book is beyond his scope as an anthropologist. Dr. Palmer's most knowledgeable topics are those of the fishers of Maine and New Foundland. Some of Dr. Palmer's best works are those he did with his former professor and mentor, Lyle Steadman at ASU regarding folklore, mythology and ancestor teachings. If I could have previewed this work before it was published, I would have said, "Craig, stick with what you know!" His documentaion is weak at best, and some of it is truly questionable.  While I understand his logic behind this topic, I think his facts are weak. I suppose, if one were inclined, one could turn any set of numbers, statistics or facts to fit the hypothesis they have developed. I think that's what Craig and Randy Thornhill have done. Craig has written some absolutely wonderful works, however, this is not one of them.   My suggestion would be that readers find this in the library and not spend money on it, read it, then come to your own conclusions on whether or not you agree with the evolutionary basis of rape. 
 Negotiating Rationally seemes promising but falls short.  It provides food for thought on the interface between distributive and integrative bargaining and on biases that get in the way of a good solution.  But as a framework for negotiation, Negotiating Rationally is inadequate.  Getting to Yes is a far better structure and is easier to understand -- both for the novice and the experienced negotiator 
 They have nice voice but Il Divo playing too safe, it became boring after a while. I am their fan from the 1st album but now my interests are going down. Just look at their song choices. I also listened to the CD and it is a I predicted 
 The idea was good but Natasha simply didn't have the talent to put it in written and understandable text. She switches all the time the "I", got me confused about who she was talking about, her or her aunt.She mixed both stories, suddenly she wants to explains her "great destiny" (narcissism) at the same time as she tells the strory about her great aunt. Those second, third, fourth, xth brother's wife, sister, uncles, all irritating narrative. I really tried to like the story, to pick and read and just gave me headaches trying to figure it out whose story she is talking. Go back to school. I don't know how the editor accepts this kind of book to be published, need a lot of editing. Maybe someone in the publishing house is her relative. 
 This guy may be a feted author/chef/whatever but none of his recipes (the ones I have tried anyway) work.  I have a couple of his books (cake and cookie) and I intend to chuck them out.  I bake quite frequently and get it right 99% of the time including recipes from Martha Stewart, Susan Purdy, Doris Greenspan, Jim Foley...I can go on.  Have never bothered writing a review before but everyone, please don't buy his books.  And he sounds like a real prima donna.  
 I couldn't wait to get this book, but what a disappointment.  Don't expect to get clear instructions because you won't!  The diagrams and instructions are extremely vague, and you will be left up in the air as to how to complete an item, you get one tiny bit of info and you're meant to just know how to finish the thing off.  Not worth the money and if I wasn't so far away I'd return it! 
 This is another product placement by Gary Null Inc. repackaged with a new title and cover. Gary Null is a God and knows everything about everything. Gary knows what you should eat and how you should think. Ignore the fact that he owns a private multi-million dollar media, supplement and gadget company that sells nearly all what he advises to consume. No conflict there at all? Gary is a brilliant marketer and here are his tactics:  1)Create documenteries, radio shows, movies, lectures, books that strike fear into your audience so that they are in a constant buying mode. Make them fear to breath the air, to  drink the water and make them fear their enviornment in total. Claim that you are the authority and others are cranks aimed at harming you and your audience. Evoke fear, conspiracy theories at every turn, and taint the competition (mainstream medicine) as immoral, money grubbing and intentionally harm promoting.   2)Provide a catalog of products to calm the fear evoked. Have them buy costly air filtration and water systems, expensive magnetic products, costly vitamins and supplements, and provide media so that you can reinforce the fear and buying behaviour. Advocate a costly and restrictive diet that few could follow for long so that they will fall back on your food replacement and food concentrates as well as vitamins. Above all promise you base that if they follow your advice and buy the products  they will look young and live forever. Promise the suckers that they will avoid sickness and will be the chosen ones.   3) Claim you make little or no money and that the profits go into making public service movies even though you charge to view them, and even though the profit markup on vits and supplements run in the hundreds percent range. Claim that you have advanced degrees and are a scienctific authourity even though you went to nontraditional schools and could not get a degree from a legit University. Should anyone challenge you claim that they are part of a conspiracy to silence you even though that if false- it increases the your profile among followers.   
 I have the same rice cooker (except with induction heating) and wanted to purchase this item as a wedding gift.  Well, when I get this item, I notice the box seems a little less than new.  I notice that the rice measuring cup is missing, the manual is worn and there is the scent of rice in the machine.  IT WAS A USED ITEM.  Note that the item is not sealed but Amazon should have known.  Very disappointed, especially for an item this expensive 
  This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations. In that sense, it is the story of two cities - Miami and Washington - and two peoples - Americans and Cubans.    I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup.   The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. It is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book.  
 I am appalled that PC lingo has now taken over fairy tales to such an extent that we cannot even have a BEAR family.  I don't begrudge Mr. Galdone his right to re-write fairy tales, but I think a warning (in the form of a subtitle, perhaps?) would at least be appropriate.  Something like, "A new take on an old favorite" or another similar phrase.  I had one friend who bought this book thinking that it would be the traditional tale, but when he got home and opened it to read to his child, realized that he had instead picked up a PC version of the beloved story.  This version simply has three differently-sized bears living together rather than a bear family.  So parents, I would encourage you to save your money on this one and buy a nice re-telling of the story as it has been passed down through generations instead 
 I really enjoyed Jean-Claude's earlier films.  But, they keep seeming to get worse and worse.  The dude kicked like 3 times in the film.  The best part of Jean-Claude's films are the fight scenes and these sucked.  You know you are getting cheese whenever you watch any of his movies but instead of cheedar this was some moldy government crap!  I'm really hoping he'll get with Steven Segal talk about how much they both suck, watch their old movies and then go back to thier roots 
 IT was not at all what I thought it would be.  For some reason I thought it was a simple tarot deck with astrological designs on the cards.  This is much much different than that.  This is simply a deck used for astrology and I am not impressed with that.  Time consuming!!!!!!!Better left to the Very Experienced!! 
 The Claim purports to be an adaptation of Thomas Hardy's classic novel, The Mayor of Casterbridge transplanted to the Old West. The producers clearly wanted The Claim to be accepted as a literate Western and it is clear that the critics fell for it. However, as anyone who has read the original Hardy novel can tell you, the movie fails as a Hardy adaptation. Meanwhile, any fan of movie westerns can tell you that The Claim is a failure in that department as well.  The Claim begins in 1869 where Daniel Dillon (Peter Mullan) lords supreme over his company town. His gold mining company is a topflight operation. Dillon is easily one of the most admired men in California, if not in the nation. However, Dillon is not a terribly happy man. Deep down, he broods over a dark secret that, if exposed, could lead to the destruction of his reputation.  You see, the gold claim was originally made by another man, but Dillon sold his wife and daughter to the original claimant in exchange for the claim. The prospector thereupon took both wife and child to Boston and raised the family there. Meanwhile, Dillon ruthlessly exploited the gold claim to become one of the richest men in all of California. Needless to say, if it became public knowldege that Dillon's success was based on the sale of human beings, that would be nothing short of disastrous.  Matters are brought to a head when his wife (Nastassja Kinski), daughter (Milla Jovovich) and his wife's subsequent daughter with the other man (Sarah Polley) show up in town and request that he take them in as his family. Just when you think that things are going to get interesting, the rug is pulled out from the audience's feet when it is revealed that Dillon conveniently never married after making his dirty deal. This enabled him to marry his ex-wife without never having to publically admit that they were previously married or what happened to that union. This effectively removed all dramatic tension and helped make The Claim a colossal bore 
 I think this book points out a big problem with ordering a book that has no age rating.  I was very disappointed in the simplicity of the book, and also the price was too much for the contents.  I wish for a good age rating system for children's books.  If I took the time to go look at every book for children that I wanted to buy, then I would buy locally. But, that is not possible because Amazon offers a huge selection that I could never access locally.  So I suggest a better industry-wide age rating system for children's books 
 Wolf's attempt at an analogy between psychological change and his confused interpretation of physical transformation is just silly. I would recommend Satinover and McTaggart if you're interested in the new science 
 I really appreciate the thought behind this series of books but constantly find myself frustrated at the tiny amount of space given to each subject.  I always want to know more and am annoyed when that's all there is.  I would instead recommend something like "The Mammoth Book of Outrageous and Heroic Women", which gives you a one paragraph summary of each woman, but then goes on to give you another six or eight pages of detail 
 I didn't want to read a story like this.  I had hoped Pietro would regain his old powers but honestly this how House of M thing was just depressing.  While torturing fictional characters is a time honored method to build empathy, without the character showing a perserverance through hardship and traditional moral center you just get to watch a scumbag at work.  This story really makes Pietro into a scumbag.  I don't want to watch heroes become scumbags.  I wanted a story of redemption and hope not insanity and depravity.  Your mileage may vary but I thought is was bad 
 I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled "This is a racist book disguised as a work of art."  It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, "The Confessions of Nat Turner," by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.    Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married.  Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.  Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.  Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.  If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of "Confessions."  But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.  Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.  His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching 
 Ann Rule wrote the story of a young couple on a camping trip from Hell! The hero is murdered and the murderer is sexually obsessed with his sexy young wife, Joanne Lindstrom. He captures her, strips and rapes her several times over, and the poor victim is helpless in the woods and grows dependent on the evil "Red Man" She even falls in love with him, and he succeeds in planting his seed in her belly. This sounds like some wild male rape fantasy, but Ms. Rule wrote it, not I. Strange crime story, with highly explicit rape scenes. Highly recommended 
 Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star 
 WARNING: MOVIE SPOILER BELOW!!! I confess that my primary reason for buying a copy of this film, is grounded in recent history. I was around in the early 80s, when L. Ron Hubbard and his Scientologists were going full-bore with the logistics of making the book into a movie (the hero depicted on the original edition of the paperback looked like Chuck Norris, or so I thought), when all of a sudden Hubbard died, and the whole project apparently fell apart. Back then, I was close to 20 years old and I was curious about whatever it was that these Scientologists were turned on to that was supposed to help improve a person's quality of life... then I read about Larry Wollersheim's 1985 lawsuit. You can figure the rest out for yourself.  Anyhow, oh, yeah, the movie... the storyline is your basic alien invasion number, i.e., the Invaders arrived to make life miserable for the poor humans (in this film, the aliens look a lot like the Klingons from Star Trek), until your typical dashing young male hero organizes a band of his fellow humans to rise up and tell the Invaders to get off of our planet. Pretty simple and straightforward, but hey, there are other films MUCH worse than Battlefield Earth, and they've taught me that if you have good enough special effects, even the lamest sci-fi storylines can work!   The thing that stood out about this film, though, was its reliance on everyday talk and contemporary cliches for much of its dialogue, and as a result, it came across as rather corny... a film to be recommended for its comedy value, rather than for things like epic space battle scenes. Also, the "bad guy" aliens use some sort of psychic power to interfere with the minds of their human subjects, in order to keep them from organizing revolts... I must say, trying to depict mind-manipulation effects on film does pretty much the same thing to the movie as varnish stripper does when applied to a CD---it turns it into a confusing, incomprehensible mess! A couple of times, the picture would break up into a concentric blur, and I'd wonder what the heck was supposed to be going on.  How the makers of this film ever talked a great studio like Warner to help them film it, is something which will forever remain a mystery to me. I remember just before this picture opened, a group of Scientologists were trying to hype it: "oh, watch---this film is going to be bigger than Star Wars and Gone With the Wind combined!" You can guess what happened when those staggeringly huge box office numbers never materialized... can you say "oops" 
 The author obviously has never seen a public healthcare system. Healthcare research continues through private auspices in Europe, Canada and elsewhere despite public insurance coverage.   This fantasy of a totalitarian medicare state may be satisfying for the ignorant or ideologically blind, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with the way healthcare is provided in most of the world outside of the United States of America 
 Difficult to install and needs re-tightening after one or two uses. Not satisfactory 
 Match Point may offer a change of locale and style for Woody Allen but it does nothing to redress the continuing decline of his work. It's not bad, more flat, partially because of some awkward dialogue (Allen really doesn't have an ear for the British dialects, going either for Dick Van Dyke or Medieval King-speak) and some uninspiring lead performances. Social climbing tennis pro Jonathan Rhys Myers, the poor man's Jude Law, says all his lines correctly and with almost perfect diction without ever convincing there's anything but an actor who'll never fulfil his early promise underneath, but it's Scarlet Johannson who is the film's most surprising casualty as a struggling actress. Faced with such awkwardly on the nose dialogue and such a stock character, she visibly flounders for much of the first half of the film as if cast adrift by a director afraid of interfering with the actors by ever directing them no matter how apparent it is that they need help. Supporting players are mostly left to do their best with one-note parts to varying degrees of success (Matthew Goode, Ewan Bremner Alexander Armstrong), laziness (Brian Cox, Paul Kaye) and embarrassment (James Nesbitt and a startlingly inept Colin Salmon). The second half does improve, though there's the definite feeling that Allen is dodging the issue in the potentially promising but unintentionally laughable closing scenes, and some of the dialogue is painfully amateur. With its shades of A Kiss Before Dying via the Martin Landau plot strand of Crimes and Misdemeanors but without the interesting bits, this never really feels quite like a proper movie. A bit of a plodder.  
 I bought the CD on spec, figuring its The Lost Trailers...the band who'd brought me Under FM Waves, Horse, and Fire on the Pontchartrain..it HAS to be good.  I was wrong.  It sounds like the very worst of 'pop country' out there.  If you like that sort of thing, you'll enjoy this cd, if you prefer the story driven songs and interesting guitar work...save your money (( or if you are curious, you can buy my copy of the CD on ebay ) 
 James Gary Shelton is a cross between Rush Limbaugh and David Duke. Limbaugh rants about liberals; Shelton goes wild on environmentalists and biologists. David Duke isn't a racist; he just wants to clear up a few misunderstandings about non-Caucasians. Shelton respects bears; he just thinks people need to kill a lot more bears--for the good of the bears.  The Deadly Truth is long on dubious opinions, and short on credible facts. Mr. Shelton, writing from the outback of British Columbia, states that he's worked in the construction industry, as a field engineer for Crown Zellarbach Logging, and as a hunting guide. How unfortunate he didn't stick with those endeavors rather than self-publishing this nasty diatribe. When Shelton isn't bashing "radical" environmental groups run by "extremists," he pillories wildlife biologists. Shelton disagrees with biologists on most significant issues, but he doesn't bother to debate biologists on the facts pertaining to the issues. Instead, Shelton attempts to discredit biologists by arguing that their facts and statistics and degrees are irrelevant. "Many of our modern bear biologists were educated in the anti-capitalist university atmosphere of the 1970s and 1980s. Some came out of school with a burning desire to save bears at all cost and have abandoned good science for the pseudo-science of preservationist biology."  I'm sure dozens of biologists now lament their decision to earn a Ph.D. from an accredited university when they could have joined Shelton for a 1 hour class on "Bears and Good Science" at the Zellarbach Logging Institute of Higher Education.  The Deadly Truth does not include references, a bibliography, notes, or quotes from other sources. It's just page after page of Shelton's unsubstantiated opinions. There's no humor in The Deadly Truth. No joy. No passion for bears, just a passionate belief we need to kill more bears. The truculent Mr. Shelton attempts to bolster his credibility with constant references to his "research" and "studies," but he's not talking about peer-reviewed work published in the Journal of Wildlife Management. He's referring to casual conversations he's had with hunters, loggers, and disenfranchised rural residents. Evidently, Shelton believes this is good science. Here's the truth: Shelton's opinions and theories should be treated with a healthy dose of skepticism 
 I am a high school student and I am not ashamed to say that i have an affinity for children's literature, particularly english, such as Alice in  Wonderland, Harry Potter (all of them), and especially PETER PAN.  This  literature contains a magic that this author proceeds to bash at every  chance she gets.  I mean, are children supposed to read about oil spills  and war?  Preserve the magic of childhood people 
 Anyone who bashes Depeche Mode has no taste in music. In fact, anyone who likes this bullsh*t Punk music has no taste in music. DM are a classic band, and everyone has a fave DM song. Ever heard "Enjoy the Silence", "Never Let Me Down", "Personal Jesus", "Just Can't Get Enough", or "It's No Good"? Do you own Music for the Masses, Violator, and Black Celebration? If not, you can't call yourself a music fan. Manny_Moses, what's your fave DM song? Oops, Manny_Moses likes The Used. What a sh*tty druggie band.  Just buy a Depeche album. Perhaps if you own all Depeche Mode's records, might I suggest a REM album? Yes, I will. Buy REM's Monster and Automatic for the People as wel 
 I've owned both editions and I totally agree with previous reviewers about preferring the original version. The older version analyzes one book ("The Accidental Tourist") that is easy to get new or used, and won't eat too significantly into time you should be writing instead of reading. The newer version analyzes several books which starts to look more like a book on literary criticism rather than on the writing process. The original is much more process-oriented, since the goal of the reader of this specific book is to get words on the page, not just broaden the amount of novels on the shelf.   Overall, I was disappointed. I thought the newer version was long-winded with lots of unnecessary filler that hindered more than helped. Get the original. It's worth it 
 I suppose you will enjoy this if you really like Yo-Yo Ma at his most boring.  This is glorified elevator music and about as interesting 
 This story starts out pretty successfully. We are shown the life of the brothers in the abbey and their daily routines. This seems to set the tone for a dull plot. Then, the reader experiences the sickness of a brother of the abbey and the mood of the story changes from the placidity of the abbey life to the chaos of trying to help the brother. This livens the book up some, but not enough. Very few exciting events happen between that point until the death of Rhisiart. After Rhsisiart's death, we are thrown back into that state of low-action; only this time, with the added commotion of trying to figure out the murderer's identity. The ending wasn't a huge shocker. It was almost too predictable from the beginning. So, all in all, I would not recommend this book unless you wanted to be easily put to sleep 
 This book was a big disappointment. You spend the whole book waiting for the main characters to get back together, and you don't even really like them. If you're looking for a fun chic lit book, this is not it! 
  Despite the praise heaped on this text, I can't help feeling that Bernard Faure has been constructing the 'straw men' other readers have spotted. It is by no means certain that the Ch'an (Zen) tradition has functioned as Faure suggests. Why, for instance, set up the 'anti-scriptural'  argument - only to concede - on proper investigation, that it is a myth? There are enough commentaries - on the sutras, by Zen monks, to make this sort of thing seem pointless. Sorry, but lets place trust in those deluded masters of old - and stay unenlightened, Faure style. 
 Despite all the hoopla, this is a bad, bad book, which reads as if two dozen researchers had gathered every scrap of information on the first part of this century and then the most unimaginative of writers had just put  them in chronological order and called it a history 
 man that singer in this band needs to be replaced if they are ever going to be any good 
 I was very disappointed by this book and regret that I lost my purchase receipt as I am now unable to return it to the bookstore where I bought it.  I will put in on my bookshelf as a reminder to not rely on the publisher's imprint (in this case, Wiley) in choosing books to buy.  In order to find the small tidbits of potentially useful information you need to wade through pages and pages of what are, in my opinion, the worst-written technical content ever printed in the English language.  The authors apparently assumed that readers would want page after page of overly familiar text that says nothing and delivers even less.  After trying to read the first 40 to 50 pages of this book I became annoyed with the over-use of "cutesy" phrases and words that convey no meaning or content.  Are we to take seriously the "credentials" of "authors" who describe a part of the Google Analytics site as "itchy glitchy," for example?  I bought this book hoping I would obtain insights in to how to improve my company's use of Google Analytics.  Instead, I feel I wasted 30 US Dollars on a book that should, in my opinion, been either stripped of the unnecessary "cuteness" or more properly marketed as a book for people who want their intellgence insulted.  There are other resources (some, free, on the web) for people wanting to learn how to improve their use of Google Analytics.  Save yourself some money and avoid having your intellect insulted by not buying this book 
 There are so many reviews saying this is a true story I have to point out that while the war and the deployment were real (obviously), about everything else is dramatized (including the mission objectives: SCUD hunting on foot, which is a joke to anyone who knows how wars are fought today). McNab has essentially written Tom Clancy genre fiction. The book Bravo Two Zero differs in details with another book written by a second member of the patrol, Chris Ryan, called The One That Got Away. However, both are convincingly debunked by a third SAS memeber in a book called The Real Bravo Two Zero, also available on Amazon, though only the UK Amazon site (which you can still order from in the US). In it, an SAS member who can actually speak Arabic retraces the patrol using both books as guides and talks to all the people McNab and Ryan supposedly killed and gets their side of the story. Most importantly, he manages to restore, without a doubt, the reputation of Vince Phillips, blamed by Ryan for getting the patrol discovered by the Iraqis and a couple members eventually killed. Contrary to what you may expect, I would recommend seeing this, in fact I recommend getting and comparing all three books: B20, The One That Got Away, and The Real B20 
 The author thinks, acts and writes like it is 1970.  I would think that the five star reviews were from her friends and family but no one in the book liked her.  Do not waste your time or money on this  self centered idiot.  
 This movie does not adress art in any way, shape, or form.  Do not be fooled 
 Don't be seduced by Pinkermania; he's trapped in a little box and he won't be taking a look around anytime soon. Edward Oaks couldn't have said it better in his review:  http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9803/articles/oakes.htm 
 One of the most confusing things about logic and reason is that it all necessarily depends on what you mean by the words you use, which is to say... it all depends.   I note for example, in the introductory chaper, page 1, "Overgeneralization", there are a couple major overgeneralizations.  That's why they needed to invent math and science, where nothing is real except precise definitions, and logic works wonderfully.  Using reason with actual real things takes more than logic 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 Sappy, wordless music performed by an orchestra does NOT a classical piece make.  Paul McCartney has no idea of what constitutes serious "classical" music.  He doesn't understand orchestration or use of time or timbre.   I always get a kick out of pop stars who have never studied music, nor can they   read, write or understand musical composition, but still believe that they're qualified to write serious music.  Even with the Beatles, it was the more musically astute George Martin who arranged the strings on Eleanor Rigby and others.  Paul couldn't tell the difference between a French horn and a tuba.  Standing Stone sounds like bad elevator music -- good for a soundtrack to a movie, sort of like "The Family Way" music that Paul put together in the 60's.  The melodies are trite and the orchestration lacks depth.  If one does not understand how composition works, one's music can only have so musical depth.  Come to think of it, even Paul's silly love songs lack any real deep meaning.  This is pretentious crap and should have been titled Standing STONED.  
 I'm not impressed with this book.  It was written quite a while ago.  It's not as true to life as most of Heinlein's work... this is just low-brow work for him...  Don't read it.  It's not worth your time 
 This book offers no real practical advice for reader to "survive" in crazy and dysfunctional workplace. Furthermore, the writing of this book is way too PHD-alike to tie to its "light-hearted" title. I stopped reading it after 20 pages or less 
 HA. This is the most disgraceful weapon I have yet to encounter. Sure the mock suppressor and the sight and the laser are good features, but the gun is weak, and the magazine holds a meager 10 BBs. I have very high standards, and this gun met none of them. It broke within 3 weeks of purchase. But, it is a pretty good backyard gun, but it is nothing compared to the pro-level airsoft pistols. Should not be used as a side arm in pro-level airsoft battles... Good for backyard fights though 
 Blessed are the peacemakers Love thy enemies The meek will inherit the earth. It will be easier for a camel to walk thorough the eye of a needle than a rich man to get into heaven. These arent direct quotes but are some ideas expressed by Jesus Christ, the same man this hypocrite claims to follow. To say that George Bush is a faithful man is so blatantly stupid. Its sad that people in this country can be subdued into believing that this man is a Christian. It seems to me that people who claim themselves to be religious have chosen nationalism over religion. If it makes you feel better to vote for someone who has murdered thousands and thousands of people by saying he is a christian, fine, answer to it when you die 
 Very little plot, which is boring. The reader should be paid by the page, if not by the word, to read this book! 
 When a book that is so provably fictional as CROW KILLER is praised repeatedly for being "true" and "accurate," the review says more about the values and fantasies of the reader than about the book.  CROW KILLER is a vicious racist diatribe that perpetuates a comic book view of the fur trade. Johnson wasn't a "mountain man," he was one of the jackals who drifted in a generation later to pick the bones--a buffalo slaughterer and a wolf killer. And a racist among men who understood the Indians better than most.  Vardis Fisher's MOUNTAIN MAN has a good deal of racism in it, but Fisher manages to maintain a distance between his own values and those of the mountain men. He gives the Indians a chance to tell their own story, and he tempers the cultural racism of the mountain men with their firsthand knowledge of the people around them. JEREMIAH JOHNSON goes even further in that direction, and that, for one thing, is why I consider the Redford/Pollack film the best of the three works.  The Indians in Fisher and Redford's stories are real people with intelligence, courage, and a way of looking at the world that is different from ours but not inferior. In CROW KILLER, Indians are stupid, vicious (and look who's talking), subhuman. Poisoning forty Blackfeet warriors is, you see, a joke. Any REAL (that is to say, "white") man can kill them in handfuls.  Get over it. The mountain men were no more glamorous that Hell's Angels or that vicious little twerp Billy the Kid (Michael Pollard, folks, not Val Kilmer, Kris Kristoferson, or Paul Newman). They went west to get rich, just like the grubby gold-mad prospectors we don't idolize at annual "re-enactments."  They went west because they were too sociopathic to survive in civilized society, and they admired the Indians because they appeared, to the outlaw white, to be a lawless ("adulterous", as Chris Lapp says) people. And libertarians, like Fisher, worship them because they are so utterly self-absorbed, self-important, and "free" of society. And romantic city boys, their drawers damp with admiration, called their manifestation of sociopathy "freedom." Right, like the "freedom" of meth-lab enterpreneurs on their Harley vibrators.  So if you enjoy racist humor and violence, and you love perpetuating stereotypes about Indians, and you want to admire somebody who, if he really were who you think he is, would beat you to a pulp just for fun, go for it. But don't call it history, Ok? It's no more history than HUSTLER is gynecology 
 "Cursed" tried to double-dip its way into the horror genre.  First, it used Kevin Williamson ("Scream") as the writer in order to bring in some funny yet still reasonably scary plotlines.  Secondly, master horror director, Wes Craven, was brought on to guide this shipwreck along.  With both of those pieces in place, you'd think that this flick would have been pretty good.  Instead, "Cursed" managed to be neither funny NOR scary.  The story is textbook.  Siblings that don't seem to get along very well are bitten by a werewolf.  One sibling believes his fate while the other denies everything.  In the end, the one werewolf who started all of the chaos has to be destroyed in order to lift the curse.  Dull, dull, dull.  The cast was pretty atrocious.  First of all, Christina Ricci is usually a very good actress in everything she does.  In "Cursed," she's nothing more than an annoying, henpecking older sister to her brother (Jesse Eisenberg), who is the only redeeming part of this film.  He has a very Frank Whaley-like appeal to him.  (For those who don't know, Whaley is the nerdy dude in "Career Opportunities."  He has also starred in a number of other films, most notably "Swimming With Sharks."  Portia de Rossi is wasted as a two-bit gypsy ripped directly from the original "Wolf Man."  Michael Rosenbaum is sufficient as a co-worker of Ricci's, though he is capable of so much more.  Pacey, I mean Joshua Jackson, portrays Ricci's "sort of" love interest.  Essentially, though, he plays Pacey playing Pacey trying to be Pacey.  Shannon Elizabeth and Mya (why?) play short-lived werewolf food.  Scott Baio (no, really, I said Scott Baio) plays himself on the Craig Kilborn show and, ironically, Craig Kilborn plays himself as well.  If these two were brought on for star power, then the casting director must have thought the producers wanted a faded star and a third-rate late-night host.  To sum up, "Cursed" is bad.  It's not funny, not scary, just bad.  Only the special effects are reasonably good, but if you've seen "Van Helsing," then you've seen what a CGI werewolf looks like already.  Steer clear of this stinker 
 One of the best books for first course in topology. There is some weakness in the second part, but for the first course of topology this book is great. 
 I know that it takes talent to make music, and I hate to criticize any musicians because I certainly couldn't do it, but this CD was just not that good. There are some cool beats, but they're pretty forgettable. Lyrics in electronic music aren't always deep or anything, but in some cases, I think she actually was trying to make a "real song", so it was kind of sad. Her vocals are Madonna-esque, without the smooth production. Maybe she just didn't quite live up to the hype. I'm beginning to think that most female djs "make it" just because of the novelty of female djs. There was nothing to HATE, but there certainly wasn't anything to love, either 
 McMaster has taken upon himself the task of blaming the civilian leadership in the U.S. for the disaster in Vietnam.  How they misled and lied to the public and ignored the advice of the military.    That is true but his deliberate slanting of the evidence to prove his point damages what is a well-documented interesting book.  General Harkins comes off in this book as a man doing the right job but who was ignored by Lodge.  In fact, although he was ignored, Harkins clearly was pollyanish in saying things were going well when they weren't.  As the Bright Shining Lie makes clear, the countryside was falling to the Viet Cong during Diem's regieme (Harkins' time) and did not suddenly happen when Diem was overthrown as McMaster seems to indicate.    In addition, General Westmoreland continued the optimistic vein of Harkins.  He ignored the advice of his Marine commanders about sending Marines into the Khe San area and other areas the NVA and Viet Cong were strong and so suffered many losses.  Yet McMaster doesn't focus on the weakness and bad decisions of Westmoreland because the General.    The only  military member that McMaster severely criticizes is Taylor and that is because he "sold" out to McNamara. In point of fact, LeMay who comes off relatively well in this book was a nut whose preference was to bomb North Vietnam so much we could pave the entire country and then plant a victory flag.  Some victory if you kill all the people. The JCS was not united as McMaster does admit.    This book is well documented and covers a fascinating topic, the deliberate misleading of the American public in Vietname.  However, McMaster's failure to be objective dramatically weakens the book.   His criticism of McNamara and Johnson is well documented.  However, in his desire to prove his main thesis and, I suspect because of his loyalty the military, caused McMaster to gloss over the failure of the JCS and Harkins/Westmoreland, and to ignore the fact that rural Vietnam was largely lost long before Diem's overthrow.    Although not perfect, A Bright Shining Lie does a much better job of describing this sorry tale. 
 Interesting and suspect that there is only one review and of course its "raving".  This book has not merit and is not worth the time it takes to read it 
 My mother got me books every Christmas when I was growing up to encourage me to read more. She got me this novel 1 year because of the title (I'm the baby of our family) but I just didn't get it? The story was just odd but to each its own. 
 I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad.  It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were.  Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin.  The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books.  I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book.  I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo 
 DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! I WASTED 15 HOURS READING THIS HEADACHE OF A BOOK, WAITING FOR IT TO GET BETTER, GUESS WHAT, I JUST TURNED THE 400TH PAGE AND I AM STILL WAITING!! 
 I have almost all the recordings of Neil Diamond since the early 70's and to listen to this is does a poor service to the artist's career as a performer. The audio remastering is poor, the musical arrangements are even worse. Even though this is supposed to be live, make no mistake this is no "Live at the Greek" or "Hot August Night" this sounds more like elevator music. If you are an enthusiast of Neil Diamond's music and passionate performance don't dissapoint yourself with this recording 
 the first chapter was awesome... lan gearing up for a battle, there's suspense, there's a promise of action, i was excited to read more.  i'm halfway through the book now and it's been nothing since but morraine and siuan chapters... what is robert jordan's problem?  why spoil a great fantasy series with chapter after chapter of catty females, i don't understand why i still read this author 
 I read THE BEANS OF EGYPT, MAINE many years ago because it was gathering such brilliant praise.  It is an appalling book.  It is pornographic, disjointed, depressing and very, very weird.  It reads like the drivel that comes out of women's writing classes which is supposed to be so profound but is mearly the meanderings of a mind steeped in Harlequin trash.  It was written most probably on a filthy kitchen table while a pile of dishes fermented in the sink and a baby sitting in a high chair screamed his head off.    This book is not fit for the compost heap 
 I usually love Patricia Cornwell's stuff but now it seems that she is getting so far away from her main character base that it all seems strange.  I am a funny reader and when I like something I like it to seem semi familiar.  This book felt odd and I didn't finish it. sorry 
  Don't think I'm stupid or don't get the "Roaring 'Twenties"... let me just tell you why it sucks.  Here goes: first of all, everyone in the book writes poetry. I don't even know why I bring this up first, but it bugs me. It's just like everyone reflects Amory. The only good one was by his friend who sooner or later seems to be stifled of his creativity by simply hanging out with the dull Amory.  Another point I have to make is that his one little affair with this country girl is so vague and unclearly written, the only things I understood about it was her poem and a horseback ride.  Honestly, it was good in the beginning, but soon enough, it slowly fell apart. By the end it was just a chaos of words. By the end, when he climbs into a car with a big man with goggles and begins a string of vignettes about his views on society which all go nowhere, the book is just analyzations.  Well anyway, it just had a horrible impact on my life and I hated his little encounter with the man with curly feet. 
 I would love to read a neutral book on Barry Bonds, I hate cheerleader type books about players but I also hate one-sided ones as well. The only good things he really has to say about Bonds are about his baseball brain and his relationship with the famous Marge (whom he then sarcastically remarks that Bonds was only her second favorite player).  The book covers a wide variety of topics, some are puzzeling. While most of the book bashes Barry Bonds is also bashes his ex-wife for being an exotic dancer. I was pretty upset to read that, I was a fan of Pearlman but I thought he had more class then that.  This book came out right after (or because of) Game of Shadows. This book here actually praises Game of Shadows while bashing Bonds for illegal activities when 3 weeks after the book came out the writers of Book of Shadows are being subpeoned for illegally optaining information, guess that backfired Pearlman. In fact Game of Shadows may be taken off the shelves soon as well.  The book uses many annoymous sources (there is a reference sheet in the back, most of those articles all include quotes from many unidentified sources), so its really hard to take alot of the harsh quotes that Bonds says seriously because it is heresay.  The book pretty much discredits itself at the end when Pearlman proclaims that sports writers do not actually try or want to dig up dirt on people, they like to find good stories. That quote alone will have any Bonds hater rolling thier eyes at the sheer stupidity of it. Sports writing has became essectially a tabliod now. Even Skip Bayless publically admitted that most writers do that.  So once again, the biggest problem is that it fails to stay on neutral ground. This would be like writing a book about Babe Ruth and only mentioning that he beat up umpires, ran into the stands to attack people, slept with hookers, drank all the time, was mean to Lou Gherig, etc.  While that may be true it would also only tell one part of the story and would be a waste, just like this 
 This book is an attempt to stifle ministries aiming to encourage gays and lesbians to become straight. It claims that "Ex gays" do not exist and are noting but lies.  The book only gives evidence to support the author's views but conveniently leaves out material on the thousands of former gays and lesbians (including celebrities) who have renounced their homosexuality.  Actress Anne Heche is probably the most famous former lesbian today. She ended a 3 year relationship with Ellen DeGeneres and she is now married (to a man) and has a son 
 This book is very much oriented around following a certain structure. Syd focuses on describing the three act structure and how to build your screenplay in this structure. While structure definitely is a valuable element, I would not recommend anybody concentrating on it too much, cause the right structure will come in the right way for your script. Much more important elements like how to create rich characters and to enhance your story are not dealt with very much. If creative advice is given it comes across in a quite rigid way, and is lacking foundation. You really feel that Syd didn't gain his knowledge by working as a professional screenwriter, but just by analyzing them. I am missing that kind of sensitivity, creativity and flexibility in his messages to writers that would come from persons who have really written screenplays themselves. To sum it up: The book was not valuable for me, in fact it left me disappointed and a bit frustrated. Other screenwriting books on the contrary have been a very inspiring and motivating source 
 Let me start by saying that many will think this review is "not helpful" and I don't care.  Have I read this book?  No.  Did I spend the worst year of my life with Deborah Hughes-Hallet's last calc book?  Yes.  Do I feel the responsibility to tell people that that book sucked more than anything?  yes.  Do I think this book could be much different?  Nope.  Check her last book and seeing the reviews.  It is a 2 based on 46 reviews and counting.  The only reason it has a 2 star rating and that is because some people give it 5 stars,  most reviews are 1's.  Avoid this author at all costs 
 After reading the reviews of the book, I expected much more.  The e-book really just whets your appetite with generalities (e.g., about the internet or globalization) summarized from the full-text version.  One could get far more from a typical on-line article in Fortune, Business Week, etc.  The e-book version is 9 pages of about 14 font text, double-spaced.  I guess that this would calculate into about two or three pages of a regular book.  I would still like to read the full-text version but I would advise avoiding the e-book version 
 Very bad, doesn't explain the meaning of the masonry.  Do not waste your time unless your a genius about the masonry, I didn't understand anything about it and he didn't even say what they were 
 In a diatribe against overly safe first time parents, she calls a bathtub faucet cover "silly".  That's irresponsible!  The bathtub faucet is in the top 3 list of household items that cause a child to injure a tooth.  She can't stand Whole Foods or Earth Fare yet lives in Chapel Hill!  That's like a Boulderite hiking the flatirons while smoking a Camel.   She does validate the common sense mothering that most of us get after the first year, but does so while dispensing a lot of garbage! 
 I purchased these but had to return them.  while the molded strap is adjustable, it only opens up approx. 1".  The magnetic attachment worked well but if your head is 23.5" or larger around - at the eyebrows, forget it, these will not fit you 
 Michael Johnston dwells in great detail upon the most negative aspects of his assignment at Greenville High School. It's a wonder that he lasted one month with such filters for negativity. When you are trained as an educator you are expected to go forth with all of your positive energy and your motivational tools to work in your chosen environment. Nobody chained Johnston and sent him to Greenville. It was his choice. He emerges more as a self-validating mercenary than he does as an educator. He arrived in Greenville as a beneficiary instilled with tools to deal with his assignment. He had the mental capacity. He had the resourcefulness. What he lacked was the compassion to admit that even at Greenville High School the good students outnumbered the bad. I know this because I  also previously worked at Greenville High School. Many Teach For America Teachers come to the Delta and perform with astonishing results. Johnston knew before he ever arrived in Greenville that he was sent there to accept a difficult assignment that his preparation had been based upon. His book illustrates that he was a neophyte who was beaten down by his own weaknesses when he was asked to step up and perform what he was trained to do. There remains some resentment against Johnston because he chose to emphasize more negative than positive. His writing ability is on either side of the spectrum as far as ability. There are moments of inspiration and there are moments of a lost child who is frustrated because he is unsure of how to step up as a teacher. It is truly disappointing that Johnston neglected to even mention so many of the good things about Greenville High and how he had so many opporunities to be more of a positive influence than he was. Johnston also departed soon after his obligation was complete. In any community there are negatives and positives. Drugs and violence can be found in any community if you look far enough. Even the most affluent schools have violence. Colorado, California, Florida, Kentucky and Washington are the proof of that. One can only hope that Johnston is now preparing educators and not another self-validating mercenary 
 I found any plot disrupted by the author's silly use of the term "mon". I believe he used it to give us an insight into Jamaican culture :=). Sam Tucker's use of the words "Boy" and "Son" are also very amateurish 
 I have been searching all over to find the book that was my favorite as a child, and am greatly saddened that it has been replaced by this version which is text heavy and watered down to be somehow politically correct (according to some other reviews).  The original was a long horizontal, though not too large book.   I can remember the drawings vividly, of the little obstinate boy out in the distance, with the sea life spewn about on the ocean floor and the first brother's cheeks full with the ocean water, about to burst.  This scene alone taught me that going against your word brings your own demise.  I remember the picture of the brother with the long legs, drawn as a center fold that you could hold vertically to see how long his legs were.  This was a favorite book of my generation who were children of the violent 60s.   REM turned it into a song it was so popular.  The new version is watered down visually, most likely due to the contemporary belief that children should be protected from death, although I am sure the current version still gets the message through about justice.  In the times we live in, I believe children are more sophisticated about reality.  To me the reinvention of this story is like ripping down an historic building to replace it with boring row houses.  Where is the old book?  .. 
 This movie was kind of disapointing to me. I thought it could've been a lot funnier than it was. The performance of Britnay Murphy was okay, she could've been better. The Performance of Dakota Fanning was ecxellent it was so good. She's a good child Actress. One of the best i've ever seen. The story of the movie was okay, it was slow and boring. thats why i didn't like it.  Plot. Molly(Murphy) is a daughter of a dead rock star who is living of his fortune, one day her accountant runs away with the money and there is only one thing she can do, and have never done. Get A Job. This would bee a new experince for her. She becomes a nanny of a Spoild brat named Ray(Fanning) who thinks the whole world Is A Germ Infested place. There is only one thing diffrent between the two. Molly is 23 and acts like a kid, Ray is 10 and acts like an adult. Can ray show molly how to become an adult?  If you liked this movie check out the soundtrack 
 I thought this book was HORRIBLE.  I didn't even finish it and can not recommend this book at all 
 A pharmaceutical representative recommended this book to me as I'm pursuing a job in this industry.  The author indicates that she worked first as a representative and later as a recruiter.  Her writing maintains the condescending attitude so prevalant among the people that work for these companies. Ms. Kerzic actually suggests that I should buy a good pair of shoes and a nice suit to interview in.  Is she kidding? In my industry you either wear the best suit and shoes that you can afford or you'll quickly be out of a job. Does she honestly believe a reader would show up wearing shorts and a tanktop? Other useful tidbits include phrases like, "don't waste my time". Sorry Ms. Kerzic, but if I decide to show up for an interview, apply for a job, or send you a resume',  it is OUR time.  Mine is just as important as yours.  She throws in a few hints on resume' building, but I've found much better formats that have resulted in interviews by consulting my local library. On the other hand, I will utilize some of her advice in writing my review of her book.  If you're considering buying this book, don't waste your time OR your money 
 B Grade movie, really poor script. Bulk of movie is boring, superficial, stereotypical. Real purpose of movie is Baptist condemnation of the supernatural.  Story line. The wife of a couple deeply in love dies in a boating accident during a beachhouse visit. The husband feels a deep loss for two years during which he is frequently visited by the ghost of the wife. On the second anniversary of the accident relatives and friends gather at the beachhouse and push the husband to come to grips with his grief and refocus his energy to move on with his life.  Overtones. The leading man is depicted as unstable, self-centered, reckless, irresponsible, and fantasy-prone.before and during the two year period. When revealed to the those assembled, the spirit contact with his wife is universally condemned. His "giving up the ghost" is seen as a great relief and the first sign of maturity he has displayed in his life.  The daughter has dream sequence with the mother in which the mother coaxes her into a head-on crash with a car.leaving her frightened and distraught.  Media Messages. The film illustrates the creation and reinforcement of a cultural taboo. 1. Spirit contact is dangerous, selfish, and emotionally unhealthy. 2. The personal grieving journey of another should be co-opted by peers. 3. Condemnation is the only acceptable response to spirit contact. There should be no expression of curiosity or investigation like "What did she look like?" "What kinds of things did she say?" 4. Messages from loved ones in dreams should not be trusted. In short the movie creates a set of automatic responses all of which mitigate against a common sense acceptance and appreciation of the value of spirit contact with loved ones.. In life our conduct is about building bonds of love and trust with those around us. In passing over these ties endure and can be building blocks for a link to the beyond. When William Blake's brother passed, he appeared and taught the skill engraving thus providing humanity for centuries thereafter with icons known to all. Many near-death experiencers have wisely learned that they must keep their wisdom to themselves. The inner teachings are sacred and must not be diluted and defiled by small minds. The same is true for after-death communications largely because of media images that create a cultural storyline like that in this film 
 Must have firewire AC wall charger and/or six-pin firewire on computer to charge this unit.  I have neither.   Also found 30g vidpod didn't fit properly in plastic sleeves and the dock connector seemed to want to unseat it as well. Returned unit to shop and purchased Belkin 4 x AA battery unit with suction cups.  Much better.  You can use rechargeable batteries or simply buy them when needed 
 This book is nonsense. Looking for something to help, but this is not about romance it is about witchcraft and self indulgence 
 I haven't done this in awhile, but I don't think I could review this piece any better than the other reviews I've read about it. It's pretty average, however filled with nice bits of knowledge. They didn't seem well-researched in some areas. Here are the interesting parts of reviews from the other "critics" that I agree with...  "they go into lengthy history lessons about the origins of the characters when two sentences...would be enough." - John Gallant  "Biased against superheros(sic)" - Christopher Ritter  "I found this book to be tedious, lacking in charm, badly researched and wildy inaccurate in some areas." - C.P. Halliday  "I picked up this book." - Lawrance M. Bernabo  "Their belief seems to be that Donald Duck was the best comic book ever..." - M.G. Bloedorn  "Pretty boring." - BernardZ  "...a black hole is hypothesized, lending a faint respectability to the premise behind Green Lantern's abilities." - Peter Vinton Jr.  "...this book will not satisfy full on fans..." - James N. Simpson <---gave it five stars.  "a chance to laugh about the heroes I still love and that mean so much to me." - Reviewer  "Man, there's a whole 200 pages of this pooh-poohing, cranky-old-maid kind of stuff!" - Mark Alfred  "They were even putting words into C. Darwin's mouth." - Aaron Spriggs  "Mildly entertaining but not great" - Reviewer  "When the man (Dean Koontz in this case) writing the introduction says he doesn't read comics, I began to get worried." - Ivan A. Wolfe  "I agree with an earlier poster." - Reviewer  "Almost every chapter tells you why the superhero is impossible." Plastic Larry  "the authors give us a more plausible (given what we know now) origin for the Hulk, involving steroids and fluorescent gene modification." - J. Draper Carlson  "this book is not mean spirited or nasty." Reviewer  "Superman's powers break the laws of science. Ooh. Stop the presses." - [...]  "interesting." - Rick Hunter  "The Science of Superheroes," - Reviewer 
 In a nutshell: Don't waste your money on this version.  The original version of this translation dates to just after the turn of the century, but the introduction and further editing by Anatol Rapaport (a biologist and a musician, not a political scientist or historian), make this a clumsy read at best and downright misleading at worst.  Rapaport, for being an editor of Clausewitz, was not a believer in the trinitarian system (primordial violence, non-rational actions, and rationality)- probably not a good choice for a work which owes as much as it does to the first and second Trinities (army, people, and government).  If this is the only one you can get, then live with it.  The first chance you get, get the much clearer, much more straightforward Paret/Howard translation, which is the one that's actually taught at most service schools as well as in universities in their courses that use it 
 I was required to get this book for my CS344 class and so far I don't like this book at all. The exercises at the end of each chapter aren't good problems. Don't get it unless, like me, you have to 
  I was not all that crazy about Alanis's Jagged Little Pill when it was all the rage.  Then came Sheryl Crow's whinning about how "Everyday Is A Winding Road" and how her man done bring her "Anything But Down".  And Alanis's JLP album was  rendered a better listen than Crow's cry-baby singing.   I enjoyed Crow's "All I Wanna Do" and she, again suprised me with her doing of "The First Cut Is The Deepest" and I wish she would stay within those boundries in her singing because she is enjoyable that way.  
 I found the characters to be mostly caricatures; there's no sense that any of them are actual human beings. As a result, there's no change -they're static, and whatever changes they supposedly go through feel completely unbelievable. And while much of the book focuses on how different classes don't truly see each other, Forster commits that same sin himself by ignoring the poorest family in the book, the Basts. Instead of making them seem real, he reduces them to mere plot devices.  In addition, Forster, a product of his time, is given to making sweeping pronouncements about the human race. Again, if he intended some irony here (as, for example, Jane Austen, who was so good at shading her prose with those kinds of hints), I'd think better of this book. Novels typically rely on either a solid plot (i.e., the stuff that's happening) or on solid characters (i.e., the stuff that happens in people's inner lives) or both to carry the reader through. I found neither here. At the very least I would like to feel the author's genuine love of language; I can forgive a bad book if it's exceptionally written. I didn't find that kind of prose here. You can skip a good third of the pages and lose nothing 
 Not being Wiccan myself, I perhaps would have found Ms. Lipp's writing to be more personally resonating if I followed her path.  However, there was an essential problem to this book that prevented me from taking what she said to heart.  Certainly she gives "reasons" for her arguments, such as mentioning that perhaps the Gods would be displeased with merely tealights as representations of the elements-- but is this really a reason?  There are equally good arguments for any arrangement of symbols in ritual.    Logical fallacies and narrow-minded assumptions aboud.  This text was not for me 
 Dr. Polchinski may know a lot on string theory but he doesn't know that much on how to write a book. I have been struggling with this book trying to learn string theory and it has been a total failure. You may think it's me but is not. I have studied chapters 1 to 4. I will announce some of its bad features: 1-The notation is awful specially on chapter 2 when he defines the infinitesimal variation of a physical quantity in a very complicated way, all formulas are presented in terms of awful excesively complicated expresions that make you feel sick (and I'm not joking), also on chapter two he defines a way for applying Wicks theorem (eq.(2.2.7)) using exponential operators but I finally gave up and did it my way for calculating expression (2.2.13). 2-Many of the results are not derived and trying to understand what happen from line to line is, besides being a mystery, in my opinion hard to say the less. 3- On chapter 3 I liked the way he calculates de Faddeev Popov determinant in terms of ghosts and you begin to hope that the book is finally going to start getting better but is not, on page 102 and 'till the end of the chapter (page 118) he starts just throwing a lot of equations that you just can't understand where they came from, specially page 105 where he uses the geodesic distance to higher orders but never explains nor show what this expressions are nor what approximations he is doing, nor where they came from. Then again on page 107 he gives a relation between operators regularized by dimensional regularization and by 'polchinski' regularization, at least the second one is defined but the other is not (on curved space)and he just shows some awful equations that no one knows where they come from. This book has been written for someone who already knows a lot on string theory but it is not for someone who is trying to learn string theory for the first time. All in all try instead the classic book by Green Schwarz and Witten or the one by Theisen and this one use it only as a reference. 
 get loved by few hated by many cause this is exactly the same cd 
 This review is not a review of the book (which, I guess, serves it's purpose just fine), but a review of the price. $70 for a spiral-bound book!?!?!?! As if college isn't expensive enough already 
  Terrible and boring In this book Mo'nique does exactlly what she says she hates sterotypes.In the book she blames skinny women for everything.This book is a ego bashing boost.I am a big girl and I found this book a Big Bore 
 Not only is the plot pretty weak, but the writing style is very unlike the older "Cat Who" books. In fact, it doesn't sound like the "voice" of Lilian Jackson Braun at all. In the past I don't recall every other sentence ending with an explanation mark. Nor do I ever recall so many extraneous characters being introduced to readers with no apparent contribution to the plot. In some cases it looks like the copy editor was asleep. Examples: on p. 131, "During Polly's absence, Qwilleran had plenty of dinner invitations" and again, on  p. 140 "During Polly's absence, Qwilleran received many invitations to dinner." I'm disappointed.. 
 I read this book after being enchanted by the Accidental Tourist and other  of Anne Tyler's books.  This book deals with the life of a depressed  teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you, I would not  recommend reading it.  On the up side, it's really short so you can get  through it rather quickly.  I was hoping to read a good book, but only felt  worse after finishing this one 
 I have a hard time understanding what it is that I dislike about the novel. I dislike it almost as much as the movie. I have been a loyal follower of Smiley and some more after that. Once the Cold War was over, JlC had to look for a new realm. I tried to follow him, but gave up with the Kaukasian troubles, forgot the name of the book. Maybe it is this: JlC's trade mark, his USP, is the evilness of the other side. With the KGB & Co., that worked perfectly. His readers were willing to stay with him and believe him. Now he is transferring the KGB style to all sorts of other badies. I think it does not work any more. It is not that I trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated. I do not. What I do not like, I guess, is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies. Tess in this story seems to be the normal do-gooder who falls foul with the baddies. That is more ok in the book than in the movie. (There, for my eyes, Rachel Weisz does herself discredit.) What is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way. JlC gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations 
 I failed to realize that this was a book "edited" by as opposed to written "by" David Sedaris until his introduction. Incidentally, the introduction was the only portion of the book that I actually enjoyed. His analogy about his favorite song in middle school is not accurate in that his classmates did not have to  pay to learn his affinity towards what may have been a bad song. I do not find it endearing that he does not care what others think of his tastes.  I do not think they were bad stories. Actually, I would like to take that back, if entertainment is a measure of quality to me they were bad. It was, however, impressive how one of the writers was able to use most of the GRE vocabulary words in one short story.   I will not stop buying the books that David Sedaris authors, I will just be more careful. David Sedaris is a brilliant writer/storyteller. He may not capture all or even any of the elements of a "good" short story; I would not know an element of a good short story if I ran into one coming off the elevator. I do know that David Sedaris' stories are excellent in that they are entertaining and make no pretense of intellectualism. I can not wait for the next book he actually writes 
  The thesis of this book is that the 9-11-01 terrorist attacks wouldn't have happened if it weren't for Bill Clinton's mistakes. That is incorrect. The 9-11-01 terrorist attacks wouldn't have happened if it weren't for G.W. Bush's mistakes. 9-11 could have easily been prevented. The CIA and the FBI were giving Bush thorough warnings about how Bin Laden was a potential threat to the U.S. and the White House had documents that plainly stated "Bin Laden determined to attack in the U.S." Bush was on vacation the whole time that he could've been looking into that. Instead, he decided he would rather be out golfing and fishing than preventing an assault on American soil. Condoleeza Rice, the then national security advisor, now Secretary of State, committed perjury at the 9-11 Commission by saying under oath that the documents said that Bin Laden was not determined to attack in the U.S. When in fact the documents said the exact opposite.   I do not recommend this book.    
 I only give it 2 stars for the shower scene with the Twins. Really bad acting and plot that makes little sense. Trying to be like the original movie but falls way short. Its just bad acting with stupid and mean characters. Not worth it except for the brief shower scene. 
 After listening to the previews of some of the songs on this website I have deemed this album "bad" or "not fly". I suggest you spend your money on arcade games or fountain soda at the mall. Or if you do buy it, spend your remaining change on some glue so you can at least listen to it higher than a kite 
 My daughter brought this book home from the school library and started to read it aloud. I was appalled at the first sentence. "Jim's dog got killed by the garbage truck". Of course, that immediately caught my attention. I wasn't sure she was making up the sentence! I thought WOW. I didn't think it was at all appropriate for a first grader in general. This book should be used for a very specific purpose. Perhaps maybe if the first grader was in a situation where their pet died but not for leisure reading at all. The book's characters display isolation and aggression; verbal and physical. I considered the entire content of the book very inappropriate 
 You should only buy this book if you're actually hoping for a far-left opinion piece rather than a book on U.S. history.  I expect some bias to seep through in a history book - we are all human beings and we all process information through our personal filters despite our best efforts at objectivity.  But a historian should make an effort at objectivity. I bought the book in hopes of filling in gaps that I have in my knowledge of U.S. history but I felt so manipulated by the author's deliberate leanings when I read about incidents that were familiar that I felt I couldn't trust him on his coverage of facts that were unfamiliar.  Moreover, I was very confused by events he chose to cover versus events he chose not to cover.  For example, he devotes almost half a page to Muhammad Ali, but does not mention Jesse Owens at all.  Ali was certainly famous and was a fantastic boxer, but I'm not sure how he affected U.S. history one way or the other.  Jesse Owens on the other hand affected with his athletic abilities not only U.S. history but world history, proving to the world on Hitler's own turf that Nazi theories on race were absolute lies.  He states that during WWII, the U.S. downplayed the horror of the Holocaust (which is certainly true), but never once mentions the U.S. relationship with Israel.  In fact, he never mentions Israel at all.  He does not mention that the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan or President Carter's response to the invasion.  At the end of the book, the author lists "ten inventions that changed life as we know it," and he lists things like the safety pin, the remote control, the brassiere, and post-it notes, but not inventions such as the lightbulb, the telephone, the airplane.  A blatant example of the author's political bias is his coverage of Reagan's presidency.  According to the author, the only people who voted for President Reagan were racists, money-grubbers and far-right Christians.  He never mentions Reagan's anti-Communist stance, nor does he mention that Reagan won by two landslide elections or the unprecedented number of Democrats who voted for him.  He never mentions Reagan's meeting with Gorbachev at Reykjavik, the "tear down this wall" speech, the treaties he reached with Gorbachev to reduce arms, or the fact that many credit him with winning the Cold War.  Whatever you think of these events, you cannot omit them from coverage on Reagan's presidency and be considered a serious historian.  (The author does however describe Gorbachev as "a remarkable man.")  I am certain that the author loves history and knows a great deal about it, but his talents would be put to better use in political campaign management 
 This item was working fine for about one month.  Then it stopped functioning.  My computer (and several others I tried as a "double check") could no longer read from the device.  Very disappointing 
 This is the grossest blob of sugary water ever to touch my lips! How could you make ice cream taste so rotten? Bat barf I say!! Even if it was good, it is much too great of a hassle! It took my Dad over 2 hours to put together, and what did we get?! A tablespoon of milky water with sprinkles on top! I got this hunk of junk 2 years ago, Christmas. It has gathered dust on my shelf ever since!      
 This series is the worse batch of nonsensical brutality I have ever come across. The writing is poor and the theme (such as it is) is unbelievable. A complete waste of time and money. I did not pass the books along, I deposited them in the garbage can.  Advice to the author: Go back to writing school 
 This relauch disappointed me mostly because of the art.  I don't believe Kitson draws these characters as teenagers (which is pretty important).  The characters look like adults (and pretty generic ones at that) and don't convey the spark of youth or energy that I  would think would be so vital for a book about teenage superheroes in the future.  Waid's updates to the setup behind The Legion are for the most part improvements that expand and deepen the future environment and worlds represented; however, I feel the art hinders the book enough to make these enhancements incidental 
 I have enjoyed the Hemlock Falls mysteries, however this effort doesn't live up to them. The language is stilted and pretentious, the characters are all rather pompus except for the two veterinary assistants who are always fighting, but you never are quite sure why. The story takes many twists and turns and was sometimes difficult to follow. Perhaps if the reader was very familiar with the venue, ie: the 'horse competition scene', the story would be more interesting. For me, it just didn't make the grade. 
 Well, I read this "gem" because my 8th grader had to for class. Was the pig-rape scene or the graphic butchery of a beloved pet the most disgusting part?  I guess it's supposed to show  historical life in rural Vermont but I sure could have lived without it.  "Becoming a Man"?? There are far better books out there than this that can fit that bill. Long before my daughter remembers any "lessons" of this book, I'm sure the lingering descriptions of the rivers of blood and stench will stick with her. Plus, inbetween the great lessons we got about pig farming/butchery it's a pretty dull story. 
 I have three bathrooms used by two teenagers and their friends, a toddler and her friends and so they need heavy duty cleaning every week. A neighbour suggested the Mr Clean to me saying it really cut down on her cleaning time and she didn't have to wreck her back scrubbing the tub.  I am disappointed with it. The one thing I did like was the pole. I was able to scrub the tub, the tile on the walls without needing to overreach. That said, I really had to scrub hard to get the grime off the tub, and still couldn't get it all until I used my regular scrub brush. I think I was expecting this to be a way that I could do a lighter clean in between the heavy duty ones but obviously not so. The other thing that bothered me was that you have to RINSE off the stuff after you scrub; from watching the commercial I feel misled because you get the impression that you just scrub and you're done. At least it wasn't that spendy so I don't feel too bad about the wasted money 
 Poorly organized, verbose writing style and most of all lacking in basic communications skills.  I'm not sure how an editor let this thing get published.  It contained virtually nothing I found useful and ranks as the worst golf instruction book I've ever read 
      As I started to read this book I got a sense that it was not going to be the thrilling adventure that I usually look for in a book. This was okay because sometimes you need a book that can slow it down and you can relax with. I am sorry to report that this book was so slow it almost came to a stop. Although it is a story of a girl who moves from her farm home to a small town to live with her aunts nothing more exciting than Rebecca selling enough soap to get a lamp for some friends that aren't very well off happens. While it is a great thing to see family helping family to get an education, something more adventurous like a love interest, or a friend saving her best and most loved toy from the clutches of a wicked aunt could spice up a story. Maybe I am a reader who is not excited by someone learning to sew and this kind of book is your cup of tea but it is not mine.  In my opinion the lack of substanance is almost suffocating and I will not be drowned by another reading of this book. 
 This book is terrible!  There are so many mistakes in this book, I don't even know where to start.  The family tree is so complex, that not even the author seems to have been able to keep it straight.  In addition the plot takes so many twists and turns and so many of them dead end that it is hard work keeping the story straight.  And the ending is predictable.  A character ("Ashely") identified as Odile's grandson on the family tree is called a great-grandson in the text.  The novel describes events that take place in 1999, yet Odile's birthdate is given as 1918, when the characters are supposed to be coming together to celebrate her eighteth birthday.  And when a character talks about an event in the 60's, she describes it as almost thirty years ago?  Last time I checked, that should be almost forty!!! In addition Henry's son is named Harry Jr.  Aren't Henry and Harry different names?  How did he (Harry) get to be a Jr. I couldn't put this book down - mainly because I wanted to see what would be wrong next. These errors bothered me so much, I got up to write a review at midnight - and I've never written a review before 
 I hate to complain too much since this is a pretty cheap item, but just to warn others - I bought this because I wanted an ab bench.  It really doesn't suit that purpose too well since it was one incline position only for abs - the other positions are just back support for working with dumbells.  The ab position is pretty weak and doesn't really work your abs as well as an abs only bench would have, plus it is a bit uncomfortable and as the other reviewer said, if you are anywhere near 6 ft tall or over, get something else.  Combined with shipping - this is a waste of almost 100 bucks here - while usable, it really won't make an impact on your workouts.  I did a few sets of situps and really don't feel the tightness I would have if I used a real bench or even just sat on the floor for that matter.  If you're on a budget, this may work if you put something under the front base to put it on a greater incline and/or do situps holding weights - and make sure you pad it with a blanket or something - the position is just too awkard.  The fact that it's a multipurpose bench takes away from it as an effective ab bench - real ab benches are ONE smooth incline, not a perpendicular seat that bends down halfway which really stretches your back a bit too much in a direction it's not supposed to bend LOL 
 Maybe I should have known better, but hokey and horrible do not have to be the same. This is a four dollar movie in any department store 
 I felt this was a highly disappointing and unsatisfactory book about an 8-year-old child who has autism. Kristy, the 13-year-old protagonist in this story baby sits Susan, whose autism is so severe that she does not communicate meaningfully. She has an extraordinary gift for music and can reproduce any song she hears on the piano. She does not play or interact with others.   Other kids soon learn of Susan's musical prowess and charge admission to hear her play. They exploit her talents until Kristy intervenes. Susan can also provide any given date and her mother explains that Susan once saw a perpetual calendar which sparked this interest.   Parts of the book reflected antiquated attitudes and misperceptions about autism. Kristy looks the word up in the dictionary and the definition provided was that it is a form of schizophrenia or withdrawal from reality. Autism is NOT schizophrenia and people with autism don't necessarily "withdraw from reality." Indeed, people with autism often feel bombarded with outside stimuli and develop coping mechanisms to "come even," that is to tone down the sensory onslaught that is so much a part of the autism experience. Suggesting that autism is in any way, shape and form related to schizophrenia has proved very costly to people with autism. Sadly, this kind of thing has caused many people with autism to be misdiagnosed. This in turn has led to many inappropriate treatments and placements being inflicted on people with autism! This kind of thing does not help anybody and has harmed many.   This book is not meant to be a diagnostic tool, but I wish autism had been defined in a more accurate way.  Rest assured, autism is NOT a disease but a neurobiological condition that affects sensory integration and communication based on the individual.  I for one am good and tired of seeing characters with autism being portrayed as having savant abilities. That only applies to roughly less than 10% of the autistic population and I can't help but wonder if this story just reinforces those stereotypes of people with autism to the neurotypical population. Same old tired tune, just a different performer.   To the author's credit, no promises are made. Susan is by the close of the story enrolled in a residential program for autistic children. I did feel the story was extremely weak. I also wondered why Susan was sent to a residential school as opposed to a day program in her area.   Read Ann M. Martin's "Inside Out" instead. That is a much better book by this author about a child who has autism.  At least James is a Beatles' fan 
 I have watched all of Jack Black's films and I have found this one to be his worst. My Wife and I couldn't keep from sleeping through it. I will admit that there were some silly parts and somewhat funny parts, but for the most part we had to force ourselves to laugh at this ridiculous movie. I'll more cautious before I rent another Jack Black movie. I hope this doesn't ruin his career 
 If you have children that are five years & younger, this would be a good album to put in your child's boom box or get it in cassette for their tape player.  but if your children are six and up.  Your better off finding the real songs and burning them if you can find these songs.  This album should be saved strictly for the poor folks who wnat music for their kids but cannot afford it.  This ablum would be number 1 if it were sold in Rwanda, Sudan or other third world nations since it could be sold for like dirt cheap.  Parents, if you buy this album, after your children turn 6 years old.  pack this CD and other Ki8dz Bop CD's and send them to Africa.  This is Pop music for impoverished folks 
 Said's book has, sadly, been hugely influential on thousands of university students, their professors, and many living in the islamic world.  His book should not be read without concurrently reading Ibn Warraq's critique _Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism_.  Said lays the blame for nearly everything wrong in the islamic world  at the feet of the West, and thus helped entrench the culture of victimhood that feeds into suicide bombings and riots against political cartoons.  By authorin this book, Said confirmed his place in History as an irresponsible poseur in scholarly trappings 
 Poor lady, in our house, sits relegated to the corner of the play room.  For some reason, this is not one of my son's favorite engines...he has so many to pick from, and she never gets chosen to haul the other coaches... 
 This book is so poorly written it's actually funny. Cook's verbose, pointless descriptions, his banal, clumsy dialogue, and his generally tactless, maladroit writing makes reading this book a complete waste of time. The story? It doesn't matter because Cook's ineptitude as a writer completely overshadows any merits it may have. If you consider yourself intelligent, you should not even open this book 
 This book's story AND title is a ripoff of the TERRIBLE and RIDICULOUS script the character of Donald Kaufman writes in that movie.  It is unbelievable that this guy seriously wrote the same story and that so many people are taking him and it so seriously.  It's like Metallica releasing their black album.  Hadn't they seen "This is Spinal Tap"  
 I'll admit this book is for younger kids, but I have to say that it was not very good at all.  Even when I read it for the first time when I was ten years old I didn't think it was very good.  The characters are all faceless and boring, except for Han who is  hugely exaggerated.  The writing is also boring and unimaginative, and very undiscriptive.  Children ten and under probably won't care, but adults and older kids such as myself should stick with Young Jedi Knights, and some of the adult novels 
 This soundtrack released does not do the soundtrack of the movie justice. There are too many terrific songs missing. Who needs the instrumental stuff. We want the real songs with vocal artists. If a  sample is good enough for you then this will do. It is not for me 
 The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again. 
 I wonder whether Terry Goodkind has fallen into the Anne Rice and JK Rowling trap of selling so many books that editors don't dare to interfere with them anymore. Any sane editor would have told Terry Goodkind to cut about 200 pages of this novel. Cutting the endless speeches and repetition of the same points over and over again might have helped make this book somewhat up to the standards Mr. Goodkind has set by the previous books of the series (except Pillars of Creation, which, frankly, I skipped). The narrative is long-winded, the endless exposition is tiring and the repetition of Richard's - questionable - moral lesson at every given chance sinks the book in a quagmire of all talk and no action. The plot is ridiculous, and the final resolution cheap and lazy.  I must confess I'm growing tired of the way Goodkind writes Richard and Kahlan. He underuses the latter and makes the former into a terribly boring stiff. Where's the spark?  Somehow the air's gone out of Sword of Truth somewhere in the second half of Faith of the Fallen, and I only hope Goodkind will get it back to finish off the series as strongly as it's started. 
 While I adore YA novels about queer kids, this one left me a little underwhelmed.  I was just never convinced that Lissa and Kate were real people --- the character development was nil.  I also didn't believe that they actually felt something for one another --- it was kind of like a romantic comedy with Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, where all of the ingredients for a romantic comedy are there, but there's just no chemistry; it's not convincing.  For a really good read, rely on the old classic Annie On My Mind --- a book which I still practically keep under my pillow, and which convinced my mom (!) that maybe, maybe this lesbian thing was OK 
 The last reviwer is a bit daft. In some 70 years of reading History I have never read such lies, distortions, and incoherent gibberish. The author is CLEARLY appealing to ethnic sentiment over "EVIDENCE AND FACTS." I suggest readers read the dozen or so "Most Helpful Reviews." Those reviewers were very in depth and know their SUBJECT 
 I am not sure if these Reviews are from 'Paid' people but  If you atteneded any of her seminars from Learning Annexe, you will find out that she is basically selling you $6,000 seminars using this book. I have been to one of her seminar and it is all confusing and it will sure confuse you.  BUT , if you pay $6,000 , you will know what Martha beck is saying.   I was conviced that this is 'NOT' what you expected from her book or seminars.   Keep away from this Stuff, there are lot of useful / helpful people / books on amazon. Her seminars are so confusing that after spending 3-4 hours , you will try to find out 'What I need to do ' ?.  You are paying for her 'Marketing Ideas' by buying this Book..   Keep Away ,  
 This is the second HD DVD that I've had issues with the XBox360 player, the other being Children of Men. Ironically, both are dual format. While Children of Men refused to play, this one refuses to go past chapter 12. I've had no issues with my PS3 playing any of the Blu-Ray movies so it begs the question, what is wrong with this format? I've got another dual format HD DVD/DVD disk that I'm going to try. Anyhoo, if you're using the XBox360 HD DVD player, this movie might not play all the way for you or might not even play at all 
 Throughout Dr. Shealy's book, he continuously touts his products. After a while, the repetitious branded names of the SheLi TENS, Dr. sHEALy's Essentials tablets, Dr. sHEALy's Youth Formula tablets and his Biogenetics Magnesium Lotion makes his book sound more like an infomercial than authentic informative research. Whenever there is product pushing involved in a book like this an alarm of caution should immediately sound. There should be cause for concern that findings may be created or embellished as a way of selling them instead of providing accurate research and truthful information 
 While Julia Barrett touches on the language "spoken" in Jane Austen's novels, it's not expressed with any feeling or wit.  The words seem to be a jumble of Austenique words placed to look good, but not sound good.  After chapter 11 the book goes into a million different directions, is narrated from several characters points of view, leaves almost no room for the main characters (Charlotte Heywood) views to be expressed, her feelings to be voiced and is just plain messy.  In most of Austen's novels, you have an opportunity to see the relationship grow between the main charactor and her "intended".  In Charlotte, you wonder how they fell in love at all.  They rarely see one another, they rarely speak and when they do, it's mostly short and nonsensible.    Then there is the plot line, or rather shall I say lines for there are several (thank you Mr. Collins).  There is the plot to save Sandition by gaining a physician, by adding a Crescent, allowing racing gentleman and their horses (and then the sub-plot to this to keep them out)and then the smuggling and bootlegging.  Dear me!  How did anything get done?  I confess, I got bored and just scanned the rest of the book!  Honestly, I was disgusted.    If you love Austen's last novel and would like to see how she may have ended it, let me recommend a book far superior to Charlotte.  Instead try Sandition.    Sandition does tend to get a little flowery in some places.  Charlotte Heywood does tend to get a little flustered and unable to speak her mind around Sidney Parker.  However on the whole, it's a much more convincing end to Austen's last attempt.  The characters actually grow.  They learn.  Here is an example.  In Charlotte: Arthur Parker is an "invalid" who learns that perhaps he is not so invalid and then spends the rest of the book remarking to his intended, also thinking herself an invalid, about how herorically he withstands his difficulties with stomach ailments.  To which she agrees and says that they only can know how much each endurs to live with this horrid desease.  And then they proceed to expound on how proud they are over their problems and attempt to live with them.  (sigh).  In Sandition:  Arthur Parker is an "invalid" who realizes that perhaps, not only is he NOT an invalid but that there are people fairing far worse then him and do not complain.  He falls for a young woman who truly is fragile but makes no complaints, only attempts to live each good day she has to the fullest.  He learns from her what it is to be healthy.  They both grow and support each other in a common goal that gets them out of a smoke filled tea room and into the fresh sea breezes.  He collects and she draws what he collects.  He learns to protect her (instead of whining over his bouts and supposed illnesses) and she learns to be stronger.    Sandition is also a book in which you can actually SEE Charlotte and Sidney fall in love.  You can watch her struggle over "does he or does he not".  It's a much more delightful alternative to all the "our herione" and "our hero" and "my herione" and "my hero"'s that go on in Charlotte (if I read one more of those I thought I would choke).    So, to sum up?  Don't Don't Don't waste your time, money or energy on Charlotte, but DO get Sandition.  It's a welcome addition to Jane Austen's library 
 "Sins and Needles" reflects the current state of our American society:  it's okay to go bad, be bad, turn it all around and go on to make money from it.  There are many folks who have lived a normal life without all the theatrics achieved by Raymond and Melanie Materson in this pitiful little book. (It's okay, because he was using a toy gun to rob and TERRORIZE someone.) There is nothing in this book that enlightens, educates or garners enthusiasm from anyone who has throughout life worked hard to be a good citizen, good spouse, good parent and good person.  It is hard to believe this book was published.  It is not well written and so elementary I was able to read it cover to cover in less than an hour. The book becomes particularly horrible at the end when the Matersons give the impression their romance and connection is so special.  It appears like she was wanting to find someone who could make money and she was the perfect manipulator who got him to take her out of her unhappy life since she was already married with a child when she met and married Materson in prison.  These two were perfect for one another!  Their former lives filled with lies and deceit followed by their present life goal of "let's see how much money we can make from our criminal activities" show they are taking advantage of others one way or the other.  This book is a lesson on how NOT to live your life because not everyone is so taken in by such a selfish existence. The Matersons have used one another for so long it would be surprising if they stay together long enough to write any more books.  Thank goodness for that 
 What would you think of a foreign correspondent in America who wrote about the politics of the 1990s without exploring the influence of Christianity? New York Times correspondent Stephen Kinzer has written about Turkey in the `90s without any effort to take account of Islam.  America is a secular state with a Christian society. Turkey is a secular state with a Muslim society. If the object of your sermon -- "Crescent and Star" is a sermon not an analysis -- is to promote democracy, then Christianity is not too much of a problem. There are Christian democracies. But there are not any Muslim democracies, and it must be asked, is that a consequence or an accident?  Kinzer doesn't ask. He spends chapter after chapter on the Kurds, victims of a genocide in the `90s that most of the world chose not to see. Some pages on women, a few on economics. Several chapters on the army, which runs the country as a disguised military dictatorship. Page after page about the ineffectual political system and corrupt parties.  Kinzer is capable of breathtakingly stupid writing. My favorite example is his description of the father of the republic, Kemal Ataturk: "Ataturk and his comrades came to think of themselves as righteous crusaders." I doubt any Turk ever thought of himself as any kind of crusader.  Without providing the slightest evidence, Kinzer opines: "Many devout Muslims . . . want to cooperate with secularists in building an open, tolerant nation." But the only political act tied to Islam in the book describes how Turkish Hezballah (Party of Allah) subjected Konca Kuris, a Muslim woman "who had written many articles describing Islam as a gentle, tolerant faith that demanded equality for women" to "unspeakable tortures," which they videotaped for the enjoyment and political/religious edification of Turkish Muslims.  "Crescent and Star" was finished shortly before Sept. 11, 2001, but even then anyone with eyes could see that tolerant Islam was losing ground. Even then, the secular, corrupt political establishment had made a bargain with expansionist Muslims (the Welfare Party) to bring them into the government. Readers of historical experience are likely to be reminded of how the conservatives in Germany thought they could tame Hitlerism by bringing it into the government.  Turkey would be another Iran now if the secular army had not stepped in to force the Welfarist prime minister Erbakan out. Kinzer gets half of it, writing  that "the worst legacy of Erbakan's disastrous year in power was that it convinced the army that Turks were still not ready for democracy."    But having just stated that Turks were unable to handle democracy, Kinzer also says Turks are "a people who are quite mature enough to deal with the challenge of freedom."  Kinzer adores Turkey and Turkishness. It is not clear whether he is blinded by love or just a silly twit.  
 Okay, maybe turkeys is going too far.  But none of these films are classics.  Criterion, as others have noted, is a fabulous company in terms of producing restored, pristine DVD versions of films.  However, these films are not classics, and are for Karloffians and collectors only.  Me?  I'm both.  I run the video room for a local science fiction convention, so I'll claim a tiny bit of authority here.  I would not show any of these films, although I'd watch them at home.  None are as good as "Fiend Without a Face", mentioned in another review in this section, and that one was not quite a classic, either.  Both Karloff films are from his older age.  The Haunted Strangler is probably Karloff's better film, and gives him a chance to contort up his face a bit and show some acting chops.  Corridors of Blood is just ok.  Neither film is particularly scarey or suspensefull, although both do have their moments.  Again, both films are of definite interest to those of us who love Karloff.  Others should beware.  The Atomic Submarine has some atmosphere, but otherwise, watch out.  The effects are cheesy, even for the time.  Not a lot of money was spent on this one.  As for First Man Into Space, you should have some Scotch before trying that one.  It's slow going, and the effects are even less impressive.  Anyone looking for something along the lines of these films that is better, nifty even, should consider the earlier Karloff film, The Body Snatchers, part of his Val Lewton period.  And in terms of the sf Marshall Thompson films, you'd be much better off with Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers. 
 Here's the deal scoop on this.  Lots of repeated questions, at least one blatantly wrong answer, and some ambiguous questions that will make you feel stupid for not getting it when in fact it's just a stupid question.  A lot of times the author gets lazy and will provide the following explanation as to why the answer is correct: "statement of fact".  Gee that doesn't help too much.  I guess you can get this book if you like tough love, meaning, it MAY teach you by abusing you.    Not a book for you if you don't already know the material.  Only get it if you need sample questions.  
 Interesting book, worth the read. Definitely take the time to read the Rich Dad serie 
 I saw this show on one of the education channels on TV and ordered it on Amazon. They indicated they had plenty of new and used DVD's in stock. DO NOT BELIEVE IT!! I have ordered and cancelled several times and it's been over a year and still nothing. Save your time and money and record it when it comes back on TV. Its the only way to get it 
 Disney, just about the worst company on Earth, has many lines of magazines. This is just used to suck even more money, even though they already have so much money that they're kids drown to death in money. Then disney goes on to cancel Dave the Barbarian and Teacher's Pet, the only good Disney shows 
 Simply, a terribly written book.  It has a shallow plot, flat characters and no style.  His descriptions of people are often late, and tend to consist of someone's skin colour.  And that's all.  The story moves ok at first but degrades into the most uninteresting chase/camping trip in the history of the world.   The ideas presented are soft, touchy feely sort of "the soul is love" type crap.  Seems like it's a rip off of The Celestine Prophecy, which isn't something anyone should want to rip off in the first place 
 Even though we in America have peace and a booming economy, Bill Clinton does not deserve all the credit as many want to give him.  A truly great president leads in times of struggle and disarray. Before George Bush was  considered the worst president ever by so many, he had fantastic approval  ratings because he earned them.  He also led us through a war and a  recession.  But many would just claim he was the cause for these problems.   Bill Clinton just inherited peacetime and an improving economy and  considers himself to be a wonderful president.  Its a shame he will be  remembered by so many as a great president who supposedly brought on peace  and a healthy economy when it really was the work of so many decent, moral  Americans 
 I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds.  I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one.  Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs!  If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking 
 This book's greatest flaw is, undoubtedly, its predictability.  It naturally has the descriptive and creative style of Scott, but the plot moves too logically from high point to high point with very little between.  There are very few "plot twists," and those which do occur are far from surprising.  From the book's outset, the story proceeds rapidly to the obvious tragic ending and seems to repeat regularly.  This ending also seems hurried and completely unbelievable.  The characters are poorly developed and, rather than seeming independent and realistic, seem to be nothing more than puppets forced to follow the extremely depressing plo 
 This review is for the MP3 audio cd.  Unless I received a faulty cd, this audio book was generated by an automated translation program. It's fraud. You don't pay to listen to a computer voice. I can't comment on the book 'Acres of Diamonds', which I was anxious to read/listen to, as this cd was so pathetic. [...]  
 Principles of Biostatistics certainly presents all of the information that one needs to know in order to succeed in Biostatistics.  Yet, the concepts are presented in a manner less logical than they deserve.    Key concepts and definitions need to be clearly marked, if only with bold text.  Examples of problems are frequently overly verbose and lose me when I'm trying to understand what's going on.    I think that the fundamentals of a good textbook are here, but it needs a thorough reversioning with content and typographic editing before it can be considered a winner.  My overall experience with the book is not great 
 I guess I'm partly disappointed with this book because I remembered this story differently....Apparently Pinocchio was not the story of a puppet who longed to be a boy and whose nose grew when he told a lie.  Rather, according to this version, he is a puppet who longs to be a boy and turns into a donkey and is swallowed by a whale.  The story is wordy and yet you feel like you are reading an abridged version and the illustrations are cheesy.  I ordered this specific book because I thought of "Golden Books" as classics.  Order another version 
 This book has a bit of a Pagan/Wiccan flavour, and it addresses astrological associations of crystals as well. I think this is one that may be skipped over for a much more comprehensive book 
 Maybe I was just expecting something like Jaws but I didn't think this movie that great. I watched it twice now only because I kept falling asleep the first time. The script is very weak and thus so is the story, the  acting is flat. Most of the shark sequences are in my opinion taken from  existing documentaries (I have seen photographs of at least one scene), you  can tell that they are cut into the movie and the parts that where done for  the movie are very poorly done. Don't waste your money, if you want to  watch it, rent it, don't buy it 
 Yes, I like Oscar Lopez. No I do not like this particular CD of his.  It is way too bland, too much towards the soft-jazz genre instead of nuevo flamenco.  Look at his album Flashback.  There is a reason that NONE of the tracks on this cd appear on that album.  Buy Flashback instead and you'll be very happy with your purchase.  These other reviewers must like bland, middle-of-the-road soft jazz.  There is no kick or passion to this album.  Sometimes it happens when you have to produce just to produce. This isn't from his soul, there is it a decent album for background music 
 Graphic novels are in, and graphic novels about the Holocaust, keying off of Art Spiegelman's MAUS, command our attention both for their subject matter and for the way they present it. Unfortunately, Miriam Katin's WE ARE ON OUR OWN, does not do a good job on either count.   As it happens, shortly before writing this review I spent a couple of hours in a bookshop in New York City that specializes in graphic novels and comic books. I soon realized that most of the graphics in the novels are poor at best. Interestingly, the best ones are done by Europeans who, it seems, are still trained as artists, something that I'm not sure we can say about their American counterparts. Katin's graphics are better than some, but still not especially compelling. They soon lose what visual interest they have.   Nor does the story redeem the uninteresting graphics. As it also happens, this novel is not about the Holocaust, but about the experiences of Katin and her mother, Hungarian Jews who, in 1944, purchased false identity papers and went on the run, staying in Hungary and finding shelter with two or three Hungarian peasant families. In the meantime, Katin's father was fighting with the Hungarian Army. I don't want to minimize the experiences of any refugee when I say that Katin and her mother were singularly fortunate - though occasionally suspected to be Jews, they were never turned in by their hosts; they survived the war and, at war's end, were reunited with Katin's father. They went on to stay in Hungary until 1956, when they left in the aftermath of the Hungarian Uprising.   The title reflects Katin's loss of faith in God, a loss that grew out of Katin's experiences, but the story she presents is simply not compelling. Elie Wiesel survived the concentration camps, the only one in his family to do so, yet he has made his peace with God, and he is hardly the only Holocaust survivor to do that. For far less powerful reasons, Katin wants to share with us her loss of faith, though she could as easily have found the hand of God in her and her parents' survival.   Were it not for the current demand for graphic novels and for Katin's attempt to connect her story with the Holocaust - a connection that barely exists - I'm not sure this book would ever have been published. If you must read a graphic novel that is compelling and is truly about the Holocaust, read MAUS. 
 There is a reason 1984 and Animal Farm are the famous ones this book is dull. It is the story of a man who first recounts his life before the war and then decides to take some sick leave and visit his old home. Most of the book seems to be devoted to fishing. It is sufficiently cynical but sometimes a plot is nice. Orwell should never use the Hemingway's style. Its not him. I looked all through the book and couldn't find a plot 
 After reading this iconic work, I felt as if I had been ripped off with only myself to blame.  I should have known better.  The book is SOOOOOOO 70's!  I'll give it two stars simply because it's really so out-of-date it's almost campy.    Okay, early oil paintings depicted the upper classes with their "stuff" and the "stuff" of the upper classes.  So?  It's pretty elemental to figure out that those painters had to make a living and they painted for those who were able to pay them.    Duh.  Okay, women were depicted in oil paintings as possessions and, in turn, viewed themselves in the light of the value the possessor placed on them.  Deep and enlightening, huh?  It gets worse.  We get a healthy dose of the "capitalism is bad" philosophy and the hammering that advertising is meant to keep the masses enslaved to capitalism.  Nineteen seventies style collectivism is so boring.  Of course, Berger offers no alternative other than some passing reference to his vague definition of democracy.      Maybe it's just so out-dated, it's no longer relevant.  Maybe it played better to the 1970's.  Maybe we've heard this claptrap for so many years, it's no longer novel or meaningful.  And, maybe, it's because we've matured enough to realize criticism without any offering of alternatives is simply disingenuous and superficial 
 I've read only a few of Hillerman's previous Leaphorn/Chee novels. I've enjoyed what I've rtead, though they are an acquired taste, and I don't indulge in them very often. I tend to enjoy the earlier, more active years of Joe Leaphorn more interesting than his ' semi-retired unofficial advisor to Jim Chee' phase.   From what I gather, 'Skeleton Man' continues a recent trend of disappointment with Hillerman's last few novels. Even without having read the books immediately prior to this one, I can understand that sentiment. 'Skeleton Man' starts off with a rather risky premise, tying the story in with the real life collision over the Grand Canyon in 1956. While an author can occasionally pull off a good story with a strong connection to 'real life'(See Nelson De Mille's 'Night Fall'), Hillerman fails here. The story is bogged down with bland and unlikable supporting characters, flimsy motivation, and very little that could really be called 'action'. Chee ends up joining Leaphorn in the background for much of the story. The spiritual and ritualistic aspects of Hillerman's earlier books are, for the most part, glossed over here. Even what should have been a major plot development (Chee's wedding) is overshadowed by Chee have to rescue Manuelito, in the manner of far too many contrived 'Superman rescues Lois' situations.  Better to stick with Hillerman's earlier novels. The 'aging athlete past his prime' analogy suits Hillerman, I'm afraid 
 Granted, it must be challenging to be a writer when one's father is Arthur Miller. This book was receiving raves and I was so surprised to discover it was basically downright bad! Unreadable, frankly. I forced my way through the stories. They were full of cliched and vague descriptions, bland dialogue, and too many oh-so-quirky characters. More than one story had flashbacks ( one story had two: A 4 years ago flashback within a  1 year ago flashback). More than one story had a character recounting her dreams. Boring!!!!  Save your money and your time. 
 This book, albeit comical at times, was a total waste of my time and money, not a very good read, pretty much all the same jokes you hear as you are preparing to be wed, yada, yada, yada. Save your cash for the expensive reception dinner 
 Lewis' qualifications as mid-east scholar sound impressive but I was disappointed by this book.  Although interesting, some of the essays are indicative of senility.  The title says "interpreting" so I will allow him creative license. Expect to find the kind of stuff you would look for in Stalin's treatise on the U.S. Constitution 
 My original remote for my t.v. broke.  I bought this one to replace it and thought that if it would control at least as much of my dvd/vcr functions as the original t.v. remote had done, so much the better. But it controls only a limited number of the functions for each and will not allow full use of the devices' menus. Contrary to  the other very positive reviews here, I am not impressed! 
  If this is the CD from Bnpublishing.com. Then be advised that it can be hard to listen to. Although the narrator gives it the old college try...his vocabulary and pronunciation skills are not up to the challenge. I am a veteran of over 50 audio books on philosophy, and this one is by far the worst.     
 I gave it two stars because while I didn't hate it, it was dull and predictable.  I see beter plots on TV's Starsky and Hutch.  It probably wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't have to use subtitles; I found myself more interested in looking at the text than watching the movie.  I know, that's only my opinion, but I watch a lot of DVD's and I think I know what I like and don't like 
 I love a good pulp-action book, but this book is just insulting. I will give him credit for his aviation knowledge, it seems pretty complete.  However he clearly knows little about real life in the military.  I'm guessing he was in a few years at best.  His mistakes are about the only thing fun about this book.  What this really comes down to though is the guy can't write, and the book is boring.  Don't waste your money 
 I started this novel with high hopes....expecting something better  than some self proclaimed thrillers I had recently inflicted myself with, but it was not to be.The plot is simplistic and the protagonist blunders from one accident to another.He only manages to succeed in the end due to an unbeliveable set of good luck and stupidity on part of the villians.  While reading the novel there was a strong sense of deja vu .... of having been there and done that, especially with respect to the character of Dr Hemlock.There is very little that is original or likable about him.  In my opinion Ian Fleming wrote infinitely better novels of this genre, viz. spy thrillers, I have yet to come across any author with a better command over language and creator of more interesting characters than him.  My search continues..... 
 While O'Brien seems to really know his stuff, and the book covers a vast array of material, it's just too darn wordy. His sentence structure, and word usage are awkward. Many of the terms he uses are NEEDLESSLY large and difficult to understand. He uses terms like 'tactical planning', 'proactive and interactive', and the like with out even explaining what he means. Many of his sentences have fillers and are full of redundancies.  The simple fact is that text books that are well written make learning the material easier. I implore the author to fix this book.  This is a poorly written book that has a great deal of valuable knowledge 
 All the sources show in this book are easily found in website and those sources are not really will help you maximize your profit because most of the sources you need to pay monthly fees. Better think twice when you purchase this book, I already waste my time and money to own this book. Good luck on yo 
 I thought because these are "gumy" headphones they would be comfortable but they are not.  They hurt my ears as much as any other.  If ear pain is your problem when you wear ear-buds, then don't get these.  
 I was forced to listen to this band because everytime I got into a friend's car that loved this band had it blasting in his car.  I couldn't stand that ridiculous voice from the lead singer and the band's wacked sound.  Don't get me wrong here.  I'm not a hater, I love all type of music, from rock, rap, metal, new wave, pop, jazz, freesyle, opera, classical, country, R&B, blue grass, gospel, nu metal, industrial, techno, to the homeless guy on the boardwalk beating on pots and pans for a nickel.  I LOVE music.  But....WHAT THE HELL DO YOU FIND IN THIS BAND?????  THEY SUCKED!!!!  BAD....LY! 
 I have read Mr. Train's earlier books The Money Masters and The New Money Masters and found them informative and interesting, gaining insights from some of the worlds most sucessful investors. Mr. Train's research seemed to rely heavily on personal interviews of these Masters often providing the reader with unique investment philosophies  not readily available elsewhere. I especially recommend Mr. Train's first book in this series The Money Masters because this book moved me away from the trading of stocks and futures as practiced by Robert Wilson the short seller and Stanly Kroll the great commodity speculator. The techniques they employed seemed too elusive and fraught with risk and if this was the basis of the trading game it was not the game for me. I was instead attracted to the similer philosophies of mentor and student Ben Grahman and Warren Buffett. Looking at a stock as a share of a business not a piece of paper with a number on it. This   was the first time I had been exposed to the wisdom of these two investors and I am grateful to Mr. Train for revealing to the public their methods. The problem I have with the current rendition is that it really adds nothing new. In fact Mr. Train seems to have copied parts of the first Money Masters and spliced them into this version. I may be wrong but it doesn't seem that the effort or creativity that went into the original went into this work. Another sort of irritating quality in this instance thankfully not present in the first book is Mr. Train's need to psychoanalyze some of his subjects especially Mr. Buffett. This adds an edge to the book that is not worthy of Mr. Train 
 Fortunately I didn't purchase this book. I saw it sitting on a shelf in a used book store and glanced through it. I copied down 11 websites of interest and when I tried them, they no longer existed. Anyone with common sense and a computer or phone can access any of this information. I work in the non-profit, social service industry and believe me there is NOTHING in this book that you can't find easily yourself...and I assure you that what you find will be up to date and accurate as opposed to the information in this book. Save yourself money and aggravation and don't purchase this farce 
 While the information and comparisons to his father's climb were insightful and interesting, I was put off by the author's comments on Americans and the spirituality of America. This book was more about Buddism and its practice than a climbing adventure.  The descriptions of Buddhist customs are informative, but this reader did not appreciate the tone which came across in these sections. As both a Jew and an American, I felt like I was being disrespected when I read it 
 I bought a 743 for the wife for Christmas. I had a 6330 that I was very happy with. So a 743 should be better Right? Every time that she went to use it the batteries were dead. We finally figured out that a new set would go dead in two days without ever turning it on! After several e mails they told me to call service. I got someone in India that could not understand me and I had a really hard time figuring out what he was saying. They made it very dificult to get it sent in. I sent it in today, but I do not expect much from the example that their service has done so far. I hope it comes back at least. 
 This is an awesome awesome movie.  I say that because it is one of the best renditions Hollywood has ever done of a person suffering from "psychotic depression."  Johnny Depp (who is effected by it) lets the viewer watch this illness evolve in a slow journey down into the dark pit of insanity.  The audience experiences this pure psychosis in a fashion that is authentic to the T.  The movie ingeniously shows this form of stress-induced-insanity which is so brilliantly triggered by (1) finding your wife in bed with her boyfriend, (2) the impending divorce, (3) Depp having to move out of his house and into a summer house on a lake, and (4) the inevitable financial stress on this lead character.  I mean, oh my god, he must be running about 500 stress points!  That's enough to trigger a psychotic attack on anyone who is predisposed to psychotic mental illness (paranoid schizophrenia, psychotic bipolar, psychotic depression, post-partum psychosis - about 8 million US people).  This is exactly the type of stress that triggered me to go into an almost identical type of psychotic episode a number of years ago while an army officer assigned to Germany.  For me, the stressors were very similar to the movie - move to Europe, new platoon leader, financial difficulties, relationship stress, new language to speak, etc.    Psychosis means delusions and the movie very realistically showed the onset of the "persecutorial delusion" (where you think someone is coming to get you) by showing Turturro coming to get Johnny.  And then the formation of the potentially more serious "grandiose delusion" where you think that others (real people) are conspiring against you.  This is where some psychotic people will actually lash out at others, and by so doing, if they harm them, they become criminally insane.  Of the 8 million of us who have this type of psychotic illness, about 50,000 of us will do this.  We'll read about the next one in the newspapers next week.  Almost all of these will be done by people who did not know they had a psychotic illness, were not previously diagnosed and were not medicated.  And this is exactly Depp's situation in the film (I have psychotic bipolar and must take lithium for mania, and Zyprexa for psychosis daily).  Psychosis also means hallucinations.  And Turturro has this part by playing an "imaginary paranoid hallucination antagonist."  This is really an ingenious Hollywood technique because it helps others in our society understand psychosis by showing a visual hallucination.  I believe the technique was first used in "Beautiful Mind."  This phenomenon, coupled with the delusions, is what makes paranoid psychosis a horrifying experience.  The movie shows this paranoid delusional psychosis very well and Depp actually lashes out at a number of people in his psychotic episode.  For me, I got these same types of delusions and similar hallucinations in Germany but never lashed out at others - therefore I got an honorable discharge as a captain, after getting out of the stressful situation and the psychosis dissipated.  I liked the above parts of the movie very well for its authenticity - it was good.  However what I didn't like about the movie is that it went way over board in the number of homicides.  This just adds to the mental illness stereotype and the stigma.  And so more people won't go in and get help when they should be getting help and medication.  It took me 23 years before I got help.  Why?  Because of the stigma and fear.  Maybe if society didn't have this stigma, we wouldn't have these types of terrible tragedies like in this movie.  My heart goes out to anyone who has been impacted by this.    Society has available the medicine and counseling which is needed to eliminate this type of tragedy.  Maybe if they educated the masses in a smart way we could eliminate it.  But instead we "monsterize" this illness by this type of movie 
 Albeit I am perpetually interested in reading Kingsolver's unique, southwestern inclined style of writing, I found that reading through "High Tide In Tucson" was really quite listless and found it a particular exhibition that could very well lead the average reader to become bored after the fifth page.   The substance of the writing is far from being meaty; it is least to say one of the most equivocal collection of essays I have read. When reading through essays, it is ideal to encounter some vestige of a thematic line or at least a connective element, but unfortunately, this collection posesses neither of these most crucial atributes. Perhaps Kingsolver is not as adept at writing essays as her prodigous novels. While some have the gift, others have theirs elsewhere.... 
 There was something about this book that reminded me of a mosquito.  From the first page on it began sucking.  Being a lover of nature I felt that love drain away as I continued reading.  The author's excessive use of metaphor was too much in itself, not to mention the fact that his descriptions were terribly cheesy. I found myself exercising my gagging reflex to no end.  The other repulsive factor involved the author continually refering to himself.  Since he is the author it is only obvious to conclude that indeed these thoughts are solely his; the fact that he kept reminding me of this led me to feel that what I was reading derived from pure arrogance.  The ideas in this book are not as complex as the author insists, only if you take into account the way he presents them. Any form of theory can become garbled when muddled with overwhelming language.  While the points he was trying to make were legitimate, the way he presented them was a major turn off.  I had to put it down before I fulfilled my urge to go chop down an ancient forest, or at least light a match to my own backyard.   
 Sorry for not being as enthusiastic as the other readers but I have many doubts about the reliability of this book. I agree there are many interesting and funny anecdotes, that the story of the English language described is captivating and so on. But as a native French speaker, I noticed that almost each time he writes about the French language that's absolute rubbish ! Let's have an overview : p3 : '[...]The French for instance, cannot distinguish between house and home, between mind and brain, between man and gentleman [...]'. Hey Bill, if it's too hard for you to check in a dictionary I can tell you the difference between 'une maison, une residence, un btiment' and 'un foyer, un chez-soi' or between 'esprit' and 'cerveau' or between 'un homme' and 'monsieur, or even gentleman'.  p5/6 : '[...]French must manage with 'je chante', we can say 'I sing', or 'I do sing', or 'I am singing'. Even if I prefer the English way of saying that I can also say 'je chante vraiment', 'je suis en train de chanter'...  p7 : [...] while the French call lice 'Spaniards [...]'. Where have you found this stupidity ? I've never heard that before ! p7 : [...] To be bored to death in French is 'tre de Birmingham' literally 'to be from Birmingham' [...] Once again where have you found this idiocy ?! I've asked to all the Frenchmen around me and no one knew it. Perhaps you got it from the only Frenchman you know who has been bored to death in Birmingham for 10 years....   p67 : [...] For instance , the French do not use [...] or R.S.V.P. for rpondez s'il vous plat. (Instead they write :'Prire de rpondre.'). Hum, let me check my paperwork R.S.V.P, R.S.V.P., R.S.V.P.,... Damn I cannot find any 'Prire de rpondre'. Did you invent that one also ?  p179 : [...] in France [...] an alloman is a switchboard operator [...] Hang on man, you're on the wrong line. I can invent a new one for you if you want : 'fantasyman'. p179 : [...] so that in France a jerk is an accomplished dancer. I've been dancing for years now and never used or heard that one !   p210 : In French it is a grave insult to call someone a cow or a camel and the effect is considerably intensified if you precede it with espce de ('kind of') [...] I wouldn't say it's a GRAVE insult ! Even less preceded by 'espce de'. Espce de menteur !   So here are the examples I picked up, I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same for the other languages and even for the English language. Imagine now my feeling as I was reading this book. Each time I learnt a point of history, grammar or vocabulary or I was amused by an anecdote I thought "hang on, is it again something Bill invented to sell his book, is it again a non-verified piece of information ?".  Despite all the books he wrote I think this guy should go (back ?) to a school of journalism...   Franc 
 I thought I would love this book...and out of all the viking series I did like it.  But it was poorly written.   I have seen that Ms. Coulter does rewrite some of her novels this is definitely one of them that needs to be reproduced.  She had one to many loopholes that aggravate me as the reader.   I loved Miranda's character.  In my opinion out of all her characters I've read, I've only liked Alexandra Sherbrooke as my ideal woman next to Miranda.   What was disappointing there was not enough more combatative fighting between Miranda and those that kidnapped her nor just a visual between her brother and her.     Secondly with Miranda and Rorik...there was no romance.  I cannot figure how a man moves from detesting the woman to deciding to marry her...although there was a small explanation or round about, mainly Rorik's thoughts on how strong she is and capable.  But besides the romance...the sex scenes were horrid.   It seemed cold and clinical.  There was no passion.   Between Douglas and Alexandra, or even the Legacy/Brides/ and the rest of the Viking sagas..there was some kind of passion that gets you excited and into the hero.  But Rorik was horrid as a lover and poor Miranda just seemed unimpressed..until she decided to take things into her own hands...and then she had to be ill before that was sucessful.  So the quality of romance/passion was utterly lacking in this fic.  My main concerns would be to develop Miranda more and give her a bit more nuances, and expand on her fighting skills with a bit more action.    Another would be to definitely romanticise a bit of the sex scenes at least and give them a bit more loving relationship.  That is not only based on a marriage of convenience.     I think those two would change things a great deal and really improve the book 
 I was given this book as a gag gift. I regret the day that I actually read it. Here's the basic message "Be good.", it's nice that so many adults are willing to be maniuplated by a statement that has haunted them since Kindergarten. If you need a solution merely "Being good" is not a solution. Change something within yourself. Don't avoid the actual problem. And most of all DON'T preach about this book to other people, they might sucker-punch you, I know I would 
 I bought this becuse it got a great review in the Village Voice and now seeing that the author lives in Brooklyn he must know the reviewer and got a gift from him.  Anyway I read close to a hundred pages hoping it would get better and reaized that it was a complete waste of my time 
 I got this for Christmas in 2005.  I treated it with kid gloves, didn't use it everyday and was careful not to drop it and always unplugged it by gripping the plug and not the cable.  It worked perfectly until a couple of months after the warranty expired (Feb 2007), then one morning it simply failed.  I had copied a file to it to bring to work and when I went to transfer it to my work computer the next morning it did nothing. I tried it in four other computers with the same result.  Since the warranty was expired and Seagate won't repair it unless you have a service contract on it (see their website), I took it apart to see what I could do.  There is a microdrive that's easily removed.  I put it in my compact flash/microdrive reader and still it won't work.  If you use one of these don't keep important data on it that isn't stored elsewhere, which is always a good idea.  In theory this should have outlasted flash drives, but I have three flash drives that have lasted longer than this with more use and abuse.  I wouldn't recommend this 
 Sadly, the Publisher's Weekly review is right on the money.  There is very little about the "life" of Rosalind Russell, as touted in the title.  The book is little more than a poorly researched, dryly written synopsis of her movies & stage appearances 
 I found the recipes in this book to be simple and bland. I am actually in the process of returning the book.  Anyone who cooks can come up with combinations better than this.  
 Sorry for the sarcasm, but I can't help thinking just how uninspired this book is.  Imagine a counter to this book.  This book would promote "hate", "dishonesty", "immorality", "ignorance, "ingratitude".... you get the picture.  This Mormon leader's great contribution to world is to say we should be honest?  Now that was profound!  Sadly, Gordo and his wrinkled cadre have this bad habit of taking the basic decency of the members of the church and attributing it to the implausible myths they peddle to the world.   As an avowed atheist, I encourage everyone to be honest, moral, learned, and all the things Gordo promotes in this book.  There is nothing wrong with promoting these and they have nothing to do with Mormonism.  But this book is written for children and sheep.  Promoting this book among the various books that seriously discuss morality, ethics and other serious issues is like watching a high school team play the New England Patriots or comparing a Janice Kapp Perry vapid song to Bach's Mass in B minor.    Mormonism is declining in real terms because their leadership does not have the capacity to address and provide any illumination to the relevant issues of the 21st century.  This book should confine itself to the children's section or to the local Deseret Book store.   
 Despite the fact that this book has been thoroughly dismissed as the pinacle of victimhood mentality and describes a backlash which never happened, despite many of its observations being demonstratedly shown to be baseless and flat out wrong, it still gets reprinted to produce more angry feminist graduates  whose only skill in life is to whine about their systematic oppression while everyone else gets on with their lives making individual choices about their work and family life.  Will somebody please tell them that their convulted oppressive patriarchy disappeared a long time ago and it is only their own victimhood mentality that prevents them from getting ahead in life.       A book only for the true believers and those taking women's studies.  Totally irrelevant to everyone else who takes personal responsibilty for their own choices in life 
 Loser by Jerry Spinelli could have been an interesting and overall good book but, in my opinion it was not because it was rushed and undeveloped.  The book chronicles the life of Donald Zinkoff from his first day of kindergarten to his last day of eighth grade in a mere two hundred pages.  Thus no grade is well developed and neither is any character but the loveable loser and main character Donald Zinkoff.  This book was attempting to give a good message about the life through school of a loser.  Because it is hard to go through your time in school with out true friends or any real interests to speak of let alone to be unatheletic on top of it.  But although the message was no doubt an outstanding one, it left much to be desired as a whole 
 The book gave insight to the more conservative Amish lifestyles but her explanations for their hard life leaves one to wonder if her husband isn't just a free loader.  She is definitely the worker in that family 
 This book was boring; it was a chore to finish. It takes place in Glamorous Hollywood, a bit too glamorous for me. The main character, a lawyer, has a boyfriend she's not too happy with. This book has too many boring pages. This is definitely the last book by this author that I will ever read 
 Jon Katz creates a remarkable story in this series of books, all apparently derived from his great love of dogs, first his beloved Yellow Labs, and then a gaggle of sheep herding Border Collies.  In "The Dogs of Bedlam Farm", however, he finds a way to turn this exciting and compelling story into pure drudgery, an almost painful book to read.  Katz continues to explore the limits of his relationships with his three dogs, selling his upstate New York cottage, buying an old, abandoned farm property, and abandoning his wife.  He adds a ram, 15 ewes, and 2 donkeys to the three collies, and attempts to survive a brutal northern winter while training the dogs to herd and keeping all of the livestock alive and fed, with mixed results.  His writing style is disjointed, with constant, but incomplete, references to past parts of the story, so that if you have not read previous books on his dogs (i.e., Orson), you will have a hard time following along.  As the narrative enters the dark, frigid winter months, the story bogs down into a nauseating psychoanalysis of ... everything ... his relationship with his father, with his sister and her personal demons, with his dogs, his feelings of insecurity with the farm, the animals, his new neighbors out in the country.  In the beginning, I felt bad that his wife was being left out of all this excitement; by chapter 12, it became apparent that she is the only sane one in the story.  As a dog lover, I couldn't have been more inclined to embrace this book, but it was a huge disappointment 
 I didn't read, nor review this book, Stand Up Comedy, but apparently LaMott A Jackson blieves that I did, as he/she chose to drag my name into his/her review.  I thought these were reviews, not forums for trashing other reviewers' names.   I would never mention anyone else by name, but I chose to do so here because LaMott A Jackson chose to berate me personally, singling out my name from other negative reviews.  It sounds like LaMott A Jackson has a personal interest in the selling of the book "Stand Up Comedy".  The book I did review however was Judy Carter's "Comedy Bible", so if LaMott A Jackson  would like to add credibility to his/her review, he/she should have gotten the review of the correct book. I have not read "Stand Up" by Judy Carter, nor would I want to after reading the lame "Comedy Bible".    If you are going to review a book, do that. Most reviewers do refer to other reviews' comments, but without stating names. Please LaMott A Jackson, submit your review of the product as everyone, but leave out the names of other reviewers.     
 I dragged myself through every novel in this series with soap-opera like compulsion, always looking forward to the climatic appearance of our Lord.  Therefore, I anticipated this final novel to be glorious, as the title indicates, but I was woefully wrong.  Are my expectations too lofty for the day of our coming King and His Kingdom?  Certainly not!    I support Christian fiction with many 5 star reviews,--just look at my other reviews--but I can not recommend this series 
 If you happen upon the video for MakeDamnSure and the sound on your television is off, then you would think that the band Taking Back Sunday is ripping one hell of a energetic and explosive tune.  They look like the MC5 in the video, jumping off amps, winging guitars around there head, looking serious as all hell.  But if your like me and you turn the sound back on, your going to hear that it's another whiny and droning effort from the emo machine designed to make kids in high school feel self important.    I was asked to listen to this by one of my friends.  I gave it an honest to god listen, but I couldn't handle it for too long.  Being earnest is fine, but stop with this emo stuff.  You'd think after the fiftieth clone of the same band that eventually the comsumers of this stuff would realize that it's all the same. If you like emo, please, buy 13 Songs by Fugazi.  They practically invented the genre, but I actually buy what they do.  I don't buy this crap, this is just the same drivel that i've been hearing for ever.  Avoid at all costs.  
 Well, nice cinematography as set-designer work: nicely interiors and well dressed actors. Maybe, visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once, but not enough to consider it as a remarkable  movie of year, as other reviewers trying to assure 
 This film is a darling of the critics. Roger Ebert gave it four stars, and A. O. Scott of the NY Times describes it, on the DVD's box, as "a masterpiece," adding, "this is why cinema exists."  That being the case, if you are, or aspire to be, a devotee of cinema, then this film may be required viewing.  But if your sensibilities run toward (mere) movies, beware.  The film, set in Taiwan and China, depicts three love stories -- set in three historical periods: 1911, 1966, and 2005 -- using the same actor and actress.  The problem, simply put, is that "Three Times" moves at a glacial pace and little happens.  As one of the few critics not to wax euphoric put it, "if this movie moved any slower it could qualify as a photograph."  When each segment ended, and when the final credits rolled, the question plaintively asked by Peggy Lee came to mind: Is that all there is? 
 As an English Lit. major in college a MLA Handbook is indispensible, but I was disappointed with this one.  I found it difficult to locate the information I needed, often having to comb several pages to find what I was looking for.  It is just not convenient to use.  I much prefer Diana Hacker's "A Writer's Reference."  The layout of her book is much simpler to navigate, and the spiral binding is always a plus, because it lays open on your desk nicely.   
 I had not read Danielle Steel in several years.  I found The Cottage to be shallow, implausible, and completely predictable.  I was very disappointed with this work 
 Democracy, for Sean Wilentz in The Rise of American Democracy, is solely a question of politics. This is, after all, an explicitly political history of the early republic and, in his discussion of how revolutionary Republicanism evolved into a popular, though imperfect, democracy, Wilentz is concerned with democracy in specifically political terms. While this gives the book an admirable focus, he somehow manages, in almost 1000 pages, to tell only part of the story. What Wilentz succeeds in doing is writing a heavy, old-fashioned book driven by an odd teleological sense of American exceptionalism.  Significantly, The Rise of American Democracy is a political history focused almost exclusively on the great political leaders of the early republic. Although Wilentz devotes some time to discussions of popular political movements like the anti-Masonic party and the Workingmen's parties of the eastern port cities, their role is as a catalyst for the emergence of party politics. The political motivations of their leaders and militants are relevant to the extent that they influenced the development of Jacksonian Democracy, but Wilentz is not particularly interested in what democracy meant to the Workie rank-and-file.  This is a particularly odd omission, given the populism of the Jacksonian ideology. Indeed, the Jackson Democrats positioned themselves as the party of the working man and the yeoman farmer, and defined their program in clear opposition to perceived revenant Federalist commercial aristocracy, particularly in regards to the Second Bank of the United States and trade policy. The economic crises of 1819 and 1837 are political issues, ushering in, respectively, an "Era of Bad Feelings" and the decline of Federalism, and a crisis in Jacksonian Democracy and the rise of the Whig opposition. What these crises meant in social terms to the working people and farmers in social and cultural terms, Wilentz doesn't say.  To be fair, that's mostly because he is interested in American democracy in political, and not economic terms, and from a national perspective. Social issues and local, class-based agitation, while significant as an influence on Jacksonian ideology and strategy, is a small part of his story. The central tension in The Rise of American Democracy has to do with balancing local and sectional interests and grievances with an emergent democratic nationalism. Consequently, the central drama in this section of the book revolves around the conflict between Andrew Jackson, and his national vision, and John C. Calhoun's evolving sectionalism.  Not surprisingly, Jackson is the towering figure in this section of Wilentz's book, and it is in his presidency that the author locates both the democratization of the American republic and the source of most of the political currents and issues that would define American politics throughout the 19th century. Indeed, Wilentz does nothing to conceal his sympathies and admiration for Jackson. He is inclined to forgive Jackson's Indian policies as being motivated, essentially, by good intentions, and he mostly ignores the fact that he was a slave owner and a defender of slavery. While dismissing earlier historians' contentions that the Jackson's policies were inconsistent and that he "trapped himself in some large contradictions," Wilentz argues that the president pursued a consistent, though not always successful program of nation-building: "In fact, Jackson, drawing on long-established beliefs, carved out a coherent and principled democratic nationalism on basic constitutional issues." (382)  For Wilentz, by the 1830s, democracy was "ascendant," and even the most aristocratic Federalists had begun to see it as a necessary evil. Universal white male suffrage was almost universal - with the notable exception of Virginia - and there was a general agreement that government was a manifestation of popular sovereignty. The sticky issue in the dispute between Calhoun and Jackson was whether that sovereignty was manifested by the state or the nation as a whole. Significantly, though Jackson successfully quashed the nullification crisis and the state interests were accommodated to national interests through measures like the Missouri Compromise, it was a tenuous modus vivendi at best.  Indeed, the politics of the early republic were very much a question of imperfectly accommodating southern sectionalism within emerging national parties. Both the Democrats and the Whigs sought to bridge sectional differences while seeking broad popular support for increasingly divergent political programs. The failure of the Jacksonian Democrats, in fact, to maintain themselves as "the party of popular sovereignty" (515) against the rise of a trans-sectional Whiggism was very much an inability to understand how complex ideas of popular sovereignty had become.  The Rise of American Democracy is very much a history of the minute details of American politics in the period, from the Eaton affair to the shifting and evolving political philosophies of Jackson, Calhoun, Daniel Webster and Henry Clay. The problem is that the book is so concerned with the details that Wilentz sometimes loses the bigger picture. For example, slavery and its expansion is a significant issue throughout the period, and Wilentz devotes a considerable about of space to abolitionist agitation and the tensions the issue produced in national politics. But though he connects the political issue of slavery to the political issue of states' rights and the fortunes of the nascent political parties, he fails to situate it as a significant social issue with deep contradictions with American democracy.  Ultimately, this is a "great" book only in the sense of its physical heft 
 I found this book to be totally biased. Even before DNA the case that Anna Anderson was Anastasia was extremely weak. In the Dalldorf Asylum Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden said that she was neither Tatiana nor Anastasia. This is a big clue. She never said she was Anastasia. The idea that she was a member of the Imperial Family was placed in her head by a fellow patient at Dalldorf, Clara Peuthert.  Anderson met her Aunt Princess Irene of Prussia under an assumed name. Neither recognized the other. Also Grand Duchess Olga did not recognize Anderson. Olga Alexandrovna would never be so callous as to reject her niece. Pierre Gilliard also said that she could not be Anastasia. Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone once shared a bath with Anastasia and said that the claimant wasn't Anastasia.  Anderson disappeared on 12 August 1922 and reappeared on 15 August 1922. These were the same days on which Franziska Schanzkowska reappeared.   Anastasia knew four languages: Russian, English, French and German. Anna Anderson only knew one: German. She never could speak Russian.  The Author resorts to slander to criticize the claimant's opponents. Lovell claims that a prostitute identified Anna Anderson as Schanzkowska. Where is the proof? Who was the prostitute? No other books refer to a prostitute. Slanderous statements such as this do not belong in print.  The suggestion that Nicholas and Alexandra had a fifth daughter is beneath contempt. This claim destroys Lowell's credibility for good. This claim is an affront to the memory of the Russian Royal family. Not even the most naïve, desperate or gullible conspiracy theorist could fall for this.    The author seems to record everything uttered by Anna Anderson Manahan during her years of senility no matter how outlandish or farfetched.  Substantial sections of the book bear little relation to reality, for example the King Kong rape story. Whilst watching a showing of the King Kong, Manahan leaves the theatre and then confides in Lovell that the entire family except Alexei were raped in front of each other.  The King Kong story is extemely disturbing and despicable, and shows how gullible the author is. It is obvious that Anna Anderson Manahan herself sees how devoted Lovell is towards her and is deliberately making up stories for him.  The author also misidentifies a photo that is really that of Anastasia's sister Marie's ear not Anastasia's ear.   Lovell mocks the claimant's opponents and believes every single word of Anna's. There was nothing regal at all about Anderson's mannerisms or behaviour. There is no balance in this book.   
 I had to say Shark Attack 1 was a better film and there was only 3 things i liked about this film-  1. Good special effects  2. I didnt have to see the first one. 3. People acually have graphic deaths {Not deaths that are like cgi graphics}  I'd get watch this movie if i had to kill some time. Thats all i could say 
 I can't work out what this band is trying to do. There are elements of metal, punk, riot grrl, and grunge, all of which are handled in the most rudimentary way. If music is inconsequential to you and all you're looking for is a cute unconventional singer to worship, then Jack Off Jill may be the band for you. If you're looking for good tunes you won't find them here.  
 This is the only book in my collection that I did not bother to finish. I have been reading on the subject since my early youth but this book could not retain my attention. It seemed repetitious at times and simply put...boring. I will end up using it as filler material for the bottom of my book shelf 
 I think if you've lived life under a rock, watched a lot of soap operas, and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas, this book will appeal to you.    It makes me angry to read this book; not because it's fiction (and I'll call it completely fictitious garbage), but because James Frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction!  He writes this book with an underlying tone "I'm better than all of you."  Not because he thinks AA is BS, but because this theme runs throughout his book, in so many situations, that after awhile it becomes laughable!  He prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain a-hole, except his tough guy "friends."  I ask you, if Leonard has such a reputation... where's his protection?  People would be after him in such a vulnerable (read: no security) place like rehab.     I think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its BS by feeling its predictability.  It reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people, yeah, he's got problems, but he'll prevail because he's James Frey!  No thank you.  I absolutely hated this book, but I read it so I at least deserve credit for trying. 
 A Midnight Clear (Keith Gordon, 2002)  Keith Gordon will probably be best remembered for playing Arnie Cunningham in John Carpenter's so-so film version of Stephen King's so-so novel Christine. Gordon, however, hung up the acting togs in the late eighties and went behind the camera, and it is here he has truly shined, turning out such brilliant movies as Waking the Dead and television genius on such series as House, Dexter, and Homicide: Life on the Street. The man has an amazing track record. So it's with some confusion that I regard those works where Gordon comes off as being somewhat less accomplished. A Midnight Clear is one of them.  Based on a novel by William Wharton, A Midnight Clear is the story of a World War II platoon (full of misfits, natch) who are ordered to scout out a mansion inside enemy territory. They encounter the enemy-- but not an enemy they expect. The survivors of a German platoon are in a house down the hill looking to surrender. The two groups spend a companionable Christmas together before they turn to the task of deciding how to get each other out of the situation they've found themselves in-- enemies in wartime becoming friends.  This is not your typical war film; characterization is much more important than action here, and as in many other substandard war films of this stripe (Hart's War and Tigerland immediately come to mind), it almost seems as if the director wanted to still play it as an action film. There's not enough real character development here to float the entire movie; we get to know our main character well enough, and the character upon whom the entire plot will turn later. We get a little less on the guy who's here for the purpose of building sympathy. On the rest of the platoon, very little, and on the enemy, nothing. We know more about the back-line lieutenant-- a minor character at best-- than we do about the Germans.  Not up to the standards set by either Gordon or Wharton. * 
 Ok.. I read the other reviews for this movie and I am a little confused.  Was it the same movie?  The martial arts were "ok" in this, but nothing I havent seen done better before.  The story-line  was.. ummm. well, nevermind.    Oh and did I mention the film doesnt end????  I mean I didnt really care but it still sucked to cut the story line half way though.  I really wantedto like this movie... but the only good thing I can say is that some of the sub-titles are hilarious 
 With all the great reviews, I thought this would be good, especially as I really enjoyed Children of Light. Instead, the first chapter is one of the most boring I have ever read. I tried it a second time, thinking I missed something.  I didn't. I thought it would get better.  It didn't. This is one of the most arduous and tedious books I've read, with excessive and boring detail about everything.  Unlike many other readers, I stop reading at a certain point if a book doesn't interest me.  I stopped at page 50.  Others who have reviewed this actually finished it, and then say it was really bad.  This book is a good reason to stop at 50 
 I find the mostly 5 star reviews of Adam Bede rather puzzling. I am a great of lover nineteenth century English lit, and have enjoyed the other three Eliot books I've read--Middlemarch, Silas Marner, and Mill on the floss, the latter being far and away my favorite. However, had I read Adam Bede first, I may not have bothered to read other Eliot works.   Eliot's talent is indisputable. The other reviews do an excellent job of capturing what is great about her prose, and many of those strengths are present in Adam Bede. What disappointed me most about this work were the characters. Each was far less complex than I have come to expect from Eliot, and I found the saintliness of Seth, Adam, and Dinah boring, almost irritating. It was hard to care about them. I also found, despite the explanations Eliot provided, that Adam's love for Hetty and Dinah's change of heart about marriage was implausible.  What sealed my opinion of this book was Adam's forgiveness of Arthur. After the devastation Arthur's actions caused, it would have been superhuman to forgive him, let alone regard him as a friend. When Arthur asserted that he suffered more than Adam, I could hardly believe that Adam did not recognize yet another expression of Arthur's massive ego.  Despite the book's strengths, this flaw, together with one-dimensional personalities of the main characters, relegates Adam Bede to an inferior status among Eliot's works.  
 I have to say that these are about the worst shorts I've ever seen. Do yourself a favour and keep your money in your pocket 
 I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start.   I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad.   I really couldn't recommend this book any less 
 I was disappointed with this after reading My Sister's Keeper (which I loved).  There are too many plot holes in this story, too many inconsistencies. Like how the semen on Gilly's thigh was never explained - that's the most major one. The characters don't seem realistic. Addie and Jack's relationship annoyed me - the scenes with them seemed very contrived. The dialogue, most of the time, comes off as cheesy. Its the only way to describe it. Cheesy, cheesy, cheesy and cliched. The story only picked up its pace during the courtroom scenes (the best scenes out of the entire book) but still the ending was very unsatisfying as it did not explain a whole lot of things. And also, Picoult ends nearly *every* scene with a character dropping a one-liner. I found this rather irritating. Maybe its just me.  Addie misunderstands Jack so many times and overreacts again and again -the reader can only tolerate so much up to a certain point. The worst scene, I think, was when Jack tried to clear out Addie's dead daughter's room to get Addie to move on. It was so unoriginal.  The plot is not believable. It just doesn't work. The portrayal of Gilly was inconsistent and one-dimensional. Why did she try to poison her father? What would it have achieved? Why was she so angry at him in the beginning? Her motives were never clear from the start and Picoult does not satisfyingly explain them.  I'll say one good thing though. She can write courtroom scenes pretty well 
 I picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book.  The book was anything but funny.  I read about half, up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore. I consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me.  The graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. I am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but I had to throw it away because I did not want my children to get a hold of it.  I found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. I started hating them for the abuse they put their children through 
 I bought this because I liked the idea of having the water filter inside. You can't find replacement filters. You can't measure the water correctly. I tried just pouring water in from a cup. That didn't work because it goes right into the water filter so it looks like it is at level 3 when it is more.  The last straw was the other day as the water started to brew through the basket, the basket sprang open. I had water everywhere. It also seems to take a while to brew a small pot of coffee. I usually made a 3 or 4 cup pot and it took 8 minutes. I will never buy a coffee pot from this company again.  
 I was very disappointed with this book.  If didn't reference scripture or history as much as I was expecting.  It was basically a feminist validating herself with a few verses throughout the book.  The flow was horrible as the book went in circles.  When I got done reading the book (was very hard to finish), I couldn't help but think it was a waste of time reading.  If you are looking for meat I would suggest "Balancing Act".  It is much more helpful if you are a Christian woman looking for meat on the subject of career and family 
 Life is too short to be spent reading drivel.  Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book.  You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better.  I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story.  With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books.  The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 This is the worse book I ever read. The only reason that I finished it was because I thought it would get better or there would be a suprise ending. Not the case. Don't waste your time. Omar Tyree has definately fallen off in the writing department. Somebody stop him 
 Man, I don't know what the other reviewers of this movie were smoking, but it should be illegal!  This is, first off, a terrible DVD: 4:3 (full screen) format, with a dark, muddy picture.  Worse, the plot is typical, predictable, and poorly written.  Other than looking for glimpses of Teri Hatcher's body, sitting through this fiasco is a total bore.  I was also surprised at how bad Teri's acting was in this movie, since I've seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this.  That is probably the fault of the director, Erik Anjou, a third-rate director (at best!) who has done a total of two movies and one documentary.  Gee, I wonder why he isn't in more demand (NOT!)!  I can enjoy "B" movies, and bad movies, but this one is just so totally non-involving that it is not even good enough to laugh at.  I can't imagine that this mess was released on DVD for any reason other than to cash in on Teri Hatcher's current popularity, and to suck the cash out of people who are anxious to see a younger (29 year-old) Teri Hatcher nude.    Rent this, if you must, but, wow, there is no reason anyone should want to buy a movie this bad 
 This guy thinks collectors want to see his own creations of what rare prototypes are. What a complete waste of time. Collectors want to see the real thing. Most of the "rare" prototypes in this book are fakes that Santelmo forgets to tell the reader. This book would be useful if you are interested in conterfeit items 
 The Rise of the Network Society was on my reading list for school -- and I was looking forward to reading it, not only in the context of my class, but because the subject is an important one, especially regarding the  distribution of information and knowledge in our society.  Unfortunately, I  was soon disappointed to find that Castells, with all his remarkable  insight into the arts of communication, has not been able to go beyond the  oh-so cumbersome turns of phrase typical of academic writing. I find myself  turned off by the lingo, where I am truly interested in the subject; I  resent having to plow my way through his phraseology, while I certainly do  appreciate the research and energy he has invested in his work.  There  seems to be an ideal to academic writing that somewhat opposes the general  trend of having knowledge and information made accessible to everyone. Or  is it that Castells really means to restrict his writing (and being read)  to the groves of Academe? If proving himself versed in the field is more  important than getting the information out there, what does he have to  teach us about the implications of a network society? That we should better  cling to our own in-group, to only those who speak our language, whatever  that is? If that is so, what change can we expect from being related  through networks?  If Castells intends to put into practice his belief that  *observing, analyzing, and theorizing is a way of helping to build a  different, better world* (p. 4), then he might as well start with  generously offering his insights to the world he wants to see changed 
 Don't know about anyone else, but the DVD I purchased had lousy video.  The only good shots were of closeups and sometimes it took the cameraman a few seconds to focus on a number of the shots. All of the long distance shots were grainy and not clear and the medium range shots were not good either. I know the concert was indoors, but I've seen other indoor videos that did not have this problem.  Did I get a bad DVD or did anyone else have this problem 
 This marble maze looks so fun and cute. However, it's actually useless and incredibly frustrating. The pieces don't fit together well and tend to fall over when you look at them--much less when you try to roll a marble through them. Also, the configurations pictured on the box don't work at all. Either our giraffe is missing a critical piece, or the wood planks are supposed to magically levitate. Ugh, I'm returning this immediately 
 I can't believe I'm being told how to dress, where to put the ball point pen, and not to talk while chewing food. Is he suggesting this program is for professional, intelligent adults? I read the reviews before I bought it, but got the CD audio version from Nightingale Conant thinking it was expanded in some way, but indeed, the negative reviews for the book are applicable here. Save your money, if you are under 14 years of age, just ask your Dad for common sense tips... it's probably better.  
 Truly it is. I watched it once, and then just yesterday and it still was painful to watch. Not because of the acting necessarily, although I think Kidman is one lousy actress in any of her films and this one is no exception.   But the story...what happened? Seriously in the beginning it's not so bad. Yet the middle and end begin to terribly fall apart- especially since in one scene they're saying one thing and then saying a completely other thing in another scene. Basically we're pulled along it seems to either the wives being robots like the old film says- and then we're told it was just really chips in their brain making them housewives? And somehow the chips disappear in the end and they become their real selves again? Then they make a real huge twist in the end which I guess I shouldn't give away but is just real tacky I think.  Just...a mess of a film. I don't know what happened, but it really fell apart in no time. If you're interested in the story, then watch the old one- that sticks to their story all the way through very well. This remake though avoid seriously.  1/ 
 Being a mother of three boys, boys have less to prove to "mommy" as they do for society.  They are the ones who join the military, police, and fire to protect our way of life. They are the ones who's only acceptable role is to provide for them selves and their families.  Society holds the role of men higher than for women.  This book berates the role of men and reduces it to another means to bash and belittle them.  Honestly, how would  misandry feminist know anything about men. Their entire view is to spread hate and lies 
 If you are new to "Law of Attraction" material you will find a lot of good info here.  The content of the book is good.  It is valid.  George clearly learned all these lessons the hard way.  However, he does not seem to realize that the forces he is working with are all part of the "Law of Attraction".  Had he researched the "Law of Attraction" before writing this book he would have had a more "meaty" offering.  He understands that the principles he presents work.  But he does not understand what makes them work or their TRUE potential.  The principles he promotes are not new.  Anyone who wants to truely KNOW the potential of these priciples as well as what makes them work not to mention a more thorough understanding of how to make them work more effectively should keyword search "Law of Attraction".  Esther Hicks, Wayne Dyer, Bob Doyle, Bob Proctor,  and several others have entire courses on the topic in book and audio form that will take you light years beyond George's work.  I will not knock George's work.  It is good and sound but it is incomplete and he does not seem to understand the true nature of the forces he is using to improve his life.  If he did, he would be astounded at their true potential.  He would also realize that simply "thinking positive thoughts" is only the begining.  He should study the "Law of Attraction" then write a sequal to the book entitled, "Oh, I Forgot To Mention... 
 I bought this for my computer, and it is useless.  The unit does not have enough power to provide back up power to my machine.  Be very careful when purchasing these.  I would first recommend contacting the manufacturer to see what they would recommend.  APC has offered to give me a discount on a new one if I use this as a trade in, but it would cost me a fortune to ship it.  Tiger Direct will (according to the website) only guarantee items against defect.  Therefore, I'm left with an expensive doorstop.  Don't make the same mistake, research before you buy!  My 19" monitor and Pentium 4 are too much for the 350VA 
 The title of the book was a bit misleading. The Playboy Mansion was only mentioned in about 10% of the book, and it was not the part of the book where everyone was having most of the wild parties. It was the part where she sought refuge from the crummy life she was living with her father, who was Hugh Hefner's doctor.  Her father was a mess.   The rest of the book was repetitious- how many times can you tell about parties which all sound the same-- sex, drugs, more sex, etc.  Actually, since she was so young, the whole book was pathetic and pitiful.  What a life for a teenager.  This book is very sad. 
 It cannot be said that Robbins doesn't know how to write beautifully or elegantly. The problem is that his prose seems to be thrown around for no purpose other than literary masturbation. Yes, there are plenty of times when it helps to enrich the story, but there are even more moments where the language detracts and even derails the story. If I remember correctly there were as many as two chapters (albeit short ones) that did nothing to develop the central themes and plot lines - it was just Robbins spinning his wheels, beating the proverbial dead horse.  The bottom line was that there is are excellent themes and a good story hidden inside of the metaphorical playground he has created. I can only imagine that his enthusiastic following finds this to be the very reason for their love of his work. I find it to be the very reason for my abhorrence. To me it just screamed of Robbins trying too hard to become a literary legend, the stuff graduate courses are taught around.  The reason for my anger and annoyance wasn't that I wasted my time, but was that I had to spend so much of my time to enjoy it. Perhaps my downfall was that I hit a particularly dense section just at the same time that I was taking a long flight, although reading while I fly is one of my favorite times to read. I was angry because I was spending quality reading-time trying to slog through a book that I was getting more frustration than pleasure from.  It has been a couple of weeks since I have finished the book, and my initial rage has subsided. I have decided, upon a lengthy period of digestion, that I am not ready give up on him quite yet. I still have Jitterbug Perfume and Another Roadside Attraction sitting on my shelf, waiting for their number to come up. Robbins has one more chance to redeem himself before I write him off completely 
 Clare Ballenger works as a divorce councellor, helping women find closure as their marriages fall apart, but Clare's own life is not exactly perfect. She lost her husband years before to a hunting 'accident' and has felt guilty ever since. Although two men are madly in love with her, Clare treats both of them as 'friends,' refusing to take their proposals seriously. Meanwhile, Clare's best friend, Dora has gotten back with her husband Son, against Clare's advice. Clare believes that Son can only make Dora unhappy.   Clare's batting average in terms of seeing what's going on around her falls even lower when her daughter's marriage falls apart as well. Still, Clare keeps busy building a retreat center for divorcing and divorced women on land given her by her mother-in-law. There, near the bay, Clare hopes to bring a peace to troubled women that she herself cannot find.   Author Cassandra King writes evocatively of the south, with families who have known one another for generations, instinctual distrust for imported Yankees, still-strained racial relations, and especially a kind of sisterhood. In QUEEN OF BROKEN HEARTS, women are the only characters with any depth--all of the men, including love interests Rhy and Lex, seem to exist only in their relationship to the women of their life. Indeed, Dory's husband Son refuses to go anywhere without his wife, and Clare's final decision between the two men who love her is driven not by the qualities of these men themselves, but by Clare's relationships with other men.   Although King's writing is strong and occasionally highly emotional, I found the story confusing and the characters sometimes unsympathetic. From the very beginning, when Clare ran out from a restaurant rather than face Son, Clare refuses to confront her own wishes and needs--which could have been the basis for a character arc, but if so, it was one King didn't fully explore.   Although QUEEN OF BROKEN HEARTS was occasionally frustrating, Kings writing was strong enough to propell me through the story. 
 I've never understood why this is mandatory reading in british literature classes. First of all, it's not written about Britts, it wasn't written in English, tho some argue it's a "really old form" of English, and the story is hardly original as the author of it (unknown BTW) merely stole old epic Germanic poems, twisted them, used some christian revisionism in the text to remove the pagan religion of the people the story is actually about and then slapped it altogether. I don't care how great the translation is, the text itself is garbage which is probably why the author is unknown. No one ever cared since it stunk so bad. The fact literature snobs think this is something special or even remotely unique should speak more about them then it. The ONLY thing this has going for it is that it's really really old. For whatever that's worth 
 Movies that show graphic child murder are worthless.  I didn't bother finishing this one 
 Unfortunately, I was forced to read this book by my photography professor. Every word, every page, was sheer hell to struggle through. Trying to follow Barthe's chaotic train of thought is next to impossible. This book is full of navel-gazing gibberish that can only loosely be described as "English". He admits to not being a photographer, and goes on to claim photography itself doesn't exist. How then, did he write a whole monstrous book on photography? And moreover, why am I being subjected to it?  My heart is warmed somewhat when I read of Mr. Barthe's history. He spent a lifetime suffering from tuberculosis, and ended it splattered across the front of a van. Good. The bastard deserved it for what he's inflicted on hapless undergrads around the world. 
 Youve all lost your minds.Please take a break.2 years or so.In this time listen to your first cd.Notice the awesome sound???The bass,the drums.Notice the singer friggin going crazy.Now when you make the next cd make sure the tone is exactly the same as the first.Exactly.Nothing different.It was perfect.Like KFC chicken!!!Also Jon,start wearing the Adidas suit again and maybe youll have a flashback and start singing with true emotion again.Also get rid of the lame Masters of the Universe mic stand!Money has destroyed yet another great band!!!! 
 A friend recently loaned me the first few graphic novels in this series, and I have to say, the writing was like a zombie going through the motions, shambling forward in a sequence of uninteresting and predictable steps.  And like a zombie, this lacked the spark of life that I think distinguishes such comics as The Sandman, Fables, Last Man, etc.  Using zombies as a device should have been a no-brainer (pun intended), but to totally rely on this device without bringing more to the table gives one a huge sense of been there, done that.  While not a total disaster, this was definitely flat reading propped up by the occasional grotesque image to keep it in any way interesting 
 After reading the first book *(which was catastropha) and reading the second which was really good, I thought that the series is taking off, I was mistaken, the third book is slow, and boring, you can see very well that Stephan king has no Idea what so ever where he is going to take that series  Nothing much is happening, and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas, the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find (And better written as well) in dragon lance series, or other adventure books, also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books,  reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book, which some say is very boring  I guess this is where the adventure end for me.. 
 The author wrote this in the 80's when the future of academia was looking a little bleak so I can forgive him some of his pessimism, but the book is rather dreary and has the principal effect of scaring away those considering a doctoral program (which is perhaps a good thing).  The book has three critical flaws:  it's 100 pages too long, it's dated (especially the material on computers and sexual harassment), and the author has the annoying belief that social science dissertations are the only "full" dissertations.  By suggesting that his own field of Sociology is the most difficult field of study, the author alienates many potential readers and loses any claim of impartial observation.  All of the useful gems of advice are covered in a shorter and more optimistic book written by Evelyn Hunt Ogden on the same subject.  Read that one instead 
 As said by other reviewers, a lot of what was in the original story was changed, and the film was updated to the time period where it was. The boys are American, from a military school, and talk about fear of the Russians snatching them up and drafting them for their athletic teams. The choice of making them from a military school may have been a poor choice - it may have hurt the belief of the transition from normal boys to animals. I don't want to sound like I'm stereotyping people in the military, but people in general already think there's a thin line between military experience in matters of war and the feelings of a wild animal.  Basically, I think the biggest problem with this film is that the storytelling is lost. You don't feel like there's a transition to barbarism like you did in the book and the 1963 film. For example, during the bonfire sequence Jack is shouting out directions: "OK, you be the pig, we'll be the hunters," and everyone chases the selected kid around the fire. (not actually hurting him, mind you, just chasing him) That's not chaos nor barbarism, that's an organized celebration. It's about as uncivilized as a frathouse orientation. The director tries to play this scene out like it's a terrible thing, but it just doesn't come across that way.  I might also add that this shares a similar problem with another modern adaptation, that being the John Hurt "1984." That film, if I recall correctly, didn't have a single "Big Brother is Watching You." Likewise, this film doesn't have a single, "Kill the pig, spill her blood!" That's right, the most famous line from the book is not even in this movie. Actually, a kid in one scene says quietly, "We killed a pig." That's about it. This leaves out an important part in the transition of the children from civilization to animal-like behavior. The fact the boys relished in the killing of a wild animal, chanting and screaming, "KILL THE PIG! SLIT HER THROAT! SPILL HER BLOOD!" was one of the most poignant moments of the book and 1963 film, and is one of the most recognizable literary quotes next to "Tell me about the rabbits, George."  On a final note, the character of Piggy is ruined in this film. Danuel Pipoly was terrible in the role, and sounds like he was plucked from an elementary school play. I don't wanna give too much away, but I was happy when "something something" happened to him. That sounds mean but it's true, and it's a very bad thing in a film like this.  This film could have been good, but it fails on all levels. The transition from schoolboys to animalistic roots is unbelievable, making the whole point of the story lost on the audience. The best part of the whole thing to me was that marine at the end, and he's in about ten seconds of film time. I hate comparing it to the 1963 film version so much, but I would really suggest people see that instead. Avoid this unless you can catch it on cable and watch at your own discretion 
 I started to read this book with high expectations. I believe that a strong dose of commonsense sometimes can do more than a lot ot analytical expertise (I have a Ph.D. in Economics from MIT, and through the years I have come to recognize the limitations of hard analytical methods). The first few chapters of the book were OK. However, I was expecting the book to end with a bang, but it did end with a whimper. The author does not provide a model that can be used to forecast anything. He basically tells you to build your own. There are two possibilities:  1) You have enough technical expertise to build an econometric model of the US economy that would potentially be useful to forecast the stock market.   2) You have no analytical skills.  In case 1) you will find out that the book is basically useless, as it contains nothing new or original. The author makes a lot of noise about tracking rates of change instead of levels, but anyone who does econometrics knows he just transformed his variables so that they are stationary, a requirement for doing meaningful regressions.   In case 2) after reading the book there is nothing you can do to forecast the stock market except possibly to read the comments in Mr. Ellis web site.   The leading relationships that Mr. Ellis claims exist between variables like personal consumption expenditures and the stock market are not easy to find (assuming they exist) and the graphical tools used by Mr. Ellis are totally insufficient for the task.   Let me end quoting from the book (Appendix D, page 263):  "Those choosing to construct their own charts ... may notice some discrepancies between charts constructed from data on these Web sites and the charts in this book. This results from the "rebasing" of the statistics by the government and other bureaus that use them. As far back as the early 1980s, the elapsed time between peaks and throughs in the leading and lagging indicators was extremely clear in the years the data was reported and for five to ten years afterward. However, in following years these lead/lag times often shrunk or disappeared altogether as the data was restated and rebased by the issuing bureaus. 
 I made the mistake of not watching this before allowing my 3.5 year old to.  I don't consider myself overprotective, but these stories have a kid abusing a dog (Pluto), a kid having his pants pulled down and being spanked over someone's knee (including showing the kid's bottom from above), and Donald chasing Chip & Dale with a revolver in the first 2 cartoons among other things.  I turned it off after that.  Talked to several other friends to see if I was overreacting & they recall seeing that kind of stuff when we were little but all agreed they don't want their toddlers seeing it anytime soon.  Was a little surprised this made it out of Disney especially in today's day & time....May be okay for older kids, but I don't really want to explain guns or why it's not funny/okay to abuse our dogs to my 3.5 year old 
 To the point; The plot is boring, the herione is boring, the storyline and characters are not believable. Total waste of money. And a disgrace to a wonderful piece of american liturature. I am willing to read a parody, spin off, or background story based off of Mitchell's GWTW. However, Ms. Randal did a poor job and wasted good paper on this flop. She could have made this story MUCH better.  
 Alright, I am a big fan of the Left Behind Series but the prequels do not compare at all to the original series. The third installment was the worst of the three being used to push a certain religious belief. Personally I felt it was veyr preachy and did not emphasize on the story. The book went no where, it was dry and boring and i didnt even watn to finish it but forced myself to. It picked up towards the last 30-50 pages but thats about it. If anyone is to read the prequels, the first book was the best and half of the second book was alright. But sorry to say the third was a huge dissappointment. The authos were just using the book as a tool to spread their owns beliefs. But im not bashing the Left Behind Series because it was an excellent read of suspent and thrill which was not at all present in the Rapture 
 The cover is deceptive as to the content. This book I rate minus zero. It contains extremely degrading sadistic text and illustrations through-out without any redeeming qualities.  Amazon should practice greater disclosure when it comes to presenting products with so much abusive content(perhaps a rating system) so those reasonable carefull in there selections do not purchase such dehumanizing content unknowingly. Greater and clearer discloser would benifit both the buyer and seller avoiding uncessary resentment as well as benifit society as a whole.  PS I not religously oriented and liberal in my viewpoints within limits 
 I'm sorry - generally I'm a fan of business stories, but this one really missed the mark.  In attempting to bring a sense of realism to his characters, it seems he focused too much on story plot and character development and not enough on the mechanics of politics and providing real examples of how to deal with it from all levels.  I want "take back to my desk" application.  This book fell short 
 The examples are archaic, the introductory material weak, the discussion of how to write cursory.   Save your money for STRONG MEASURES by Dacey and Jauss, a much more expensive book, but worth it many times over 
 I can't speak to the content of this book, having only skimmed it in the library, but buyers should be forewarned that it is one of the most shoddily printed books you will ever see. It looks as if it were typeset with an inkjet printer and run off on a photocopier -- both badly in need of new ink cartridges. I understand that there isn't much money to be made in academic publishing, but this is disgraceful. In such a case, it would have been better to publish this exclusively as an e-book, and skip the paper altogether 
 Predator is the worst book I have read in 2 months (I read a lot of books).  It is too dis-jointed and incongruous and lacks cohesiveness of plot and events.  The characters are poorly drawn (I hardly recognized the Scarpetta and Marino of earlier books).  The transition to reveal the perpetrator was abrupt and weak, leaving me feeling: "HUH??" This the fourth (and it will be the last) book by Cornwell that I have read.  It was totally disappointing and I spent extra time on it just so I could complete it and "Forget about it" 
 I don't know why this book is a classic.  Foreigners come to Babar's home and kill his mother.  He goes to the land of the foreigners to learn to be just like them because the are so swell and all.  He then takes their ways back home with him.  marries his cousin and gets everyone to wear clothes like the foreigners.  This is a nightmare, not a children's book 
 The first thing that one should realize when reading Marilyn Frye's book is that it is not a work of philosophy.  It is propaganda.  The only people who will be convinced by her arguments are those people who agreed with her to begin with.  Frye's analogy of the birdcage is often cited, but her actual argument is circular in nature.  She says that if one only looks a one bar of the birdcage, it will seem like no oppression is happening.  With a single bar, the bird could just go around by sidestepping.  To see the birdcage, oppression, one has to move from the microscopic to the macroscopic.  Instead of looking at one bar, you have to look at the whole to see that there is a system of oppression, a system of bars.  Sounds good, right?  The problem is that it is circular when Frye puts that analogy to work proving the oppression of women.  Take one of her examples of female oppression such as men opening doors for women.  If you look at opening doors as an isolated event, you cannot see it as a "cage bar."  But if you look at door opening in the macroscopic, that it is one event in a system of oppression, you can see that the action of opening a door for a female is oppressive.  Did anyone see the problem there?  To prove systemic oppression she must display the "bars" that create that oppression, and to prove that some event is a "bar" in a systemic oppression, one must look at that event in the perspective of its participation in a system of oppression.  She came full circle.  But the force of Frye's argumentation isn't with its soundness (which it has little), it is with her persuasiveness as she makes ad hominem arguments.  She attempts to trick her reader into agreeing with her arguments.  She does this by clever examples, such as juxtaposing a rich, pampered male skier with a poor, black ghetto mother.  She includes an entire section about abduction and brainwashing, and hopes that her reader doesn't realize that the whole section is a weak analogy (which she conveniently forgets to posit how the analogy relates to actual world events.)  In the end, her conclusion that women should separate themselves from men into lesbian communes is ridiculous.  I don't see many women converting to lesbianism at whim and moving into the country.  But I don't think they would be able to anyway, Frye gives no clear idea of what a "woman untouched" would actually be, so no woman leaves the book with a clear path to what she should be working toward.  If you like man bashing, especially homosexual male bashing, you will enjoy this book.  If you are trying to get a sense of what Feminism is about, don't read this book.  This is radical Feminism, and should not be taken as representative of what sane feminists believe 
 This was a great scoop.  Worked well, looks nice, flashy, but it started to degrade after a year or so.  At first it was juat a little mark inside the scoop but it grew.  I put up with it but now it's rusting.  Nothing worse then scooping out orange vanilla ice cream.  For the price I paid, I would have expected this scoop to last longer.  Yeah, it's flashy, but I wanted longevity.  Next time I'll buy a cheaper scoop 
 WHY OH WHY! as a fan of the 'proper' Blind Dead films and having the occasional dabble with that nutter Jess Franco i thought 'why not,how bad could this be?...' very in actual fact. Gone are the skeletal Templers,gone are the spectral horses they ride on,gone is the ethereal doom laden bell and chant sountrack that accompanies them,gone are the sexy dolly birds...gone are...you get the idea. In comes bored blokes in white dressing gowns with flour on their faces,no horses,no atmospheric music..oh and not very dolly dolly birds. Its a shambles,sorry but just for completists...and fans of flourey faces.   
 I purchased this book hoping for some artistic pictures such as might be suitable for framing.  What I found instead is a jumble of photos that are anything but.  A completely disappointing collection at best 
 For those of you who have not yet read this book: this book is about a white-wannabe black girl who pays way too much attention to her friend's puberty. I have never read a worse book in my life. This book is shallow, boring, and completely pointless 
 I don't like her routine in this DVD at all.  I don't like the strechie.  It's a completely waste and it won't give you the same workout as hand weights or balance ball.  I solde the DVD the 2nd day I bought it.  However, I do like her 'Shrink Your Female Fat Zone,' which uses dumbell and balance for upper body, lower body and abs 
 I'm so tired of these books that claim to be the "Best". Sorry but this was a horrible book for Windows XP. Almost everything I looked up was not found in this book, (simple things that I found easily in my last XP book, "Headaches in Windows XP" that was a great book, but I lost it) I thought of re-selling this one but couldn't bare the thought of someone else having the same experience w/ it, so I threw it in the trash...literally! 
 I agree with Masala1226: many of the chapters were quite boring.  I think the author could have done a lot more with the story, especially some of the dialogue, which sometimes didn't seem to fit what was going on.  I know she translated some of the original Italian, and because it took place hundreds of years ago that makes a difference, but still.  I found it bland, and rushed through it just to get to the end, hoping it would get better, which is didn't.  For someone who did so much research, she should have made it more interesting 
 Too bad there isn't a 0 star rating. This was simply awful.  I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years - waded though a lot of her semi-readable stuff - waiting for another decent installment.  But I give up.  No more Kaye Scarpetta for me.  This book cured me - for good 
 Although there have been some updates in the essay on Christian Science, it's very sad to see the persistent attack on Mary Baker Eddy based on falsities. I have no knowledge of the other "cults" under discussion, but my knowledge of Christian Science is so different from what is written that it makes me doubt the accuracy of anything else published in this book. The falsities abound, starting with incorrect names and events. But the most egregious errors come from the ridicule of a theology that is misunderstood and misrepresented. I kinow several conservative Christians who have changed their minds about these claims after we've had a chance to have an honest heart-to-heart discussion of these issues. Please listen more carefully to those who know the subject matter better 
 I can do all the exercises here, with sufficient rests between them, plus a warm up and warm down, in 15 minutes.  So what's the other 15 minutes of this 30 minute DVD?  Um, the instructor blabbering on about nothing.  The exercises are as basic as can be, you could do them without a DVD to follow because he doesn't switch things up at all to keep them interesting , and there isn't even any music to get into.  This is the least useful exercise DVD I own -- I know that sounds really negative, but anything by Denise Austin or QuickFix would be a lot more interesting and a lot more creatively put together.  You can find other DVDs with several different workouts on them so that you can rotate the routines, and for the same price.  Keep looking and don't buy this one

 Ayn Rand's fictional story about "when the engine of the world stopped" is rather poorly written. The philosophical perspective presented in some of the speeches and some of the events in this overly long story is individualism that knows no restraint. I got the feeling while reading this book that there was no such thing as society, no such thing as kindness or compassion. In fact it seemed like compassion and kindness were moral faults to be sneered at. Anyway, the story was second rate at best and kind of horrifying at worst.  Judging the literary quality of a book may be a matter of taste, however I am not alone in considering the book to be poorly written. The specific areas where it is wanting in quality are there: (1) The characters are poorly developed and seem to exist mainly to advance the philosophical agenda of the author. (2) the situations and conversations presented in the story lack credibility. What person have you ever met who launches into a 4 or 5 page philosophical presentation while courting or love making?  (3) the 'bad' characters are 'bad' mostly because they think that social responsibility and compassion matter. Somehow compassion is a vice that the author distorts until it cannot be recognised. Such departures from real life experience that we all share really degrades the story line into parody - again this is done to advance the philosophical agenda of the author. The parody is not intentional it is merely the product of poor composition (4) the story is at time interminably verbose. What could be said in a few lines is stretched out into tedious pages by the author because she had an inadequate ability to write in the English language. Verbosity does not clarify and it does not improve a story line.  I am sure that this book appeals mainly to people in their later teens - before they gained enough life experience and enough good sense to reject the stupidity that the author seems to think is a virtue 
 I am concerned that the title of this book implies that those people who suffer from clinical depression are somehow at personal fault for their disease and, perhaps even worse, have somehow "failed" if they take prescribed medications to remain healthy 
 This is a great starter deck for any duelist.  With just a few booster packs this deck will become unstopable!  After only a few days of practice with this deck I had beaten all of my friends who had been dueling for months. 
 Wow, she has to travel and stay in hotels. Never would have guessed that. 
 "The dream of simultaneous orgasm is just a herring dying on a mirror." - 92 in the Shade  For those readers seeking the arch, the cynical glib and metafictional malaise, look no further: this author has street cred.  If, on the other hand, you expect a read with a plot point there and here, step aside 
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 Harriets adventures include feeding laxatives to her rivals, and her bright friend's big plan is to set off a smoke bomb (incendiary) during a school assembly. Either one will get a kid expelled, arrested, and in the newspapers. Not amusing ! Then there's Golly telling her about the virtues of lying. If there is a lesson that could be drawn (which the movie misses), Harriet's secrecy from her parents manages to create a full blown crisis out of nothing, because she is showing the sort of behavior that (in a kid 2 years older) would be take as a possible symptoms for other bad things like self-mutilation or bulemia, as in the movie "Thirteen. 
 Other reviews have homed in on the frequent nit-picking and general vindictiveness of this book.  I agree with these criticisms, but I'm not going to revisit them here.  The deeper problem lies with the Ayn Rand Institute, which only gives scholarly access to persons guaranteed to toe ARI's party line.  As long as the Ayn Rand Institute refuses full, unconditional scholarly access to Miss Rand's papers, any biographical efforts produced under their aegis will not be taken seriously by anyone who respects proper academic practice.  Nor should they be.  
 Usually when soundtracks come out you look forward to new recordings by familiar artists - Kimberley Locke's "Better Than This" is really the only true standout on this entire album. This is a new song by her and while it's an EXCELLENT song, the entire CD wasn't worth the cash. Howie Day's "Collide" is a great song but it's all over the radio as it is and his album is great - so if you're a huge Kimberley Locke fan, you may want to check out her new song - but other than that, this album isn't really worth it 
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 This book is horrible and chocked full of slanted thinking (?) and outrght lies aimed at dividing this country even further. It's a sad, sad day when this is what American politics have become 
 I have yet to see how Ice T keeps getting roles in movies.  He is such a bad actor, and he has no screen presence.  Yet he keeps cropping up in inane movies like this one.  This time he's a traitorous pilot who fakes his own death so he can resurface working for some drug or munitions lord and steal a stealth fighter to accomplish assassinations for the criminal.  He is tracked by his former co-pilot, a straight arrow guy whose marriage is floundering because he spends too much time at work?  Come on, ladies..you marry a military man, you expect this.  Having recently seen HOT SHOTS 1 & 2, this is the kind of movie those gems spoofed; this would have been better had it been a spoof.  Aside from Ice T's stony performance, we get Wishmaster's Andrew Divoff with some kind of phony accent; Costas Mandylor huffing and puffing his way through his standard role; Erika Eleniak pouting in her few scenes as Costas' estranged wife; and funniest of all, Ghostbusters' Ernie Hudson as the President of the United States. It's all tastelessly dull and routine, and I give it two stars only because I finished watching it 
 This was the most useless book I have ever read on being a parent.  The author goes on and on about how painful and excruciating breastfeeding is, and how all "girlfriends" can relate to this pain if they are breastfeeding.  Huh??  If she had read any books on breastfeeding at all or gotten some basic advice from a lactation consultant, she would realize that her baby was latched on incorrectly and would have corrected the problem.  Also, she talks about girlfriends hiding from their husbands in the house so that they can breastfeed?  What?!?!  This book just infuriated me, it was so shallow and pointless, I feel like the author lives in a world all her own, inhabited by stepford wife-like "girlfriends" who struggle incessantly with mothering a new baby and have to hide everything from their dumb husbands who are completely incompetent.  How insulting!!  Don't waste your time or money on this garbage 
 I bought this book hoping to get ideas of what to do and what to expect but instead all i got was discouraged and upset,  with every page the author makes you feel it is imposible to start your own clothing store and that you should basicaly find another dream.... well i have acomplished a few of my biggest dreams in life so far and i know that books like these and people like the author are those people out there who are not dreamers but people who lead very simple and risk free lives. I refuse for any one to make me feel like i should just give up because its going to be to hard!!! you have to keep going and risk a little for your dreams,   so to any one looking to buy this book i suggest not taking it seriuosly, I know from personal experience that dreaming big can realy pay off and dont let any one break that for you. if we did not have dreamers out there and only had the people who think every thing is imposible would we have: celebrities? Big Designers? the Light bulb?? gone into outer space???    Continue your road to your dream..... you will get there with or with out this book!!!!   
 I give James Bradley much credit for making this important, though unpalatable, story better known.  We need to realize that as human beings, Americans are not significantly better or worse than most others, especially when tested by the extremes of war.  However, Bradley's basic writing skills, as evidenced in this book, are not appropriate to an important historical volume.  He jumps back and forth between between ordinary colloquialisms and formal historical style.  He uses the first names of historical figures ("Curtis" for LeMay).  Some of his descriptions of firestorm effects are much overdrawn and unrealistic. There are internal contradictions.  He frequently uses sarcasm, which is completely inappropriate for a serious work of history.  It is most unfortunate that his poor writing has much diminished the contribution that this book could have made.  Further, a great annoyance is the word "Flyboys".  I lived through WWII, and my older brothers were in the Pacific theater throughout. One was a naval air crewman, who flew many missions over Japan.  In those days, I do not recall ever hearing the word "flyboys" used to describe any of our own or the enemy's air personnel.  I find the word sarcastic and derogatory 
 Silent No More is an interesting approach to promoting a greater understanding of Islam, in that it tracks the path towards understanding taken by author Paul Findley, who is himself a public figure.   I like the concept of tracking someone who begins basically ignorant of the Muslim faith and moves towards becoming an expert, but I'm not sure that the execution is all that good. Findley faces an almost-impossible task when he tries to share personal experiences as an elected official whose political career hasn't yet run its course. Knowing how down and dirty modern american politics can be, Findley must write every sentence as if its liable to be taken out of context and used to headline his opponent's next smear pamphlet. This restriction makes what could have been an honest and entertaining story an exercise in caution.   Reading this will indeed give you a greatly enhanced level of understanding of Islam, which is all the more important given recent world events, but you have to be prepared to slog through some rather boring prose.   I guess Findley felt a need to publish while the topical iron was hot, but I'm looking forward to reading his thoughts on the topic when he doesn't have to protect his image.  
 Back in the early 90's, Jane March made a big splash internationally with her uninhibited performance in the sexually explicit The Lover. Granted, the role didn't give her much to work with, but from a physical standpoint she made a big impression on a lot of filmgoers, including me. The movie garnered her a lot of notoriety and she had every opportunity to use that as a spring-board into a legitimate movie career. Unfortunately, choosing the unbelievably stupid Bruce Willis vehicle Color of Night as her follow-up probably killed any chance at a career that she had.   I've always found erotic thrillers to be quite a dubious genre. Most of the ones that I've seen, while sexually explicit, aren't really erotic. Nor are they thrilling in any way. This movie was following on the heals of the tremendous success of Basic Instinct and almost every studio was chomping at the bit to come out with something similar. As a result we ended up with some terrible films like Sliver, Jade, Body of Evidence and this film, Color of Night.   The plot goes something like this. Bruce Willis is a psychiatrist who has a patient dive out of his office window, going splat on the sidewalk below. He is so traumatized by the incident that he loses the ability to see the color red(!). He decides to take a break by visiting his psychiatrist friend played by Scott Bakula and hanging out with Scott's therapy group. He hopes that he might be able to make some sense as to what has happened. Scott's group is a motley crew of screwed up people, from a woman who is nymphomaniac, to a weird androgynous young boy. Bruce ends up meeting a beautiful young woman played by the delectable Jane March and he quickly falls in love with her. We get treated to explicit scenes of the two of them screwing in the pool, the bedroom, the bathtub and the shower. Meanwhile someone murders Scott Bakula and starts to wreck havoc with Bruce. He tries to figure out if it's someone in Scott's therapy group and on and on and so forth.   The movie is really quite laughable due to the fact of how serious Bruce Willis was apparently taking this movie. Virtually everyone else in the movie seems to have their tongue planted in their cheeks with their performances, but Bruce seemed to think that this might be an Oscar contender. Add to the fact that the plot is absolutely atrocious and contrived beyond comprehension, and add way too many red herrings, and the movie quickly becomes a chore to watch.   About the only thing this movie really had going for it was the explicit, but decidedly unerotic sex scenes. They really come across as more silly than anything else.   The only thing that I enjoyed was getting to see a slightly older Jane March in the buff and looking better than ever. What a smoking body!  But, like I mentioned before, she got a lot of the blame along with Bruce as to why the movie turned out so terrible and as a result, she has appeared in very few movies since. I still think that if she had been given the proper chance, she could have been a great actress, but people have all but forgotten about her by now.   It's really surprising that this movie didn't kill Bruce Willis' career. But I guess if he could survive Hudson Hawk & Bonfire of the Vanities, he could survive anything.   BTW, the version I watched was listed as being the "R-rated director's cut" with 17 additional "steamy" minutes added back into the film. Since I never saw the original cut I couldn't tell what might have been added back into this version. There is some fairly explicit sexual content and a shot of full frontal Bruce Willis nudity in the pool scene but nothing that's too strong.  Avoid this movie like it was herpes.   Color of Night is rated R and contains strong sexual content, nudity, graphic violence and strong language. 
 This is a barely passable pulp fiction "mystery" novel from Jonathan Kellerman revolving around a sex murder and some questionable rich kids.   In essence, this book is pretty much completely predictable, and burdened by lengthy explanations that, by the time you get to them, you've either guessed or stopped caring about.  The book starts off with premise - a young woman is brutally murdered and sexually molested, with no apparent leads, a cold case 20 years old - but it quickly degenerates, and the true perpetrators are apparent from early on.    Even as a light holiday, poolside, read - this book is lacking.  There are way too many lucky breaks and coincidences (the main character just happens to be old friends with a key witness' shrink) for this book to even approach plausible.  The characters are one dimensional and boring.  Even Milo, the gay cop, is just... boring.  Cliched.  A shabby excuse for a fleshed out character.    Give this book a pass - seriously.  I'm sure there are much better books to spend your $6 - $8 on. 
 If you want to spend 8 dollars to get a paper copy of a bunch (well really not that many) of recipes that are easy to find on the internet, go right ahead. I wish I hadn't 
 I must confess that I watched this movie after having seen "Howling II" which is the worst werewolf movie I've ever seen except for "An American Werewolf in Paris".  Thinking that the original had to be a lot better than the sequel, I watched the original "The Howling" with an open mind especially given the good reviews this movie has received, and I came away very disappointed in this movie.  Indeed, despite the good acting (Dee Wallace-Stone, especially for a horror movie), "The Howling" just fell flat on its face as a horror movie.  To be perfectly frank, I just did not find the werewolves to be frightening or scary at all...I thought they looked ridiculous, and the way the movie developed was just terrible in my opinion.  In turn, "The Howling" comes off like a joke more than anything else.  Ostensibly, the story seems quite compelling as a newscaster is attacked by a maniacal killer and then goes with her husband to a retreat to recover.  What transpires at the retreat, at least in theory, would seem to make for a scary movie, but the creators of this flick just blew it with the ridiculous looking werewolves, poor character development and, to a large degree, a lack of action or a lack of compelling action.  What action there was appeared absolutely laughable and totally ridiculous.  I just don't think the creators of this flick knew what to do with this movie when they got to the part at the retreat.  When I wasn't laughing at how terrible this movie was, I was VERY BORED watching "The Howling".  Frankly, I just thought the movie lacked luster and completely sucked.  Well, at least it is not as bad as "An American Werewolf in Paris", but that isn't saying much!  I would not recommend "The Howling" to any individual that is serious about his/her horror movies.  If all you want is some laughs and cheap thrills, maybe you will like this garbage, but I recommend sticking with "An American Werewolf in London" as it is, in the opinion of this reviewer, the greatest werewolf movie of all-time.  That being said, I must admit that I am completely mystified by the glowing reviews this movie gets...some people call "The Howling" a great horror movie, but I just call it rubbish 
 If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way ENTIRE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO 
 I love Billy Blanks Lower Body and Ultimate Bootcamp dvds.  I tried his Ab Bootcamp, thinking it would be great too, but what a letdown.  I'm not sure why so many other reviewers liked it so much...maybe it's just me.  His favorite move is standing and rotating the torso from side to side.  I felt it in the abs a little, but he keeps going back to it OVER AND OVER and it bothered my back. Also he makes some comment that your neck will stop hurting if you just suck it up and strengthen the neck muscles.  If you are pulling on your neck and using bad form that he teaches you, you can get hurt.  Most of the video is done standing up.  He focuses more on the obliques (sides) than the rectus abdominus (front).  At first I liked the move where you rotate your hip up and bring your elbow down, isolating the obliques.  But I got bored of it after 10 minutes of the same thing.  He does crunches standing up too.  You stand in this hunched over squatting position (which I'm sure is bad for the back), put your hands behind your head, and contract your abs, pulling your head down (pulling on the neck).  I thought this was a lot of work for the rest of the body but I didn't feel it in my abs at all.  I prefer to do crunches on the floor, which uses more resistance since you're lifting the upper body against gravity.  He does have some good floor moves in there at the end that I've never seen before.  It might be worth a rental to see those.  As usual, Billy shows his lack of stretching knowledge.  His stretching routine usually involves swinging the arms like in Tai Chi...which really doesn't stretch anything.  I found it weird that he does a quad stretch and a hamstring stretch at the end of an Ab workout.  Wouldn't you expect an ab stretch?  Or a back stretch?  This video is about 30 minutes.  It might seem short, but when you're targeting only 1 muscle group, that's a long time.  I thought my abs would be twice as sore compared to another dvd I have which is 15 mins, but the only thing that's sore is my back.  I guess I'll keep looking - I've heard good things about Gilad's Abs Workout 
 I bought this (luckily, used) based on the excellent reader reviews I read here on Amazon.  I could not have been more misled.  This is one of the worst self-improvement books I have ever read. It is bad beyond anything I could have expected, so bad that had I not gotten my hopes up for a good read with some good advice, I probably would have fallen out of my recliner laughing.  This book is a very thin gruel of other writers' ideas, dumbed down for the sort of reader who finds literary satisfaction in  romance novels. The substance of this book is nothing more than "If you write down what you want--and keep writing it down, if necessary--you'll get it."  Hmmm.    "Hmmm" is right.    Hardly anyone these days isn't familiar with the earlier New Age incarnation of this idea--writing affirmations--and anyone who has read the writings of the Founding Fathers of motivational self-improvement (like Napoleon Hill) has seen it as well.  Far, far too much of this book consists of anecdotes.  The anecdotes range in their effect from soporific to nauseating.  Take "Gloria's" story, for example.  An entire chapter is devoted to Gloria's search for love, for a husband.  She writes letters to a "soul mate" that she has not yet met.  Among her puerile love-maunderings, she writes a description of the soul mate she hopes to meet:  He is a "beautiful" dresser, and has "Strong hands, deep integrity, and spiritual truth," and a gift for "making and having money." She doesn't want the money because she's high maintenance and loves to spend; no, she wants the money "for the joy, love, peace, and bounty it can bring the world."  (Uh, yeah, sure Gloria.  Clearly you're one of those unfortuate individuals who believes her own bs.)  After two years of writing this sort of pabulum to herself, Gloria goes to a bar, gets picked up by a lawyer, and marries him 11 months later. As we all know, lawyers typically possess exactly the sorts of qualities she was looking for in a soul mate, so this outcome is hardly surprising....  The book doesn't get any better than this, and there is even a short chapter at the end of the book to help you rationalize the failure of the techniques (for lack of a better word) described between the interminable anecdotes.    Most importantly, the advice simply doesn't work.  This book really is a silly piece of nonsense.  Skip it. 
 This book seems to be comprehensive in its treatment of digital audio but unfortunately much of it is simply cut and paste from more technical articles with little attempt being made to digest and explain the material in a more accessible fashion.  For example the material on error correction on CD's hits the reader over the head with equations that come out of the blue and the reader couldn't hope to understand in a month of Sundays.  The material on analog to digital conversion is much the same. Nonetheless this book serves as a compilation of relevant topics in digital audio but fails to provide the reader with the intuition to really internalize the material.  
 The authors of this book have not reviewed the latest research on nutrition.  Consequently, their book will not tell you more than you already know.  If you know that vegetables are good for you, you don't need  this book.  That is all you will learn 
 Please understand that I am a die-hard cheesy movie buff.  Pause with me while I attempt to explain this movie.  Around 1960, a European filmmaker blended sci-fi horror with sexploitation.  What this premise lacks in originality it usually gains in our twisted curiousity.  Hope springs eternal.  An exotic dance troupe (i.e.; strippers) and their male manager, stranded on a remote Pacific island, find a dead scientist dangling in a big web.  They find the dead man's research notes that reference a strange "hissing" around the perimeter of his camp.  This is a promising start.  The women are worth viewing as they display ample cleavage and bare legs.  The "giant spiders" are not giant.  They are about the size of cats.  They are as "real" as discount store Halloween decorations.  Never mind batteries, you can almost see the windup key turning.  Classic sci-fi fans who recall "Tarantula" should adjust their expectations.  Low budget is, after all, low budget.  I know it sounds an unlikely thing to say, but the script spends too much time on the "girlie" show.  Between the basic B&W photography and the constraints of the censor, attractive women just hanging out can get dull.  Even the occasional catfight can't ease the tedium.  When the boss turns monstrous with spider venom, I thought the story would get moving.  No such luck.  The mutated guy disappears into the jungle, and only sporadically reappears.  The story comes to the inevitable climax.  No, I don't mean that kind of climax.  Ultimately, the script can't decide between sexploitation and horror.  It succeeds at neither.  This flick is okay for we of the cheesy movie hall of fame fan club.  Not great, just okay.  The low priced DVD edition is adequate from a technical quality standpoint.  Go slowly into this dark night.  ;-)          
 Yes it is true that you need special learning to understand Pound.  I did my undergraduate thesis in Pound and I am still confused.  I am now a student in Biology. Pound said (somewhere) that biologists are the best scientists because they observe the world. He thought scientists were stupid otherwise.  Since Pound I have discovered Dawkins, Ridley, William James, E. O. Wilson just to name a few authors.  They make sense to me.  Get the Cantos only if you are really dedicated to understanding one man's view of history and culture. He really believed that culture particularly past cultures affected people.  In this sense he was a behavioralist.  A little science would have helped him. This book is a throw back to the age of the oral narative when gods came down and took possession of a person. Somewhere in the Cantos he says : "The Africans have more sense than the Greeks"  who says?  Where is the proof.  He thinks he has found some. Also he writes: "We should keep our promises to the Arabs" maybe that is true.  I wonder, as a follower of Musolini would he be a follower of Osama today just to get into hot water and be controversial.  Like Homer he was blind as a bat! "A serious Character"  a biography of Pound is a good read.  
 This film had a lot of potential--interesting premise, compelling characters and a strong cast--but something keeps it from gelling into a satisfying story.  There's a flatness to the film that is probably the fault of the director.  The above-average cast, that includes the wonderful Bonnie Hunt, Michael Learned and several other very likable young actors, seems squandered somehow by a lackluster dialogue and unrelenting low key tone.  The redemption that this viewer wanted to see emerge from the script at the conclusion didn't quite make it.  A pity as, despite the film's continuing weaknesses, I wanted more than melancholy for its lead characters.  
 Generations of sad dingbats have stood on mountains waiting for some all-important 'End Time', and when the predicted dates come and go, is anyone dissuaded?  Of course not. They just re-interpret the same old ambiguities and come up with another date. "No, really, THIS TIME we KNOW we've got it right."  Because books like this exploit the terminally self-centred, who want it all to be about 'ME'.  "I" will be there when it all happens. It's all for "MY" generation. It's all focused on "ME".  LaHaye and Jenkins  clearly capitalise on these feelings, as have generations before them.  Nobody ever went broke overestimating the gullibility of the human race 
 What a waste of money.  This book wouldn't even make a good short story.  It's a bunch of random thoughts, put together in a sort of stor 
 I was at the airport, getting ready to fly out to Cali and I found this book in the airport gift shop- I thought what a stroke of luck I had getting a Stephen King title at such a juncture... I'm a huge  fan. Despite the fact that I started and finished the book exactly as the plane took off and landed, I was sorely disappointed.  Much ado about nothing would be an overstatement 
 You know, I read daily, and I adore a wide variety of genres and styles. I began this book with an optimistic interest. Unfortunately, in the end, I found this book to be a bitter disappointment.   The book started very promisingly, with Ms. Morrison breathing a vivid life into her characters and her town. I was immediately invested in these characters; identifying with their emotions and their lives. However, I did find the writing to be extremely disjointed in some areas, which left me with a vague sense of dissatisfaction. As the book progressed, this disjointed style grew, as did my sense of dissatisfaction.  At some point, my initial interest and joy, turned into a sense of obligation. I never start a book without finishing it. Unfortunately, finishing this book became a chore. I grew more and more annoyed with Ms. Morrison's odd style of writing -- and the near-cliche oddities of the citizens who populated Ms. Morrison's town. (Apparently, the more oddities one can ascribe to one's characters, the better.) Overkill would be an understatement.   In the end, the novel that began so promisingly, left me feeling annoyed and bitterly disappointed. The last half of this novel felt rushed, and underdeveloped. Not because Ms. Morrison lacks talent, but because she apparently lacks follow-through.   Perhaps I wouldn't have been so disappointed with the development of this novel if I had not learned to care for these characters. It is not the fate of the characters which I find disappointing, it is the hurried and nonsensical style with which that fate was related. These characters deserved better 
 First off, 9th WOnder's beats are sick. All of the albums that he handles most of the production, except the mostly dissappointing (to me) Minstrel Show, have consistenly tight production. THis album is no excpetion. But Skyzoo definitly DOES NOT bring back NYC. I can tell that he made this ablum in 3 days because most of the verses lack flow (i.e. sounds like every wack mainstream NY rapper; Faboluous, GUN-IT, Jay-ZZZZZZ). Accolades from Jay-Z and Nas don't mean anything, as they are merely hyped up one album wonders. If 9Th made these beats for Kaze again, MURS or Buckshot, or somebody like MF DOOM (a true NYC lyricist)or maybe bring back Jeru tha DAMAJA?? then maybe I'd have an album I can listen to for more than three days and be able to get high to like only a real album can.If you like 9th wonder, and you can tolerate someone like Skyzoo who isn't that bad but should have put more effort into this ablum (maybe a week would help)then it is a must buy. If not, check for the instrumental and make your own 3 day high 
 well, where to begin...not the most inspirational album ever, a bit of a let down from the first i thought seeing as the film was soooo "GOOD". some good tracks like lo fidelity all stars and the fiddle one errrr.....ok then. so in conclusion..ladies and gentlemen scotty DONT ! :- 
 If this is supposed to be a satire, then the author forgot the key element...wit. This waste of wood pulp lacks intelligence and humor, and only the most ditzy of flakes would be able to stomach reading more than halfway through. Here's a little advice for the author; take thirty-five cents out of your coin purse, drop it into the nearest pay phone, dial the number of whoever told you that you'd make a decent author, and inform them that they have made baby Jesus weep 
 My all time favorite book is Deavers THE BLUE NOWHERE and The Testament by another author.  I think this book is on the bottom of my list.  It was a combo term paper and novel.  I wonder where the editor of this book is.  Where was he/she?  It read like it was written by two different people and a poor editor combined them.    Don't worry Jeff, I'll still buy your next book...I've bought them all but please ...get a second opinion about your editor. I good editor wouldn't have let it go out in this shape. 
 I love Alfred Hitchcock as a film maker, but I was very surprised at just how contrived this movie is--watching it was not a great experience.  I kept asking myself "What?" time after time as unbelievable scene after unbelievable scene played out.  There seems to be very little attention to detail in the script and the shooting here, and it turned out to be a very normal movie-watching experience.  Much of what happens onscreen is simply unbelievable.  From Stewart--supposedly a career cop--following Novak in his car just some thirty yards behind her and parking even closer when she gets out of her car to the two of them falling madly in love without ever meeting each other, this film suffers from contrived scene after contrived scene.  There's a contrived inquisition of sorts that seems simply weird and out of place, as we have no idea who any of the characters are, and in which Stewart is accused of allowing his partner to fall to his death--without a bit of regard to the truth of the matter.  Add to that a completely unbelievable murder based on the murderer's "knowledge" of Stewart's fear of heights, as well as the just as unbelievable death at the end of the movie, and you have what looks more like an amateur's first film, supported by the big bucks of Hollywood.  The pace of the movie is also tedious at best.  Hitchcock chooses to spend many minutes showing us Stewart driving (and making tight turns while hardly turning the wheel a bit, another lack of attention to detail), and we have quite a bit of dialogue between Stewart and an artist female friend whose character is never developed fully, and who contributes virtually nothing to the story except to reveal a few shallow details of Stewart's character.  Of course, all this simply means that I don't "get" the film, that it's somehow above and beyond my comprehension, so take this review as you will.  The bottom line is that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except someone who really likes older movies, and even then my recommendation would not be an unqualified one.  It's simply boring and predictable, with huge flaws in the script 
 I disliked this book enough to take time to say so. The style of writing is difficult, circuitous, repetitive, and wordy. It is full of generalizations and citations from other authors and is lopsided in its  thesis that all good things come from hunter/gatherers. It is nostalgic  babble about a time long gone, from which we continue to evolve. There is  no going back. No pragmatic solutions are offered for improving our present  day predicaments, such as over population, aggressive behavior and  overcrowding. This book seems to me to be an academic treatise with  sophomoric overtones, trying to sound more profound than it really is. In  all fairness some of the problem may be that the book is a posthumous  publication 
 I was definetly not impressed by this book, not the caliber of the Table Saw Book or The Router Book. Not a lot of information that most woodworkers familar with a hammer and pliers did not already know.  I would suggest the book be re-written with some added useful information.  Jr 
 This book is, in hindsight, horribly wrong. It is now known that there are no WMD's in Iraq. Saddam did not pose a threat to America and the world at-large. It's just sad that the trumpeters of the Iraqi war were playing to the wrong song. It's packed with faulty and "highly dubious" intelligence. The CIA has since admitted as much but I do not expect as much from a hack writting a book to profit from a "massive intelligence failure" 
 Let me begin by saying that I absolutely love travel/adventure books, especially books at sea.  So I was really looking forward to this book.  I have never read a book more disappointing.  The writing is almost impossible to follow.  The setting (North Sea during Winter with tremendous storms) should have been spellbounding.  Instead most of the book involves long discourses between crewmembers as if no one is listening to the other person.  I believe only once does the author go above board and then only for a brief spell during a storm.  This book is not worth reading. 
 I liked this novel at the beginning.  The cast of characters was good.  As comic relief I thought Hannah Goldsmith was great -- and, speaking euphemistically, the tension about progress, or lack thereof, in her love life was of considerable interest.    What killed the story for me was the coincidences: too many, too unlikely, too intrusive.  We are supposed to believe that Chief Inspector Detective Wexford has a very similar situation in his home to the murders he is investigating.  We have about every character and suspect in the novel being related to each other in one way or another.  By about page 250 of a 320 page novel I had had enough. The author had blown her believability.        Ruth Rendell is, of course, one of the best known of English detective novelists and has many loyal fans.  Perhaps she's written better books. I hope so.  But don't choose this one to read unless you are really, really a fan.      Smallchief    
 This is a terrible movie that I gave 1 star because I couldn't give any fewer. It features the usual idols given primarily to the black youth of today, hip hoppers playing gangstas who have no respect for anything or anyone other than money. It is another one of those blaxploitation specials in which there is literally no figure of any redeeming value. This explains the  almost endless series of beatings, shootings, and overall ignorance portrayed in sequence, and served up as some sort of story. It's only entertainment they say, but they are typecast without even knowing it, foolishly dying to portray a fantasy image...psychologically bound as tight as any slave was ever shackeled 
 Books have been written, and will continue to be written, to try and disprove Christianity and Jesus as the Son of God. What is almost comical is that one has to print lies and errors to try and convince people. That's because you can't disprove the TRUTH. And what are some of the errors, you ask? I will give you a few: Dan Brown tries to use Gnostic gospels (gospels written in the 2nd century and beyond by people who were not eyewitnesses) to try and prove his theory and omitting New Testament Scripture. To say that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married by using the Gospel of Phillip (written after 250 A.D.) where there are missing words: And the companion of the [...] Mary Magdalene. [...] more than [...] the disciples, [...] kiss her [...] on her [...]. Clearly, there is some problems with this text with the missing words and the fact that it was written over 200 years after Jesus died. This does not prove anything. Also, he says that the word "companion" means spouse in Aramaic, which is great, except that the Gospel of Philip was written in "Coptic," where "companion" does not mean "spouse!" Second, Dan Brown says that it wasn't until 325 AD at the Council of Nicea did people start to believe Jesus was a Deity and that it was a close vote. New Testament disproves that because it shows that Jesus was Deity where Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 15:3-5: "For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve." Also, The Council of Nicea met only to sort out some differences among church leaders, all of whom believed that Jesus was divine. The main question was whether Jesus was begotten or made. Jesus' divinity, death and resurrection were not in question. Only two of 318 clerics at the Council did not sign the Nicene Creed. So there was not a close vote unless you think 318 to 2 is close! Third, his main argument is that it Mary Magdalene in the Last Supper painting by Leo. If that were true, then where is John, the youngest and most beloved apostle? John was often portrayed in a feminine manner to convey youth, as is seen in many stained glass portraits in European cathedrals. And also, Leo was just a painter who was not around when Jesus was, so it didn't matter if he tried to put Mary in a painting or not! Fourth, Brown says that The Gnostic gospels and the Dead Sea Scrolls are "the earliest Christian records." While the New Testament obviously came before the Gnostic gospels, The Dead Sea Scrolls refer to a collection of about 900 documents, many of which are fragmentary scrolls written in Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic, that were discovered in a cave and do not contain even a single mention of Jesus or of any other person mentioned in the New Testament as they are Jewish documents! He also says they were discovered in the 1950's when they were discovered in 1947. Oops! Fifth, Dan Brown says that Christianity borrowed its beliefs from the pagan religion of Mithraism. He says that Mithraism worshipped the pre-Christian God Mithras, called the Son of God and Light of the World, who was born on December 25th, died, was buried in a rock tomb, and then resurrected in three days. Scholars of Mithraism would strongly disagree with Brown on all of these points. Nowhere is Mithras given the title Son of God and the Light of the World. Brown apparently made this up because it sounded good. Mithras was born on December 25th, however this proves nothing. The New Testament never associated December 25th with the birth of Christ. The early Christians chose to celebrate the birth of Christ on this day intentionally to oppose the pagan mid-winter festival of Saturnalia. They never claimed Jesus was actually born on that date. The claim that Mithras died and was buried in a rock tomb is just not true. Scholars will tell you that in Mithraism there is no death of Mithras at all. So, there was no rock tomb and no resurrection. So once again, he is nowhere near correct. Lastly, Brown says that the four canonical gospels were chosen from over 80 gospels. First, there were only less than half that many books written about Jesus life. The two Gnostic gospels Brown relies on most heavily weren't written until the second century A.D., long after the New Testament gospels were written. It makes sense that the Gnostic gospels came about in the late second century, as this is when Gnostic thought was most prevalent. However, the New Testament was complete before the end of the 1st Century. Also, the Gospel of Thomas, which Dan Brown lies heavily on,claims women must become men in order to receive salvation. That makes no sense. There are many other errors in this novel, but I think I have showed there are enough lies in this book not to be taken seriously. This is pure (or rather "poor") fiction, without a shred of evidence that Jesus was anything other than the Christ, the Son of the living God! Thank you, Dan Brown, for making my faith stronger 
 Needleman had some interesting stories but I didn't find the book all the helpful or entertaining.  I had to read it for class and the only good part about the assignment was the class discussions, most of which had little to do with the actual book.  I thought it had potential and I was excited about reading this book but ended up being dissappointed.  It is a VERY easy book to read and you can fly through the pages.  I ended up reading a lot and not really understanding or getting anything from what I just read.  
 I did not even finish this!!... I have No idea what this book was trying to get across... I give Bono credit for the hard work he is doing for Aids but I do not understand where or what this conversation???  was all about...Sorry Bono, I am a big fan of your music, but this book was so confusing and not at all enlightening 
 It is quite possible for this film to wash over you and leave absolutely no trace of passing.  There are about three or four lines in this effort which are funny however the tedium in-between does not make them worth the wait.  Part of the problem with this film was that I felt that I had seen it all before. Which, of course, I had in Four Weddings. Slightly pathetic, floppy-haired middle-class Englishman falls for glamorous American who rejects him them gets back together with him and has a group of friends suffering from various disabilities.  Not since "Intersection" have I spent a movie looking at my watch to see when it ended. I honestly don't know who was worse, Julia Roberts or Hugh Grant. They both became so grating on the nerves that I couldn't wait for the movie to end. The most enjoyable part of the film (aside from it being over) were the trailers they showed before it.  Not worth seeing or renting. Save the money for something better... it shouldn't be that hard 
 This didn't feel like an authentic Seuss, just as another reviewer has pointed out... The narrative is stiff, the rhymes lacking fluidity and humor, and the story is just plain dull. Although I have no problem at all with presenting anti-war and anti-arms-proliferation sentiment in a format suitable for a child, I don't think that this book does it well. The overall impression I get is that of a message being sent in the style of Seuss, with rehashed elements, rather than a genuinely entertaining Seuss book 
 This author has gotten one thing right: scientific discoveries and theories should be questioned.  In fact, any scientist who says otherwise is rather disingenuous.  Science is all about questioning pre-existing knowledge.  That's how it grows and, with observation, experimentation and logical reasoning, is part of how new knowledge is acquired.  That's what Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein and anyone else who has made scientific discoveries did.  There is a point however where the questioning continuously leads to the same conclusion, which is the point where concepts such as evolution and relativity are now.  Where creationists/intelligent designers fail is in assuming that simply raising questions provides evidence to the contrary of what you are questioning.  It does not. If there is an "intelligent designer" you need to do more than simply point out that there are aspects of evolutionary biology where further research is needed.  What you have to do is provide research that provides evidence for any alternative that you propose. Simply raising questions is not enough.  You need to provide evidence for an alternative claim. Without such evidence, creationism cannot be considered science, and thus, has no place in a science classroom.  Furthermore, you must be willing to subject yourself to - and to encourage - the same process of questioning of your ideas. I am a Christian who has no problem with this. I don't need to lie to children to keep my faith strong. I don't need to confuse them about what constitutes scientific knowledge. I can accept that evolution is the way God created the world.  Why He has chosen to do it that way is for Him to know.  I don't trust anyone who says they know what God thinks.  I don't trust anyone, such as this author, who feels he has to mislead people about scientific knowledge in order to have faith in God.  
 I got a copy of this book a few years back as a Christmas gift, and the title and cover immediately put me off (and I'm really not the type that judges a book by it's cover).  It wasn't until recently that I started reading this novel.  Big mistake on my part.  The novel began well enough, but then began a downward spiral.  It had one of the oddest plots I've ever seen, and that alone normally wouldn't put me off a book.  But in addition to the bizarre story line, it seemed as if Koontz had wrote the book, and then went back and looked up every word he had written in the thesaurus and replaced it with a synonym.  Simple sentences were unneccesarily drawn out, and some of his figurative language (especially that which involved Middle Eastern conflict) was flat and boring.  Truly one of the worst reads I've ever had the displeasure of enduring 
 If the book's title and the story behind the title were typed on one sheet of paper, you could post it and read it often to remind yourself that life is short, so live every day. For a few of us, that is how shallow most of our problems really are and therefore we probably do not need this book, just that one story. For many, however, their problems are real, their stress is real, and they are looking for real answers to help them live every day. Unfortunately, they will not find them in this book. Little depth and even less understanding or acknowledement of the real pain in people's lives leaves a "cutesy" book but not much help 
 This book read as if the author just accumulated facts from other writers and listed them in a sterile "here are the facts and only the facts" type of way. Not fun. Not very interesting. Very little insight into Carole Lombard.  Really a disappointment. 
 The hyperbole won't seem appropriate to most people, but for me this was the single most un-enjoyable movie I've ever seen, ever. Every aspect of it was painful.   First, the production values: this movie is just ugly. I guess the biological computers are supposed to be a novel or deep concept, but it's just disgusting and really very poor looking. At times I thought they just rooted through the medical examiner's dumpster to gather props. I understand that you can't really have nice props in a low-budget movie, but with the setting and technology so central to the plot you think they could've paid for a decent production designer. Everyone says this is not a "special effects" movie and that the ideas behind it are what counts, but plenty of low budget movies didn't look this bad and were able to convey something new.  The acting: just one thing in a sea of annoyances here was Jude Law's accent. It's terrible, and he lets his native one slip several times. It's distracting and sloppy. The dialogue was just bad overall, so I blame the writer for most of this.  This movie is not "misunderstood." It's an objectively bad movie. It's unentertaining, boring, and scrabbling for a significance that only scraggly-bearded philosophy majors will care about and dogmatize. A lot of reviews said it was better to see it as a black comedy, but this movie is only unintentionally funny, if at all. I'd give it zero stars if I could, as I'm trying to warn people away from this turd 
 Instead of writing a review I am citing an error that I observed in  reading the book.   On page 141, Mr. Davis states that Bob Marley had a  daughter named Kimane. He had a son named Kymani, who is now a singer and  recording artist 
 Dust is the first attempt I made at a Martha Grimes novel.  Page 74 is point where I am tossing the book aside.  OK, someone was killed.  Many people knew him, although I can not remember  any of them.  Who are all these other people and what do they bring to the story?  I know this is a novel in a series, but most authors can bring a new reader up to speed fairly early in a novel.  I also can't figure out what is so important about Jury getting busy with most of the female characters.  Is it a mystery novel or a Harlequin romance?  Looks like I'll be skipping any other Richard Jury novels 
 The idea is counterfactual, of course.  No surprise.  But such ideas are allowed, and this one is full of possibilities, both comic and dramatic.  None of those possibilities were explored in this film.    Instead, this is a garden-variety teen flick.  It pushes all the teen buttons.  The caveman morphs into a California hip teen in less than two minutes, and that's the end of the caveman as such.  The three boys do rock dancing, ride the roller coaster, do rock dancing, play arcade games, do rock dancing, roller coaster, rock dancing, arcade games, roller coaster, rock dancing, etc. ad nauseum.  To top it off, the caveman is a pacifist who wouldn't hurt a flea, not even to defend himself.  Yeah, right.    The social commentary, the psychological insights that could have been evoked by a clever development of this idea!  The truly comic situations that the caveman could have gotten into!  It's time someone made a grownup movie starting from this idea.    The people who made this film clearly didn't know what to do with this splendid idea.  Or, to use a word they would likely understand, they were clueless. 
 it is pretty general,there is no such thing as advice or anything the like about practices.he insists in almost every chapter that the mission is the most important thing.the only intersting ideas in his book are some about leadership, but i felt very much that i already knew them,he only confirmed them.this is not to say i am a genius.i am 18, so i guess if you are involved in running a nonprofit for more than one year, you would be able to write a better book.  for a beginner it might be intersting to get it from the library, and read it in a train or so.  not bad, but getting a book on leadership,and other one  on marketing is a much better idea 
 This title is currently being extensively SPAM-advertised, with particular reference to its availability on Amazon.  My view is that if the author/publisher needs to resort to SPAM to drum up interest then that fact in itself speaks volumes for the work.  On that basis alone I wouldn't touch it with a pole. 
 Warning to parents: This DVD has new cover art and carries a release date of 2006 in the Amazon listing, which both lead you to believe that this is one of the new Paramount MLP releases.  Be warned that THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  This DVD is repackaged versions of two of the original 1980's Sunbow cartoons from the TV series.  As a parent, this means that they pre-date the FCC programming standards for children.  The content on this DVD is troubling if you care about positive modeling and concepts for your child.  In the first episode, the ponies are forcibly kidnapped and endure slave labor, and the bad guy cronnies plot to kill the evil princess.  In the second story, some of th ponies steal precious treasures from other peoples to bribe the bad troll.   And the original Subow art and animation was really crappy to boot!   If you're looking for the pro-message, thoughtful content of the recent paramount releases, this ain't it 
 I have not bought this particular video, but I did buy another set of GGW videos a few months ago, and I COMPLETELY regret it.  This is the worst purchasing experience I've ever had.  Many people have complained about the horrible customer service at GGW.  In my case, I paid extra on my order for speedy delivery.  The charge went against my credit card, so they got immediate payment from me.  My videos were supposed to have been delivered within a couple days, but it wound up taking a couple MONTHS instead!  And only after I complained did they finally deliver them.  But they still didn't reimburse me for the extra expense I had paid for the speedy delivery that never happened.  And if that isn't bad enough, for the last month these jerks have been calling me every day, several times a day.  I get calls at home, I get calls at work.  They called me three times just today.  This is harrassment!  I'm right now researching what my legal options are because their incessant phone calls are making me crazy.  Can you imagine having to explain unsolicited calls you're receiving at work from GGW?  Unless you want to go through the hell I'm being put through, do yourself a favor and please avoid these sorry jerks 
 When someone like Gerd Ludemann publishes with Prometheus Press, take it as meaning, "I knew darned well my thesis would never survive peer review." Ludemann is very well able to construct historical fantasies without documentation in order to explain away recorded history that has all of the documentation. The Resurrection of Christ is mostly an extended exercise in this sort of literary snowblowing, as Ludemann finds conspiracy to convert you under nearly every turn of phrase.  Thus for example, Paul includes himself in the list of 1 Cor. 15 "to defend his apostolic authority" [41]. That's not quite true, though; from a Greco-Roman rhetorical standpoint, Paul's self-inclusion is part of a narratio, in which a self-testimony that would be expected to round off the feature. As well, assertions of fact are under suspicion merely for having an "apologetic ring" -- so does any claim of truth, for that matter; even that Gerd Ludemann has a Ph. D. If he happens to assert this, should we immediately suspect that he doesn't actually have one, and that because he is "defending his authority" we ought to be suspicious that a) someone else questions it, and b) they may be right? Critics like Ludemann we suspect would have a serious issue with such a judgmental indictment upon their characters, but they have no problem accusing Biblical authors of the same thing.  Ludemann's book shows great deficiencies in terms of being aware of current scholarship. His claim that Matthew stressed the "newness and cleanliness" of Jesus; burial cloth "to convince his audience of Jesus' uniqueness" [53] and to stave off the implication of a dishonorable burial fails on multiple points: 1) he obviously has not read McCane's work showing in effect that a pedantic reference to a clean cloth, as he supposes, is going to in any sense convince anyone that Jesus' burial was not shameful; 2) he has failed to recognize that the Gospels were written for and to Christians, so that Matthew is not trying to and does not have to "convince" anyone of anything in terms of Jesus being unique; 3) it's just plain paranoid; one may as well argue that Matthew stresses a linen cloth as a secret slam against producers of other fabrics. He's also missing McCane in his treatment of Jesus' burial by Joseph [62]. Otherwise, there's little in the way of quality explanation: A text that reports miracles is automatically unhistorical, no further explanation needed; words of Jesus must be inauthentic because they can be "explained by [an author's] theological purpose" [112](so can we say Ludemann didn't write his book, because what is in it serves his theological purpose?).  Ludemann is also not entirely above the occassional temper tantrum. He has particular scorn for N. T. Wright and his book The Resurrection of the Son of God, a huge volume he barely touches; his frustration with being unable to address Wright in detail is clear in that only Ludemann could decipher from Wright's measured prose against historical revisionism a "bitter polemic" of any sort [37]. Who is indeed bitter here is shown in that Ludemann insults Wright by preferring to rebut him with Thomas Paine (!), and addresses him snidely in the first person [200]. (His accusation of inconsistency by Wright is confused: Ludemann is apparently ticked particuarly because Wright tagged him for assuming ancient people were too stupid to know that dead people did not ordinarily rise. But as a reply, he only insults Wright for reaching "theological" conclusions, and hoists a vague spectre of "goodbye scholarship" when miracle claims are admitted, which is nothing but the same begged question of naturalism that Wright's point implicitly refutes!)  Ludemann's crowning glory is his attempt to reconstruct how resurrection belief came to the apostles, but here he fails most conspicuously, as his theories would never work in the social world of the NT. A mourning Peter would never think a vision of Jesus was Jesus himself, but Jesus' guardian angel (a twin brother, as it were); and he would never think that this Jesus, even if Jesus, was resurrected (as that was not expected until judgment). The same Peter would also not experience "guilt" [166] but shame. His idea of Paul as a man with a "Christ complex" who always had to be number one is refuted by the ancient understanding of honor as a limited good. Thus Ludemann's effort to create a "chain reaction" [173] scenario fails from the very first and most critical links. His rebuttal as well to the opportunity of authorities to open or point to the empty tomb [181] doesn't hold water:     1. He points to the "rapid decay of flesh" in Palestine's climate. But this in itself would not keep authorities from pointing to the tomb, and making the claim that Jesus' body was within; as it is, the lack of even this shows that they could not make such a claim, for the tomb was empty.    2. His claim that the "place of burial was unknown" is a farce, for there is no way the location of Joseph's tomb could be unknown (and it is a counsel of despair to suggest that Joseph, or the burial in his tomb, is not historical, especially after McCane)    3. And, a "Disneyland Palestine" objection that fails to realize that Jews were not typically inclined to verenate persons and places as described.   So it is that Ludemann grinds out more of the same we have come to expect. It's a valiant attempt, but in the end, nothing but invention of history to explain away history 
 I sat down to read about this after hearing about it for years, and I want my week back. It only took that long because I had to push myself to finish it.  SPOILERS AHEAD: Meggie and Father Ralph (who everyone always seems to refer to as Ralph de Bricassart, even when they're talking to him) meet when he is twenty-six and Meggie is...ten. She speaks, acts and thinks like a 5-year-old, though. As the years go by, Father Ralph de Bricassart becomes sort of a father figure to little Meggie, and she develops a girlish crush on him. As Meggie is also "developing a very feminine figure," Ralph comes to love her in return but realizes that their love can never be. They discuss this in approximately fifteen thousand "Don't love me, my darling, for I love you but you know our love is forbidden and can never be" conversations throughout the book. Finally, after years of smothering their passion, they do it. In a really very boring scene that's all inner ruminating and blurred descriptions. And wouldn't ya know it, she gets pregnant. Ralph de Bricassart realizes (again) that their love can never be, and leaves. Meggie has his baby, and capers about gleefully that she's "stolen" something back from God. But wouldn't ya know it, the kid (who's as angelic and one-dimensional a boy I've ever encountered in literature) decides to be a priest. So she sends him to Father Ralph de Bricassart for training, who--get this--is so totally brain dead that IT NEVER ONCE OCCURS TO HIM THAT THIS MIGHT BE HIS CHILD!!!!!!! Apparently arithmetic is not a compulsory part of training for the priesthood; this guy also misses an incredibly broad hint from Meggie, when even the other priests figure it out. The Big Secret finally does come out (again in a very brief, anticlimactic scene) toward the end, but by then we're too busy skimming to really care.  All this leaves out a great many things--including immortal dialogue that makes Meggie sound perpetually ten years old ("I'll tell you something else about your roses, Ralph de Bricassart--they've got nasty, hooky thorns!"), endless, heavyhanded symbolism (ashes of roses, thorn birds...we get it! we get it!), some dumb subplot concerning a brother who is absent for 90% of the book, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious "tragic" scenes I've ever read (death by pig). Yet the Ralph-and-Meggie storyline really is the only major thing going on. And we never really get to see what it is that draws these two people together. I was expecting other subplots and development of other characters, and this never really happened. Many of the other relationships were sketchy and/or very confusing: Meggie's cruel judgment of her daughter Justine as a "monster" and a "b* tch," for example, seemed to have no basis. The last third or so involves Meggie making peace with her mother and daughter, and it just doesn't matter. The quick "the end" wrap-up would have been an even greater letdown if I'd still cared by that point. Even the most developed characters are flat and lifeless, and thoroughly unlikable. Scarlett O'Hara was selfish, but she was fun; these people are selfish and boring. Sickly-sweet quasi-romantic trash. 
 This book is great in that it has all of the Curious George stories in one place. Unfortunately, that makes it incredibly heavy and hard to hold with a squirming kid on your lap.  I'd buy a set of the individual books, even at a higher price.  On the upside, my daughter loves the George stories and wants them read to her nightly before sleep. We've had to learn how to read portions of each book to keep her interested and awake. 
 Buddy Holly has a number of collections that are superior to the one put out under the 20th Century Masters series.  Every one of the CDs in this series is skimpy in content and superfluous.  This one is no exception.   Look elsewhere 
 I bought this book because i thought i can use the pattern in the cd provided, but unfortunately you cant use any of them, they saved it as flash animation format. Unlike the other book I have purchased "the complete pattern library" where you can use any pattern in the book and even change the colors of them 
 It is time for the transgendered to stop being so in denial about autogynephilia. This is sexual desire for the idea of oneself as a woman. For males who become females, but who are not exclusively attracted to men, that is what motivates us. A very vocal group of closet cases has tried to make discussion of this concept off limits. But do we have to cooperate in that?   This book mostly takes the standard line stressing gender identity, where anyone who wants to be the other sex has that desire because the are similar to the other sex, at least in their gender identity. But that's not what motivated me. I had sexual desire for myself as a sexy woman. That Mildred Brown works with transsexual patients but cannot (or will not) discuss autogynephilia does not attest to her clinical insight.  I know this is hard to understand for the uninitiated (although if you are reading these reviews, are you really uninitiated?). If you don't get it, read Bailey's "The Man Who Would Be Queen." 
 Having read a few of Anne Tyler's books in the past, I was looking forward to reading her latest novel.  At best, I found the book to be wholly forgettable.  At worst, I found her bottom line premises, upon which the book is based, without much merit.  I say so with some personal insight.  I was born in America in 1944, the first in my family to be a native born American.  And yes, my parents spoke a "foreign" language at home, among themselves and with their friends and relatives.  I was schooled in the local public schools, and interacted with youngsters who came from all sorts of backgrounds.  This remained true as I went on to college, and then graduate school.  My family did not feel like it was outside of the American mainstream because they had their roots in Europe.  To the contrary, they felt blessed to be here, and never missed an opportunity to praise America and all it stood for.  While our parents spoke a concocted language to us (we called it Germglish), we fully understood their native tongue, while we (the children) only conversed in English (to them as well as to others). Our experience was not unique;  infact, most of the people we met came from similar homes and backgrounds.  Now, perhaps growing up in New York City is different from living in the Baltimore suburbs, but I don't really think so.  I think that the greatest thing about this country lies in the fact that ALL of us came from somewhere, either recently or once upon a time.  And while we may choose to interact with people who share similar backgrounds, I really can't imagine that most of us are embarassed that we are not the American stereotype...white, protestant, having ancestors who came over on the Mayflower.  For this reason, more than any other, I found the book to be based on faulty premises, and when the central feature of a book doesn't ring true, the whole book ends up being less than fulfilling. 
 I gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf.  This pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it.  It has problems that need modification.    The top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body, making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb.  That means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely.  Remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it.  Add some adhesive Velchro to the back of the case.  Make a fabric band for your ankle.  Attach the ends to each other with Velchro.  Put a strip of Velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band.  I get  accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle.  I got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline.     The hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted.  I opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring.  The strut is made of thin brass.  Aluminum from a soda can would work, too.  I made a "V" in one end of the strut to hold the spring.  I pushed lightly against the spring from the left side, drilled a hole in the brass, and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board.  The strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it.  I now have quite a few miles on the pedometer.  (I have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely.)  Several times the pedometer reset itself to "0" for no apparent reason.  I know nothing pushed on the reset button.  One incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security.  Once it reset while I was walking.  Twice it reset while I was napping on the sofa.  I am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit, but I do not know.  Static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers, too.    This pedometer uses a counter circuit.  If someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter, connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts.  Connect a button switch to the two wires.  Freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue 
 I bought this recording for my 5 & 3 year-old grandchildren who love ballet. There was nothing in the Amazon literature to indicate the homosexual slant of the production. The kids and I were half-way through viewing it when I realized what was being passed off was truly counter culture. The principal women (mom & girlfriend) were evil and stupid respectively. The "hero"s" true love was an undisguised male swan (all the swans were male). There was no hiding the passion between the male lovers. Good grief!! [... 
 One reviewer said, ``First, Barbosa attacks Morris Kline (he's got some nerve doing that) for Prof. Kline's supposed lack of understanding of mathematics. This frivolous insult is so ridiculous that it isn't necessary to discuss it further.'' I won't claim that Kline doesn't understand mathematics, but it is quite clear from this book that he does not understand logic. I looked up reviews in the professional literature by logicians and found they made the same point.  Kline makes many technical errors in his account of the foundational debates in the early twentieth century. My favorite mistake, and perhaps his most blatant blooper, is Kline's statement that the Loewenheim-Skolem Theorem implies Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem; he thinks that models with different cardinalities cannot satisfy the same sentences. (For non-logicians: they can and do; Kline's alleged implication is wrong.) His account of the history of mathematics is not as bad.  Kline was an applied mathematician, and in his last two chapters informs us in very strong terms that applied mathematics is good and true, but pure mathematics is not. He urges mathematicians to abandon the study of analysis, topology, functional analysis, etc., and devote themselves to the problems of science.  The book is lively and entertaining, if not entirely reliable 
 A dip into practically any page will yield passages that list exotica, for example page 348 ("must have spoken Paya, Miskitu, Guamimi and Kuna"). This kind of dense unexplained information throughout the book seems to have dazzled the other reviewers here or, rather, beaten them into some kind of admiration. It left me cold, and more than little resentful that such a fascinating subject as the grown and demise of languages over time should be handled in such a dull shallow manner. 
  The audio problems mentioned in these reviews are correct.  The music is much too high and the narration much too low.  Constant adjustment of the volume is necessary.  Beyond that the writing is often poor and some of the footage staged.  This is a corny 50s TV production and can't be recommended.  But what your looking for is out there.  It's called The World At War, a 70s British production.  This is a classy, often brilliant documentary with a comprehensive treatment of WWII.  Compelling narration by Laurence Olivier, numerous interviews with real participants (e.g. Hitler's secretary) and historians (a young Stephen Ambrose), and fascinating footage.      
 I picked up this book because I've read two other books by Anne Tyler that I greatly enjoyed, but I was disappointed by this one.  Maybe it was written before she really hit her stride as a writer.  While entertaining,  the book seemed somewhat empty.  I didn't find the characters' actions very  believable, and the "surprise" ending did not follow from  anything earlier in the book (as all really good surprise endings should).   The virtue of this book is that it can be quickly read in one evening.  I  do recommend Tyler's books "A Patchwork Planet" and "Earthly  Posessions.&quot 
 I agree. The leap pad barely fits inside and has big pouches, rather than velcro flaps  to contain all of the loose parts that come with the pad. Don't buy this 
 Already wary of John Vornholt's writing, I was hoping this would change my mind...I was wrong. There is little or no action until the very end, and I was hoping it would be epic space battles, which I got from the cover.    But the Enterprise is stuck in a starbase, and all the crew does is try to  help some pathetic commander. And when they do finally show up, it's too  obvious, and it was like an after-thought to add the rest of the crew in  the story.   The only two characters who really shined were Hasmek and  Geordi, since they weren't used that much, and Vornholt couldn't screw them  up.   The whole Badlands part is pointless.    I suggest to anybody that  you read the Deep Space Nine series, because they're awesome in comparison.    A war fits nicely into the Deep Space Nine universe, not The Next  Generation universe 
 This book was a disappointment.  It was full of platitudes and emotional and attitudinal characteristics recommended for mortgage brokers.  But it had no real techniques, no strategy.  It advocated a shotgun approach to marketing; do everything, signs, websites, telemarketing, advertising, etc.  Save your money 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 I'm appalled that my public university, the University of Virginia, would even consider paying somone like him to teach. Everything he talks about is just ridiculous.  
 None of the members of the Family Markowitz are likeable.  That leaves me the reader with no one to cheer for, let alone identify with.  Matriarch Rose is selfish, maybe psychotic.  Her 2 sons must inherit their  self-absorbtion from her.  Their wives are the only characters I didn't  hate.  If you like books with no likeable characters [A Confederacy of  Dunces, maybe?], then this book is for you.  Otherwise, forget it 
 While I did enjoy parts of the book, I find it to be lacking overall.  Gertie is a believable character but lacks in courage.  She was supposedly a strong person.  She did face many challanges but didn't overcome then.  Instead she sidestepped her problems.  Not until the last page does she actually become the character she is portrayed to be but I barely made it to the last page.  The climax occurs far too early in the book so the resolution takes up far too much time.  The one star was given on pity alone.  Do not read this book if you have seen the movie.  In fact do not read this book period 
 This book is worth reading just to get a sense of the way the American public views business today. The stories of businesses told in this book are one-sided and even irrational, but without a doubt, they reflect the way American business is seen by the public right now.  The problem with the book is that it offers very few ideas on how a business can successfully navigate today's minefield of public perception. As a reader hoping to come away with ideas on how to nurture the public's perception of my business, I instead finished the book feeling that businesses are largely at the mercy of dumb luck and circumstance when it comes to perception. Further, the author admits that businesses are in a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation when attempting to let the public know about any acts of goodwill.  This book is well-timed to take advantage of today's anti-business climate, but not of much help for those seeking to find their way through it 
 As an original cast member with Florence Henderson's "Sound of Music" tour 45 years ago, I have a unique perspective about this recording.  Even the musical director comments at the end that this version of "Oliver" was not particularly well sung but that the cast had a lot of energy.  Unfortunately,(in my opinion) this energy doesn't translate suficiently to the recording and I agree - it's not particularly well sung.  Again, from the perspective of a former child performer singing with other kids, it actually is possible for a group of children to sing together and make pleasant-sounding music.  The adults in this "Oliver" aren't up to musical snuff either.  Although I haven't heard it, I'd be willing to take my chances on the original London version before settling for this one (which, by the way, was recorded in an LA studio before it even got to Broadway. 
 First of all, I have to give this collection at least 2 stars because it is RATT after all and there are some great tunes here. But in general, the Essentials series sucks. They try to put the big over-played radio tunes and leave out killer album cuts and fan favourites. They only have two tracks from Dancing Unvercover, my favourite Ratt release. The material from Detonator is the slow ballad crap and not the really high energy stuff. What a disappointment. Do yourself a favor and buy Dancing Undercover. If you still don't like Ratt after listening to that album, you never will 
 Not a CD to buy when wanting easy listening too boring - made for German market.  Booklet with CD.    Robert Mitchum's gravelly voice does not come through as it should.  Not a good buy. Recommend Calypso Is Like So 
 These extensions should have been included with the co-sleeper.  As it is, the co-sleeper is lower than the average adult bed and the extensions are required if you want your child sleeping on your level.  The fact that they sell it as a separate item is pure gouging for an extra few bucks, which is irritating.  They are simple pieces of plastic and shouldn't add but a dollar or two to Arms Reach's cost.  There are twelve pieces, so you can use a max of 3 pieces per leg to increase it to the maximum height.  We had to do just that, and found that the three connected pieces are *very* unstable.  It's too bad they charge so much for a poorly constructed set of unstable plastic pieces.  What they should do is provide a set of pieces of varying heights, to prevent too many connections to a bed that's holding your precious child 
 Mark Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson (1854) is a short, episodic novel which continuously promises to flower into a small work of genius but never succeeds. Densely packed with socially explosive themes and literary devices--including two apparent sets of twins, switched identities, transvestite episodes, an emotionally biased stepparent, a scheming heir, a dramatic court room scene, and a mysterious murder--the book is too obviously calculated throughout, and thus, despite moments of genuine power, reads like the awkward concoction that it is. Since Pudd'nhead Wilson is essentially plot-driven, Twain's frequent apparent lack of confidence in his narrative doubly dilutes the novel's forward momentum, leaving the reader uncomfortably aware of the author's somewhat forced creative decisions. Even locally misunderstood lawyer Pudd'nhead Wilson himself--a secondary character--never really exists as a three dimensional figure and seems present throughout only to serve as a deus ex machina at the story's conclusion.   All of which is a shame, since Pudd'nhead Wilson, in terms of its themes, had the potential to be Twain's greatest work.  The novel is the story of Roxana, a slave who, being "only one-sixteenth black," can pass for white and who switches her own light-skinned child with the child of her master while both are in infancy, thus hoping to spare him the horrible fate of "being sold down the river." But Roxana's child, now known as "Tom" and raised as the future lord of the manor, becomes a bully, an ingrate, and a secret criminal, while the real heir, raised without any advantages as a slave and called "Chambre," merely fulfills his role as an illiterate piece of property.   The novel's most significant problem is also its most obvious one. Pudd'nhead Wilson would have been far more compelling had Twain not allowed the text to take the overt position that blacks raised as whites will turn out to be as shiftless, loafing, and inherently worthless as the prejudices of the era defined them to be. This is especially true since "Chambre," the genuine white heir, remains offstage for most of the novel and thus his lack of development as a human being under the slave system is never explored.   Nothing hammers Twain's error of judgement home as much as the fact that the initially sympathetic Roxana develops into a morally compromised individual as the story proceeds, not because it is essentially believable for her to become so, but because Twain needs her to falter to further his rather cumbersome plot. Ultimately, that Roxana is only "only one-sixteenth black" and "Tom" "thirty-one parts white" and both thus essentially caucasian, is neither here nor there, since Twain repeatedly reinforces the notions of the era that both remain "negroes" regardless.   Though only 120 pages long, the meandering Pudd'nhead Wilson reads like a book twice that length, and, as its audience will begin to suspect as the narrative progresses, the story's climax is pat and predictable. Twain might have succeeded at leaving his racially charged themes deliciously ambiguous and prismatic, but simply does not. Few things are sadder than a work of art that attempts to be clever and fails to be, of Pudd'nhead Wilson is an fine example.     
 After only 3 months the SanDisk Cruzer Micro 2GB died.  Data was lost, could not be read.  Both my desktop and laptop computer wanted to reformat the Cruzer, but when I tried to format, it could not. Flash drive is totally useless. I replaced it with a Kingston Data Traveller and I hope it lasts longer. 
 I was lucky enough not to buy this book, never feel specially draw into such matters as werewolf,but I didn't resist the temptation to browse it briefly at my local used bookstore,a lot of empty empty words,....   
 What happened??! I have really been enjoying the Sneaky Pie Brown series - up till now. Found this one to be extremely disappointing and far off the mark for all the characters- they weren't very likeable. Conversations were too preachy and had little or nothing to do with the basic story line. There was very little focus leading up to how the mystery was solved, and  the condition in which the murder victim(s) were found, more graphic than it needed to be.  Ms Brown needs to go back and review her earlier books in this series and refresh her memory on why this series has been so fun to read. Jud 
 I'm a big fan of both Perdido Street Station and The Scar, compared to these earlier works Iron Council was a huge disappointment in both the writing and story.  It was at times very painful to read and I was so excited to finally be finished.  If you are new to Mieville, start with Perdido Street Station, if you are a big fan and looking for more from New Crobuzon be prepared to be disappointed 
 As a former teacher and current homeschooler, I find that much of the material in the early levels of this series are not appropriate for the grade levels indicated.  I use the books as references but not usually at the grade indicated by the title of the book. The history sections are especially inappropriate. Children at these early grade levels do not have enough background knowledge (i.e., comprehension of the passage of time and the geography of the earth in relation to their own place in it) to fully understand the material presented. Thus, they are very unlikely to retain the knowledge or to apply it meaningfully to other areas of study. Parents trying to stick to these grade levels are bound to be frustrated 
 On the Far Side of the Mountain is about Sam Gribley, who lives on the Catskill Mountains. He eventually is also burdened with his sister living there, and must leave the safety of the mountain to save her with his friend Bando.  This book has some action and adventure, but not enough for my taste. I didn't appeal to that or the characters. It was basically about outdoor survival, which is much better done in other books, like Hatchet by Gary Paulsen.  I would recommend reading other, more exciting books, like Hatchet,instead of this one. 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 The original. He was kind of cool, but now he ain't; people using his backwardness against us. Forget this dude, or perish. 1896 speech was a total sell out to da man.  Drop ya boots, dawg!!! I 
 Maybe at the time it was written I would have reviewed it more favorably. In light of the life Miller led I can't help but to be disappointed by the cheap commericialization of the socialist superiority over capitalist theme that permeates the play. Here Miller creates a character only to destroy that character to point out the ills of capitalism, then Miller spends the rest of his life living an indulgent capitalist life here in the good ole USA: the very capitalist society that was supposedly Willy's oppressor. I think the years have taken the shine off of Miller a bit. I'm sure the Liberal 101 literature professor will disagree 
 I was very disappointed in the book which I received as a Christmas gift. I, too, dislike the light yellow print which is a strain on older eyes! It is difficult to find the recipe on the page because of it.  This might seem trivial to some; but, to others it is a real pain.  Also, the recipes are nothing special.  I am glad that I did not pay for this book 
 Two Words for this bulls**t they call an album: STRAIGHT GARBAGE!!!!!!!! What were they thinking. Bone Thugs are my favorite rap group of all time, but what the hell is this? Every track is horrible. They could've left this CD at the record company. If I could, I would give this CD 0 stars 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 MARK FURHMAN??? HMMMM THE MAN WHO LIED ON THE STAND AT O.J'S TRIAL, THE MAN WHO KNOWS NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT THIS CASE WRITES A BOOK??????  WHO IS HE AND HOW IN THE WORLD CAN HE MAKE ALL THIS MONEY WRITTING NOTHING MORE THAT TRASH. ALL THIS BOOK IS, AND EVER WILL BE GOOD FOR,IS BURNING MATERIAL OR TOILET TISSUE. I READ SOME OF IT, WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME THATS FOR SURE. I NEVER WOULD HAVE SPENT A PENNY ON IT LOL, YOU COULDN'T PAY ME TO BUY IT, BUT IT WAS AT AN OFFICE I VISITED SO I READ A FEW CHAPTERS AND ALL I COULD DO WAS GET SICK TO MY STOMACH, AND OR LAUGH AT HIS STUPIDITY... THIS MAN DISERVES NOTHING.... ANYONE WHO BUYS IT SHOULD BE CHECKED FOR BRAINS, ITS SURE NOT WORTH IT.... 
 Kane seems to think there is some irony in titling his book "Savages", but instead it adds to the racist overtones found in his faux anthropological approach to his "field work". The oversimplifications found in this book are upsetting to those of us who spend years working with native populations, and this book does little to halt harmful visions of native peoples.  This is an ecotourist approach to a complex culture and we are left with more questions than answers, and this book in many ways capitalizes on the plight of these people 
 This was kind of an impulse buy for me and I didn't get what I thought I would get. I thought it would be a clear and concise magazine on what is up and coming in TV and the Movies. Instead I got indepth ramblings on actors and directors. If you want to pick up a magazine and find out what is coming up without fluff and filler...this is not the mag for you. 
 OK I have seen a lot of bad movies but this one takes the prize for worst movie ever. I am generally a big fan of 80's movies, especially 80s high school movies and chick flicks. But this was just so horrendously unfunny, pointless, dull and banal, with unsympathetic, flimsy characters and a weak plot. It tires so hard to be funny and emotional but fails miserably. I mean, the part where she says about how she's with Lloyd because he told her there was glass on the ground is just so artifical and contrived, yet it is supposed to be profound and emotional. I was actually embarassed to return this piece of garbage to the video shop. The two leads have no chemistry whatsoever and I fail to see what on earth John Cusack's character saw in the selfish, stuck up Diane. I can not understand how anyone can give this movie a high rating, I can only assume that you 1. have all been smoking crack or 2. are all the same person. Thank goodness Cameron Crowe's films got better. Please, don't buy this pile of junk if you have any brains! It will be two hours of you life wasted 
 There is 1 reason for you.  This is a movie about a guy who is a really crazy big-time bank robber who like to go out and hae gunfights in his snazzy car.    Nothing works for me in this movie except hugh jackmon, and halle berry of course.  His character does have a lot of good backround elements about him.  But the way they use him and his family was just stupid, just like evrything else in the movie, except for halle berry.  I wish that this movie had it's finer points, well I guess there are 2 pretty good scenes with halle berry, one more pleasing than the other.  But the stunts were the stupidest thing.  You can tell what this movie was supposed to be about, halle berry,but besides that this is just a movie where a bus is being helicoptered all over the city.  I had heard about this when it came out and it didn't intrigue me at all, but then my friend told me that this is halle's berry best movie and I had to go see it.  So he wasn't lying, it is my favorite role that she has ever played, but the stunts and whole bank robbery thing was just retarded.  I can't remember if I brought up halle berry in this review yet so I would like to take the oppurtunity right now to say I love you halle berry and just give me a call sometime 
 Her work is unreadable.  It's too bad she abandoned what she had accomplished with Erosion so many years ago.  She is good at convincing people of her importance and so no one will tell the truth about her work.  If someone does, that person risks being thought of as a bad reader.  But there is nothing to nourish the soul in her poems. Nothing to contemplate.  They are not even interesting technically. The passionate defenses she generates always make me think of "protesting too much."  Her work is like reading impenetrable critical essays.  And even critical essays can be written for pleasurable reading, with ease and style.  American poetry has gone down a wrong road by following her example 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 What a load of turnspeak.  G. Orwell (deceased 
 This book is very very much out of date! Fortunately I read much better and up-to-date books so I know what dog training is about nowadays. And that is NOT what Dog Training for Dummies wants to make you believe 
 I was pretty disappointed by this album. I'm a big fan of The Free Design and of pop psychedelia/sunshine music and so ordered this album somewhat blindly out of Amazon recommendation: but I though this album was really not in that league at all. Guryan has a very weak sing-song little-girl voice and the material is mere pre-rock pop more like Leslie Gore on valium. The arrangements are also unstriking and soporific.  I'd have to say stay away 
 I still have not recieved this item that I ordered. I did get the star spangle shirt and love it but I have yet to have recieved this one and am not sure of who to contact about it. Please let me know how to go about getting it. I was under the impression I would have recieved it a number of weeks ago (it was part of a going away gift of my better half who is deployed to fight the war now) and still have not had word or recieved it.  Thank You, Holly Padill 
 This is an unbelievably simpleminded book. It is supposedly written for school counselors--but seems to assume that we think at an elementary school level. Save your money--there's a lot better material on the market 
 I was hired as a cable subcontractor last summer, under the assumption that the contract owner was going to make me his company manager and crew supervisor. Knowing more about public relations, marketing and journalism than management, I did what any good college student would do - I ordered some books and got to studying.  Michael Gerber's books sounded good in the summaries and had promising endorsements and blurbs on the jackets, but they were misleading. His books (Manager and Contractor) have little in the way of tangible methods and practices that you can jot down into notes and use. The book seemed to focus on anecdotes and points that were spread out over so many meaningless paragraphs that their consistency was almost that of vapor.  As I said, I tried taking notes. Or, more accurately, I sat there with a pad of paper and pen on the verge of jotting something down. None of it seemed worthy of the effort and what little of value there was was spread out over so many pages of verbosity that the undertaking would have been headache inducing.  This book, and his others, seem to be aimed at managers who need self-help assistance to fix their life away from management. In this case, the subtitles should read "The E-Myth Manger: Why your life sucks as a manager - and what to do about it" and "The E-Myth Contractor: Why most contractors' marriages don't work and what to do about it."  Seriously, these books are that bad 
 F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life 
 It pained me to sit through this movie and I would have turned it off after the first ten minutes if I didn't have to write a comparative analysis between it and Shakespeare's "Othello." The writing is terrible, the acting is so-so, the music is the pits, there is WAY too much emphasis on race, and the relationship between Odin and Desi is a joke. I'm supposed to believe he went stark-raving mad over a girl he had been dating for four months? Give me a break--I ended up laughing through the majority of this movie simply because it was so bad. This is teenaged melodrama at its worst 
 ... but very little real information.  At 65 pages of large print and sprawling cartoons, rather devoid of anything exceptional.    I'd skip it and find something more informative for your child.  
 This monitor does not work well.  This is a lot of static and it is not sensitive to sound.  This one is going back 
 John Updike's literary criticism is perceptive and sparely written - every one of his non-fiction collections is worth reading.  But his novels have, from the very first, been precious, over-written and stifling in their desperate need for approbation.  When he writes fiction, he's like a dog doing tricks for reward.  And certainly, the rewards have come.  But for readers outside the US at least, it's all a little mystifying.  John Cheever was a far better writer, yet his work seems somehow to be regarded by Americans as the lesser canon.  Time will correct this mistake, no doubt, but in the meantime Updike pours out ever more cloying and over-heated work like this.  If I still have your attention, let me recommend the 'Collected Stories' of John Cheever.  Updike could only dream of writing prose like that.  
 I was thinking this book was written from a Christian perspective.  WOW, was I wrong.  If your desire is to raise a WORLDLY, EGOTISTICAL, SELFISH and IMMORAL daughter then this is the book for you. I gave this book 1 star because zero and below was not an option 
 quindlen's advice here is certainly pretty sensible stuff, though i think any reasonably intelligent person could have come up with something just as good.  my real beef is with the price of the book in comparison to what you get.  the book is only 64 pages long and half of those pages are pictures with no text anywhere on the page.  so, being charged $12.95 for a 32 page book, and a pretty small one at that, strikes me as beyond ludicrous, even if the content is pretty good.  i'm just glad i checked it out from the library instead of buying it 
 I read another book by this author, Friendship Cake, which I really enjoyed and passed around to several friends. So I picked this one up thinking it would be worth a read. Luckily, it only took me about an hour and a half to read it, since that's about as long as I'll remember it.  I guess I never really cared about the characters too much. It's not a thick enough book that there's a lot of room for exploring and exposing the characters, which is too bad, because they could be interesting. And I know Hinton's capable of it from her last book. I also read that the author thinks race relations is so important to this story ... I never got the whole emphasis on race relations thing. The story happens to characters who happen to be interracial friends/lovers, but I never get that it's important to the plot.  Not to mention that the "big secret" is telegraphed so blatantly it's hard not to know what it is almost immediately.   In spite of its faults, I think it would be OK for a quick beach read or if you just don't care for much depth at the moment 
 Heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention.  Unfortunately, these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere.  This shoddy technique is found in all four of Hienlein's final books.  We are also treated to some of Heinlein's stock characters, dirty old men, horny female computers, naked adolescent girls, and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips.  Without these archetype characters most Heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed.  As if this isn't enough, Heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing.  In spite of all their cameo appearances, this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout.  Heinlein's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people, especially boys.  This novel, as well as most of Heinlein's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption 
 I can't help by not like anything about this movie. The actors seem to be as uninterested in making the movie as I was in watching it.  I returned it so fast it made the cashier dizzy.  Skip this stinker. Trust me.  You'll have more fun at the dentist 
 As a huge fan of "Chiefs", Stuart Woods first novel, I decided to give Dark Harbor a try.  What I found was a predictable plot, gratuitous sex, and all the marks of a "spit out thinly plotted books" machine.  Stone Barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family's life and left Stone as the executor of his will.  When it is discovered that the cousin worked for the C.I.A., Stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work.  As they investigate and the suspects materialize, the plot grows more and more predictable.  Run from this one 
 All the reviews from "Customer" from various cities are fake, just false advertising for this very inadequate book. Don't be mislead. Read my real review down below 
 Reading this pamphlet is one way to spend 20 minutes. However your 20 minutes would be better spent searching online for a book with a bit more "meat" on Japanese carriers 
  Unfortunately, this book says more about the author than the subject. If you want a book that demonstrates a problem, illustrates a potential solution and its applications; then don't buy this. This is a very personal and hence cloudy view of the subject matter. There is some useful information in this book but it is hidden behind the grand philosophical statements or buried in the foot notes.  Has this author ever met an empirical scientist, rather than mathematicians or philosophers. Scientists love measuring things. No scientist would ask the question 'Is an apple red or green?' They would pose the question 'How much pigment (in milligrams) of each of a series of colours does each apple have?' Or in truth something far more obtuse. In fact the fuzzy logic treatment would be a bit black and white for most scientists.   I suspect that there is a great deal more to the subject that the author communicates and I felt a bit cheated that there was not more substance in this book.  Did I miss something? If I did then the book did not work to convey the subject. If I didn't then fuzzy logic is one of a myriad of tools to handle uncertainty, and thus is a small branch of probability.   
 I only made it through the first 1/3 or so of the book, and skimmed the rest.  I assume that I am missing some great gems of romance writing wisdom, but I kept wanting to throw the book across the room.  There was some really bad advice, early on, which undermined the book's credibility for me.  The bit that sticks out in my mind is where the author advises getting the biggest, fastest computer with the best screen out there to work on.  Does she not know that text and word processing files are TINY in the world of 21st century computers?  A high-power computer is wasted on word processing.    I admit, this has very little to do with romance writing, and yet there's a big section on equipment in the book, much bigger and more directive than it needs to be.  Maybe that's the "Dummies" formatt/formula talking.  Parts 2 and 3 are the sections of the book that focus on romance writing.  I was not convinced by some of the author's advice in that section, either, though it wasn't as bad as the bit about the computer.  I haven't written a romance novel yet, but I've read quite a few good ones which don't line up with the advice this author/editor gives.    The sections on manuscript format, again, are much longer than they need to be and would only be useful to someone who's never read anything on how to submitt a manuscript, and/or can't use the internet.    There must be a better how-to-write-a-romance-novel book out there. There must be.  
 What a disgusting book.  Some 22 year old, who probably has never gone to a college writes a book about this?  What has happened to this country - the mentality of these people.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! 
 A good book if you are beggining in Marketing, but nothing new for experienced marketeers. Is easy to read, with the same old broadly used to explain almost everything examples (IPOD and others).  
 I purchased the book "The Anatomy of Buzz" and was happy to read about the impact that Word of Mouth marketing has on a product's success.  After reading "Ideavirus...", I was shocked to see that they used Seth Godin's name and quote on the back of it.  The first book was well written and provided several great references and facts that I am still using today.  The "Ideavirus" is, at best, a case study on the tripe people bought during the tech boom (and discarded shortly after the tech bust) to help "further" businesses marketing plans.  The bottom line of the book should have been "see: The Anatomy of Buzz", because while he tries to proclaim that he's found the "thing" that makes a product "sizzle", the reality is that all of the examples in the book were A. good products that B. people told each other about because C. they made life easier.  If you're looking for a good laugh, pick it up.  It's the cheapest laugh (I paid $1.99 used) I've had in a while.  Looking back, some of the non-referenced "facts" (see: "It costs an online retailer $80 just to get people to their storefront!") are downright hilarious 
 I liked the idea of this, the concept, so much more than the book itself. The life story of a famous villain sounds intriguing, but this falls short in Maguire's hands. He is good with language and turns of phrase; almost Byzantine at times, his writing is appropriately other-worldy, but it becomes distracting and too obvious for the most part.  He is not good at telling an absorbing story, even given some wonderful stuff that is already established. This book is slow going, and not at all similiar in whimsy or wildness to its original material by L. Frank Baum.   This could have been such a fun and fascinating story, but it is not. It is about prejudice and politics, and it paints an Oz that I wouldn't want to visit. Baum's Oz was colorful and dangerous and strange.  Maguire has taken a children's classic and made a very adult prequel/parallel novel, and he twists the Baum work and the 1939 film to fit into his vision. It reminded me at times of fan fiction.  The Witch I know could not have been a sympathetic and misunderstood person; she wasn't a crusader for animal rights. I like my villains bad, not in some gray area.   And now the sequels will keep churning out. Son of a Witch, The Cowardly Wars, and so on. I can just imagine future titles like The Quadling Child, The Fall of the Monkey Kingdom, blah blah blah...     I'll pass 
 I have never written a review before but was so disappointed with this book I felt compelled to this time. Don't be fooled by the attractive artwork, this story is incomprehensible to kids and adults.If you are looking for a bedtime book, pick something else or be prepared for questions about naked children being baked in ovens.  
 This book was written ( I bet)by unpaid graduate assistants. I borrowed it from the library to read before mr Fukuyama's arrival to speak at a university. The book was "written to order" to appeal to American conservatives. If Mr Fukuyama had really wanted to write about the construction/maintenance/increasing/decreasing of TRUST he could not have pointedly ignored the European Union. Nations and peoples with a thousand or more years of organised warfare are now at peace and trying to work together now that's an exercise in TRUST BUILDING. I asked Mr Fukuyama why, as the book doesn't have America in the title, did he only mention distrust in medieval Italy and not the phenominal TRUST required to bring Germans, Brits and the French together. His reply "Oh .. people always want me to talk about their country. Next question." well!.... I feel that this book is a dis service to Americans because as with so many political/cultural and economic books from the USA what is left out of the book adds to the hurly burly spiral of disinformation accepted as the truth about the world by many Americans and esp. uncrital conservatives. I am, of course by my own reckoning, a conservative - a mixed economy democratic christian from the U.K.(OK OK New Labour) So I am not hostile to the US, but this type of book and the supportive reviews sadden me. Good luck America and PLEASE read wider and TRAVEL 
 This album can't hold a candle to thier earlier releases WRECK YOUR LIFE, TOO FAR TO CARE, or HITCHHIKE TO RHOME!  This is alt/country/pop.  Or poop as I like to call it.  Sold the album on ebay!  What happened to the real stuff fellas? 
 Michael Moore can be really funny at times, but most people should not take this goofball too seriously.  About half way through 'The Big One', I turned it off because I did not find it the least bit funny and I didn't know where Moore was going.  What is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of Cheap Trick?  This is not one of his better films 
 This book had all the potential to develop more in terms of its storyline, but strangely, towards the end of the novel, I found myself not caring what happened to the protagonist, and not at all involved in any or all of her activities and pursuits.  The plot is hackneyed and contrived at best, in addition to being overwhelmingly cliched. Reading the novel was seriously and literally painful because of the abundance of typing, spelling and editorial errors; mistakes occur on nearly every page, if not every other page! One wonders how an award winning journalist could let slip all the errors and omissions that would have been picked up with more careful editing and proofreading. Surely, editorial staff have much to answer for too!  I'm not sure if this book should be allowed to remain on the shelves of any bookstore, let alone still continue to be sold at all. I would seriously recommend a total recall of all copies of this book from bookstores, followed by a thorough editing process before unleashing it onto an unsuspecting public. This is an outrageus assault on the reading standards and literacy expectations of literate people 
 You know a book is going to be mind numbing when the author praises their book above all others for about 4 pages.  I understand that this is a college level book but it didn't need to use so much jargon.  The paragraphs are almost impossible to decipher on the first, second, or even third read.  The author obviously had to use ambigious language to make himself seem more academic. When explaining the works of Goya they devote an entire chapter to him.  Pages upon pages which in reality could have been truncated down to perhaps 3 or 4. The pictures are on one page and the explanation of the pictures can be PAGES away.  Making studying extremely difficult.  My classmates and I believe that the true answers are in some other book, or perhaps you need a black light to find them.  This book is like punishment from God 
 It's very good, and I only give it one star because my teacher ruined it for me.  She analyzed everything Arthur Miller wrote in it, whether the lights were to be dark, or bright, how he shift time, how the instruments played, believing symbols of all of them.  Contrary to Arthur Millers own statements which I printed out and gave to the class, that he didn't plan on anything, he just wrote.  Let people do with it what they do.  In that affect, the teacher took a great play, and ruined it with her ideas of what he meant.  
 All this new magazine is is a glossy ad for makeup and clothes. I can't even get my subscription delivered and there is no phone number ANYWHERE to contact customer service.  Don't waste your money unless you love Paris Hilton 
 Admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it's moments of entertainment, BUT overall it's long and pretty boring.  It seems it would have been better suited as a play, which apparently it was originally.  I had just finished re-reading Romeo and Juliet when I rented this, thinking I was still in a Shakespeare mood, but this didn't do it for me.  I suppose if I had just finished reading or watching Hamlet, it would have been better.  My favorite parts are Oldman's silent scientific discoveries, completely amusing.  Couldn't wait for the movie to end, honestly 
 I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more happy.  Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined.  With the flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some firework sound effects.   Boy was I wrong. I opened the book only to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks.   At that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. It's only now that I can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is.   I say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects.   I have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made.   The methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest.   We found some very good books and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II." Its published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life. Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. I've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house.   Now I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling. 
 The Micro has some excellent features at the right price. But it fails to work all the time. First it was the firmware, then it wouldn't connect to my PC, now the hardware has failed. I am going to buy an I Pod, despite Apple's refusal to allow other forms of mp3 downloads.
