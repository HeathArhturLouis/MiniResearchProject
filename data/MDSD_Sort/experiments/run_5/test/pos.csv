 Everybody in town loves Edwina, the dinosaur. And why wouldn't they? She's helpful and charming and winsome and makes great chocolate chip cookies. But smarty-pants Reginald von Hoobie-Doobie is very irritated that nobody -- least of all Edwina herself -- realizes that dinosaurs are extinct. And so he sets out to disprove Edwina's existence. While this book isn't as silly as the Pigeon series or Knuffle Bunny, "Edwina" is a solid read-aloud that will be enjoyed by children ages 4-6. And adults will appreciate the subtle humor in Willem's illustrations. 
 Unless you took a good American Literature survey course, you probably never heard of or remember the author, William Dean Howles.  After reading A Hazard of New Fortunes, you will both remember him and recommend the book and may want to read his other work 
 What a thrill to find Jeff Meyer's book at Amazon and Barnes& Noble! I had no idea he was working on one - and one so comprehensive as this. I knew he was  extremely involved in the historic tree/seed program and research. There is also a very interesting documentary on this subject that Jeff appeared in and advised on, which was aired on PBS this year. His mother, Joanne, has been a strong influence on Jeff in this field. She is a tireless member of The Garden Club of America and, by her efforts, raised the conciousness of many.This book is a fine explanation of all the work that has been done to preserve history, as well as to make us more aware of how important beautiful trees are to our quality of life on this planet. The photography is marvellous and the book is a wonderful read, as well as a great coffee table book for just a quick pickup. We all love a "picture book", don't we 
 So yeah, it's got a few flaws, two of linked novellas are fairly similar for instance, but overall I really enjoyed it. If you've read Martin's Ice and Fire series, Tuf is a bit like Tyrion, though not quite as nasty and a little more verbose with his vernacular. The first story feels a bit like Joss Whedon's Firefly, (which any sane person would agree is a good thing,) and progresses from there to a number of other interconnected stories that chronologically follow the same central character as he uses the most powerful vessel in the universe in a number of interesting, entertaining, and always thought provoking ways. Not that the book is all intellectualism and moral dilemma, there are fight scenes, dinosaur attacks etc.  If your a fan of Martin's at all I don't see how you couldn't like this one. It's better than Dying of the Light and most of his early sci-fi short stories. I only had two problems with it. The above mentioned similarity with two of the installments and Tuf's too-oft statement to his cat about the untrustworthiness of strangers. That just got annoying after the third part. But those are really little things. I read it in about three days and enjoyed it thoroughly. As I hope you will. 
 I AM AMAZED BY THE SCOPE OF THIS BOOK IN CATALOGING THE LIGHTS OF DAN FLAVIN. I NEVER REALIZED THAT HE HAD DONE SO MANY WORKS IN SO MANY CONFIGURATIONS, AND HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY ARE.  IT'S INSPIRATIONAL. THANK YOU MICHAEL GOVAN 
 I have not read this work.  I have, however, read most of Fante's other works. I know Bandini well.  Look at them down there, this "Queequeg" and the little lady, slandering a work of art and conscience. Oh, it's racist! oh, I feel excluded! Tough, little lady. Go back to your happy literature. Or are you not satisfied? will you take from us every last refuge? Oh boo hoo for you, you felt excluded. Good literature is not universal; that is to say, good literature discriminates, chooses. You were chosen against by Arturo Bandini. So solly.   As for "Queequeg"....what can one say. These subhumans have title in the Leftist Inquisition. They're perpetual axe-grinders, defamers, petty resentful polecats....What would Bandini do 
 What can I say?  Don't leave home without it.  As usual, in addition to all the little details you like to know about before you get to each city, the photographs give you good ideas for where to be, where to stand, what time of day, etc. for you own creativity.  We will not travel without an Eyewitness Guide if there is one for that particular destination. 
 I bought this CD on a whim and was immediately floored by the presentation and quality of composition. This is a live album recorded at the Montreux Festival. It possesses a tremendous audio soundstage putting you right there in the audience for the event. Sweet! The New Tango is infused with a light jazz fusion which is new and joyful while remaining true in theme to its Latin roots.   Piazzolla and Burton immediately create the exotic fluid mood of this CD with their intro piece "Milonga is Coming." This is a CD for pure musical enjoyment and not dancing. Don't let the other reviewers looking for background Tango music confuse the issue. This music is a fusion of Tango and Jazz yielding a sumptuous and thickly romantic sound coupled with an equally irresistable jazz heartbeat. Burton's Vibes provide accenting on and off tempo syncopation that really sends the music into motion. I could not help but be lifted and carried along with the fresh tropical sounds "The New Tango" provides. 
 I'll open by saying that I picked Rashomon up because of how critical it is in the movie Ghost Dog (quick piece; Forest Whitaker plays a person who works for them mob from time to time as a hitman.  He only works for one person in the mob and he follows the code of bushido.  Rating it on the Amazon scale, I'd rate it 4.5 out of 5!).  Rashomon is a series of short stories written by Akutagawa in the early 1900's describing life in medieval Japan.  All of these stories have excellent descriptions of people and how the people act/react to the story being told.  As a matter of fact, when reading this book, the characters reminded me of Kurosawa's character development in his movies.  As for the stories themselves, Akutagawa often uses biting satire to describe things much as O'Henry did (actually, in reading Rashomon I was reminded of O'Henry more than once).  If you have an interest in medieval Japan or stories with character, I highly recommend Rashomon.  My personal rating, 4.5 out of 5.  Since Amazon doesn't permit half stars, round it up to 5!  Btw, there is a similarity between Ghost Dog and Rashomon; character development and the way the story unfolds! 
 Olivia is written and illustrated by Ian Falconer.  This book is the winner of the Caldecott Honor.   Olivia is a book about a pig named Olivia.  She is good at lots of things like wearing herself out and other people out.    Olivia lives with her mom, dad, her brother, Ian, her dog, Perry, and her cat named Edwin.   When Olivia gets dressed, she tries on everything in red.   On sunny days, Olivia likes to go to the beach.  She is good at building sand castles. On rainy days, she likes to go to the museum. Olivia is never sleepy! My favorite part of the book is when Olivia's mother is putting her to bed.  Her mother gives her a kiss and says, "You know, you really wear me out.  But I love you anyway."  Then Olivia says, "I love you anyway too." I recommend this book to everyone because Olivia is a great character and the pictures have lots of detail.  This is a book you will enjoy reading over and over again 
 After nightly calls from someone eventually claiming to be his father, Errol Porter sets out on a path to find the truth which lands him at a cemetery in the middle of the night.  The man he finds there isn't his father -- not as Errol remembers him, but is instead a younger version of his deceased father, with all his memories, mannerisms, and more.  Unknowingly and without much choice, Errol is catapulted into another dimension, on the edge of reality as he knows it.  Though Errol teeters back and forth from believing what is being presented to him, those around him who he shares the information with have no trouble believing that the young stranger is his father.  It is up to Errol to keep him (and those like him) safe as the federal government becomes involved and will stop at nothing to keep their findings a secret from the world.   Once again, Walter Mosley has written a captivating story that is original and outside of the box.  What I loved about THE WAVE is that it is a thought-provoking and out-of-the-ordinary, and though it delves into the supernatural, it is actually believable.  Mosley showcases some of mankind's major flaws wrought about by laws, rules of society, and the reluctance to change. His writing is, as always, intriguing, and inspires one to think and question reality as we know it.  His characters are multi-dimensional, complementing one another and the reader is instantly pulled into the story.   Reviewed by Tee C. Royal  of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers 
 What we can say about this experiences of R.L. and other new musicians of our times??Fantastic!! I'm a bluesfan,and i really know something about the history of the blues,his influences,his hard way to become a rythm recognized all over the world.Here in Brazil we are really tasting a same experience with funk music that took all the places,all of the social slices,and this musical style as the blues,come from the underground,at U.S.,they called ghettos,here we call the "favelas(slumbers)"and whatever the funk musics goes,they causes a chaos,discrimination attitudes from a great part of people,etc...etc.. But what we cannot forget is the capacity of this kind of music,to transformate,influenciate,a great number of members of this new generation!And what R.L. did is to recognizes this influences of modern styles and put it together with our great blues,to create a new kind of music that is,undoubtedly a phenomen!!! We are in front of perhaps,one of the great bluesman of ever!!! This man is teaching how we must do,to be in tune with the musical modern tendences of the New Era!!! Great cd,of a great bluesman of the past and new millenium!!!!! 
 I'm more than a little surprised that this book, published in August 2005, hadn't already received a review by the time of my own review here in mid-February 2006. There has been a lot of buzz about the book, not least because it is the work of one man: Paul Griffiths, former music critic of The New Yorker and the New York Times. The book goes toe to toe with other similar books like the Oxford Dictionary of Music or the Harvard Dictionary of Music, and others of that ilk. It appears to me to be the equal of those which were written by committees of musicologists. And it has the advantage of putting forth the viewpoints of a single author. I found myself browsing with utter delight. My problem with browsing was that when I was referred from an article on, say, Beethoven to one on Handel, I would get side-tracked when, as I turned pages, I came across an article on Frau ohne Schatten, Mirella Freni, or the French sixth. But then that's part of the pleasure of a book of this sort. I took to writing down where I wanted to eventually get to in the book because most times I would get so caught up in the intervening reading that I'd forgotten where I had intended to go.   The book contains short articles (and some not so short -- the one on Beethoven, for instance, takes six pages) on innumerable topics, covered in nearly 900 pages. It covers composers well-known (Beethoven, Bach, Brahms) and those barely heard of (Franchetti, Nanino, Gruenberg), as well as instrumentalists, music publishers, conductors, singers and the like. Basic (and some not-so-basic) musical terms are defined and sometimes examples given. There are articles on the various musical instruments and their histories, as well as disquisitions on various musical forms, techniques, styles, artistic movements et al. There are brief articles on important musical works (e.g. Goldberg Variations) and he provides brief synopses of operas.   Griffiths writes in a smooth modern authoritative-yet-casual style that is extremely easy to read; this is no surprise as he is also a published poet and novelist. He includes enough oddities and rare facts to make a grizzled veteran like myself want to keep reading. Yet he covers the basics without becoming pedantic or pompous. When in an article he uses an abbreviation or set of initials (e.g. LSO: London Symphony Orchestra) one can find the definition under the alphabetical listing for that term. One small deficiency is that he makes no effort to provide pronunciations of non-English terms. As in any work of this scope, he has had to make decisions about what to include and what to leave out. Thus, pianist Marc-Andr Hamelin rates an article, but his pianistic colleague Stephen Hough does not. One is amazed, though, at how much he manages to include without the work assuming truly gargantuan proportions; in its paperback format the book is easy to handle and will not break your toe if you drop it. It has an attractive format, the paper is sturdy and the print easy to read.   This book would be a valuable addition to any musiclover's library. Strongly recommended.  Scott Morriso 
 Dr. John Murray's classic on the Reformed perspective of the atonement offers insights from the Scriptures that help the reader to better grasp the doctrine of particular redemption (or limited atonement).  Murray's writing style is rather technical and the average reader may struggle with some aspects of the book.    If you desire, however, a Reformed perspective on the redemptive work of Christ and for whom did Jesus die on the cross then I would highly recommend this book.  Murray, along with John Owen, represent the best Reformed writers on particular redemption.  For an Arminian view see John Goodwin's REDEMPTION REDEEMED: A PURITAN DEFENSE OF UNLIMITED ATONEMENT 
 Raymond Chandler certainly has a flair for terse dialogue and hardboiled metaphor, as well as knack for quick-sketching believable characters. But the active Philip Marlowe is the presence in THE LADY IN THE LAKE that kept this reader on the case. Reason: For me, narrators who seize the initiative are better in mysteries than narrators who are saved by dumb luck or the deus ex machina of improbable intervention.  But let's be honest. Hasn't Chandler been surpassed by others writing in this genre? I read very few mysteries--only three in the last three years according to my Amazon.com reviews. But two of these mysteries show Chandler's limits. For example, NIGHT TRAIN (Amis) certainly surpassed this book in sparkling dialogue and metaphor. And, TELL NO ONE (Coben) has characters that are just as well drawn while its plot (admittedly farfetched) is just as surprising but never hard to follow.   What THE LADY IN THE LAKE says to me is that an above average author can write to make a dollar and still do good work. I suppose the key is to work within a genre. Then, the genre keeps a middling author from overreaching, while making him mind his Ps and Qs. Such discipline enables a modest talent, like Chandler, to produce something beloved and lasting.

 "It's funny what a picture can do":  1/400th of a second in time.  I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie.  Will Eastwood respect the book?, I believe it is in his nature to do so.  The true story surrounding the flag raising on Mt. Suribachi in Iwo Jima.  Well written, with tales of heroism; hard not to shed a tear.  We will learn the names of the marines who made famous that one day in time;  who they were, their hometowns, their progression from training, to individual deployment, to the forming of the squad.  Finally progressing to the day they meet and each individuals final fate.  The Japanese were as phantoms, fighting to the very last man.  Our marines had to fight for every square inch on a volcanic wasteland.  The initial fight was for Mt. Suribachi.   But at the raising of the flag (the second one to be raised) the battle was not over.  The horrific losses were just beginning.  Why could they have not just starved the island out?  "The heroes of Iwo Jima are the guys who didn't come back"  Lets thank those who were "just doing their duty".  Wish you well Scot 
 First Book I've read from Sandra Brown and it was really great. It was a page turner from beginning to end. I found the book interesting and easy reading. A well written mystery suspense that keeps you guessing until the very end. Will not be the last Sandra Brown novel for me

 While Ellis is the originator of REBT, he may or may not be the best author on the subject.

 Upon the first forty seconds of the first song, you just might be tapping your foot- to the beat of the song- because Pinback carries a beat- to the song. I think I said that all correctly.  What I mean by all of this is that Pinback is not just a pile of different sounds meshed together to make a noise that you can see your neighborhood punks blasting late at night for no logical reason- oh no, Pinback features melody. "Concrete Seconds" officially declares that as so. Just listen to the guitar in each song followed by the drums or drum machine, and you might just see what I mean. Well, if you haven't heard it- take my word for it. So we've established that this CD has melody. A concurrent and beautiful melody, if I may say so myself. I mean, when you listen, there is no loud and abrupt sound that make you cringe, or any ridiculous solos in the middle of songs that seem completely pointless. When you listen to this CD, it will seem like...  ... Like everything is in it's place- right where it belongs. And it carries a beat too, remember, so... you have pretty good music on your hands.  And you have some differentiation as well. For example, "Boo" is a very laid back and easy song to just listen to in the long hours of the night, and incorperates somewhat of a "drowning" feeling as well. Then, the music switches to "Bbtone", where you have more a preppy (but not dancy-preppy, more like bob-your-head-and-smile preppy) beat, that becomes catchy and memorable as soon as the verse kicks in.  I suppose I should mention at this time that there is an amazing harminization between the two singers at any given time, when they have to sing their part as well. Rob Crow and Zach Smith's vocals are soothing and fluent, which perhaps makes Pinback so worthy of a grand title. Take "Penelope" for example- you have Crow singing softly, or just going "oooooooooh, realease that air" while Smith sings almost delicately. Again, preservation of melody.  I also wish to state this- when you listen to the CD, you will most likely find a favorite song. Many prefer the aforementioned "Penelope", or the uncanny but delectable "Prog", or even the mysterious "Seville" (Sheena Bella, Sheena Bella, that name will get stuck in your head [only if you can decrypt the lyrics]). I personally prefer "Bbtone" myself, along with the very gentle song "Tres", which some may consider to be a marvelous piece on it's own, where the piano plays a major role.  Either way, if you give each of these songs time, you most likely will enjoy them all. Each song seems to have it's own... flavor, and what makes it so amazing is simply... well, simply what it is. This whole CD is wonderous, inspiring, and vibrant, and you should not miss it. Pinback's unique melody and harmonizing vocals are purely grogeous, and if you allow it, they will find some place in your memories. Or they'll just give you that tingly feeling when you listen to it a year later...  A great CD essentially 
 Having been a text-based HTML guy for years, I decided I needed to get with on the WYSIWYG bandwagon.  This book has been a tremendous help!  Amateur or professional, you can pick up this book and get the information you need in seconds.

 Nice job, Ms. Abbott!  Your novel was so tough to put down, and the writing was excellent--so much better than most of the tripe American authors slap down on a page.  Your heroine was wonderful, and her hint of decadence made us like her more since it was surrounded by her innate goodness, conservatism, and family orientation.    Particularly arresting was that moment when Lora sees Alice looking through the family photo album late at night--your description of Alice's expression was truly haunting and secured me as a fan of your writing.  You were able to elicit from your phrasing a dense, murky atmosphere that felt so real.  I felt like I was in southern California in the early '60s every time I picked up the book to continue reading of Lora's, Bill's, and Alice's tale.  The characterization of Alice was gripping.  Just when she's "arrived", she realizes she can't quite (and doesn't even want to) give up her sordid past.  Your description of how she can keep up her public face 99 percent of the time makes the 1 percent appearance of the dark Alice all the more scary.  I can't wait for your next novel!.  I'll definitely read it because this one was so thoughtful and different 
 Surprisingly, I really enjoyed this book! It is about how to be a "Doll" -- a charming, graceful, accomplished, and incredibly stylish lady -- while paying attention to how to be beautiful both on the inside and on the outside.  And who doesn't want that? It really is an ideal combination.  Beautylicious really emphasizes the fact that "fabulous" on the inside and "fabulous" on the outside go hand in hand. The best part is that it isn't a farce.  It isn't an exaggerated, comical advice book to make you laugh.   This is a great inspirational and how-to book for women who want to live life feeling great on the inside AND looking great on the outside. 
 Excellent release for Lo Pro, with the former Ultraspank singer Pete Murray.  Every song has its moments and the album blends together well.  The vocals are unbelievable.  I recommend this purchase for anyone who like rock music.  Check out Pete Murray's new band Chokt on Myspace. 
 Jane Adams is the female lead of Louis Menand's The Metaphysical Club.  Here is a review of her book by one of it's male leads, William James, from a letter to her:  I have just read your Spirit of Youth, and think it "simply great."  Hard not to cry at certain pages!  The fact is, Madam, that you are not like the rest of us, who SEEK the truth and TRY to express it.  You INHABIT reality; and when you open your mouth truth can't help being uttered.  I think that this book will have a great and vital influence.  
 This is easily one of the best books on late 20th century third party politics out there. As a journalist who covers third parties this election year, I found this book to be immesely helpful in its analysis of the Reform Party effort as well as a superb account of Nader's unsuccessful 2000 run. If you are reading just one book on third party politics, this should be it 
 This is a good book.  It's easy to read, speaks directly to the reader, and makes excellent points about how -- and how not to -- do direct mail fund raising.  I'm not an expert on direct mail, but I've done it before.  Hitchcock's advice is right on target and easy to explain to non-development staff, board members, and volunteers.  Hitchcock is President of Mal Warwick and Associates.  This firm does a lot of fund raising consulting, and Mal Warwick is well-known for his many books on nonprofit fundraising.  In fact, "Ten Steps to Fundraising Success" was co-written by Messrs. Warwick and Hitchcock.  The book is organized around six key themes (see list below), and the 83 "chapters" are very short (often 3-4 pages each) ideas relating to the theme.  These ideas often include concrete advice, checklists, and lists of numbered tips that make the advice easy to follow.  Much of the advice and knowledge is deceptively simple -- we feel we should know this, but often we don't act as through we do.  For example, the book instructs on how to keep an appeal simple, direct, informal, and free of verbal or physical clutter.  Did you know that including your nonprofit's brochure in a fundraising mailing actually decreases donor response?  Did you know that cramming a lot of words, no matter how well-written, on a single page to save a little printing and postage money actually costs your organization far more in lost donations?  Reading this book has helped me in my consultation work with clients, in my work as a volunteer trustee of a national foundation, and as a consumer and citizen evaluating the direct mail appeals I receive all the time. Stephen Hitchcock is generous in writing a book that allows the rest of us to feel we're as savvy about direct mail fundraising as he has become through years of experience. 
 Sarah, Plain and Tall is a heartfelt story about a family who lost a mother and wife.   Jacob, Caleb and Anna's father, must make the decision to place an ad for a wife and mother for the best for all of them.  Sarah, a young lady from Maine, returns letters back and forth to the whole family getting to know them better.  She decides to come down to the prairies of Kansas from the sea for a month to see if this is a life she could become accustomed to.  When the children see the yellow bonnet coming down the road, excitement was in the air along with anticipation.  Would she decide to stay and marry Jacob, or would this place be too small and too far away from the sea for Sarah.   	Maclachlan chooses to have the young daughter, Anna tell this story to get a better understanding of what young children had to go through back in the prairie days. (Around the late 1800s)  Anna shows us the inside picture of what is like to have to suddenly lose a mother, say hello to a new brother, and have the heart and maturity to accept and love a new mother.   	The theme is a lesson for all to learn.  Through pain and tragedy, great new things can arise.  Everyone has pain in their lives, whether it is a death or something else.  Choosing to fall apart and never sing again or to become stronger and better because of the situation is the outcome.  Anna shows how strong she had to be to lose her mother and still be pretty much the woman in that family.  Sarah shows how is hard to say goodbye to family and one way of life.  She realizes that now it would be just as hard to leave her new family.  Yes, she will forever miss the sea and her brother, but nothing could replace the dunes, animals, and family that she now has in her new life forever.    
 There is a reason why George Morris is such a revered member of this sport!  This book is brilliantly written in that it takes a form of a horseback riding that appears so complex and makes it easy for anyone to understand.  I rely on this book as the basis for my training in hunt seat.  His emphasis on not only on technical maneuvers, but on style as well and, through his pages, the reader truly comes to appreciate both the athleticism and beauty of this sport 
 As a former prosecutor and current defense attorney, I began this book with some ambiguity.  However, the story of Ron Williamson and the Oklahoma justice system (or lack thereof) soon captured me and moved me.  I have read virtually all of Grisham's novels.  Some are excellent, some are mildly entertaining, some are mediocre.  This is, by far, the most outstanding and worthy of any awards it receives.  
 As one of the foremost fantasy illustrators of the past twenty years Canadian born John Howe has done more to define the look of Tolkien's world than almost any other illustrator (along with Alan Lee!). He captures in vibrant and dramatic images the grandeur and majesty of Middle Earth, in calendars and on book covers alike. But he is much more than just a visual interpreter of Tolkien's work, getting his big break in Time Life's: The Enchanted World series in the 1980s his art has graced the covers of some of the bestselling fantasy authors of today. He has illustrated books on myth, legend and fairy tale, he's even written and illustrated several enchanting children's books.   His magical art for the book "A Diversity of Dragons" or his book on medieval armour with its complex and detailed illustrations has cemented his already well earned reputation. John Howe occasionally tries his hand at science fiction illustration when he gets the chance. Though of course and with good reason he is mainly and justly famous for his work exploring fantasy, myth, legend, folklore and fairytale. This book is a stunning portfolio of some of the most significant and beautiful masterpieces that have marked his career thus far, and an exploration of what inspires him as an artist (like for example, ravens or horse-shoe crabs!).   With revealing commentary from some of the people he has collaborated with over the years this insightful volume explains why he is so sought after as a fantasy illustrator. There is even a fascinating chapter on his passion and hobby, creating medieval arms and armour for a re-enactment society in Switzerland, where he also lives. While many of the pictures are a bit on the small side and hence fail to do justice to his art, and I also think the text is a bit thin... one can't really complain. As one of my favorite modern illustrators I was very pleased when this long overdue book was finally published 
 Here's the thing: I'm a mother and I completely recognized myself in this book about fatherhood. Elisha Cooper's essays about his first year as a breastless parent is honest, hilarious, and insightful.  I alternately laughed out loud (cliche though that may sound) and nodded my head vigorously with recognition.  Cooper owns up to a short temper (check), to stealing time by dawdling on his solo errands (check) and to not changing his shirt during a cross-country drive (uh, well, maybe not...).   But his attention to his daughter, to what she is thinking, feeling, and perceiving at every moment, and his articulate musings on her future and on his future with her make me want to be a better parent.  Crawling is for every potential father and mother who is apprehensive about maintaining his or her sense of self and privacy after the kid arrives. Which is to say, it's for all parents

 This book is great for someone who has a little experience with baskets already.  Someone with no experience can follow as well, but some of the techniques are a little bit harder than in standard basket weaving.  The instructions are pretty clear, and if you thouroughly read them, then you  shouldn't have any trouble.  Overall, this book makes a great addition to a  basketweaver's library, and I'm glad that I bought it

 This is a great book, and I own an earlier edition of it. However, I was looking for a decent updated version. This is not it--I'm glad I borrowed it from the library first.   There is one chapter dealing with PDAs and other organizing devices, and how they might impact your organizational style, but the info was pretty obvious--if you're an "everything out", visually oriented-type person, a PDA is just not going to do it for you--you're better off with a conventional planner or wall calendar.  So, buy the book, but the earlier edition is just as good if you can get it cheaper 
 This fascinating book is a powerful illustration of the value of Zen to understand structures, processes and dilemmas that faces every manager when analysing problems and making decisions. There is an actual  link between organizations and products to keep the track of competetive actions and strategic plans. In this book, any product is understood as an idea in a form with a demand; it introduces an innovative frame of reference to understand the development, processing and distribution stage of good and services in any firm or agency.   Work is understood as the exercise of discretion within limits in order to produce a result. This is also an innovative framework to analyse task cycles, job description and evaluation as well as setting up a salary administration system. Four criteria by which to judge organizational effectiveness are approached: simplicity, completeness, pragmatism and communicability. The author has been a business executive for two decades and now, retired, is the director of the Montreal Zen Center. Both facets together give him an unusual and unique perspective on managerial things. He has the rare ability to express complex concepts in clear, strong and compelling language. There is a French and Spanish version of this book

Williams is so much at center stage behind the microphone, doing his imrovisational schtick as only he can, that whatever else the movie is about becomes inconsequential and quickly forgotten. The movie is an exhausting experience to watch, as it must have been for Williams to perform. It's an amazing one-man show, but the picture as a whole left me somewhat empty 
 I liked most all the patterns in this book.  My favorites are the ripple stitch drawsring purse and the updated old pattern for the black purse(nice shape for that purse).  I would recommend this book, especially if you are into purses 
 Devlin is not esoteric in his approach; he is not interested in ivory tower mental rumination.  One need only an imagination, not cumulative jargon. He sincerely wants to share the beauty of mathematics with the general populace, its theoretical development and utility. The reader gathers that mathematics is an approachable language, not pig latin for some apocryphal secret society!! 5 STARS!!! 
 By far one of his best (if not his BEST) album. Featuring hit songs like `They Dance Alone', `Englishman in New York', `Be Still My Beating Heart', and (my personal favorite) `Sister Moon'. Sting's creative genius shines through this album, no two tracks have the same melody, tempo, or meaning- every single one is unique. Ranging in songs from the optimistic, jazz-like, `Englishman in New York' to the soft ballad `The Secret Marriage', Sting touches on themes of love, happiness, conformity, war, peace, success, and failure. Added to the lyrics is a description that explains why each song was written and how the melody and words were engendered. This is a must have album for fans everywhere and a great addition to any music collection 
 My family has a long-standing love affair with roses:  a "Belle of Portugal" that my grandmother planted in the 1920's has been passed down through several generations.  So I found this book utterly delightful, full of fascinating anecdotes about old varieties of roses, the characters who developed and distributed them, and the even wilder characters who "rustle" and propagate old roses with passion and gusto today.  The chapters are thematic and geographical, rather than historical, but they're immensely fun to read.  I learned all sorts of amazing historical trivia -- e.g., why the Grass Valley, CA public library owns a Cornish/English dictionary, and the political aspects of rose nomenclature.  And, as someone interested in "heirloom" plants in general (I'm a card-carrying member of Slow Food), I found his discussion of rose genetics and propagation fascinating.  Some of his stories are poignant, too -- e.g., the elderly black women in rural Texas who propagated roses over the centuries from sheer love, but were dying out even as he wrote.  I enjoyed the book thoroughly, and recommend it even if you're not an old rose buff 
 All I have to say is this entire compilation will make you weep from its incredible beauty 
 In my view, this book explains what motivates  the Muslim world into holy wars aginst non-Muslims, and how they pursue they pursue these motivations.  The attitudes of today's radical Islamists and Pan Arab nationalists are sketched with meticulous accuracy. The author has a good commands of the facts, and more importantly, he connects very well between dots.  The book gives facts that are hard to argue with.  Though he does not dwell on the subject, Islamic Imperialism also explains why Christians in today's Arab world (Jews were expelled) are persecuted and given inferior status, as is the situation in Egypt.   
 Roark's has been and remains an excellent resource for the structural engineer and designer regardless of the edition.  This is a referance I use on a daily basis.  Typically the first book I reach for 
 Scott McCloud became the premier comics theorist with his first book, Understanding Comics.  His second book, Reinventing Comics, was much more controversial and not nearly as well received as his first.  Finally, 13 years after his first magnificent insight into the comics world, Scott McCloud publishes Making Comics, a book he was destined to make since 1993.  All of the theories in Making Comics are not only sound but brilliant and insightful, covering a vast range of topics from body language and facial expressions to the tools of the trade to the ever expanding genres and ways to publish comics.   McCloud thoroughly dissects and examines every issue comics creators come across during the creative process and presents it in a way that's easy to comprehend and mindblowing at the same time.  Along with presenting these findings, he tacks on notes to the end of each chapter with exercises that are easy to do and perfect for getting the creative juices flowing for aspiring comics creators.  Not only is Making Comics an effective textbook for learners but, as a structured book, it's an intriguing narrative as well with McCloud bending, breaking, and exemplifying every rule he discusses.  Through his narrative and visual style, Making Comics becomes an adventure with a character that can literally do anything.  All through the book Scott displays a drive to create the ultimate comic book story he knows he's capable of making but all indications show that with Making Comics, he's already made it. 
 A book about "instructors" full of desire to give "something of truth" to whoever has a burning drive to learn what is unknown to him - be it some useful method to achieve a specific goal or the meaning behind that goal itself. Having read this short story, I appreciate once more the people whom I already admire. 
 Only thing noticed is that the book lacks some of the parts  that are shown in the TV version movie.  My Granddaughter (age 5) noticed it right away.   My personal opinion is that it probably can't be helped in producing a movie out of a book.  The rest is very good and we've read it a few times already 
 I don't really know how to describe it but I'd have to say that "Rapid Fire","Breaking the Law" and Steeler are the best songs on there. I'd probably pick Rapid Fire as my fav. It's fast and powerful and Prieset's guitar solos are awesome 
 This is the original story by Annie Proulx as well as the movie script. Great for fans of the film as a collector item 
 This book could have some editng and there are some artits such as Lorez Alexandria and Etta Jones Mr. Friedwald should of,at leasr, mentioned. However, the ones he does write about are given the credit they deserve!  While I don't share his appreciation of Betty Carter,Carmen Mcrae, and Mark  Murphy; his comments on Tony Bennett,Peggy Lee,Nat King Cole, and Della  Reese are right on the mar 
 I LOVE the 100 calorie packs!My favorites are the Sunchips,the Teddy Grahams,and now the LD shortbreads!  In my town,it's hard to get any of the popular 100 calorie packs,like the Cheetos,Sunchips,or Hostess carrot cakes because they always sell out.But the Teddy Grahams and Lorna Doone shortbreads never seem to sell here,so I always have plenty.  I try to limit myself to one pouch a day,but somedays I might have 2 because they are so good 
 I agree with other reviewers that the maps and images are of very poor quality but the quality of the writing far offsets that. One of the best books I have read this year! I highly recommend it, especially if you are as ignorant of what this voyage was like as I was 
 The U.S. intelligence system in low intensity operations needs to be properly integrated into the new world order. September 11 was the impetus for an awareness of world order, or disorder, depending on where you stand.  To argue that fighting terrorism perpetrated by a handful of Islamic fundamentalists equates to all Muslims as potential enemies is absurd. Nevertheless, ideologically based terrorism that includes religious terrorism, is hard to eliminate due to holding appeal to a wider section of the population. If there really is a specifically Islamic challenge to the West that repudiates its values, often resorts to violence and appears to be growing in strength, then the intelligence system had better adapt.   The objective as described in detail within Culture Matters, is to achieve containment by limiting the appeal of the extremists to their likely sympathizers, as total elimination is neither practical nor desirable.  This volume is comprised of individual works by esteemed social scientists, journalists, and practitioners from around the world on such issues as the `Moral Imperative'; e.g.   "There are three basic levels of morality...The lowest is criminal-disregard for the rights of others and the law...In development-favorable cultures, there is widespread compliance with laws and norms that are totally exigent and are therefore realizable. Moral law and social reality virtually coincide. In development-resistant cultures, on the other hand, there are two worlds that are out of touch with each other. One is the exalted world of the highest standards and the other is the real world of furtive immorality and generalized hypocrisy. The law is a remote, utopian ideal that does little more than express what people might in theory prefer, whereas the real world, effectively out of touch with all law, operates under the law of the jungle, the law of the cleverest or the strongest, a world of foxes and lions disguised as lambs." P 48.  "The challenge ahead is the need for global civizational dialogue as a prerequisite for a peaceful world order. The preceived clash of civilizations makes the dialogue imperative...The paradox, then, is our willingness and courage to understand radical otherness as a necessary step toward self-understanding." P. 266.  Get it, read it, learn. 
 this was my 5th bukowski book and it is my favorite, tied with 'you get so alone at times that it just makes sense'. it is beautifully written, i love the way bukowski looks at life. as a 20 year old female i dont know how i manage to relate with chinaski but i do.  i think im going to read everything bukowski ever wrote. 
 I have been a Roy Acuff fan for over 50 years. There were some songs on this CD that I have been seeking for a long time. Thanks to Amazon's excellent service, I was able to go back in time and enjoy Roy Acuff's music again 
 Blessings is one of those rare novels which takes a single-word title into seven-dimensions of meaning in a delightful story about family love.   Before introducing the story, let me outline the "blessings" references to help you appreciate the subtleties of this book.  1.  Blessings is a place, the country home of the Blessing family.  2.  The Blessings are a family that has had its ups and downs and sees its extinction coming.  3.  Blessings are those gifts that we receive from God every day that we take for granted . . . like our families, the beauties of nature around us and our health.  4.  Blessings occur when a new child is born . . . something we often call a blessed event.  5.  Blessings are ours when others show love and appreciation for us.  6.  Blessings can move us to live a better life when we are inspired to turn to goodness.  As the story begins, an unwed couple is sneaking up at night on Blessings, the home of 80 year-old Lydia Blessing.  Startled by a security light, the father takes their baby to the bottom of the stairs to the garage apartment rather than the main house.  There, handyman Skip Cuddy discovers the little girl and takes her in.  He finds himself totally charmed and challenged by this baby.    Soon, Lydia Blessing realizes that Skip is parenting a baby alone and agrees to help him tend Faith.  From that awkward beginning a strong bond develops among the three of them.  Strengthened by this chance to nurture Faith, Skip and Lydia discover new depths of love, understanding and respect in one another.  How well will these bonds endure when the world's expectations and perceptions intervene?  The answer to that question is what makes this a grand story.  Many will be disappointed with the story's ending, finding the transcendent focus of the conclusion to be unsatisfyingly spiritual . . . rather than tangible.  For me, the book's main weakness was a tendency to over draw characters and situations which made the story clearer . . . but less convincing.  If you read it more like you would a fable, you will undoubtedly rate the book as a five-star effort.            
 I somewhat disagree with the other posts by the "veterans", however that could be because this was the first Mage book I began on. I mean, yes, I disagree with the fact that some story elements are missing, Mood and the Example Of Play section for example leaves you kind of lost.Call me Technocratic, but I feel that the Paradox system is efficient, and the read overall isn't as confusing as most players can rumor it to be. "It's like rolling dice to a freakin' VCR manual!" I got the substance out of this book, but the actual purpose of a Mage after the Ascension War is still hazy to me...Which actually leaves a player with more reason to become an Ecstatic. Whatever, though. Being the die-hard White Wolf fan that I am, I'm satisfied enough with the Revised publication 
 Learn some new ways iof looking at color ar expand what you think you know.  Lovely ideas and great things to put into use 
 The title sends the message of my review.  Every Windows Vista User should purchase this book at the same time Windows Vista is purchased, or, immediately after the purchase of Windows Vista.  The book covers everything that most users want to know and should know about Windows Vista. Significantly this book is written for easy reader understanding and for plesant reading.  Read it a learn things technical you should know without plowing through unnecessary technical language.  If you really want to get technical, then, after you read this book to become a competent and comfortable Windows Vista user, purchase Windows Vista Inside Out by Ed Bott, Carl Siechert, and Craig Stinson.  Windows Vista Inside Out is great book if you really wish to get technical and look at Windows Vista in-depth.    
 Excellent play.  Enjoyed reading it and rehearsing with a friend before auditioning.  Didn't make the cut, but it was well worth the experience.  Ray Bair 
 if you have a medium sized sedan....like a vw passat....expect to move the seat in front of the installed car seat way up.....i like the car seat....but it's extremely big for my car...you need to have an suv with a lot of back seat space or maybe even a mini van.....otherwise it's very cute 
 An absolutely amazing novel about a rich, Southern woman, who--after the loss of three children--becomes more a mother of the South when her home Carnton, which is on the edge of one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War (The Battle of Franklin), is turned into a hospital. Carrie McGavock finds the strength to care for the wounded men, and later to transplant all the dead men into her own cemetery, where she mourns for them during the tremulous reconstruction years. Carrie McGavock builds a relationship with Zachariah Cashwell, one of the soldiers who has lost his leg. Both of the characters are extraordinary in the fact that they both have such a strong and odd (in that the quality of their lives is questionable) desire to survive and to live. The story, which is more than just about the South or the Civil War (in fact, sometimes I forgot that I was reading a Civil War novel), is about survival during the most horrible moments of life. It isn't so much about the war and why it was fought, but about the people who were forced to fight it, and lost. The most amazing part of this novel is the brilliant style, which is absolutely modernist and psychologically driven (perfect for the end of the Civil War as style and system broke down), capturing the characters and making them real, poetic, beautiful, and fascinating. Carrie and Zachariah are a beautiful romance, but more beautiful people, because they are so odd, yet so driven, broken, yet surviving. One of the best novels I've ever read. Grade: A+ 
 Paula has changed my Yankee family's outlook on Southern cooking and they have finally come around to seeing it the way of this old KY boy.  Her comfort food is so tasty and her recipes are so simple even the man in the house might enjoy them 
 i love this book. it was very motivating and the quotes were helpful. i'd recommend this book to anyone and everyon 
 I have often heard it said that Studs Lonnigan is not art, that it is too true to life and that true art is not this realistic.  According to the deprecators of the book, true art shows the artist's interpretation of life.  How utterly and totally wrong that this book did not display the writer's deep understanding of human nature.  Studs Lonnigan is reality.  There is no doubt about that, but the author is not merely just mindlessly repeating conversations and actions which he himself has heard and seen.  He is also displaying his deep understanding of the motivations of all this vast assortment of characters.  The moral emptiness of these people disturbed him tremendously and thus their dialogue, attitudes, and mannerisms were etched into his memory.  These are middle-class people, attending church regularly, attending church-sponsored schools and yet none of these things raise an ounce of moral awareness in their souls.  Studs and his friends laughingly kick the feet out from under an inebriated elderly man and laugh as his skull cracks and bleeds on the sidewalk.  Farrell didn't just see  the words and actions of these people, like a court reporter reading her minutes.  He said here are the words and actions of these people and this is what it means.     Farrell not only shows the moral vacuousness but suggests a solution - Communism.   A system of government which supposedly imposes upon its citizen, a constant recognition that the welfare of all citizens must be a consideration to each citizen.   Although this idea has a lot of merit, I think that for reasons far too complex to elaborate upon here, that we have already seen that it produces governments more morally depraved than the capitalism upon which America is based.  Despite my disagreement with Farrell regarding the solution to the lack of moral awareness of these people, I still feel that Studs Lonnigan is an extraordinarily powerful study of human nature 
 Yvonne Vera is an extraordinary author. Stone Virgins is beautifully structured and every word is essential as Vera weaves this exquisite Zimbabwean story from every angle. I agree with Ama Ata Aidoo in the editorial reviews: this book deeerves to be recognized as one of the most notable novels of the twenty first century 
 This soundtrack has wonderful sound quality and includes all of the compositions I remember from the movie. The instrumentals are gorgeous. A must-have for any fan of the movie 
  I highly reccomend this guide book for anyone who is into rocks, stones, minerals and gems. There are in-depth explanations, includes varieties,synonyms, and alternate names along with popular and alternate names, foreign and vernacular. There are descriptions of the distinguishing characteristics of rocks and minerals along with the traditional scientific explanations. Locations of the stones and minerals of course and the basics,coming from a great variety of dimensions. If there is a tear in the fabric of this book...it is merely that they have left out the healing properties which I expected, as science has yet to catch up with the mysterious, doesn't it? Even a history of the first place the stone was mined or found may br found in this text. A few books you may want next to your field guides are these...if you  are into crystal healing, earths polarities, etc. The Crystal Bible by Judy Hall, Crystal Medicine by Marguerite Elsbeth, and Love is in the Earth - A kaleidoscope of Crystals by Melody. Two (of the greatest) other guides I have on my shelves are another small easy traveller Gemstones of the World by Walter Schumann, and (large, coffee-table book, sized) Smithstonian Rock and Gem (the Definative guide to rocks minerals gems and fossils)my favorite. One warning on the paperback guide of this reviews Peterson field Guide...if they have a hardback, get that because a couple of pages came out on my first examination of the guide...not well bound. So that if I had been looking at it out-doors on a windy day atop some volcano...I may have lost those pages, if you get my drift. Still definatly worth having, for a great reference, and  very informative, & giving one a gift of knowledge, some which you may not find elsewhere.  Hope I have been helpful to you 
 Beginners rush order this book. I just received my 5th books on this subject and found this book by far the best of all of them. Franzesca writes for the beginner and for those who have years in the field. I  especially like the way she explains mixing oils. For example other books  use per cents and ml but Franzesca goes further and gives drop amounts.  This is very helpful for the novice. This is a book you will continually  refer back to. Thank Franzesca 
 This first book of Jane Austen's doesn't have the same subtlety as her later works, but it is light-hearted and good writing.  It's amazing how skillful she was at writing dialogue, even at a younger age.  I mention her youth because it pervades Northanger Abbey; the character are youthful in spirit, and I think that of all her novels, this one might be the most accessible to the modern day younger reader.  It was certainly one of my favorites as a teenager (though the pleasure of rereading it hasn't diminished as I've aged).  The simple and natural emotions of the main character, Catherine Morland, would seem more real to many of today's teenagers than the repressed spirits seen in so many novels of this period.  Catherine is perhaps the least 'civilised' of Austen's leads, in that she does little to conform her behavior to the decorous standard of the day, but she has an exuberance and sweetness that breathe life into every scene, and I think this carries the book.  Northanger Abbey is a delightful read for all ages and Austen fans, even the most serious 
 The central achievement of Süskind's novella is the way it articulates the social anxiety of a man whose childhood fear of abandonment has played out as a lifetime of limited scope, controlling routines and self-imposed isolation.  That might sound heavy but it isn't - mainly because Süskind wisely chooses the "free indirect" narrative style (mastered by Henry James).  The story is told in the third person, but is nevertheless filtered through Jonathan Noel's gaze and consciousness so that external reality exists only as refracted in his mind.  The result is that we see the world as he sees it, but without the unreliability that such a point of view entails.  Süskind is thereby able to show us precisely what he wants us to see - both the horror and humour of Noel's experience - and to deliver a climax which remains somewhat objective and thereby inspires hope.  Other reviewers seem to have found the ending cloying and unrealistic, but I think they're assuming more than Süskind suggests.  Noel and his life are not utterly transformed at the end - he has an epiphany, he loses his fear, but it may or may not last 
 I read it as a teenager- and it moved me. I felt like there were so many others with similar experiences.  I felt more compassionate toward others. And learned how many experiences that are not so good- can be looked at as a good learning experience. I loved it so much I thought every teenager should own a copy 
 Adler and Doren believe that reading well is an art.  This book gives a step by step method to reading difficult books well.  I like this book because it has helped me to read 3 books that I found difficult to read (Homer's Illiad and Odyssey and Plato's Dialogues including The Republic). The authors provide a Great Book list in the Appendix.  
 I watched this movie because I am becoming a fan of the strikingly handsome Vicent Perez. I not only tremendously enjoyed Vicent Perez in this movie but I actually enjoyed the story it told.  Being an American with an hispanic background and a history buff, I often wondered what Spain's role was in the World Wars.  This little story not only let me see a little of what my ancestors stance might have been during this period, but by the way the Spanish people where portrayed in this movie I also caught an insight on their way of life and made me proud of the scence of pride, strength, and intelligence they seemed to have possesed and passed on to future generations.  The chemistry between Vicent Perez and Polly Walker had a little to be desired though.  I am sure this could have been improved if the charactors had been able to explore each other a little more instead of trying to cram their story into 1 dance and one afternoon.  All in all the story was meaningful, enjoyable and encompusses the whole families views and emotions during these trying times 
 If you have an affinity for sea stories, this is the book for you! Magnificent in content, broad in its scope and selection of authors, it is also a great introduction to some classic and almost forgotten writers. Where else can you read selections from Homer, Jules Verne, Herman Melville, Victor Hugo, James Fenimore Cooper, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Rudyard Kipling? A book originally published in 1940, this new release is a welcome sight to us sea-lovers 
 My oldest daughter got the older version of this product for her 5th birthday.  She could only play a couple of the games at the time, but she loved it.  For three years now it has been her all-time favorite car toy.  It has been dropped, banged, kicked, stepped on, fought over, and everything else two kids could do to it in 3 years, and still works great!  Drawbacks:  Pixter & Leapster caught on that kids might actually want to play their toys past 5pm in the car & put LCD lighting in, but this company hasn't caught on yet.  Also, no headphones jack--some of the games make incredibly annoying noises!  One more thing--the ages are not appropriately labeled.  Closer to first grade and up 
 This is the 2nd Sandra Browne book that I read - the first one being Chill Factor.  Both were very well written, and this book, Riccohet, keeps you in suspense throughout - going up and down hills and making U-turns all of the time.  If I had to nitpick anything, it was just a tad long in the middle, but picked right up again and took you on yet another journey.  I am very much looking forward to Ms. Brown's next book.  She is an excellent writer and one of my favorites as I enjoy her writing.  Keep up the good writing . . .  Mary San Clemente, C 
 This show originally aired on The Discovery Channel. In it, William Shatner hosts an hour-long program about how the technology and ideas presented in classic Star Trek have affected both real-world technology and our ideas about what is possible in the future. Footage of the erstwhile Captain Kirk goofing on his own image (that guy has very possibly the BEST sense of humor about himself of any celebrity) is intercut with interviews and documentary-style footage (narrated by Shatner, of course) of real scientists and engineers (many of whom, you will be unsurprised to learn, were inspired as youngsters by the original Star Trek series). The result is an informative, funny and often inspiring view of what it REALLY means to live "in the future."  It's good to be reminded that the lives we live now used to be someone else's future, and the future we look forward to is a place where people are going to live.  Highly recommended 
 Proper Records has drawn together an impressive array of tracks from most of Parker's studio recordings from 1944 to 1951, when Bird was working for the Savoy, Dial and Verve labels.

 Ann Marie Sabath has a way of getting directly to the point, making this book an excellent reference for anyone wondering about the rules of  etiquette in the workplace.  Her book deals with the issues that most  executives need to know. At a time when informality and familiarity seem to  rule, Sabath's book clarifies what is appropriate for the reader's success  both personally and professionally. If anyone wants to know how to  "climb the slippery ladder of success", as Sabath says, just let  them read this book 
 You could spend lots of money on all kinds of folklore & mythology books, and still not have as much information on the "darker entities" as this book.  Each entry is very detailed with description, habitations, sightings, etc.  I think this book would make a great gift for anyone interested in the supernatural, or even RPG GM's looking for new ways to torture their players... ; 
 Me against my brother provides the reader with not only an understanding of the conflicts in Somalia, Sudan, and Rwanda, but it is also a personal tale of the author's experiences in Africa.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in Africa or international relations. The descriptions are often depressing and heartwrenching, but it instills in the reader that the developed world must do more to help ease the suffering in Africa 
 I am just happy that this film is on DVD.  Rent the film and watch it and see if you'd get a copy of your own.  Recommended for art film lovers.

 This book is well-illustrated and easy to read, but it is really a basic text, not the end-all.  For example, in the section on nutrition, the authors recommend that carbohydrates should constitute 50% of an athlete's daily calories, and yet they neglect the fact that so many people in this  country do not tolerate carbohydrates well.  Nutrition really needs to be  adjusted to the individual's metabolism and needs, and there is really no  one set magic formula that will work for everyone.  But, if you keep that  in mind and are looking for a good introductory text, this will serve  admirably 
 I took the GRE last week after studying for months. I'm really happy to report I got 700's on both the verbal and quantitative sections! I initially bought just the Princeton Review book, but found it was lacking in practice questions. This book had plenty of questions, and had very thorough vocabulary and math sections.   Whereas the Barron's really focuses on mastering the mechanics, Princeton Review focuses mainly on test-taking skills. I think the difference in approach is what makes some people like one over the other; I preferred really working on improving my math skills and vocabulary, and not just improving my test-taking skills, so I liked this book better. However, I did get some good tips from PR, so I would recommend supplementing the Barron's book with another study guide.  I also got the Kaplan 500-word flip-book, which I highly recommend. I studied words from the Barron's extensive vocabulary list, but the Kaplan book is excellent if you only have a week or two before taking the exam.   As for the CD-ROM and practice tests, I found that only the scores I got from the ETS practice exams (from their free PowerPrep software) were anywhere close to my actual exam grades.  The computer-based and paper tests I took in the Barron's and in the Princeton Review resulted in scores much lower than my actual scores. Don't freak out if you're getting only 500's in these practice exams, and you've been studying like crazy 
 This is an outstanding work, highlighting the very likely risk of future global food shortages and food price inflation. During most of our western-world memory there was on oversupply of basic food and governments were concerned about too much grain and prices dropping too low. Lester Brown makes a very convincing case that the opposite is likely to happen in the future. His opinions are very well documented and based on plenty of statistics.  
 I've owned this album for years and it still is a frequent visitor to my CD player.  Everything about is top-notch, and a must have for either a blues aficianado or persons interested in SRV's roots and musical  background 
 As an art student, I am fascinated by the way artists put media to paper, in the most basic way, and draw. In this book, 'Jim Dine: Drawings from the Glyptotech' we are shown the true art of drawing. By taking a pretty straightforward model, e.g. a statue, Dine renders something quite unique. How can one artist lay open the heart and soul of something so static as a statue? But, surprisingly, he does this with economy of line and media. The drawings show strength and depth and you are left with a knowledge of real people and their lives, in a two-dimensional sense. The text is concise and you immediately understand the points Dine is making in relation to his drawings. The reproductions of his drawings are exceptional. This book should be in every art students' (and artists, for that matter) bookcase as an essential reference point from where to start drawing. I have learnt so much from Jim Dine in this book that I just want to spend years exploring the art of putting down good lines on paper 
 It's a good movie, you have action, romance and a twist of science fiction. All of these are just winner ingredients, in this particular case the picture has a favorable outcome and it serves it's primary purpose: entertain. Don't look forward to the probable appearance of a Big price, a BIG nomination, or somthing like that...expect FUN, and a GREAT time, thats all.       And YES my friends; dont act surprised if you dont get a classic movie like Gone With The Wind, after all you know what kind of movie you are going to see...after all it's a great picture, a Van Damme movie! 
 I had to own the superbit for one of my all time favorite movies.  This movie has a great plot, an amazing cast, and wild graphics.  You won't be disappointed.  Stephen John Beccia Author of THE TREELANDER 
 Ms. Kreuz's book is truly the textbook for all things feral cat-related. The book even contains some extremely useful information for anyone considering starting their own cat rescue organization or for the average person just wondering what they can do to help that scrawny stray without getting an arm clawed off in the process. Well-written, clear, and concise- I can't recommend this book enough to anyone interested in feline welfare 
 This is a wonderful tool for making your supermarket a positive place to shop, find healthy choices and to learn new ways to negotiate those tempting food areas. I love the helpful hints for incorporating more healthy choices into your day...adding more fiber, natural sugars in fruits, even some healthy makeovers for those old favorites like smoothies and burritos. My favorites! It's hard to give up some of the fattening foods when you start a new diet, but in this book you will find alternatives to giving up those comfort foods and you'll see some wonderful replacements with delicious flavors and textures you didn't dream of before.  You should definately try it! She has found the secret to shopping for food and staying fit forever

 I started watching ER while on vacation a few years ago. I'd come in from the beach, crash on the couch and get invovled. When I found they had come out on DVD I bought the three series that are available. Although I have not yet completed series 3, it's proving to be just as enjoyable as the previous two. What we need are the rest of the series to be released on DVD too. I see series 4 is available in the UK but not here. What gives with Warner Bros.? If you enjoyed the earlier series, get series 3 too and place your order with Amazon for series 4. Hopefully, if enough of us do that then Amazon can get WB to go burn some discs 
 There are tourists and there are travelers. Both visit other lands, but tourists make no attempt to learn about the people and culture, preferring to view everything from their own perspective. Travelers try to learn as much as possible about the places they visit and appreciate the cultural differences. In "Sunday Islands: New Zealand, Tahiti, Australia," Harold Truman shows that he is a traveler as he offers his impressions of the South Pacific gleaned during visits to the region from 1994 to 2000. Truman is not the stereotypical "ugly American" on his journeys. He never loses the awareness that he is a guest in other people's homeland and is careful to show respect for their customs - even if those customs are totally foreign to Americans. He also shows his sense of humor in recounting his own misadventures, such as his first attempt to use an outrigger canoe and learns it's not as simple as it appears. Even when playing the tourist, Truman remains the traveler. Most tourists going out on a fishing excursion would concentrate on landing a big one, but Truman gets to know the boat's captain, learning more about the country and its people in a few hours of conversation than anyone could learn from reading thousands of travel brochures. Throughout his journeys, Truman demonstrates a keen sense of observation of people and places. Thanks to his narrative, which flows like poetry, and his descriptions of people and places, we are more than readers of his travel journal, we are his friends accompanying him on his journey 
 I hate to be the only one not giving this a 5 (but four means it's great). [NOTE: My rating was accidentally registered as a five] Others have already highlighted how great this is. In many respects, it is superior to Kittel's Theological Dictionary of the New Testament (10 volumes). I've owned my set since 1980, when it was three volumes (the current fourth volume is an index). I can't give it five stars because 1) organizing by English words is very difficult and annoying for those of us who can look it up in Greek word order, like all the other Greek resources (20 minutes learning the Greek alphabet is all it would take for someone who doesn't read Greek). 2) Like so many other works geared to both those who read Greek and those who don't, it uses transliteration in the articles. I think that's the ONLY thing I like better about Kittel's - no transliteration! 3) This is not cost-effective compared to the absolutely outstanding and inexpensive "abridged" version of this set (see more below).  I've used DNTT for years. I always come away from reading articles quite edified. It's a tremendous resource. It's so good I overlook it's organizational faults.   However, consider the following:  Zondervan quietly put out an abridged version of this. Nothing important is missing! See my review of the New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology - Abridged Edition here on Amazon for more details. That is only $23, while this four volume set is $93. That uses the odd English based organizing system, the abridged is easier to use and all words are listed in Greek word order. They crammed the information into one volume by shrinking the type (still plenty big), moving to a double column format, and making the book taller and deeper than the original size. Read more about it at my review.   If you are considering this set, you may want to consider the abridged instead. When I've used the abridged, I never feel cheated because they kept all the relevant stuff! I have all the major theological dictionaries of the NT (TDNT, DNTT, Exegetical Dictionary of the NT, and Spicq's TNLT) and I use them routinely. I'm telling you that the Abridged version of this is not a kiddie version. It's the real thing. It's the best kept secret in scholarly resources for the NT! Don't feel like you're slighting yourself by getting the abridged, you're not. Now the abridged Kittel's, by contrast, is a different story.  That was a serious abridgement and a serious compromise of the original. I sold that on eBay. I retain and use the original.  A great supplement to this set (or the abridged version) is Spicq's Theological Lexicon of the New Testament. See my review of that. It is far more theologically refreshing and insightful than either this set or TDNT (EDNT is the most bland, but it has its strengths).  May God bless you in your pursuit of a greater understanding of Holy Scripture 
 Cell-Level Healing reminds us of the sacredness of our bodies and our lives.  It creates a beautiful and comforting bridge between the spiritual and physical dimensions.  Dr. Joyce Hawkes's words open our hearts and our minds.....assisting us in accessing the healing energy available to all... 
 If you like this type of comedy where jokes are as visual as they are vocal (play on words, taking things litterally, and so on), then this is for you. There aren't many movies like this nowadays... I recommend you watch it before sleeping... that's a much better way to end your day (and start your night) than watching news about tragedies, war and so on... Enjoy! 
 I'm reading bad review after bad review which refer to the censored and cut DVD VERSION of this movie.  This is incorrect and needs to be fixed by Amazon. The specific box UPC code which "leads" to this product page and Amazon ASIN number is for the NOT RATED video (VHS) version of this movie.  As we all know, "not rated" is the Hollywood euphamism for "we knew we couldn't get it past the film censor without it being cut to shreds, so we didn't even try".  BTW, both the box and the cassette case state that this VHS version is the FULL 90 minute (i.e.: uncut) version.  We are a seller. As part of our listing process we review all used movies for quality issues. And I gotta say: this is a pretty hot movie.  5 Stars for hotness, and to counter all the inappropriate 1's.... 
 My hair has gone from unruly frizzy to smooth and silky.  I always use good products from the salon, but this is the best I have used 
 Postmodernism is an incredibly fuzzy concept. Eagleton is able to sharpen it and make it crystal clear. His criticism, from a theoretically deep Marxist prospective, shows what is true and progressive in Postmodernism and what is nonsense and off-the-wall. It is outstanding and brilliant. Read it or be square. Assign it to your students or wish you had 
 I am not a viewer of late night television, so I had never heard of Craig Ferguson before picking up this book. After reading it, I certainly hope that he continues to write books, and especially ones in which his talent for the absurd comes to the fore. This book chronicles the intersecting lives of several well-drawn characters, and they are unusual and funny and sad and heroic all at the same time. The writing is crisp and the plot moves along. The coincidences reminds me of the many that occur in Thomas Hardy's works, although he was a completely different sort of writer. I enjoy books that challenge me to appreciate the effort the author puts into making the unusual appear to be the norm, and this book has that in spades 
 As a pastor I decided to use this short but powerful book as an entry point for discussing the spiritual life with our church book group during the season of Lent. Everyone enjoyed Nouwen's easily understood writing. He puts things simply and clearly. This allows people the freedom to enter such an important spiritual affirmation/guideline: We are beloved children of God 
 I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the books in this series and hope there will be more.  They are interestingly written, contain non-offensive language, and are excellent studies of human personalities 
 Steve Perry's "Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire" explores events between the two films "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi" just as Timothy Zahn's new book "Allegiance" bridges the gap between "A New Hope" and "The Empire Strikes Back".  Zahn established himself as the best writer of Star Wars fiction with his Thrawn trilogy following on from "Return of the Jedi": "Heir to the Empire", "Dark Force Rising" and "The Last Command". In "Shadows of the Empire" Perry comes close to Zahn's class in serving a similar function.  One of Zahn's strengths has been the creation of new characters who have taken their place in the Star Wars universe, like Mara Jade and Grand Admiral Zahn. In "Shadows of the Empire" Perry provides fascinating background into Prince Xizor, leader of the Black Sun criminal network, and his human-like killer droid Guri, characters also featured in A.C. Crispin's "Han Solo trilogy" tracing Han's life before the fateful day he met an old man and a kid in a Mos Eisley cantina: "Paradise Trap", "The Hutt Gambit" and "Rebel Dawn", which seem to have been published in 1997, after "Shadows of the Empire".  "Shadows of the Empire" features all the main characters of the final two Star Wars films, with the exception of Han Solo, who is still in carbonite. The action concerns the Rebels' efforts to free Han, and along the way we learn things like how Leia came by her bounty hunter suit and a thermal detonator, and how Luke made his first light saber.  In the NPR radio series of "Return of the Jedi", which goes into greater detail than the film, filling in many gaps, when Han is rescued he criticises Lando for letting C3PO fly the Millennium Falcon. That flight is in "Shadows of the Empire" 
 I thought the book was good, but i didn't like the ending. It just leaves you hanging. The rest of the book was exciting and adventureous. I hope there is a second book, because I want to read it. 
 so small it fits in the palm of your hand, light enough to clip on to paperback books but strong enough to clip to my laptop. lots of light which really impressed me because I bought a more expensive bulky one two weeks earlier but returned it because it hardly lit up the pages. only reason not giving it 5 stars is because i'm not sure how long before it needs a battery change and because neck might be too short for some peoples' needs 
 This was the textbook for an introductory course in business law I took. It does a great job at laying the groundwork of the US legal system and explodes many common myths. A large amount of material is covered clearly and consisely. The chapters on contracts and constitutional law alone are worth the price of the book. The authors do a good job hitting the high points and not getting bogged down in details that are inappropriate for an introductory course.  There are a few typographical errors that carried over to the thirteenth edition and ought to have been caught. Because this is a survey course, the reader may find supplemental material such as a law dictionary necessary to understand some of the finer points.  
 Alan Alda must feel blessed to have been such an integral part of two of the greatest shows in television history.  The creative forces behind the West Wing gathered their collective strengths and gave the series the ending it deserved.  Decades from now I'll be pulling out these discs and watching them.  With horror and sadness we learned last December that John Spencer had suddenly passed.  West Wing fans grieved and sent their prayers on behalf of Mr. Spencer and those who had actually known and loved him.  We can see that some of that love and respect gets translated to the show and the episodes that swirl around Leo's death are among the most heart-breaking I've ever seen on screen.  When Kristin Chenoweth as Annabeth tells Bradley Whitford as Josh that Leo has died her tears didn't look at all like "acting". The same can be said for the expressions on the faces of all of the actors at Leo's funeral, ending with Martin Sheen as President Bartlet.  The storyline of this season centers on the Presidential race with Jimmy Smits portraying Congressman Matt Santos against Alda's Senator Arnold Vinick.  This ticket was clearly the fantasy of the liberal writers as even the Republican candidate is pro-choice, insults some NRA-type vigilantes and all but thumbs his nose at the religious right.  As Vinick's campaign is derailed somewhat in the aftermath of a nuclear accident in California a particularly shrewish right-winger is brought in to help the Senator woo back the republican base.  Ron Silver continues in his role as Bruno Gianelli, the political strategist who only cares about winning - and knows how to do it.  Patricia Richardson is effective as Vinick's assistant who tries to keep him on track.  Janeane Garofalo serves as sparring partner to Josh as Lou, a democratic operative who gets almost as much pleasure from seeing Josh flounder (which he inevitably does for brief moments) as from helping her political causes.  Teri Polo plays Helen - candidate Santos' wife - and this character always seems a little less enthusiastic than would be appropriate for the wife of a man who may become president.  Aside from the sensitive and respectful way the real-life death of John Spencer was worked into the fictional story, this season gets a few other things right.  Where we may have been frustrated in the past at the lack of love lives of most of these characters for years - all in the service of their country - this season we get to see most of the principal characters hook up in one way or another.  First daughter Ellie gets married in a White House ceremony curiously missing both of her sisters. (Although all three daughters make Leo's funeral.) Through their own obvious attraction and Donna's persistence Josh and Donna finally get together.  In the opening of the first episode we're glad to see in flashback that C.J. and Danny Concannon have married and have a child, and in other episodes we get to see Danny's gentle courting techniques on one of the most powerful (and powerfully nice) women in the world.  It's also gratifying to see some "old friends" show up in the final episodes such as Rob Lowe's return as Sam Seaborn.  (Sam is recruited to duty by Josh in a scene that pays homage to the earlier flashback scene from season two when Josh conscripts Sam to the first "Bartlet for America" campaign.)  To the shows writers, directors, actors, and the professionals who shot, set and costumed the show: Bravo! I'll miss you dearly and watch these shows with enduring pleasure.   To the pinheads who decided to release these DVDs without any significant extras: A pox on your houses.  While the first seasons came with full sets of subtitles, documentaries and commentary tracks in which performers, directors and creators couldn't withhold their obvious glee - this season comes with next to nothing.  The first seasons came with subtitles in English, Francais and Espanol.  The last two seasons have not had an option for English subtitles.  What if the viewer is hard of hearing?   What is the reason for these deficiencies? Laziness? Complacency? No doubt the almighty dollar played the major role.  This show - and this show's fans - deserved better.  Rest in well-deserved and honored peace, John Spencer. Adieu, West Wing. 
 Fox's severe comments on the biblicism perpetuated by the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and some protestant denominations trenchently remind us that pious ignorance can be invidious. Reading the biblical text as religious testimony rather than history has been taught by scholars for most of the past century! Yet the perpetually purblind have influenced too much of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict over whose land this is!  The dangerous politics of archaeological hegemony is clear in this investigation into the assassination of Dr. Albert Glock in January of 1992. Who did it? The book's insight is monumental 
 For my mother's fifty-fifth birthday, I gave her a copy of this book. Even I, at sixteen, was completely changed by Seneca's powerful and timeless ideals in this book- these are essays for all ages, all eras, all people. Although Seneca wrote in the beginning of the "common era," his description of a world where people search fruitlessly for happiness through materialism and waiting for the future rings truer than ever in our postmodern age. His ideas for remedying our distress, through accepting each minute of life as it comes and concentrating completely on our present task, are no less than transforming 
 Light, hilarious and genuine: I read this on the plane from London to Chicago, and enjoyed it so much I started it again immediately on the bus ride home from O'Hare.  It never occurred to me that the American edition would be different. What are we, infants? If there's some slang we don't quite get, there's always peevish.co.uk and a host of internet slang dictionaries at our disposal.   If you want the real thing, get the English version. Can't miss it. It's bright orange with a big purple 'e' on it 
 My house floorplan is extremely spunky. That also means that setting up my WiFi network was going to be extremely difficult.  Up until the point that I bought this antenna, I spent a total of $400 trying to get all my signal strength bars up to max, but rather, ended up getting mediocre connectivity, with occasional connection drops.  After installing the antenna, I get perfect signal, without the use of any repeaters in between. Hawkings is truly the best IMHO, especially when the quality of home/office networking gear is going to sh**. I just hope that the frequencies don't cause any long term health effects : 
 I have always had a copy of National Geographic available to me. As a kid I glanced at my Dad's copy (just for the pictures- I had a subscription to Ranger Rick that was more my style until I was 8). As an adult I read it cover to cover every month and its the first magazine I look for on the newsstands. Simple the best magazine that is published 
   A big Neil Young fan in the 60s and 70s, I hadn't followed his music in many years (or any other popular music, for that matter). One of my 8th grade students, knowing how I feel about the war in Iraq, gave me Neil's LIVING WITH WAR. I loved it, so I checked out reviews of PRAIRIE WIND, and I bought it. As far as I'm concerned, it's a masterwork. The songs are incredibly moving, especially for someone who is Neil's age. I love this man for having made it. 
 Italian director Franco Zeffirelli did an outstanding job of bringing Shakespeare's romantic tale to life.  It is THE definitive version of Romeo & Juliet, in my opinion.  The fact that the actors were so close to the age of the star crossed lovers adds realism and freshness to the story.    Shakespeare's words flow so naturally that you forget that it is a classic play and just get lost in the story.  The cinematography is beautifully done and the wonderful customes are a treat for the eyes!    You will enjoy this movie ... again, and again ... I highly recommend it 
 AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON is a clever series of comedy skits, designed to resemble channel-surfing on late-night cable access television.  As the title suggests the main feature is a B-movie schlocker called 'Amazon Women on the Moon' (supposedly presented "complete and uncut with no commercial interruptions") but constantly halted for technical glitches, commercials and community service announcements (the actual film being parodied is a combination of two different sci-fi classics of the 50's, "Cat Women of the Moon" and "Queen of Outer Space").  Most of the sketches are fantastic and the stars include Lou Jacobi, Erica Yohn,  Michelle Pfeiffer, Steve Guttenberg, Rosanna Arquette, Griffin Dunne and Steve Forrest.  Highlights: Ed Begley Jr. as the "Son of the Invisible Man" and Carrie Fisher in a hilarious parody of a 1930s sex education film 
 Art Caplan provides a practical, easily grasped  guide to today's controversial  high tech medical issues at a time when scientific discovery is outpacing existing policy and yesterday's paradigms. His provocative and amusing essays range from cloning to engineering ourselves. His essay on brain enhancement brings it home when he frames the morality in the context of sending his son, Zach, to private school concluding that people want to optimize their brains.      Caplan is a visionary leader in the field of bioethics. This new academic discipline is as critical to biotechnology as is groundbreaking scientific research. If Americans are going to benefit from scientific breakthroughs of the new millennium such as the mapping of the human genome, gene therapy and stem cell research, we must have excellent communications between the scientific community and society.  Smart Mice, Not So Smart People provides that critical communications bridge. Caplan has a unique ability to communicate to the academic community, the biotech industry, the decision-makers in Washington, the media, and the general public. Without the understanding and participation of each cluster of this mosaic, we will not be able to transform scientific advances to medical treatments in a timely manner. Nor will the necessary funding for cutting edge research be forthcoming if the societal issues are not integrated into the equation 
 I DID NOT EXPECT THAT CASIO PRODUCES SUCH GOOD QUALITY WATCHES. THIS WATCH IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN IT SEEMS IN THE PHOTO. IT IS SHINNY AND VERY HEAVY. THATS A VERY GOOD MANUFATURING PRODUCT. BEAUTIFUL AS IT COMBINES ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL READINGS. AND I AM SURE THAT THIS WATCH WILL LAST FOR A LIFE AS ALL MY OTHER CASIO WATCHES WHICH I BOUGHT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND STILL ARE WORKING. NOT TO MENTION THE PRICE FOR SUCH A FANTASTIC WATCH. JUST 50 DOLLARS? IN GREECE WE SAY "DON'T EVEN SAY IT TO THE PRIEST 
 The book is received in extremely good conditions.  It has very good and interesting topics. Perfect for anyone who is searching for material with great tools to use at work 
 This is the second "Next Exit" I've purchased. Bought 1 for some friends too. (They were always borrowing ours!) Anyone who travels a lot on the interstates will find this book a wonderful asset. Even in your in a car, it's nice to know what motels/food places/stores/bathrooms are ahead. It sure beats getting off randomly, and not finding what you're needing! I'll be a customer for life 
 At some point while I'm reading a work of historical fiction, I'll ask myself "Is this story believable?"  Well, not only is Black Cross believable, it's hard to imagine that it didn't occur.  Iles has written a story that seamlessly merges historical fact with dramatic narrative.  Yet, a believable story isn't the book's only positive feature.  Iles also masterfully paces the story, resulting in a tale that is difficult to stop reading until the conclusion.  Additionally, Iles has created realistic characters that act in ways which are credible.  All these elements combine to make a book that is near perfect.  In fact, if one took out the superfluous love affair and the epilogue that wraps things up a bit too neatly, this book is perfect.  Historical fiction fans owe it to themselves to add Black Cross to their libraries 
 This book is primarily a book on the art of selling, which you probably already guessed from the title.  It is also much more than that.    If you are in sales, going into sales, or might ever go into sales, you should read this book.    If you think you are not in sales, think again.  Almost every aspect of dealing with other people, is sales.  Want your kids to clean their room?  Sell them on why they should.  Want a raise at work?  You have to sell your boss on why you are worth it.  Want some lovin from your wife?  Once again, you gotta sell her on the idea.  Obviously some things are much easier to sell than others.  I started looking into the field of selling after reading many psychology/trading/improvement books.  Many times I read examples that related a particular topic to the field of selling.  It made sense to me.  Then I started thinking about how almost every interaction with others that I had throughout the day was related to "selling".  I started using many of the techniques I read about and they worked in most situations even though I was not trying to get someone to buy a product from me.  Its still sales!  This book has a lot to offer even if you are not in the sales field.  After reading it I realized I may need to switch careers and start selling.  I am sure I would be good at it 
 Being that Slim Aarons recently passed away, his work warrants an even closer work. What this book and the equally impressive Once Upon a Time have in common is that they portray true grace, elegance and class that makes todays celebrities look like a bunch of bums. 
 This is a geat book to improve your flexibility.  Master Kim is a TKD master but the book would be great for any martial artist.  I needed to improve my flexibility but too many of the book were too technical without a direct understanding of why and how.  Kim does a good job of showing and explaining how things neeed to be done.  I am not quite to the ground with my splits but am quickly getting there 
 I've always enjoyed the Buddha Bar Series and this album is no exception, but while reading some of the customer recommendations posted on this site I discovered a group by the name of Mehdi (pronounced meddie). After an online search I found their site (SoothingMusic,Com) and listened to the samples...  I was instantly blown away by the quality of this music and so I gave it a try and now that I have listened to these CDs several times I really must say that although I'm still a Buddha Bar fan I find Mehdi to be a great addition to this CD. I have them both in my multi-disc CD player and love the way they compliment each other. I highly recommend that you give this artist a try or atleast just go listen to the samples, I have a feeling you'll be glad you did.  
 If you've ordered this book and read it, then you've taken the first step to freeing your mind from all the garbage the media suffocates us with. And if you swallow these eye-opening books  like I do then I earnestly recommed anything by Noam Chomsky, as well as these two books, which will no doubt enlighten you about the Bush administration and the war in Iraq: (1) War Plan Iraq: Ten Reasons Against War with Iraq (Milan Rai); and (2) STUPID WHITE MEN (Michale Moore). And if you love a good laugh, here's a satire on Bush and the media: The little samba boy (Jay Singh). The truth is out there 
 Ilove the Law & Order series on TV and the SVU the 3rd Season is the best buy. To pop in and watch the entire 3rd season on a rainy or snowy day was the best. I recommend it highly and would give it top rately. LL from R 
 I read this book and found it very interesting.  The book is from a women's perspective in all aspects.  Kellie even addresses annoying things such as men giving unsolicited advice.  That is such an annoyance for me, so was glad to see it addressed 
 Writers wishing to engage with the Holocaust can be faced with a vast array of initially overwhelming difficulties. The gravitas with which the subject area must be approached and the struggle to "express the inexpressible" through the written word alone, is enough to deter many from ever embracing the subject. One of the most difficult tasks for an historian is perhaps presenting factual information and a coherent line of argument, whilst retaining a degree of reverence and sensitivity to Holocaust survivors and the families of the six million victims. Conversely, an excess of sentimentality and emotion, could lead to the loss of any objective method of study in its entirety. The challenges posed by this area of historical study, as one can see, are great and yet Marrus in his text The Holocaust in History, succeeds in producing an excellent overview of the events and current polemics surrounding the period, which maintains a high level of objectivity throughout, without ever drifting towards callousness.  Michael R. Marrus, is a Canadian historian, born 1941, who specialises in, and has dedicated much of his time to researching; Jewish history, the Holocaust and anti-Semitism in France.1 The Holocaust in History, published in 1987, is his best-selling text to date and according to the cover quotation, provides "the best review of this tragic period"2.In many ways however, Marrus' work is far more than a "review" of the period, but a work of detailed scholarship and synthesis which examines many aspects of the Holocaust in considerable detail. Most notable, perhaps, is the assessment of the Final Solution or Endlösung, which lucidly presents the key arguments of both the Intentionalist and Functionalist schools. With animated prose, so often lacking from historical and especially historiographical texts, Marrus engages the reader in the various debates between the two groups, leading to an accomplished four-way discourse, between writer, reader, Functionalist and Intentionalist.  The Holocuast in History is, however, primarily an historiographical not an historical work. Although it provides sufficient background information on the events of, and build-up to, the Holocaust, its foremost aim is to establish the various scholarly polemics, which have emerged through what Marrus describes as "serious historical investigation" and engage the reader in these pertinent debates.3 Such topics examined, are the emergence of anti-Semitism both within the Nazi party and on a European scale, bystanders and collaborationist governments, the Jewish resistance, public opinion and state of knowledge, and finally, the victims of the Holocaust. Despite its relative accessibility as an historiographical text, some knowledge of the methods of genocide employed by the Nazis and knowledge of the rise of the Nazi party in the nineteen twenties make the book far more accessible to the "lay-reader".  This is one area where Marrus' text excels, as the book seldom drifts from its central lines of argument. It is often the tendency of erudite historians to loose track of important polemic threads, feeling that they must lengthily discuss specific terminology and in doing so; loose the coherence of their arguments and often, in turn, the readers attention. Neither does the text concern itself with defining the term Holocaust, Marrus acknowledges that this is "a serious body"4 of literature in itself but rightly does not feel the necessity to discuss it within the confines of his text.  One of the key uses of The Holocaust in History as an historiographical text is to use the arguments revealed within it and apply these to the wealth of Holocaust related material now available, noting whether or not Marrus' arguments are supported. The text also clarifies many of the Holocaust "myths" which have presented themselves, dispelling rumours for example that there was inherent anti-Semitism in Germany at the turn of the century, on the contrary in fact, Marrus informs us that " one might easily settle upon France" for the most dangerous country of inhabitancy for a Jew. 5 The sheer volume of Holocaust related literature available and the varying states of knowledge on the events of the Holocaust in the past, both in terms of scale and accuracy can lead to many studies, being ill informed, especially those undertaken by inexperienced students, who do not always question the credibility of their source material. Therefore Marrus' text is extremely useful for students writing on the Holocaust, as it allows a greater awareness of the key questions and debates, which are applied to the period.  When we are informed by scientists that there are more grains of sand on a beach than stars in the sky, we "lock up" mentally, unable to comprehend what we have heard. The same could also be applied to the Holocaust. Statistics report that there were six million Jewish victims between 1933 and 1945. To us, this becomes another meaningless number, something our psyche is unable to contemplate, let alone understand. Perhaps exactly the same could be said of our treatment of the Holocaust as a whole, because it is so morally, ethically and proportionally incomprehensible, we refuse to admit that it exists and that it can be studied in the same way that other periods in history are. Until we translate the universal to the particular, it eludes us, not just academically, but chronologically as well, occupying a position removed from time rather than its place in the middle of century we have only recently left. There are many arguments in favour of the academic study of the period, in the hope that once it is universally recognised and accepted, it could prevent such a tragedy from ever occurring again. Marrus is a clear advocate of scholarly study and demystification of the Holocaust. He insists that it must "receive universal recognition" and become part of our "general consciousness".6 His authoritative text brings us closer to understanding why the Holocaust is an area of such dynamic and emotive debate, and why the years between 1933 and 1945 must never be forgotten.   1.

 This is a great little taste of what these women were like. It is easy to read and contains just enough info. I checked it out for myself while at the library with my kids. I loved it 
 This is my first Bocelli CD and I love it.  His voice is amazing and so romantic.  The live performance of "Can't Help Falling in Love with You" in English, just didn't seem to fit.  Wish it would have been a studio cut in Italian.  Over all a beautiful CD and a must have for any music lover.

 We love these socks for numerous reasons... 1. they're adorable 2. they make great gifts 3. they stay on much longer than any other sock we've ever found 4. they hold up in the wash (no fading .. yet - and it's been 3 months) and everyone loves to comment on how cute our baby looks with the "shoes". I highly recommend this for anyone having a baby or going to a baby shower 
 Dr. Dre not only ushered in the G-funk era, he put the westcoast on his back and on the hip hop map. Coming out of a sour deal with Ruthless Records Dre decides to go solo and puts out the best album of his rap career. Standout Tracks: F*** WITH DRE DAY(Snoop and Dre diss the pants off Luke, Eazy E and Tim Dawg), LET ME RIDE, THE DAY THE N***AZ TOOK OVER, NUTHING BUT A G THANG, DEEEZ NUUUTS, LIL GHETTO BOY, A N***A WITTA GUN, LYRICAL GANGBANG(Kurupt and The Lady of Rage rip this track in half), STRANDED ON DEATHROW(more classic material) and B***HES AINT S***. Filler: None. Bottom Line: The Chronic is a gangsta rap classic that can never be duplicated unless Dre is doing the duplicating. 2001 was a great album but it couldnt touch this one at all. The lyrics(on this album) were superb and memorable, the production was top notch and the skits were pretty comical(especially the 20 Dollar Sack Pyramid LOL). Nothing but cd collection material here. Good times, good times 
 I have always loved mysteries, and THE ONE FROM THE OTHER, simply put, was a sensational and stirring read. In this novel, Philip Kerr has rendered a seamless blending of fact and fiction, history and the wide-open realm of possibility, all packed up neatly in the form of a compelling page-turner. With his signature grace and panache, Kerr brings the post-World War II era, with all of the complexities of post-Nazi German life and conscience, into sharp relief; he also brings back Bernie Gunther, a crass and dirty detective, who somehow manages to maintain his own version of integrity--nobility, even--in the midst of the worst kind of ignobility. With precise attention to detail and flawless prose, with electrifying twists and turns, Kerr delivers a fast-paced and truly thrilling read 
 I got this book when I was ten and I think I read this book two or three times a year.  It's a gorgeous story with amazing characters and writing.  I love the 'Ted and Wanda' storyline and 'Dr. Pepper.'  Old Pepper is a great character.  There isnt a single word of this book that I dont adore.  I recommend it to both kids and adults.  Everyone can get something out of this book.  Out of all the books I've ever read in my entire life (and boy are there a lot of them) it definitely makes the top 10 list 
 Los Angeles Rams quarterback Joe Pendleton (Warren Beatty) is about to meet his demise in an accident. A heavenly escort (Buck Henry) plucks him from his body just be for he is dispatched. At the way station he refused to board for his finals destination, complaining the mistake was made.  Sure enough Mr. Jordan (James Mason) finds out that the over zealous escort did not wait for the outcome which would not be fatal.   Now they must find him a new body because his old one had been cremated. Not finding an ideal match. He settles for a temporary, Leo Farnsworth; he is ambivalent at first until he meets a girl Betty Logan (Julie Christie) he wants to help. He also want's to get this body in shape for the Superbowl. The fun begins when he has to learn to be Farnsworth, his wife (Dyan Cannon,) and male secretary (Charles Grodin) "lovers" what to kill him.  Will they kill him? Or will he make the Superbowl? And what becomes of Betty?  This is based, and I must say much improved on a movie called "Here comes Mr. Jordon" from a play by Harry Segall. Jack Warden plays Joe's friend Max Corkle that ties all the Joe incarnations together. 
 Who doesnt love the Wind in the Willows? great book for children, I love it even now as a college student. I brought it with me and keep it on my bookshelf in my dorm room. The sweet little mole, the wise old badger, and of course, the silly and carefree toad-what charming characters! everyone must read this book at some point over the course of their lifetime, and will most likely chose to read it again soon after. 
 "The ultimate origin of processed chocolate, though, seems to lie with the Olmec of the lowland forests of southern Mexico, some three millennia in the past, as shall be seen in Chapter Two." pg. 13  When reading another book called: "Food: A Culinary History," we find information on Chocolate telling of how chocolate was "discovered." They basically explain how the Spanish discover chocolate when they colonized the New World and explain how the Aztecs had used chocolate in their rituals.   Which rituals? (You will be shocked) Who actually first discovered the Theobroma cacao plant/tree or learned how to use the beans (they look a lot like giant almonds in the picture) in the pods (look like an elongated squash) growing directly from the tree trunk? (It wasn't the Aztecs) Do ungerminated beans have the same flavor as germinated beans?   The story of chocolate is extremely detailed. This book traces the discovery of chocolate from it's earliest pre-Columbian roots to modern times. The way we serve chocolate today almost seems primitive when you read how many ways the Aztecs made their chocolate drinks.   Honeyed Chocolate Flowered Chocolate Green Vanilla Flavored Chocolate Bright Red Chocolate  It is amazing how this book came together as it has, because Sophie D. Coe was diagnosed with cancer before the book was completed. Her husband, Michael D. Coe, took on the responsibility of literally thousands of pages of notes and finished a book she started.   The authors spent hundreds of hours tracing down all possible references to chocolate in Libraries in America and Europe. They also searched in 400-year-old books in the Biblioteca Angelica in Rome.   The story of Chocolate is amazing. Just the way it is made is a process that was kept secret for many years.   From Research I've done in the past:  Seed pods, growing on the trunk and main branches are harvested and opened with sharp blades to reveal creamy white cacao beans which darken, then ferment under banana leaves for up to nine days as they lay in the sun. After a 250* to 350* hour-long roasting process, the beans are dehulled leaving small pieces called nibs.   Cocoa powder results from ground roasted beans which have the cocoa butter removed. After the cocoa butter is extracted, dry cakes of cocoa are ground and sifted to make fine cocoa powder. Most cocoa powder is naturally 97.75% caffeine-free. A 1/2 tablespoon cocoa powder contains about .0002 ounces of caffeine. There is 10 times as much caffeine in a 6-ounce cup of coffee.   The Dutch chemist Coenraad Van Houten added alkali to neutralize the acidity of chocolate and mellow the flavor. This is how the darker Dutch-process cocoa was created. Black cocoa is slightly more bitter and is the darkest cocoa powder available. It is best combined with a Dutch-process cocoa powder. When manufacturers make chocolate bars, the roasted beans are crushed with sugar and vanilla to make chocolate liquor.   The chocolate liquor is refined to evaporate excess moisture and acidity, then it is ground so fine that the mouth no longer perceives the beans as individual particles. After heating and cooling, chocolate is poured into molds, cooled and wrapped to be sold as bittersweet, semisweet or unsweetened chocolate bars, depending on sugar content or lack of it.  This book takes you on a "chocolate" journey. This is a book about the history of chocolate and does contain some rather interesting "chocolate drink formulas."   I guess one of my only objections might include places where the authors called a ritual "spectacular" instead of "detailed/extravagant." It made it seem that they were defending the Aztec's brutal way of life although I'm sure they were not. They just tried to look at the reality of the situation and probably found the rituals rather out of the ordinary. The reason for the rituals seems based on "fear that the world would end."   There also did seem to be some rather morbid uses for chocolate in the past. There is also a passage that says something about a "baseless" claim for chocolate having aphrodisiac properties. We do know that it contains substances, which do produce an "in love" feeling.   What really had my attention was the topic of Crillo beans vs. "Forastero" beans. The Crillo tree produces the best quality beans, while the Forastero produces a more bitter bean. Valrhona Manjari is made exclusively with rare Indian Ocean Crillo beans. This gives the chocolate a winey, bittersweet flavor and incredible aroma.   If you have yet to taste this or use it in cooking, look for it online or by looking for the N.Y. Cake and Baking Distributor catalog or Formaggio Kitchen catalog.   Many chefs swear by this chocolate and I can tell you it is the best I've found besides a chocolate I love called "Peter's Chocolate from Nestle." Nestle chocolate is my ultimate favorite. Especially the milk chocolate. The use of cocoa butter in place of all those other palm oils is rather refreshing. Being one can be highly allergic to palm oils and cottonseed oils and the like.   The difference between the bars is that you can eat Peter's Chocolate straight off the bars, but the Valrhona Manjari bars are a bit bitter on their own. When you mix in a little cream and sugar, it becomes magic.    Valrhona chocolate is of course considered to be one of the finest chocolates in the world. I myself won't use anything but Valrhona Manjari in my Chocolate Ice Cream and Mocha Freeze. I also discovered Valrhona Caraque for use in Truffles. The authors also include the meaning for "Manjari" which is "Sanskrit for "bouquet."   If you are hungry for information about chocolate, this is the best book I've read so far. It is intensely detailed and does seem to have been written because of a love for chocolate!   Have a few cups while you read. Just don't forget the whipped cream and nutmeg!   ~TheRebeccaReview.com 
 The book covers the subject well and is carefully written.  It stands  alone in that there are no other books for the prospective owner of a  single dairy cow rather than a herd.  Some of the information is dated;  recent improvements in genetics have more than doubled milk production and  changed the needs for feed.  There is a little philosophizing with a '70s  back-to-the-lander slant which I found distracting 
 As a first-time mom, my husband bought me this book for my birthday! I absolutely love it!! The illustrations are beautiful and the variety of poems, stories & recipes are great. I'm glad the lyrics & hand motions to a lot of children's songs are included since I forgot most of them. It brought back memories of the songs I used to sing as a kid.  I highly recommend this book 
 This is a beautiful album that can be played again and again.  It's relaxing and mellow, but never tame, and never boring.  It sounds like being lost in the Deep South, or like finding a whiskey still and its gun-toting owner: it's peaceful and natural, but mysterious and sad and just a little threatening.   "Bird Stealing Bread" is a gorgeous and muffled song about an old memory and a lost love, "Upward Over The Mountain" is a sinister lullaby with such disturbing imagery as "the night that the dog had her pups in the pantry" and killing "the last snake that lived in the creek bed"; it's the song that sold me on Iron and Wine.  "Southern Anthem" and "Muddy Hymnal" are dark little stories that seem to advertise a simpler life while also sending out a warning, a threat.    The album's lo-fi/four-track feel makes all of the songs feel real and gritty and soft, like a haze or a cloud or a fuzz that you could fall into and be completely enveloped by, and it keeps the songs from ever becoming plain old folk songs.  It reminds of Paul Simon if Paul Simon had indie-rock sensibilities and grew up in Weogufka, Alabama, or of Roy Montgomery if Roy Montgomery listened to folk, drank 40-oz. bottles of Cobra, and went to revivals. This a great album, worth any of the hype it's gotten, worth buying, and worth keeping forever 
 When this three got together it was a night to remember.  Each guitarist has his own style; Paco is pure gypsy passion and speed, Di Meola is creative strnght and improvisation and Maclughlin has that impeccable playing.  The three put together is probably the best guitar live show ever, theres something here for everybody. It carries you effortlessly from flamenco to jazz to blues to the Pink Panther theme song without you even noticing it. I can listen to this album time and time again.  
 I really like this cookbook for several reasons:  the vast variety of cultures/tastes; the variety of spices, foods utilized in the recipes; the variety of dishes (soups, salads, main dishes, one-pot suppers, sandwiches, even dumplings and pizza dough!); and the ease with which many of the dishes can be prepared.  Easy does not necessarily mean boring, as evidenced by the asparagus with curry butter sauce.  I make this dish for almost every family get-together dinner and it always gets raves.  I hate to admit how easy it is to make!  I would never have thought of mixing asparagus with curry.  I really appreciate the foods from various cultures, including Middle Eastern, Southwestern and Mexican.  And good old-fashioned American tastes as well.  Sample menus in the back of the book are very helpful and are also organized by type of meal(for example, the "I-Just-Lost-My-Job Supper -- Dinner on a Tight Budget").I haven't tried many of the desserts, although they also look good.  But I haven't tried one dish I haven't liked yet.  Not necessarily for vegans, since many of the dishes include cheese and milk, etc.  But it's a great intro to vegetarian cooking.  Nicely arranged, easy to read, fun to use 
 I have to say I expected more from this book. I wasn't so much interested in the screenplay as in the background, technical and otherwise. A whole section, not just a capsule, on the wire work would have been nice for example. On the plus side, now that I know the screenplay by heart, I can go see the movie again without reading the subtitles, and with the full impact of the images. Furthermore, the book does boast some really nice color pictures (more, a lot more, of the stunning Zhang Zizi would have been appreciated). Not without faults, but if you love the movie, it is definitively a must-have, along with the CD 
 Joan Didion's essays are sharply observed and very personal.  She informs us of her fragile mental state in the very first essay, in which she describes a pervasive sense of detachment that she felt from the world.  She then goes on to deliver a collection of well-written profiles on personalities, places, and the concerns of the time (late 60s-early 70s).  Didion inserts herself and her personal issues into these pieces on ocassion, which no doubt contributes to the accusation by some that she is a whiner.  On the contrary, I feel that it was courageous for Didion to reveal herself this way and that the awareness of the narrator as a fragile, flawed individual rather than an omnipotent, god-like commentator pronouncing judgement on its subjects gives a unity and a perspective to these disparate pieces that they would not have possessed otherwise 
 When they say fast shipping they mean it! I have bought a lot off amazon and other sites and I have never actually received and item from the west coast so fast. The apron I bought is excellent quality and I would recommend this seller to anyone looking for a high quality item at a great price. Will do business with again. Thank you!! 
 I found this book to be helpful with the basics in anyone's prayer life.  From the beginner to the most advanced this book thru prayer will strengthen your relationship with God.  I also think this book is very well written, the author uses great analogies from life and applies them to biblical stories.  This book is for you if you are looking to deepen your prayer life 
 I just saw Mr. Turrentine in concert last night. What a pleasure and, what  Style! He is truely a classic. The mood was mellow with a twist of  rumbunctious fun. I wish I didn't have to work today. I would have love to  have gone to Breakfast! You are one of the greats, Mr. Turrentine 
 This book is every bit as entertaining as the run-of-the-mill speculative/paranormal UFO-from-Atlantis books with which it is unfortunately cross-listed on Amazon,  but the author's scholarly rigor makes it much more satisfying.  Sullivan supports his fascinatingly unconventional conclusions with evidence, sound reasoning, and a bit of self-critical skepticism.   But the real charm of this book is the fact that he pursued such a crazy theory in the first place.  Behind the scholarship is a "guy-with-a-crazy-dream" human-interest story (e.g. Fitzcarraldo, Field of Dreams).  This would make perfect film material for Werner Herzog.  To hear the author tell it, he spent several years in the academic wilderness (as well as the Andean wilderness), chasing after the (wholly-unsupported) hypothesis that Incan myth encodes both astronomy and Andean history.  To his advisers, this must have sounded a lot like writing a grant to study the pyramids of Mars.  For a lesser intellect, this would have been a career-killer and the reader gets the sense that Sullivan knew it.  One of the best parts of the book recounts Sullivan's meeting with Owen Gingerich and "the Vatican Astronomer" at the Harvard planetarium.  He's clearly terrified that these eminent astronomers will think he's a kook.  But when they conclude: "he's done his homework," Sullivan breathes a sigh of relief.  A word of warning: get the hardback.  I got the paperback edition and the binding was defective and the first 50 pages fell out the first time I read them.  
 A reprint of the 1958 edition, this was like finding an old friend.  I first read this in 1958 or 1959, when I was about 10 years old.  I remembered snippets of it ever since and wondered if I would ever come across it again.  The story is just as fresh as it was then.  Indeed, I looked for some disclaimer that it had been updated, but found none.  Other than the lack of scientific explanation underlying key aspects of the plot, thus dating its style somewhat, this was a remarkably prescient piece.  And far from sophomoric in the bad sense, it appeals to the kid still inside me. I enjoyed it as much now as I did when I was 10.  It has time travel, Russians, aliens, prehistoric tribes, space ships, personal struggle and triumph...what more can you want in a science fiction yarn?  From over 40 years ago, it still rates 5 stars 
 Rodney Stark uses a sociological perspective to reconsider the development of Christianity from the early first century until it became the dominant faith and official religion of the Roman Empire in the fourth century. Stark, who is currently a university professor of social sciences at Baylor University, begins with the basic premise that the development of Christianity is not purely a social and political factor, but rather the product of human faith that stands up to all social phenomena: from interaction with pagan values and persecution, to the various social crises such as epidemic and political disorder. Stark writes, "Whatever one does or doesn't believe about the divine, obviously God didn't cause the world to be Christian." That the world has become Christian and will continue to be Christian depends on human effort that is based on the reflection and commitment of that Christian faith and community.  Stark states that the early Christian community gained it converts through a social network built by intimate interpersonal attachment. Interpersonal relations within the early Christian community built a strong social network that allowed the steady growth of conversion during the first centuries. In this context, it becomes important for Stark to reconsider what was the social basis of the early Christian community. Many historians and sociologists in the twentieth century claim that Christianity and all religious movements are driven by the lower social strata in a community. For Stark, this assumption is no longer accurate because of the fact that the early Christians consisted of the privileged and the middle class in the community. Christianity was pardoned by the political authority because it included members among the family, friends and relatives of the early believers. Had the early Christians consisted of merely the poor and the oppressed, the Roman authority would consider it as "a political threat, rather than simply as an illicit religion."  By explaining the fact that early Christians consisted of the privileged, Stark doesn't mean alienating the poorer class within the early community. Rather, he relativizes the assumption that most new cult and sect movements, as Christianity was, are driven by those who were poor. In addition, Stark is convinced that, whether power is held by rich or poor, all members of a religion have the same desire toward "the rewards that do not exist in this world." Moreover, it is the vision toward the other world that sustained the life of the early Christians, so that they became a solid social community.

Meanwhile you are also learning of the revolutionary war and the affect it had upon the south as most of the traditional stories are placed in New England or the middle colonies. I guarantee you will love it 
 In her first book, Eudora Welty surpassed the mannered and overreaching efforts of more celebrated Southern authors.  She examined the inner lives of varied characters -- male and female, black and white, funny and brutal  -- and submitted them all to her quiet and curious personality.  The effect  is both timeless and strange 
 This book is a great book, because it uses Montessori's own words to explain the basic concepts of Montessori, and it covers all of the basics.  However I wouldn't recomend it to parents who first want to find out about Montessori, because the language is very complex and you get tired of so many ideas in so little space.  First time readers of Montessori are better of with her other book, "Montessori Today".  This is an excellent book for people who will have patience and read it little by little to be able to "Swallow" and get every idea 
 "Wild Strawberries" is a film by Ingmar Bergman, made soon after "The Seventh Seal." I'm still not completely familar with Bergman's work, the only other Bergman film I've seen is The Seventh Seal. Wild Strawberries is a film that will thrill some and bore others. The movie is approaching 50 years old and it hasn't aged much; I think many people who are coming to the end of their life feel the same way, the main character in the film, Isak Borg. Isak Borg is an aging doctor, who's going traveling to accept an honorary degree. In the beginning of the movie, he has a nightmare which makes him face his inevitable death. When he leaves, his son's wife Marianne (Ingrid Thulin) comes with him. En route, he stops by his old home and has a flashback about a woman he was in love with. She ended up marrying his brother. Along the way, he picks up a group of young kids who are intrigued by the doctor and he continues having flashbacks and dreams throughout the film. The movie's not big on plot, but it's not lacking in it either. My synopsis is short because there's plenty to say, but too many spoilers in saying it. Isak is played by Victor Sjostrom, then a veteran Swedish director, who reportedly struggled to remember his lines onset. Something you'd rarely hear pointed out about this film is that writer/director Bergman was not very old when he made this film. Yet, the script is written in a tone that suggests the man had lived just as many years as Isak has. He captures the essence and the fear of the character perfectly. As I said earlier, not everyone will enjoy this film. But I'm pretty sure people who already been exposed to Bergman and have enjoyed it shall.   GRADE: B+ 
 A great product especially for the discounted price 
 KURUPT AGAINST THA GRAIN  Finally KURUPT has dropped this album, after years of delays and drama "AGAINST THA GRAIN" finally hit the streets. I must admit I was surprised it was actually on the shelves even after the date was never pushed back. But I must say the delays were worth the wait, the album is off the hook. Granted some of the songs have been out for awhile threw mixtapes, and the internet. One in particular was all ready released on an official album for the same label. In fact two others can be found on two other official releases. But all that aside this is a very strong album from Young Gotti, and even with the above mentioned it is great to hear a full album from the Kingpin.   1.INTRO  2.SPEAK ON IT-the first song on the album comes out bumpin' hard, courtesy of a bangin beat by MARK SPARKS. What a great way to start an album, plus VAL C on the track, and a guy just telling him to speak on it. And Kurupt definitely does that speaking on different situations in the world like the DPG break up, racism, the east/west war, and certain individuals getting paid off of this type of music. Also this song as got a lot of attention due to the supposed dissing that goes on at the beginning of the song. Other then the 50 CENT part the others could have been mentioned dissing everybody that says that DMX, JA, and NAS are the new Pac's & Biggie's, not necessarily the individuals mentioned. Of course I could be completely wrong, so over all this is a great track, and even though it only has one verse I'll have to give it 4.8/5.  3.ANARCHY '87-Mark Sparks returns to drop another hot beat that switches up on ya during the hook, and the verse. The hook is more up tempo while the verse is more smooth and gliding with its bass and claps. Kurupt rips the track up easily with his lethal flow, and even throws in a little DAZ diss. I also love the fact that he brought back the hook from "BEHIND THE WALLS" for a lil portion of the song. Over all this is an excellent track.4.5/5  4.THROW BACK MUZIC '86-this has to be one of the best tracks to come out THA ROW in awhile, definitely a classic. Non surprisingly Mark Sparks returns to drop this straight west coast track for our listing pleasure. Kurupt giving it up to a time period he came up in, mentions a gang of things some will definitely remember. The guy that reviewed this album at rapreviews.com said this track and the previous track were Kurupt and tha row trying to be a part of a period of time they weren't in. He must not realize that Kurupt is giving it up to that era, that dude is straight hating on this track. This is definitely a must have right here, no wonder it's a single.5/5  5.DEEP DISHES-ah yes a favorite of mine, even though some people don't really like this track. I love the way Kurupt rips this track, the way he flows to it fits the track perfectly. And the beat by RICK RUDE is amazing, very creative on his part, it kind of reminds me of that video Method Man & Red Man did where they were in those chains; I think it was called "THE ROCWILDER" or something. Also homie from rapreviews.com dissed Kurupt saying he rhymed dishes with dishes, and went on to praise KANYE WEST'S albums even though every song he does he rhymes the same words all the time. Any way this is a personal fav of mine, u have yours I'll have mine.5/5  6.STALKIN'-another single from the album, in fact this is the one I hear on the radio all the time. SIR JINX created a very interesting and intriguing beat for this track, and the samples used add to the beat greatly making this psycho girl more believable. Of course u all know Kurupt holds it down on this track, this track happens to be my girls favorite song on the album, should I be worried.3.8/5, her score 5/5  7.CAN U FEEL IT-ok I guess every album has to have that summer time, radio friendly track. DOUG MAYHEM is the producer of choice on this track, and he was very successful in making a bouncy summa tyme track. to be honest I even bump this track from time to time. This is probably the closest thing to mainstream on this album, not that it's bad, in fact it is catchy to a point, and that includes the simple hook from POTION. This is another fav of my girls. This is this album's "IT'S OVER", & "SUNSHINE".3.5/5 her score 5/5  8.SLIDE N SLIDE OUT-the ever reliable BLAQTHOVEN drops this nice beat, and this tack features Y.A. representatives EASTWOOD, BIG TRI, & YOUNG TONE. Surprisingly the star of the album Kurupt only drops a lil something at the end adding up to nothing more then a cameo, not even a verse from Young Gotti. Of course this technique has worked well for albums like "THE CHRONIC", & "DOGGYSTYLE" were there were 1 to a few tracks were the star wasn't on the track, just giving their boys shine. Over all though for the most part this is a nice addition to the album, all though to be honest I really don't listen to this track much, also Daz gets dissed.3.8/5  9.I'M BACK-to be honest this track fits the album nicely, but surprisingly here it is not labeled as a remix. As we all know this track was indeed on the "DYSFUNKTIOANL FAMILY" soundtrack, but there it was labeled a remix. So logically one would assume or at least think that the original version would be on the solo album from the artist. Or the other way around would be more logical since it would have came out years before the remix, but for some reason the remix was released first, and then re-released on this album. Well I have reviewed this track before and like before I do like this track, and the eastern influenced beat by the ROW HITTERS is nice. But I still wish the other version was included on the album.3.5/5  10.JEALOUSY-this is by far an excellent addition to the album, a great choice for a single in my opinion. Mark Sparks returns to continue his winning streak on this album, the instrumental itself is enough to get anyone to bump this joint. Lyrically this is an interesting track, seeing that the ex roc-a-fella signed M.O.P. is in the house making u "Ante Up". Also Kurupt in his verse mentions the hatred towards him for returning to Deathrow, and his so called lose of flow on this track. but to this reviewer it's ROSCOE that steals the show with his fiery verse. This is definitely a great addition to the track.5/5   11.THA PAST-Dough Mayhem returns to drop the definition of what an instrumental should be. I could go on and on about how perfect the beat is for this song, but the lyrics are just as powerful. I love that a track was included that addresses Kurupt's {at the time} former boys in tha Pound. I also appreciate the fact that this isn't really a song hating on the others, plus DAVE HOLISTER is excellent on the hook.5/5  12.MY HOMEBOYS {BACK TO BACK}-finally I got my wish 2PAC on a Kurupt album, man it felt great to see this track on the track listing. And how appropriate that this come after the previous track. also it was great to see that Mark Sparks returns to create this masterpiece of an instrumental, I love the flutes. Kurupt was right it feels good to see a Pac verse on a track with some one he actually got down with. Also Eastwood held it down nicely on this track with a verse and an excellent hook. U know I was going to give this a 4.5 or something for a recycled verse {"ME & MY HOMIES" from NATE DOGG'S album} but since a lot of people are using verses from Pac on their albums {usually the one from "THUG LUV"} I' am going to give this the classic rating it deserves.5/5  13.BULLSH#T & NONSENSE-the second song that is strictly from Kurupt's boys, in fact Kurupt doesn't even get a cameo credit from me, he only says a few words. But the thing about this track is that it is a better track then the last Kurupt less album, the beat from JOSHUA ANDREWS is a really well put together track featuring great pianos. SPIDER {now with g-unit} and Eastwood come real correct with their verses, though I prefer Eastwood's flow better in this one. Over all this is an excellent track.4.5/5  14.CALICO-what more can I say other then this is a highly energetic track, the beat from THE SCREWFACE MUSIC GROUP is highly bouncy and to quote another track with Kurupt "off tha chain" {THE VERY BEST OF DEATHROW, that song also has PETEY PABLO}. Kurupt drops two hot verses; he even adjusts his flow to fit a southern type of flow. There's even a shout out to Snoop and the Doggpound in his verses. Also the DAYTON FAMILY hold it down hard on this track, especially during the hyped up hook, this track also appeared on their album. Over all this is a great song, also the Dayton Fam shout out RAS KASS.4.5/5  15.HUSTLIN'-another song that's been moving around the internet for a while now, actually it's been years. This track was known then as "FAMILY", and the audio wasn't as good. This version seems cleaned up to a greater extent, it has a much more clear sound. This track sees Kurupt rip it up with Big Tri & Young Tone on this smooth Sir Jinx track. Each verse from the artist is off the hook, this happens to be one of my favorite tracks on the album.5/5  16.IT'S A WRAP-mark sparks returns to drop one of his best instrumentals on the album, the way each instrument is put together sounds incredible. Kurupt holds it down nicely on this track easily, the only problem with this song is that it's to short. The song comes in at a short 2:58, becoming the shortest song on the album. I just wish the song would have had one more verse.4.8/5  17.YOU F#CKIN WITH THE BEST-when I first heard this song on the internet I could have sworn that an in house producer for DOMINATION & BANG EM  had producer this track. I had always loved that underground sound this song had, and I always felt it had an east coast feel to it. So to say the least I was surprised to learn that BABY C-STYLE had produced this banger, and to his credit the beat is hard. It has the perfect underground sound to it that fits Kurupt and Domination's styles nicely. And to be honest I love the hook for this track, "I came in this Muthaf#cka with a mask on, so lay ya a## on the floor, or get blast on".4/5  18.OUTRO 
 Descriptive, historical, truthful and hysterical all wrapped up into 1 book. The band members, friends, etc. all speak openly and very inventively captivating from a personal perspective. Total honesty is refreshing and the wit, completely charming and awe inspriring. This is a must read for anyone who loves Aersomith, rock n roll, or for those who are curious. It will keep your attention until the very end, leaving you with a sense of accomplish and pride towards some of todays icons. Well done to the band, significant others, managers, friends and writers who took the time for this magnificant work of literature.  
 I love this pattern.  So fresh and springy.  It brings a beautiful brightness to my table 
 Damien Bartoli is an insightful scholar.  The essays on Couse and Gardner add a lot to the discourse on nineteenth century painting.   
 Genius book, as others have noted. But the equally genius graphic design also deserves mention. If you look at the book carefully, you'll appreciate how the designers evolve the look of these "front pages," parodying newspaper design from the early part of the century through the USA-TODAYification process that took place in the '80s.   One example: The eagle featured in the title banner at the top of each page is suddenly dropped in the late "psychedelic" '60s and replaced with an onion with eagle wings. Suitably trippy, and anti-establishment.  Terrific.  
 please watch this movie  as one who recalls the night of the shooting of Bobby Kennedy and the death of all and any hope, this movie which opens with Sen. Bulworth viewing his wall of RFK, MLK and Minister X, this movie says it all, right up to the shattering but inevitable ending. IT carefully and clearly lays out the issues in many ways, visually and verbally. Listen carefully to Halle's character's analysis, no matter how quickly it is spoken, and see her hopelessness briefly relieved by Bulworth, as also the excellenty Cheadle's character. Try this as a double feature with Bob ROberts and be afraid very afraid at what we see now in DC 
 "Put a lot of sex in it; that's always nice," Lorenzo (protagonist of this film) is advised about his novel-in-progress. "Sex and Lucia," which contains stories within stories within stories, unpacks this claim, showing that sex is not always "nice," but that like narrative it can be liberating and transformative.  Tragedy and betrayal lie at this film's heart, but because its story bends and twists around as it follows Lorenzo's false starts and revelations as a writer (it has, as it explains, a hole at the center which the audience, like the characters, can fall through) it also offers a way out -- a way to distinguish voyeurism and pornography from love and art, a way to stay faithful to a vision of human trust and imagination.  Brilliantly accomplished, "Sex and Lucia" displays the loveliness and ample talent of its stars, especially the beautiful Paz Vega (as Lucia) and Tristan Ulloa (as Lorenzo). A tremdous film 
 HAHA....man this album is awesome i give it 4.5 because it has comical values.kool keith is definitely one of my fav emcees because hes just RAW, and for the fact that he has a song where he says I DONT BELIVE YOU after everything he says.this album has crazy producing,like in the song "extravagant traveler" it sounds like he had a ten year old lace the keyboard beats and just looped it HAHA. but all the songs have a head noddin catchiness to them that will have you listening more and more.. alot of the lyrics are kinda the same but its just the way he attacks with them that make the difference, like in the song "keith and bumpy" he raps in jamaican accent man its PRICELESS..i myself put this album up in the higher ranks of all my keith related cd's i think everyone who is a keith fan needs to give this one a chance... 
 The music here frequently reminded me of Pagan's Mind with a touch of Porcupine Tree and flashes of Iron Maiden.  A fantastic mixture of 1970s Progressive rock bands such as Yes and Kansas molded with European-style Power Metal and Brazilian folk music.  While this can be extremely interesting there are a few moments here and there that don't quite mesh.  In actuality I give the CD 4.5 stars for its superb songcraft and inspired, sometimes flawed ambition.  But as an overall package, this Special Edition of "Temple of Shadows" is an excellent place for newcomers as the bonus DVD holds a concert in 5.1 surround sound that is loaded with songs from their back catalog.  This is a great album filled with high quality Progressive Power Metal and a DVD concert that gives a taste of their other albums (not to mention it's just plain fun to watch as the band members are clearly enjoying themselves, smiling throughout the show).  Highly recommended. 
 This book is an attempt to provide an interpretive framework for much of the history that has been written about Early American History in the three decades prior to its publication (1990). I have read many of the historical works that Shalhope is attempting to synthesize. I wish I had known of this book when I first started to read seriously in American history. Simply stated this is a great place to start in the study of the 1770-1800 period. It is a little outdated but it is dealing with a lot of historical work that remains essential. The following is a partial list of the authors whose work Shalhope has tried to contextualize within his interpretive framework: Joyce Appleby, Bernard Bailyn, Joseph Ellis, David Fischer,  Jack P. Greene, Nathan O. Hatch, Rhys Isaac, Isaac Kramnick, Kenneth Lockridge,  Drew McCoy, Jackson Turner Main, Gary Nash, Caroline Robbins and Gordon Wood. In six very well written and compressed chapters ( the whole book is less than 170 pages!), Shalhope outlines the main ideological framework of the "old order", the emergence of "revolutionary republicanism" as effected not just by political thought but by current religious movements, developments in the arts and changes in the economic realm and finally the transition to the liberal democratic thought that Shalhope feels was characteristic of the early nineteenth century. Shalhope makes several points that are worth discussing. For someone like myself (an agnostic who leans toward atheism in my dogmatic moments) one of the more challenging aspects of American history is how often the impetus toward reform and/or revolt was deeply religious. The rise of Baptism in the 1760s and 1770s would prove to be profoundly democratic. "Baptists sought an orderly, moral community, a more secure center of social control centered in the people themselves rather than in a gentry-controlled social hierarchy." (p.36) The locus of authority shifted from the gentry to the saved individual within their fraternal community. This is one of the many ways in which the "old order" broke down and which would have implications for post-Revolutionary politics. Shalhope also writes very well about the shifting meanings of virtue during this period. This period saw Locke's thought shifted from natural equality to a "natural right to equal opportunity" by reformers like Richard Price (p.48). Virtue began to shift in meaning from an emphasis on civic virtues like the selfless love of country (exemplified by Washington) to economic virtues like frugality and personal economic autonomy. Shalhope explores these shifting meanings in his last chapter which focuses on the conflict in the 1790's between the Federalists and the Republicans. I would love to have a chance to actually converse with the author on several points. I have notice in many writings on this period a determination not to see the schisms of the time in anything approaching a class framework. The emphasis is always on political thought or ideology but not the emerging economic classes whose attempts to justify the breaking of restraints on their activity inspire so much of that thought. Shalhope (I feel) circumnavigates this issue by placing the conflicts within a hierarchy/localism context (derived from the work of Kenneth Lockridge).  The Federalists are the party of Heirarchy- they stood for more centralized economic and political control. The Republican becomes the party of Localism- they stood for diffused localized control that was more democratic in its nature. I find that a useful way to look at things but I also think that there was an emerging sense among the working and "middling" peoples of this country that their needs were not represented by either the Republican or Federalist elites. I just have a hard time seeing either Jefferson or Madison (as great as they were) as being the champions of the "mechanics". I would love to debate the issue with Shalhope. The learning that resulted would be one-side but, heck, I could use some good learning. But I digress. To sum up, in spite of being somewhat out of date, this is an enormously useful book for anyone reading about the political history of this period. Shalhope's interpretive framework is an important and original contribution to our understanding of the period. If you really want to understand the history of those times this is an essential book. 
 I was born in Brooklyn, and have always had a unique relationship with the Verrazano Bridge.  It started when I was a young boy and my father and mother would drive over the bridge en route to my aunt and uncle's home in Staten Island, with me in the back seat of the car ... looking down in fear at the deep dark water below.  That fear continued thru my early years, as at times I would feel the wind sway the car across the roadway as my eyes stayed focused on the marvel of construction that was the building of the Twin Toweres.  Yet the Verrazano opened up a new world to me . . . funny, I considered my travel to the fifth borough to be a trip to the rustic countryside!  How things have changed.  Gay Talese is one of New York's most prolfic writers, and I am a fan of Mr. Talese and applaude Mr. Davidison in their work in this insightful and enjoyable historical tale of the building of The Verrazano Bridge.  It was with great interest that I learned the details of the political issues involved with the building of the bridge, and how the bridge essentially created two of New York's most beloved neighborhoods: Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst.  I consider myself a lover of bridges, especially New York bridges.  Yet I always seemed to feel, thru my love affair with the Verrazano, that there was something missing -- a walkway similiar to the Golden Gate Bridge or the Brooklyn Bridge.  After reading 'The Bridge: The Building of the Verrazona-Narrows Bridge' I have a sense that this wonderful bridge that is the longest bridge in North America, and the sixth largest in the world is not a bridge for pedistrians and is in fact 'perfect'.  The insights and tales of the lives of the workers who built the bridge: a migrant work force made of courageous ironworkers: from native north american indians to newly arrived immigrants who traveled from one bridge project to another was extraordinary.  It is in the understanding of their lives that Talese and Davidison re-create a time capsule that brings you back over forty years ago to a time when the New York skyline and all that has come to be was in the creation period.  Wonderfully done 
 This album was great.  When I actually found it, I had to get it fast.  I used to listen to this album when my mother bought it for me endlessly (this was when I turned 8 or 9).  Now, my 3 boys love it.  While I forgot how some of the songs are rather graphic (I had memorized all the songs when I was little and was able to sing along once more after hearing them again) they are great for boys 
 The plot of this book is a minimalist coming-of-age story. The novel's great strength lies in the strength of the writing: Nordan can make a trip to the store sound Homeric. The individual episodes vary in quality, but at  Nordan's finest he writes as movingly as anyone alive 
 I bought this camera six months ago for my 12 year old daughter.  It was her (and ours) first digital camera.  I read so many reviews prior to selecting this model.  The reviews for this camera were so helpful.  This camera has been so easy to use and it takes excellent pictures.  Rechargeable batteries are definitely a must! This camera is the best camera for this price, no doubt about it.  We have taken still shots and videos.  It is so fun to have the option to take a video.  We have some great clips.  All I can say is we are so happy with the camera.  We would definitely choose it again 
 With business people today spending an average of 30% of their work time writing, this book offers simple techniques (along with practice situations) to make your message more clear and powerful.  This book was  helpful to me because most writing skills taught in business schools today  are not comparable to the writing demands faced by these same students in  the business world.  This book also helped me discard my academic view that  writing features lengthy paragraphs and big words and taught me to use  concise paragraphs to get the job done. Look at me now!  This review was  originally five pages 
 I was walking around the anime section of a nearby electronics store and this box set caught my eye. I looked it over a bit, and noticed the character design as well as the storyline was created by 'Ryo Mizuno'. Ryo Mizuno is also the creator of Record of Lodoss War and Legend of Crystania, which are both great animes 'especially Record of Lodoss War'.  I, of course, already started to have high expectations for Rune Soldier. It is awesome, it's pretty funny, and less serious than it's counterparts. The characters all have unique attitudes of their own, and while the story progression can be a little pointless, *find runes to find treasure* the ending is actually surprising, and makes this Anime an extremely wise purchase. I would recommend Rune Soldier to any Otaku 
 The description was detailed, delivery was excellent, and product was just what I wanted 
 This lens has so many uses.  Anytime I can position myself where my subject is more than five feet away, this is my lens of choice.  I have the kit 18-70mm that came with the D70 and a 50mm prime (I have the 18-200 VR is on order, and if Nikon can ever get around to catching up with demand, that lens might surpass this one, due to the smaller weight - plus it is a lot cheaper).  I took every lens I own with the D70 to the British Museum in London. Shooting handheld in available light (I never used the flash) with many of the Egyptian and Greek artifacts over fifty feet away, I got outstanding results with this lens. The VR technology is amazing.  Having a constant 2.8 aperture was also a major advantage.  I'll grant you my arm felt like a rubber hose after four hours of site seeing, but it was worth it!  I have had similar satisfaction using the lens outdoors for wildlife photography. I have even used the TC-20EII teleconverter with the lens, to shoot hummingbirds at great distance. I would have no reservations about recommending the lens, until Nikon announced the 18-200 VR. This new lens has a much broader focal length on the low end, and focuses much closer (around a foot, compared to five feet for 70-200).  The 18-200 does not provide a constant 2.8 aperture across it's focal length, so the 70-200 would be better at long distances in low light.  But at less than half the price, and I think less than half the size, this new lens clearly will have a premier spot in my bag.  Will it totally replace the 70-200VR?  I'll update my review when I finally get to try the lens on the block. Until then, the 70-200mm VR is the champ 
   Shell Silverstein, the author, has the most creative ideas in his head and they're probably still coming.  If you like to giggle, then read Falling Up!  It has creative words that made me laugh for each of those silly little words in the poem!  The exotic pictures are half of the reason why I laughed so much!  Sometimes, Shell Silverstein writes about impossible things of life as well. I also loved the book because he gives me great story ideas.  Really, take my advice, if you like writing stories, or just like to laugh, read Falling Up! If you read the first poem, and you like it, you have about 130 more poems to read!  Sometimes I just read a poem's title, if it's catchy, I read it 5 times!  The title might not be catchy but, the poem might!  One of the things that I like is the pictures.  I like the pictures because they're funny and they're on almost every page!  Some of the poems are weird. Some just sound weird, and then, some just are weird. Falling Up has lots of pictures, big ones, small ones, fat ones, and skinny ones.   I would really give this book a four star rating.  I recommend this book to kindergarteners and up because their parents can read it to them, and the parents will really enjoy reading it to them!  I say kindergarten and up because the poems are so funny where the kindergarteners will be able to understand the poems as well as not bore the adults!  If you want to enjoy reading more Shell Silverstein poems, just get an adult to go buy you the other three books called The Giving Tree, where the Sidewalk Ends, and A Like In The Attic!           
 Kirk's book is supposedly the bible of Conservatives. Not neo-conservatives, but Conservatives. He sets up the long standing debate between the French, and Voltaie, and the English, using Burke as it's spokesman Supposedly Kirk would limit the vote, have a professional class of government officials, reduce if not eliminate most taxes, and let each individual strive for success. This is the basic mantra of classical conservatives, and is all well and good as far as it goes, but only a few of the many ever succeed this way. One of the surprises is how young Kirk was when this book was written; it's as if he had some inspiration for on high (probably not), or was cherry picking history (probably closer to the truth).  After reading this book I had a better understanding of where the Conservatives are coming from, althohgh I still don't understand why an obscure Royalist politician from the 18th century should be their flag bearer. Royality as a form of government most likely will never occcur in the US, although we seem to flirt with it from time to time.   Conservatives seem not admit of a meritotocracy, as we currently have in the US: they would rather rely on accidents of birth, cronyism and college organizations to select administrators, rather than people who have succeeded in other venues. A very informative, albeit frightening, book. 
 This is a compilation of transcripts of Ronald Reagan's radio talk-show from the late 1970's. Reagan always loved to use stories to communicate ideas and give advice, and this collection is replete with perfect examples of that. I believe that the four components of leadership are:  1) A clear vision of a better future; 2) The ability to communicate that vision; 3) The ability to get others to want to listen to your ideas and to believe you; 4) The ability to translate your vision into action  Whatever you might think of Reagan's vision for America or of the actions he took, this book shows us how he excelled at communicating his vision and pulling people into it. He was not called "The Great Communicator" without reason, and this book shows you that reason clearly. This is a treasure for Reagan fans, for anyone who wants to understand this intricately simple man, and for anyone who wants ideas on how to be more charismatic 
 I love this book. Rachael is at it again with more of her delicious recipes. This book is so great I can never put it down. Everytime I go to the grocery store I think of another one of her recipes & I start buying more & more. My hubby just can't get enough either. Way to go Rachael once again. I definately recommend this cook boo 
 It is not overstating the case to say that creating these photographs cost Diane Arbus her life, her suicide followed soon after they were assembled.  When you study them, (and you study them, you don't look at them), you quickly understand why.  Arbus was a brittle and emotionally volatile woman long before taking these haunting images, the product of a privileged upbringing who cut her teeth in the world of fashion photography, making perfect-looking people look even more perfect.  Having refined her technical skills she ventured into the opposite side of that world, seeking out the people society hid and desperately tried to forget.  Arbus said famously that most of us live in fear of a traumatic disaster while her subjects had already endured theirs and were, in a sense, aristocrats as a consequence - free from the fear of being unwanted - secure in the knowledge that they most certainly were unwanted.  Arbus was so obsessed with presenting unadulterated reality that she never cropped her photos, indeed, the "live area" of the prints goes beyond the photo and includes some of the film's border - to prove the picture wasn't cropped.  She dove into the dark side like an obsessive child at a circus freak show, nothing was disturbing enough to satisfy her and even the commonplace became bizarre by the time she was done with it.  Arbus was passionate about photographing the mentally retarded, but giants, transsexuals, twins, triplets, skinheads, nudists and other bits of social flotsam and jetsam lured her as well.  Whether it was a boy holding hand grenades or a teenage couple looking like creepy miniaturized adults, Diane Arbus gravitated for the slice of humanity certain to engender revulsion.  Her genius lay in the ability to bring nothing to the proceedings, she approached her subjects on their own terms.  Because she did this, the subjects did not "rise" to meet the camera, they remained fixed in their personal nightmares.  This made for profound, well-crafted photographs.  Arbus didn't see beauty or pathos in her subjects, simply their reality.  She invited us to behold what we dread and honor the dignity of her subjects.  We are able to do that because we are more or less healthy, and because we can close the book when it becomes too painful; she could not.  Every Arbus photograph is a self-portrait; every lost, hideous freak was Diane Arbus looking in the mirror.  For the most part it seems that the people in her pictures survived her completely unsentimental scrutiny, she did not.  What's more unsettling is that the popularity of these pictures gave rise to a wave of young copycat photographers who thought it was "cool" to photograph the disadvantaged, disabled, and mentally ill.  The copycats never understood that for it to be art you have to care, you have to get involved.  Arbus got too involved.   
 The Road to Mecca is a crucible for Miss Helen, the seemingly strange, eccentric widower holed up on her bizarre property in rural New Bethesda, South Africa. She is clearly different, as evidenced by her many sculptures and odd creations surrounding her house, which unto itself holds a myriad of eccentric charms.  She comes to odds when Elsa, a young woman committed to Helen surprisingly appears at her door and discovers Helen on the verge of giving up on life. Elsa's staunch commitment to Helen's unique beauty conflicts with Dominee Marius', a local preacher who stands on the side of the patronizing, yet caring Christian community.  The play is dynamic in it's a)exposure of isolated aging, b)Elsa's youthful/urban attitude vs. Helen's elderly/rural one, c)soul crushing Christian convalescence vs. a spirited iconoclastic artistic home, d)characteristics of artistic inspiration, e)creativity's essential place in daily life, f) the long journey of self discovery, among others.  A powerful conclusion as well demonstrates Fugard's unbound compassion and empathy for spirited life under South Africa's skies. 
 I really enjoyed this DVD - it was a great way to begin, and now that I'm more advanced, I like to layer moves on top of the moves she does in the video.  The music is great, the instruction is great, and like others said: the camera work, voice over work, and the like are wonderfully the way they should be - in stark contrast to many other bellydance videos.  Amira takes the time to go over and explain movements, and also includes an effective warmup and cooldown.  I'd definitely vote this as a smart addition to any instructional collection 
 The true story of John Merrick, an outcast reinvited into society, is tragic, moving, and thought-provoking.  Merrick's relationships with a sympathitic doctor and a bold actress bring to life the deformed man's deepest thoughts and ambitions, leaving the reader caught in the world of a romantic artist.  The irony of Merrick's desire to be like everyone else is displayed clearly by supporting characters' hypocracy and cynicism.  I highly recommend The Elephant Man to anyone who enjoys dramatic theatre 
 Mother Teresa hung the author's "Paradoxical Commandments" in her orphanage in Calcutta, India to inspire and challenge those who read them to live a life of service. These are universal truths that apply to every aspect of life, including work and home. If we all chose to live life "ANYWAY" we could change the world 
 maverick is a gambler and this is truer to the story line and is very entertaining it's clean fun to watch and maverick gets a taste of his own medicine buy it enjoy it 
 Garth Ennis' sixth collected storyarc of the Punisher for Marvel's adult MAX line, Barracuda finds Frank Castle in over his head more than he thought he would be.  His investigation into a mega-conglamorate corporation with a devious plot leads to him meeting an assassin named Barracuda, who to put it lightly, makes the Russian look like Mickey Mouse.  Without giving too much away, let's just say that Frank goes to some great extremes to even the odds.  It's amazing that six storyarcs in that Ennis' take on Marvel's vigilante still seems fresh.  The graphic ultraviolence that Ennis orchestrates is nicely drawn by Goran Parlov, although his pencils aren't as great as previous artists like Dougie Brathwaite and Leandro Fernandez.  That aside, Barracuda is still another superb arc in Ennis' violent Punisher saga, and here's hoping the man still has some gas left in the tank 
 I bought this book based on a recommendation from a friend, and because I grew up reading Roald Dahl.  My 10-year old niece loved it so much she read it to her 6-year old brother the next day 
 Review Review =The book horseman it is about a kid, who is around 14 years old, that grew up in Texas. He ran in to some problems between some people and others he was really close to. I like this book because I find old western books interesting. I liked everything, and I did not dislike anything. It is a good book and you should read it. The book has some cool adventures. Good book.  
         Right from the first scene in the first episode, you know there is going to be a lot of lingering suffering in this series. But this is pre-Abu Graib, when the US government thought that torture (and extraordinary rendition) was a justifiable way of averting calamity. The producers of 24 take up this theme with a vengeance, and Jack Bauer dies at least once in this story, although you know that he gets resurrected, otherwise there couldn't be a series 3, 4 and 5, could there?  The story is better than the first series in the sense that it is one continuous plot. (Series One suffers from a big change of story, pace and production team after episode #14.) But in order to keep Kimberley Bauer in the story, she is subjected to a series of adventures almost wholly unrelated to the main nuclear-bomb story yet which happen coincidentally on the same day. The girl she looks after is incredibly annoying, by the way. But if you want to target a teenage audience, I guess you have to have some teenage characters.  There are some highly unlikely turnarounds during this 24-hour period. A president gets replaced then reinstated. His ex-wife worms her way back into his bunker, then gets expelled, then becomes a virtual heroine. The top baddies seem perfectly happy to switch their plans at the last moment from a start-a-Middle-Eastern-war strategy to an assassinate-the-president plan. The aspect that perhaps the director does best is the no-sex relationship developments. Tony and Michelle look early on as if they're going to get it together, but by the end, they both know they're too damned tired. And Jack and the woman he rescues develop an understanding, without any need to hop into bed before the day is out. (James Bond would have had at least three lovelies by this stage.)  I'm not happy about seeing actors in pain, and I'd frankly much rather see them in bed, but I guess torture is unfortunately a fundamental part of this plot. Shame 
 oh boy, finally a cd of all the great fatback hits,i would buy this cd just for the energy packed hit,SPANISH HUSTLE, ALONE PLUS THE LOVELY BALLAD OF ETTA'S JAMES VERSION OF AT LAST!GREAT TUNES!J.H.5275 
 I typically am not a fan of classic literature. There are a few books, however, that I have really enjoyed. This is one of them.  As one would expect it's a high reading level. However, it's definitely worth it. Malory does an excellent job at telling the stories of King Arthur, and develops his characters very well.  I enjoy medieval-themed stories and I recommend this to anyone who likes this genre and has a high school education (for the high level of reading) 
 Carl Ernst is widely considered one of the very leading scholars of Islam in the world today, and the excellent volume Following Muhammad:  Rethinking Islam in the Contemporary World is his learned, profound reflection on the situation of the Islam, Muslims, and the world at large today.  The book is beautifully illustrated by eight pictures and six luminous calligraphy pieces by the contemporary South Asian calligrapher, Rasheed Butt.   This timely volume should be recommended enthusiastically to anyone who wants to gain a nuanced and balanced understanding of the contested position of Islam in the modern world.   It fully deserves to be recognized as the single best choice for academic courses dealing with Islam and Middle Eastern studies, in both the undergraduate and graduate levels.  While one can not recommend it strongly enough to students and scholars of Islam, here is hoping that political scientists and historians of the Middle East and beyond, not to mention policy makers, will also avail themselves of it.   Ernst's volume breaks new theoretical ground while remaining completely accessible to the intelligent lay reader.  This is the rare work that only a scholar at the very zenith of his/her field can write, an even more daunting task given all the polemics about Islam today.   There is no better, more profound place to begin-or end-a sophisticated discussion about contemporary Islam than Ernst's masterpiece.   
 I love this seasion but the packaging could be better, I got cut with my copy of it 
 I purchased the incorrect item and had to return the item but had no problems with Amazon refunding my purchase amount.   
 Ferling does a good job in depicting the way of life for U.S. office-oriented colonists/citizens in the 1700's.  The relationship Adams and Jefferson had was also well described.  I felt the author had some bias but the book is still a "must read" for parities interested in the early U.S.,mannerisms of politicians at that time, and important personal/party battles 
 In our homecountry(Japan), we have no meals to see SG-1 from season 5 to season8 (season 9 is on the air through cableTV now.)I was looking forward to having my orders arrived. The nine pieces of merchandise were packed neatly.We cannot see the DVDs via DVD players made in Japan, because region cords are different between Japan and America.However, the quality of the display with PC are great. Thank you. 
 This is a GREAT film on so many planes, it's simply beyond me that anyone wouldn't love it! It's a HOOT.  It's a black comedy-horror-drama-thiller-action movie with a little kitsch tossed-in just to keep it balanced. Tee hee.  It is SMART; it is FUNNY; and it has its moments of horror, tension and well-choreographed military action.  The script is superb: It's cleverly written and and just plain makes you smile, okay all you snooty pooties out there?  And make NO mistake, there ARE doses of action, horror, suspense and thrills.  Forget the plot; forget the low budget. Let yourself be entertained by another "cult classic".    You will NOT be disappointed! Trust me...     
 Like an American "War and Peace", albeit not quite as comprehensive in its characters as Tolstoy, but a great read shedding a lot of light on the lead-up in the U.S. to WWII 
 Brazelton makes it easier to be a parent, especially on some of the tougher areas of the job.  He lays out clearcut ways to improve behavior (your child's and your own!) and strengthen the relationship between parent and child.  It's not rocket science, just good, practical advice to review when the going gets tough 
 This book was originally written in 1984 but was reissued in 1989 and then reprinted in 1993. It is a cultural materialist study in Renaissance literature. Cultural materialism is a movement led by Raymond Williams and  often associated with the new historicism of Stephen Greenblatt. The book  reviews the relationship between culture and context, from a revised  neo-Marxist standpoint. Along with his (then) colleague, Alan Sinfield,  Dollimore led the way in Renaissance literary criticism and this book  precedes their magnum opus, 'Political Shakespeare.' Dollimore focuses on  the possibility of subversion in works that had previously been seen as  re-asserting the validity and essential stability of a pre-existing social  order. The possibility of resistance had effectively been refuted by  Foucault and his followers, and the focus on potential dissidence in  readings of the text allows a greater chance for subverting the status quo,  necessary for any radical reading of a text. Dollimore draws on literary  and cultural theory, particularly Althusser and Gramsci on ideology to  assert a greater radical potential in the literary canon. In the context of  a British Thatcherite hegemony, this search for a possible resistance  movement seems natural, and it is also an outstanding piece of scholarship.  Very useful, very influential, very well-written. In short, well worth  having 
 If you want to learn how to teach children math skills through hands on methods, this is a fantastic book!  There are many many great ideas in this book for teachers to use to help their students understand math concepts in ways they've never been taught before.  It'll be a reference book on my shelves for sure 
 I am currently a student of Dr. Campbell and we are, not surprisingly, using this book for the course.  It uses many examples and teaches how to effectively use the comparative method.  It is also quite readable.  A great book for beginning the exciting field of historical linguistics 
 This book is amazing.  Charles Martin is an amazing author.  His characters are authentic and you can't help but feel their pain as the story unfolds - it's a hard one to put down.  I highly recommend this book 
 In a book that is heavily mathematic, it is very useful to have a table of symbols to refer to. However, this text not only has no such table, but the author often fails to define the symbols he uses! He cannot assume that the symbols he uses is so standard that the reader will already be familiar with them. Also, he even often fails to define his terms directly, but relies on homonyms in subsequent sentences, and apparently expects the reader to infer the meaning, and to know that he refers to the previous concept. However, this can lead to many misunderstandings and impedes the progress of learning substantially 
 After the great sucess of Laundry service.Shakira comes again with her two new jewels, Fijacion Oral vol.1 and Oral Fixation vol. 2. This CD IS really great , just as Fijacion oral, but is more hard to like. Shakira voice is unique. Ad she proves it with this CD. 1.How do you do: the first track of the album is very rock but also with also some pop included. Also   the lyrics are really good in this song. 10/10 2.Dont bother:  This is the first single, It wasnt as sucesfull becuase is not r&b or reggaeton but it a really good song. 5/5 3.Ilegal: This song is the one with Santana. The lyrics are also very melancolic. But the musica is a little balnd for me. 4/5 4.The day and the time: this is the translation of the song ''Dia especial'' from ''Fijacion Oral''. The songs sounds very good, but sometimes the lyrics doesnt sounds great, like the original. 5/5 5.Animal City:My fav song of the album!!!!!!!!is just really upbeat and somewhat sexy.The lyrics aree great also. Its the perfect choice  after hips dont lie.  6.Dreams for plans:this song is a very slow ballad. It really have grown on me.  the lyrics are really sweet.  now is my fav ballad of the CD. 5/5 7.Hey you:This a really weird song, it has some of ''Ciega,sordomuda'' beats, and shakira sexy voice. 9/10 8.Your Embrace:a romantic ballad, the chourus is very romantic, but other parts are too soft. 9/10 9.Costume makes the clown:This song is very rocky, and the lyrics are very interesting. a great track. 10/1o 10.Something:''En tus pupilas'' but in english( en tus pupilas is a transnlation of Somehting, but it came out first), this sogn sounds great too in english. is really lovely. 11.Timor:this is the more upbeat track of the album. Is really cool and diferent. Definately is going to be a single!! 10/10  Overall this album is really good, but they are chences that you will love it or hate it. Take a time to hear the previews and see if  you like them 
 With four Bibles on each page, it is a very good way to study the Bible and have a more complete idea of what each verse means in everyday terms. The Amplified Bible gives an expanded view of each verse and helps to understand what the other versions mean. I highly recommend 
 Neil J. Sullivan does a good job explaining some of the politics and corrutption surrounding the building and keeping of Yankee Stadium in N.Y. Being a native New Yorker I can relate to some of these events. Being a scholar as well, their are some things that I disagree with and some things tend to be repeat themselves in his book. He does go off subject some and then tries to tie it all together. I thought the book was a very good read! Steve Minn Graduate Student Sul Ross State University Alpine, Texa 
 I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.   A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.   Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!   Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.   Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.   I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat "Bite me!"   I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it.  
 The film was so much more enjoyable than "Brokeback Mountain". I really, really enjoyed it. Nuff said.... 
 This is a marvelous work.  It provides the reader with such a cross section of information about physics and does so in a very readable style.   For one thing, the author, one of the co-founders of the inflationary theory of cosmology, provides the reader with a glimpse into the world and life of a physicist.  The urgency to produce noticeable work, the concern over obtaining a tenured position in an institution that supports a physics program not only by course work but by time to work on projects and the equipment necessary to do so, the desire to collaborate with the "best", and the demands made on the family of the individual researcher are all described in intimate detail.  One comes away with a strong sense of the physicist as human being.    The individual personalities of the high profile physicists and of those just beginning to work on their programs is also provided, giving a very human picture of the "rocket scientists" of whom the rest of us often make fun but of whom we are also in awe. It makes the progress in science more obviously a triumph of human endeavor.  The insecurities and concerns of the author as he prepares to unveil his ideas before a daunting audience of famous people, have the reader on the edge of his/her seat.  In places the discussion reads like a cliff hanger novel.  The most important aspect of the book is the clear presentation of a theory in evolution.  It was surprising to see just how much creative, almost artistic, thought is involved in the process of theoretical physics.  It was also interesting to see the degree to which even potential competitors collaborated on difficult problems.  Even those from vastly different cultures and political environments contributed in an effort to "make it work."    Against this backdrop story of human beings looking for answers to big questions, the discussion of the theory of early universe inflation is put forth for the reader.   The author describes its simple inception as an intriguing question recommended by a peer as a potential project for collaboration, the gradual accretion of ideas from various sources, and the flowering of the initial concept into a full blown theory able to explain observable  facts, provide direction for research, and predict likely future discoveries.    Guth is careful to explain clearly the details needed for the amateur to understand his theory and its evolution.  He discusses relativity and quantum  physics, particle physics, the "big bang" cosmology, fields and their interaction, the quantum character of what most of us think of as "empty" space, and so on.  He also provides a history of physics and its personalities that provides the reader with a background in what has been learned and who made the contributions.    All explanations are clear and concise, and the author provides additional information for the curious in detailed foot notes and even more detailed in appendices so as not to distract from his central theme.  Although I found the going slow in places, I came away with a distinct feeling that I knew what he was talking about, and a sense of awe over the magnificence of the entire theory.    The description leaves one feeling as though one was actually there at the beginning of the beginning.     
 My wife and I wanted to know as much as we can about having a baby. This is one of the books that stand out in its category and I bought it. I am very pleased with it! Mr. Brott describes what it takes to be a dream father-to-be. I was deeply impressed and I will do my very best to come as close to the described role model as possible because as my wife said: "What more a pregnant woman may ask for?" I am very happy that in addition to information about the baby are discussed so many and it was hard to believe that they are so many little but important things that I and only I must take of. I even had to face the frustration from 9 sexless months but that won't happen because I learnt from another bestseller scientifically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex how to enjoy multi-orgasms  with or without her. Now I can confidently say that the key to success as a father-to-be is to be prepared as much as possible. This book is one of the must have because it covers many areas and provides excellent and detailed advice. I am sure that it will help you to be a dream father-to-be as well 
 The products was mailed out in a timely manner.  The condition of the book was excellen 
 As an author and therapist working with teens and their families for the past twenty years, I am constantly looking for resources for parents. This no-nonsense book can help parents when they are at their most desperate by offering real-life solutions to the problems they most frequently face. For support of a more spiritual nature, check out my daily meditations, as together we try to survive this amazing and challenging time in our lives, and the lives of our teens 
 This book is a wonderful account of life in the attic as told by Anne Frank. I read the book in high school and then recently read it after my husband and I visited the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. It was so interesting to read the book after having visited the real. I would almost recommend reading it before and after visiting the site 
 I think I can claim to be probably the only clinical neurologist who has read both this book and its first edition cover to cover, which really reflects the fascination of the articles more than incredible compulsivity on my part.  The book is divided into 11 sections--development, plasticity, sensory systems, motor systems, attention, memory, language, higher cognitive functions, emotion, evolution, and consciousness, with anywhere from 8-15 articles in each section (total 94 chapters!), averaging around 15 pages each, and a helpful introduction written by an expert for the sections.  There are also a large number of color illustrations.  For the most part, the articles are very clearly written reviews, and would be appropriate for the upper undergraduate or graduate level student.  The emphasis is obviously more on neuroscience than on clinical medicine, though helpful correlates to neurological patients can be found in many chapters.  Michael Gazzaniga has once again done a masterful job in assembling contributors, and it is wonderful to see how much the field has advanced since the first edition of this book was published in 1995.  For anyone with more than a casual interest in the field, this book is a MUST HAVE! 
 These trunks are true to size and look great!   I wear them for swimming laps, but imagine they would work just as well on the beach if you are looking for a shorter cut trunk.  
 This book is my introduction to Bill Bryson and a fine introduction it is.  Bryson is an American who lived in England for twenty years.  Before moving back to the States, he took a trip around Britain and recorded his findings.  Although it may be a little dated (England isn't in as bad economic shape as it was back then) it is still a worthwhile read for any Anglophile.  Bryson dutifully records the foibles of the British people - such as the way they cling to the notion that there country is a big place.  There is no plot, but it is a funny, insightful look at the British 
 I was on the Maine Photographic Workshop's 1999 Golden Light Award committee (with photographers Slyvia Plachy and Len Jenshel, in April 2000), and we voted this best retrosepctive photography book of 1999. It's a comprehensive, lively, and engagingly designed overview of this  intriguiing but little-known artist's work. Our critieria: books we'd want  to have on our shelves at home. Coming from a photo book publisher, 'nuff  said 
 We use this callendar on the front desk in our veterinary practice. It gets rave reviews every year, and many requests to know where we got it. We also get the cat Cat Gallery Calendar too! Can't go wrong with either one 
 In God's Time: The Bible And The Future by Craig C. Hill (Professor of New Testament, Wesley Theological Seminary, Washington, D.C.) is an informed and informative contribution to the on-going theological debate about the Bible, the future, and the predicted day of Rapture. Taking a moderate stance between those who intensely burn with "rapture fever", and those of the Jesus Seminar who believe that Jesus did not teach about the approaching Kingdom of God, In God's Time is a scholarly, thoughtful, engaging examination of apocalyptic writings, the history of prophecy, patterns of theological orientation, and much, much more. In God's Time is a welcome and highly recommended combination of intellectual and theological discourse 
 The reason i think this is the best album ever is simple. First it paved the way for punk as did MC5 and The Stooges. The second reason is the songs are amazing and Johnny Thunders is the best guitarist ever if you don't think so just check out his later work (LAMF, So Alone, Que Sera Sera, New Too Much Junkie Business). If you think The Ramones invented punk rock you are dead wrong it all started with MC5 and The Stooges and got really good at this point 
 There are few bands out there that have such a sound. At the drive-ins sound is hard to clasify,just raw power. The defening sounds of the guitars, the unusual time signatures used, they all show a glimpse of what would become Sparta and The Mars Volta.   Between the raw guitar chords is an ever so sweet melody, that is imposible to forget. Cedric's vocals are shouted with passion. There are no lack luster tracks here, this is not a collection of singles this is an album. All 12 tracks are unique and special in some kind of way.    There are few bands out there that can restore my faith in music, specially these days, At the drive-in is one of them. Five stars 
 Another classic in need of updating, the 1994 book Managing Your Documentation Projects still provides good information about the basics of managing a technical writing project. It takes you from defining the project to completion, and on into the normally neglected phases of evaluation, and maintenance. This is a great tool for a writer who wants to formalize and add supporting structure to what he already does by instinct, for an experienced writer who is used to working alone and discovers he has no idea how to manage a team, or for anyone who wants to understand the mechanics of a well run team 
 I read F. Scott Fitzgerald's "Tender is the Night" (1934) following a recent online discussion on Amazon's discussion board in which a number of good Amazon reviewers offered their thoughts on the book.  I am please to note many fine reviews on this site as well.  "Tender is the Night" is a story of part of America's "Lost Generation" in the period following WW I.  Most of the story is set on the French Riviera in the 1920s with a large cast of wealthy, dissipated and idle Americans with little to do with themselves. The book tells of the fall of Dick Diver, a promising and idealistic young American psychiatrist.  As an intern in Zurich, Dick had married a beautiful wealthy young American woman, Nichole Warren, who had been his patient. Nichole had severe and lasting psychiatric issues resulting from sexual abuse by her father.  While on the Riviera, several years into the marriage, Dick is attracted to a callow 18-year old American movie actress, Rosemary Hoyt.  Although he resists Rosemary's advances at the time, her memory stays with him. She and Dick have a brief affair a few years later.  Dick ultimately sees her as shallow.  By that time, his life has dissipated through drink, idleness, problems with Nichole, and the corrupting effect of Nichole's money. Nichole leaves Dick, and he returns to the States for a lonely, wasted life.  It is all very sad.  I found the story effectively organized and told. The opening scenes take place on the French Riviera with Dick seemingly at the height of his powers as a socialite and budding medical writer.  After an extended opening, the story doubles back to Dick's life in Zurich and has fateful courtship of Nichole.  We then witness Dick Diver's inexorable deterioration, alcoholism, and degeneracy, and the break-up of his marriage.  The writing is eloquent and spare, with good characterizations of mostly unappealing people and pictures of places.  We see the rootlessness of a class of Americans after the great War and the corrupting effects of money and idleness.  Dick Diver's story, I thought was sad and sentimental rather than tragic.  There is little of the hero about him.  "Tender is the Night" is the story of wandering lives, lost innocence, and the waste of human potential.  In some ways, the book reminded me of the writings of the Beats, following WW II.  It is a 20th Century American book, well worth knowing.     Robin Friedma 
 The basic premise of this book is that optimisim is not only a tendency which some are born with, but also a learned skill that even those who are naturally pessimistic in nature can master. It is theorized that by teaching children this skill they will be better able to avoid being overcome by depression,as both children and the adults they grow into. The author is one who was an early proponent of cognitive therapy, which is a behavior modification type program for re-training the pessimistic brain of those who are depressed, and which has had remarkable, positive results. In this book those same techniques are described to parents as PREVENTATIVE life skills and habits to be developed in order to safeguard children from ever even becoming depressed. As the former spouse of a clinically depressed man who has sucessfully managed his depression through cognitive therapy, I am a believer in this process.  If severly depressed people can be taught a functional optimism which effectively treats depression, then teaching these same positive functional habits of optimism in children as a prevetative measure makes alot of sense. I picked up this book in the hope of teaching our children these life skills. I was impressed by the functional "HOW TO" type exercises to use with children of all ages.  This book is written in a easy to understand manner which is not overly innundated with technical jargon.   Of course, my review is from the vantage point of an optimist herself who would like to believe I can help prepare my children to face life in a healthy manner through parenting. I am putting a lot of faith in the power of nurture over nature- and many will debate that. Nonetheless, having heard the depressed who has lived through the worst of depression to extol the virtue of cognitive therapy as nothing less than life saving,  I think that even a pessimist would be a believer in the power of optimism once he or she learns this incredible secret-- that like most things,  optimism can indeed be learned, and that it is one of the most important things one can learn to be healthy and happy. This book truly is a great tool in teaching that skill 
 I bought one as a gift. It looks great on him. But it ran out of battery after half a year, and my friend need get it fixed. This should not happend for a new watch. As the watch was already started when I received it, there was a possibility that it wasn't brand new when I bought them. Other than that, it is a good buy 
 I think this software is excellent for biginning designers like me. It gives a great range of choices to help you expand your imagination & create new personal things each time you work. The only problem faced me was that it doesn't support other languages, but it works with wordart 
 You'll cruise by quaint country scenes, race a train skirting rolling hills and rustic mountains. You'll make it all the way to Nashville via gritty city streets past all the coolest jazz and rock clubs. That's where you'll go when you put "Get Inside", a slick offering from Johnny A, in your CD player.   As it states on his biography page on his official website "This is music for an open mind aching for the open road."   What was that, did Mark Knopfler cameo on this CD? No, but there is an unmistakable, however subtle, Knopflerish quality to Johnny A's playing on some tracks. Still, Johnny A's playing is completely his own, incredibly versatile, refreshing and new, with plenty of smooth grooves and tricks to keep your ears busy. Johnny A. is one of the most talented guitarists I've ever heard.   Get Inside is a well produced collection of instrumental guitar tracks that conjure a variety of mental images. One thing that cannot be ignored about his playing is the incredibly clean picking and colorful phrasing. As a guitarist, there are moments in this CD that make me say, "How the heck did he do that?"   Excuse me while I go lock myself away with my guitar for another twenty years. Good, inspiring guitar playing for the inspirable guitar lover 
 This is a great album.  I love listening to CDs that have songs from some of my favorite shows.  My favorite songs on this CD are: The Simpsons, Roseanne, Seinfeld, Home Improvement, and Tales From The Crypt.  Everyone  should definitely buy this CD.  It's great to listen to because you can  still keep in touch with some of your favorite tv shows that are no longer  on tv.  I love this CD.  Buy it 
 Oh. My. God. I passed up buying the complete short stories of Raymond Chandler for this one. McBain, Mosley, King, Westlake, Deaver, and Block sharing the same book? And, mind you, not with any skinny little throwaway, wrote-in-a-weekend, virgin Bloody Mary shorts, but with big phhhhhat novellas. The novella is one of the greatest lost forms of detective fiction -- a dense, polished gem waiting for future generations to find in a dusty magazine pile or anchoring an obese anthology.  Fitting that Ed McBain -- whose nearly-half century-aged 87th Precinct is still going strong and fresh -- would revive the novella. His own contribution is a new 87th Precinct novel-in-miniature, "Merely Hate," which just simply rocks. The post-9/11 theme of religious and cultural intolerance rockets along with serial murder, terrorism, media satire, and those great McBain cops and characters. The whole squad chimes in in the course of this unexpected marvel, and it all wraps up in the kind of twist McBain's become famous for.  I moved on to Lawrence Block's new Keller novelette -- another score for my favorite hitman -- and on to Donald Westlake's latest raucous caper for hapless Dortmunder and felonious friends. I'm saving the Stephen King as a sort of creme brulee capper, but so far, my fictional world has been rocked to its foundations.  I'll buy Chandler next paycheck. 
 Perhaps there are no more influential four bars in the history of recorded music than Bird's astounding unaccompanied break just prior to his first improvised chorus on "Night and Tunisia" on the 1946 Dial recording. (See, for example, Martin Williams' analysis in "The Jazz Tradition.") Its omission makes this collection an unsatisfying introduction to the genius of Charlie Parker 
       Oxygen is one of those great books that keep you on the edge of your seat. This book is a lot like Apollo 13, except of course this crew did actually make it to their destination, which is Mars, not the Moon.      Oxygen is an adventure/mystery/romance novel about a space mission that went wrong because of a bomb that exploded while the crew of four, Valkerie, Bob, Kennedy, and Lex, were in space, on their way to Mars. There were only a few people who could have placed it- one of the crew themselves or one the few people of Earth who are telling the crew what to do. Another problem presents itself soon after this- their spacecraft is running out of oxygen. The only way they all could survive is if three of them are put in comas while the fourth one stays awake to revive them when they reach their destination, but trust has become scarce since the bombing and each of the crew is unwilling to let another stay awake. 
 Another Rita Mae masterpiece.  Jutz & Wheezie once again square off with dynamic and often hysterically funny exchanges.  The touching part is that their love for one another always shines through.  Cora continues with  her compelling wisdom, Ramelle with her gentleness and charm.  A must read  if you enjoyed Six of One and Bingo 
 Fans of The Clash will not be disappointed with this effort from Joe and the boys. I bought the CD on the strength of Tony Adams & Yalla Yallah downloaded a while back and the rest of the tracks are equally good :o 
 This is a great book!! It deals with how to stop tamtrums before they can start, and a sections on saving your marriage. Whinging kids get a section and even single parents. Steve Biddulph has great ideas which are simple and easy to put into practice. Get DAD to read it as well to make your life even easier!!( I read the 2000 edition 
 I read The Red Hat Club first but I did pick this one up first at the bookstore ~~ it looks fun and after having surgery, I was definitely in the mood for FUN! Linwood is the character that I wish I could be ~~ speaks her mind and gets away with it. And this book had me laughing in several spots ~~ which is the best medicine that the doctors could recommend.   Linwood moves home after thirty years of marriage ~~ moves home to an ailing father, a bossy mom, an uncle who is slowly losing his mind and his beleagured wife. There is the long-suffering brother who is home after his numerous divorce. Linwood was just not anxious to be back home ~~ but she didn't have any place left to go.   Stuck in real estate classes at night, she works at the local pharmacy during the day time ~~ Linwood becomes embroiled with the local politics in butting heads with the current mayor and council ~~ and she also falls into lust with her next-door-neighbor. This book is just fun ~~ and not so predictable as I thought it might be. It's full of sassy humor and wit ~~ perfect for any woman who is going through a male-bashing period.   This book is intended to be fun ~~ not a serious tome of life ~~ and it worked for me! It's also a perfect beach/pool read for this upcoming summer! Be sure to bring your glass of iced tea and enjoy!  3-18-0 
 Very rarely will I come across a cd with songs aside from the single(s) worth listening to. This is ONE of the few!   Franz Ferdinand were named for the Austro-Hungarian Archduke whose murder sparked World War I. With the success of their single "Take Me Out," they were propelled to the mainstream where they won an MTV Music Video Award for "Take Me Out" as well as the U.K. Mercury Prize.    Their second single released here in the U.S., "This Fire," also became a sizeable modern rock hit. Some of my personal favorites include: "Jacqueline" / "Tell Her Tonight" / "The Dark Of The Matinee" / "40'"  Overall, I give this album a perfect score. Very original, post-modern pop rock. Impossible to listen to without bobbing your head or dancing to!    
 This book has 25 anotated games where it goes over 3 main variations of the English.  One is the Symmetrical English where the author goes over the Hedgehog, Double Fianchetto Defense and Rubenstein System.  The second part of the book goes over Reversed Sicilian Positions you can get from the English Opening.  The third and final section goes over English vs Nimzo Indian Defense systems.  All the games were from 2003 on so alot of new theory and ideas.  I really liked the part with the Nimzo vs English since I have not seen too many modern books on that subject.  The only thing I did not like is this book comes from England and takes FOREVER to get delivered.  I had to wait months for my copy.  But well worth it if you are and English Opening Fan. 
 Great movie, full of twists and turns, deep charcters, will keep you on the edge, the DVD quailty is also great 
 This book is incredible.  I was intrigued first by the title and then even further by the synopsis on the jacket.  What would happen if all your memories came back to you as if you were living them all over again?  If everything you saw or or smelled or did in the present reminded you of all moments small and large in your past.  And is what you remember exactly as it really happened?  Are our memories trustworthy, or are we rewriting them for better or worse even as they happen?  It's amazing the way the author addresses these questions through the characters, and makes you question your own memories.  Right from the start, you are there with these people holding your breath during the "spill" which isn't really a spill, but a release of a chemical into the atmosphere as one of the characters points out.  She draws you in and you can't help but get lost in your own memories just as the characters do in the book.  As you follow these people as they fight to find their way back to the present, and then struggle to move on after reliving their lives through their memories, you see how their memories have shaped and controlled their lives all along.  And how do we break free of the binds that are our memories?  Read the book and you may discover the answer for yourself.  When I was finished I was so disappointed to find out it was her first book because I couldn't wait to read anything else she had written.  Well now there's "Disapparation of James" also a very intriguing book, and I highly recommend that one as well 
 Jingle All the Way is the perfect holiday comedy for those of you who can't find the right Christmas toy for your children.Schwartzenegger plays Howard Langston,a workaholic father who's son,Jamie,is constantly dissapointed with his father's inabitlity to come home for Christmas,or make his karate classes.Howard sees his opportunity for redemption when Jamie tells him he wants a Turbo Man action figure,the hottest selling toy on the shelves.Howard sets out on a quest for the toy,shooting blanks at every toy store.It seems that Turbo Man is more popular than he thought as he teams up with another desperate father looking for a Turbo Man:loud-mouthed mailman Myron Larabee,who eventually pits himself against Howard to get a Turbo Man first.It's a fun-filled ride from start to finish as Howard ends up at the Christmas day parade as the one and only Turbo Man in one of Arnold Schwartzenegger's funniest moments on screen.Get this movie 
 This is Philip Roth's masterpiece. Here is where it all comes together in an unforgettable eruption: the giddy sensualism, the infuriating guilt, the brilliant narcissism and the punctured self-loathing, the mortal terror and sexual obsession. Mickey Sabbath is shocking and painful and hilarious and ultimately heartbreaking.  Every time I read this book I am amazed. It is what novels are meant to be. 
 Instead Of Education: Ways To Help People Do Things Better by alternative education advocate John Holt (author of the 1964 book How Children Fail) is an iconoclastic and seminal work presenting a persuasively argued case for "un-schooling" from traditional classroom structures and curriculum fare, to innovative, self-directed learning as the basis for a truly creative life. A direct challenge to the complacency of today's educational status quo (even in this political age of "no child left behind" and school voucher proposals), Instead Of Education should be required reading in every Teacher's College, District School Board, and governmental education policy development office whether it be federal, state, or local. Instead Of Education is a significant and seminal contribution to education policy discussions and commended to the attention of education reform activists at all levels and from all perspectives. 
 Goldberg's is an excellent, well-researched, and interesting text that documents the history of a most misunderstood medium:  performance art.  Proceeding in a sure-footed way from the early, combative, theatrical efforts of the Italian Futurists, then to Dadaism, then on to the dances of Oskar Schlemmer, to the 1960s "happenings", up until the end of the 1980s...Goldberg covers it all.  She gives essential and pertinent cultural information that facilitates the reader's understanding of the "how" and the "why" of performance art.  This book is a must-have for art and cultural historians, as well as anyone who wants to broaden their knowledge of the key figures and events relating to art of the modern and postmodern eras 
 Just like a computer is useless without the programing, the TIVo DVR is useless without the TIVo Service and your programing source. TIVo allows a person to save programs you might want to view and lets you view them when you want.   Negatives: Used with Dish Network requires a signal from the Dishnet control after its daily update and TIVo doesn't give this signal.    TIVo works with IR controlled Dish/cable boxes, and Dish Network has dual tuner box with one tuner IR and the other radio controlled, TIVo will only control the IR controlled tuner

 Film is all about the image, and Bruce Block gives you a visual toolkit. With this, you can construct images that help to tell your story, set the mood, and control how the image affects the audience. His techniques can make any film stronger. I highly recommend it 
 this is a movie that seems to be a star movie but does not even pretend to do so; we are always with the loser - what he isn't. be surprised 
 Just brilliant, I read it in his Spanish version 7 years ago; hey I was at that time a freshman student and had no knowledge of a lot of things. I just did not stop in every detail, and let me assure you, it is not necessary to comprehend the whole story. Don't bother having dictionaries and stuff, just follow the story bypassing the details.  3 years ago I read it for the second time, I found a lot more things than the first time, it was quite refreshing  now I have studied a little of Kabbalah and felt the need to read it again, it is amazing how much you learn when you read the book carefully, but hey, don't do it the first time, you don't have to and if you are not intellectually patient and curious you will certainly get bored of stopping again and again

 This wonderful book contains just about everything anyone could possibly want to know about the art and artists of the period, what they painted and why they painted the way they did, including background material on the political and economic environment in which the artists worked. Included are 410 illustrations with approximately half in color. This book will be treasured by students of art as well as those of us who are "merely" art appreciators. The writing is scholarly, but not stuffy and very accessible to any art lover. It is a book to be picked up over and over again. A real treasure that every museum-goer should own 
 This DVD is the most engaging video the Wiggles have made, and we love it at our house.  It is a video of one of their live concerts in Sydney, Australia---their hometown, and it is an excellent sampling of their music and entertainment.  I have taken my two-yr-old daughter to two Wiggles concerts in the past year, and this is the closest you can get to being there without actually going!  Because we are such big Wiggles fans, and because the grandparents are so generous, we have every Wiggles video, and if I had to recommend just ONE for someone to buy, this one would be the one.  They start the show in the Big Red Car, entering the concert.  Every Wiggles fan alive knows "Toot, Toot, Chugga, Chugga", and every fan in the audience is cheering and singing along.  Throughout the video, the song and dance numbers are fun, catchy and memorable, and the Wiggles look like they are truly enjoying entertaining the children of the world.  Fun, exciting renditions of "Rock-a-Bye Your Bear", "Hoop Dee Doo" (great fun!), and a wonderful medley at the end help make this their greatest release yet.  There are great antics offered by each member of the Wiggles (Jeff falls asleep repeatedly, Anthony "musically" dances, Murray plays his guitar, etc.), and even Jolly Old St. Nick makes an appearance....after getting lost on his way to the concert!  It's always Christmas in Wiggles land, according to my daughter, so Santa is welcome anytime!  There are "live" satellite feeds from different parts of the world (including one from a fire station in New York!).  And as always, Captain Feathersword, Dorothy the Dinosaur and Wags the Dog add even more fun and humor to the show.  Don't forget the Wiggly dancers....all the favorites are there!   Kids love this video, and it is remarkably entertaining....not a dull moment. Want your kid to see a Wiggles concert, but they don't come to your hometown?  Buy this video.  It's almost like being there!  My daughter never tires of watching it, and Mommy likes it too 
 This book gives a nice rundown of different handbag styles, and designers. It's simple and slightly informative. I mainly wanted the book for pictures and inspiration, which it gave me. I enjoyed the section that goes over the types of handbags, just because I was clueless as to their names and such. Overall, I was pleased 
 I am a thirty-something person learning the piano with no musical experience at all. This book has definitely taught me to play, and no other book I picked up came close. The Alfred book starts at the very beginning with pictures of numbered fingers and numbered keys. And within a few pages you're reading music and playing with two hands! The pace is appropriate for an adult, progressing quickly, but with full explanation of each new skill.   I would still recommend getting additional beginner books if you're serious about learning the piano, because it's useful to have a variety of resources, but this book is the one that taught me to play.  Good luck 
 Only a person who really loves libraries could have written this book about a disturbed man who wants to blow up the Chicago Public Library's Harold Washington building.  Just look at the intricate way he weaves the footnotes into the plot; he must have spent a lot of time researching.  As a librarian myself, I loved the plot, the setting, and the character of Eve Jablom.  Nice to see a librarian portrayed as young and attractive instead of old and austere 
 Somebody should totally open a theme restaurant based on this book.  I would definitely eat their deep fried burgers.  I want a "Eat At Satan Burger" t-shirt.  If you haven't read this book yet, you lose 
 Not that all the tracks aren't intriguing, interesting, fun, or even brilliant but note that some tracks are closer to bossa nova/trip hop than straight 'chill,' or just easy samba - nothing wrong with that but you will have to mix/shuffle the tracks a little. 
 While watching "Jeopardy" in his New York apartment, Howard Mitla hears the sound of a finger tap-tap-tapping in his bathroom sink. Is it coming from the drain? Why doesn't his wife notice anything wrong? Is this a job for Drano or a pair of hedge-clippers?  Mitla's situation can only mean one thing: We are in the world of Stephen King's imagination. This 1994 collection of King's shorter works is his most diverse ever, and while some, like the above story, "The Moving Finger," deliver King's typically creepy chills, there is also a Sherlock Holmes mystery, a poem, a journalistic account of his son's Little League team, even a religious parable. Not everything is terrific, but nearly everything works at least a little, and several approach the level of King's best writing.  My favorite is "Dedication," a very unsettling story about a woman's devotion to her son's literary success that shows both King the gutsy gross-out artist and weaver of gripping yarns. Even if it isn't exactly frightening, it is truly unnerving in the vein of "The Shining" and "The Dead Zone" and has one of King's best-ever endings, both clever and sympathetic.  Speaking of "The Dead Zone," the obnoxious supermarket tabloid reporter from that book, Richard Dees, is back on the job chasing a vampire who flies with the aid of a Cessna Skymaster, knocking off the staffs of backwater airports in "The Night Flier," a King tale in the classic macabre mold. My favorite of these spookier stories is "Chattery Teeth," about the closest thing to "Evil Dead 2" in short-story form. King often tries to be funny in his writing, but he is seldom as successful at it as he is here.  A couple of stories ("It Grows On You", "Sneakers") begin well before petering out. Others, like "Umney's Last Case" and "Dolan's Cadillac," take too long to get started but reward the patient reader, at least somewhat. I can't think of but one or two stories here that were utterly lame, except maybe "My Pretty Pony," a story about aging, and "You Know They Got A Hell Of A Band" which telegraphs its punches from a mile away.  But the others are good reads, even the Little League article, "Head Down," which manages to be something more than the product of an indulgent father who happens to be a talented writer. There's a neat Elmore Leonard pastiche, "The Fifth Quarter," along with apparent nods to H.P. Lovecraft ("Crouch End"), Roald Dahl ("The House On Maple Street") and Raymond Chandler ("Umney's Last Case").  The best of these is a Ray Bradbury-like story called "Suffer The Little Children" about a schoolteacher who doles out more than detentions to her young charges. I thought the Sherlock Holmes story, "The Doctor's Case," was a nice try, though I can't picture Watson and Holmes discoursing about "ponces" the way they do here.  Some readers may find this less satisfying than other King short-story collections, particularly his first, "Night Shift." But "Night Shift" had a couple of clunkers, too, and if "Nightmares & Dreamscapes" fails at times, it does so for the sake of King advancing his craft. And if you find stories like "The Ten O'Clock People" and "Rainy Season" to be anything less than classic King shorts like "The Mangler" and "Quitters, Inc.," you are kidding yourself more than a little bit 
 For someone who is always dreaming, head in the clouds, of faraway places and exotic sights and encounters this book brought me crashing down to earth with a resounding thud. He's right you know...you may be lying on a beach in Barbados...but there is nowhere in the world you can get to far enough to escape yourself. So I've put aside my guide books about Europe and lost interest in checking and comparing airline ticket prices...I've found a fantastic yet unlikely place that I've never ever really gone before. That's right folks...if you want me..I'll be taking a leaf out of de Maistre's book and will be travelling around my bedroom. Many thanks to Mr. de Botton for introducing me (by way of Xavier de Maistre) to this deceptively simple thought and reminding us that we cannot escape ourselves, as much as we try..for all the palm trees and London towns in the world 
 another great book by Stuart, i look forward to many years of good reading from him 
 With a script by Terry Southern, author of Candy, this is the ultimate floss on the icing, and a totally memorable movie masterpiece. A brilliant plot, unforgettable dialogue ("de-crucify the angel, or I'll melt your face"), incredible special effects, stunning performances by all concerned. Subtle, deep and multi-layered. Maverick mad scientist invents a WMD and plans to rule the galaxy! Defeated by innocence, incompetence, sweetness and excessive sex! Not forgetting a flashy fashion quick-change every few minutes. What outfits! Very influential, and one of the milestone highlights of movie history, the full recognition of its unique merits lies in the distant future; but some of us, with remarkable prescience, can actually see that far ahead. All those sad, dull dumbos, who think it is just silly and camp, bad and boring, will be positronically erased and forgotten as the years, the centuries, the millennia and the stars roll by. Who needs to wait for the 41st millenium with this dvd in their collection? 
 An excellent book. Very well written and a super index of swimming terms The swimming terms are explained very well and also organzation is excellent   I Love how Brems gives workouts for the beginner  intermediate,  and advanced swimmer. Super  tips for everyone who loves swimming   Also  this book is great because it gives you   workouts for about 1/3 of the  year!!    I would recommend this book to anyone who interested in doing  swimming workouts without a coach!! This book is a must have for all  swimmers! 
 i would have given this book five stars except at the start it dragged on a bit till it got good, but this book from the middle onwards was great! crystal gordon "shugra" wants to make a coven of witch potential people so she can be invulnerable and willow is the main target until she doesnt agree (it has to be free will) and while buffy and the others try to destroy crystal the woods have a plan of their own. even though i dont give this book five stars its still very good 
 I have read the book Ida B. by Katherine Hannigan and it was a very good book. Ida B. always talked to the trees and the brook. She played with them every evening. Then one day Ida B.'s mom got a lump on her body.She went to the doctor and found that the lump had Cancer. Before Ida B. had been home schooled by her mom and dad, but Ida B.'s dad couldn't take care of the farm, school Ida B. and take care of mom.Ida B.'s dad ended haveing to sell a little bit of the valleys and mountains thay he owned and he had to send Ida B. to school. A school buddy, Claire, moved into the land that had to be sold. Ida B. got into a fight with her and can't find a way out. Then when the school year ended mom got better, but did Ida B. end the fight with Claire? Find out in this book. I was stunned when I found out that Ida B.'s mom had Cancer. It would not be fun to have to sell some of your families land and go to school and have your mom sick and tired. I also think that it would not be fun to not have any friends at school and be in a fight with someone in your own class. It was a hard time for Ida B. Therefore, if you want a good book, read Ida B. 
 Packed with more information than some larger books.  Small enough to carry with you. Very impressive.  Would recommend 
 What can I say about this sublime book that blends an exciting mystery with tantalizing folklore and fascinating historical detail?  Only what virtually every other reviewer here has said:   I read this book as a teen and never, ever forgot it. I became enthralled with the legends surrounding Glastonbury. I didn't rest until I actually visited the site in my 20's.   I almost never write Amazon reviews, but I am so delighted to see this gem of a book available again, I had to check in.  From the unanimously excited responses of those who rediscovered this book, I am confident that word of mouth and enthusiastic teachers and librarians will do everything they can to see that this amazing work reaches a new generation of future travellers to Glastonbury.    Like I, they will be thrilled to gaze on the actual places described in the book: The beautiful Chalice Well, the ruined Abbey, the marker for "Arthur's grave", the thorn tree; and the profoundly mystical Glastonbury Tor at the nexus of one of the most remarkable places on Earth.  Thank you, Eleanor Jewett, for making that trip a foregone conclusion for me upon the opening of your book. 
 If you are a Columbo fan, you will enjoy season five. I own seasons one through five, and enjoy them all. If you are type of person who likes extras such as bloobers or interviews, you won't find them on this DVD. The only extra is an episode of Mrs Columbo, which really isn't necessary. It's not hard to see why that series didn't last 
 Clowney sets out in 290 pages to address the issues of the church's "abiding nature and mission." This he accomplishes, addressing every facet of each of these categories, typically by juxtaposing Reformed theology with the most prevalent error of today in a given area. This has two results: to teach the reader what the Bible teaches, but also to bring to light fascinating details of, for example, the syncretism of the World Council of Churches, or the misinterpretation of Acts of the charismatics. The image of the church Clowney presents is probably unfamiliar to most Christians, as elements such as church discipline, proper worship, and a correct doctrine of the spiritual gifts are sadly lacking today, especially in my own Southern Baptist denomination.  Clowney's work is not incredibly detailed, but references a great many other works. For the seminarian or pastor, it is sufficient to grasp a basic understanding of what the church is, what it should be, and where it has fallen into error or misunderstanding. It is also suitable for the lay person (in fact, I would recommend it).  The binding is, of course, paperback, and seems sturdy and of good quality. My copy shows very little wear after its first thorough reading. I found only one glaring typographical error (bottom of pg. 283). I understand the economics of paperback publishing, but this work deserves a hard cover. 
 It seems that these days anyone can write a chess book about the openings. Quite a few authors have a well-established production routine: do a database search, add a few meaningless comments, secure the praise of a few drivel-producing colleagues and here you go! A marketable chess book is born! Well, Chess Stars book in general are on the opposite end of the spectrum. The Safest Sicilian is another great example with a lot of original research and useful insights into the opening.  I cannot say that I always agreed with GM Delchev, but it is just a difference of opinion. The format of the book is very interesting, one way to utilize it would be:  1. Read just the quick repertoire part (won't take long) 2. Start playing the opening in blitz 3. Go back to the book and review the "holes" in your preparation.  And yes, despite the title, this book will not guarantee you a draw with black, but you didn't expect it, did you?  For those of you who want to see great opening books for white, I strongly recommend "Opening for White according to Anand" and "Opening for White accroding to Kramnik" series 
 The only reason to have this three pack is for the Nun's Story which is so far above the nonesense on the other two as to leave one breathless. The thing to do is to buy the Nun's Story seperately..forget this package, and forge ahead with Audrey Hepburn in the greatest film she ever made.  The Shoes of The Fisherman is absurd, even with Anthony Quinn and Oskar Werner. TYhe Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima is a camp classic.  See the Nun's Story, but not with these two other unworthy Dvds 
 I was a bit skeptical when I came across this Mic, but for the price, I decided "Heck, why not?".  I got it in the mail the other day, installed it (comes with a sticky adhesive back preinstalled, no holder or anything, but that's fine by me) and was immediately blown away and pleased with the quality and sensitivity of this Mic.  I typically use my Mic for Ventrillo and Team Speak chats, as well as MSN and other various activities.  Previously I was using a headset by Plantronics, but I was tired of having something on my head and dealing with the wires, etc.  This sits stuck under my flat panel now (I sit about 2.0 feet from it), and I can speak in a natural volume and tone, and it picks everything up with perfect clarity, detail and volume.  It picks up a little of my CPU fan, but it's not bad.  For the money, this is a GREAT PERFORMER.  This Mic performs closer to some in the $30-$50 range, believe it or not 
 I bought this book to give to a young man who is developing an interest in market investing. Here is the reason: When I first began to study the stock market years ago, I found the books I bought so frustrating I nearly quit! I couldn't even understand the terminology and complained, Why don't they write in ENGLISH?! It was terrible! I didn't know about William O'Neil's books at the time. This book will give the reader a sound basis in the stock market and at least the beginning of a trading plan (I think everyone develops their own through experience). I give this book the ultimate five stars for the novice newcomer, or even for the person who has been investing unsuccessfully and wants to change that! A very worthwhile book! Arlea 
 This book was great for giving practical advice on how to manage your finances while you are also in the process of combining (or not  combining) finances with your future spouse 
 Colette is an amazing woman who shares her moving, personal experiences in this wonderful book.  Her story is one we can all relate to, one of being sensitive in an often chaotic world, and her path back to recovering her true power - that of her connection to living in service and in truth.  The contents of this book will help you reclaim your own intuitive gifts which are your birthright.  You will be inspired, delighted, and enlightened as you find ways to love yourself and others.  This book is surely one of the best of its kind 
 Ah, disco.  A music which saw women take center stage on many occasions.  I love to put on this collection when I'm biking, it gives me energy to workout and I can sing along.  The variety is pretty good, in fact, some of the selections are rather horrible but we can't like everything.  This was the second of this series that I purchased and I'm very glad I did.  Think I'll go bike and sing "I Will Survive" right now 
 I am re-reading the book, and was compelled to share my love and appreciation of the deep understanding and unique approach to organizations and to the ways of dealing with change offered by Arie de Geus.   I'm undergoing through deep change in my life; my business is growing and changing. The book gives courage, foresight, support, tools and a map both to pass through the process holistically, and take responsibility for the future. I see how my whole company is taking responsibility for its future. I give credit for this movement to the ideas and concepts laid out the the book 
 And very simply the best book of its kind -- beautifully produced, with stunning visuals by great photographers, superb art direction and, of course, Dita.  She re-invents  glamour.  It takes a remarkable model and some great stylists to hold your attention through a one-woman "show" like this, but she does it, and looks great throughout, over the course of an unbelieveable variety of settings, wardrobe, lack of wardrobe, styles and situations. Nothing lewd at all, in fact there is no nudity in this book. It's the "teese" that keeps you interested.  You will not go wrong, a very, very well done book that you will be happy to own 
 I listened to the abridged version of this book over the course of a few days and found it to be quite entertaining and informative.  Those who are intrigued by the special mission units of the US military should look no further than here for an insider's account behind the scenes as many of the heavy hitters were just getting started in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Carney is at his best telling the tale of small unit leadership in action as he fought tooth-and-nail to gain respect and a mission for his "Brand-X" airmen.  Another strength of the book is in showing how hard it was for US special operations forces (SOF) to really get their act together.  His account of Desert One in Iran, which has been written about elsewhere, is still not easy to stomach.  Grenada was not much better.  It was not until Panama in 1989 that things were truly clicking on all cylinders.  Special Mission Units didn't have much of a role in Desert Storm/Shield, at least, not at first, but later in Somalia and of course in Afghanistan they were much more than bit players.  Carney calls Afghanistan the first "special operations war."  But will it be the last?  The book was published before Iraq kicked off, but I wonder what he would think about attempting to extrapolate the successes of SOF to that war?  The narrative loses a bit of its strength towards the end after the author retires from active duty and can only watch from the sidelines.  In all, No Room For Error is a fast read/listen and quite interesting.  
 I checked out the movie from my local county library and really liked it. Then I tried to purchase it from Amazon and it was only available from Canada. The cost of the shipping was as much as the movie so I cancelled the order 
 An exuberent principal at a small school is the crucial element of this hilarious book.  The principal, in awe of the schools "fine-fineness" decides to have school on Saturdays..then on Sundays as well.  Soon there is school on all holidays, vacations and breaks.  School hours are extended, lunchtimes/recess is shortened. But the students have no time to spend with family.  What will they do? With hilarious illustrations, and a humorous plot, this book yields to deep belly laughs by both kids and adults.  If you have a child between the ages of 6 and 16, I strongly reccomend that this book be on your shelves.  It reminds you that it could ALWAYS get worse 
 The music is always wonderful, and the dancing in this timeless tale is truly professional.  My students, ages Kindergarten and up, ask to see this every year 
 Weinberg ties together disparate strings of cause, effect, strategy, and happenstance, to weave a highly readable history of the Second World War that encompasses all of the theaters involved.  While some detail may be sacrificed in the effort, no other book I have read does such a good job of relating how success or failure in one part of the world resounded in other areas affected by the conflict. Places and events that are often ignored in other histories receive their rightful recognition here.  Highly recommended.  
 My god!, after listening intentley to this album for a week...I finally understood what the words "rock and roll" meant. It was one of the most joyous times in my musical carreer, as if I had seen the light. I know this seems a bit over-board but it is the truth. The Jesus Lizard (an off shoot of the previous band Scratch Acid with ties to Steve albini of Big Black) has given us excitment, nervous elightenment, courage, glimpses of the insane, and sorrow for the weak of heart. Percussion and bass that truely hold it down and give it all movement and anchor. Big bass lines everywhere and drums that smack you upside the head. Heavy in the truest sense. Guitar work that defines intense, rockin', grandure. If you want to understand tone, it is here. And the vocals...this is what pushing yourself and suffering for what you love sounds like. When you think it's too much you come to realize that it is just the beginning...this album seriously made me reconsider just about everything I thought about rock music period. You can start here, find your way to some Scratch Acid, Big Black, Rapeman, and through to Shellac 
 an enthusiastic scholar somehow creates new life; this awful creation, though, only serves to haunt him as he attempts to escape its reach.  he flees to england, to switzerland and finally flies to the north pole, only to meet the crew of an adventure-bound ship and recount his chilling tale. mary shelley's incredible work here is outside any 'mainstream' conception of 'frankenstein'.  there are no dark castles, no mobs advancing on said castles with flaming torches, no crazy inventors, no unthinking monsters with plugs in their necks.  instead there is a young scientist whom the reader has no choice but to sympathise with.  a 'monster' who makes no monstrous demands.  whilst shelley's main character may seem a touch too chatty at times, this work is an intriguing tale of the urge to create and the urges of creation.  this edition has short appendices covering the stay in geneva that prompted mary shelley to write 'frankenstein', and concise notes on the text 
 The dust jacket quotes the Denver Post: "Doss does for the Utes what Tony Hillerman has done for the Navajo [sic]."  Well, not quite.  I enjoyed reading "White Shell Woman," and look forward to reading other Charlie Moon Mysteries, but not quite as eagerly as I look forward to the next Tony Hillerman book.  But who knows? Maybe some day Doss will equal or even surpass Hillerman.  I hope he does.  After all, there are never too many excellent writers, and James Doss shows promise of better things to come 
 this book was very thourgh in the area of trail technical difficulty, however the directions to the various trails can be a little confusing. Overall this book can take you to some spectacular riding areas and put you in touch with those that can lead you to more trails 
 I enjoy all of Ms. Stein's books. They are written in easy to understand language and are great as reference resources. This book is no exception. It takes some of her previous work and puts it together into a comprehensive package you can turn to time and again. Not sure why anyone would mind the references to Wicca. I realize that people write from what they know. Interestingly, we don't knock Deepak or Wayne Dyer for this, but we are put off when it is coming from an even less mainstream faith. I also find it amusing when people put reviws on sites such as this knocking this author for using "she" instead of "he" and referring to women as students, seekers, etc. instead of men. It is so telling to me just how brainwashed we are in this society to see things from the male perspective. Does anyone ever stop to think why this makes us uncomfortable - even WOMEN? I think Stein does this for a reason. (And I don't think it has anything to do with hating men!) Look inside yourself. Perhaps it's time to take the blinders off regarding the patriarchy that still permeates our world and the inequality which exists even inside ourselves. I look forward to Ms. Stein's next work. Wonderful stuff, as always 
 Aa fight for the lost dream or a better self. Deeply moving 
 After three studio albums,Peter Yarrow,Noel Paul Stookey and Mary Travers decided to record some of their live performances. We start with Bob Dylan's THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN',one of his highly covered tunes. Billy Joel even recorded it live. A-SOALIN' from MOVING,is about Halloween,according to Stookey. 500 MILES is from PP&M's 1962 self-titled debut. The version on this album would later appear on THE BEST OF PETER,PAUL & MARY-TEN YEARS TOGETHER. BLUE,I think would later inspire the Nick Jr. cartoon. THREE RAVENS and ONE KIND FAVOR are OK. PUFF THE MAGIC DRAGON,from MOVING,is a popular childrens' song. Forty years after the release of this album,the song would remain popular with generations that followed. CAR CAR and JESUS MET THE WOMAN are OK also. There's also another popular Dylan composition,BLOWIN' IN THE WIND,from 1963's IN THE WIND. That song asks nine questions,as mentioned by Yarrow. LE DESERTEUR is sung in French by Yarrow. Following that is ROCK MY SOUL. Again,Yarrow takes the lead vocal,this time asking the audience to join him. PAULTALK,a non-musical track where Stookey,who's a comedian as well as a musician,does bits about swimming,golf,cars and drive-in theaters. Stookey's comedy is a lot like Bill Cosby's(Cosby is PP&M's Warner Bros. Records labelmate). Travers takes the lead again for SINGLE GIRL(naturally,she would for that song). THERE IS A SHIP is cool. Also from the PP&M debut is IT'S RAINING,IF I HAD MY WAY and IF I HAD A HAMMER. I'm surprised Stookey never did any full comedy albums. There is a similar track on 1965's A SONG WILL RISE entitled TALKIN' CANDY BAR BLUES which Stookey's spoken vocal is heard 
 Definitely a must-buy for anyone delving into the craft of loom knitting, and it even has something for the more experienced knitter, as well.  This book covers all the bases.  In a market where loom books are scarce, this is your bible.  Worth every cent. 
 Perhaps this album was issued as a means of overcoming the rather disastrous "David Live" from a few years earlier, or perhaps Bowie just felt it was once again time to document his live show. Either way, Stage adequately represents Bowie's multi-faceted career without sounding excessive, forced or extraneous. Full of incredible musicianship and focused in a manner that defined Bowie's character at the time, it rights everything that was wrong with David Live. It is also perhaps one of the most schizophrenic live albums ever made, since Bowie skims from various stages of his career without any attempt to conjoin his multiple phases of fashion.  Ziggy Stardust kicks off the album as if he were an independent opening act. The entire first side of Stage consists of excellent versions from the Ziggy Stardust album, performed faithfully to the originals despite the absence of the original Spiders from Mars (Mick Ronson, et. al.). From there, Bowie leaps headlong into his `Los Angeles/Berlin'-era music. The next-oldest song on this collection is "Fame". Otherwise, the show features highlights from Bowie's previous three albums, all of which were excellent studio efforts, but which left the apparent impression that they would not be capable of making a transition to the stage. Stage disproves that theory handily, with live, atmospheric versions of a few of his most enigmatic instrumental works serving as set-up pieces for "'Heroes'," "Blackout" and "Beauty and the Beast." Since it contains nothing new, Stage can hardly be considered essential listening, but it is a rather extraordinary live document that will not disappoint fans of Bowie, particularly those who recognize the late seventies/early eighties as one of his most creative phases.

 Exodus is a pivotal book, a key volume not only in the Pentateuch but in the whole of the Hebrew bible. And Douglas Stuart is a first rate evangelical Old Testament scholar (who has already penned commentaries on Ezekiel and some of the Minor Prophets). Put the two together and you have an important and powerful combination.  There have been a number of good commentaries on the book of Exodus. Many consider the 1974 volume by Brevard Childs (Old Testament Library) to be the best written, albeit by a non-evangelical. Good volumes of a somewhat more conservative and evangelical variety have been penned by Enns (NIV Application Commentary, 2000) and Durham (Word Biblical Commentary, 1987). But this is the newest and perhaps best treatment of the book. Part of the New American Commentary series, this just released volume will long serve as the first port of call for evangelical assessments of this important Old Testament book.  Good commentaries offer a balance of two things: the technical, grammatical, cultural and other background material, along with sound theological analysis. Both exegesis and exposition are required. This volume fulfils both requirements nicely.  Stuart has clearly done his homework. (He says he consulted over 1700 items, not all of which are featured in the bibliography.) He is up on all the relevant literature, and is aware of the current debates. He also writes well, and is able to provide the theological sense of the book, and individuals passages throughout.   Given the constraints of the series, his introductory remarks do not occupy much space (only 50 pages out of an 800 page work). But more detailed discussions of important points are scattered throughout the commentary. Thus a number of excurses into various disputed issues, difficult topics, or theological hot potatoes are interspersed in these pages. Surprisingly however one such item, the Divine name YHWH as revealed in Exodus 3:14, receives no separate excursus, but just a half page discussion (along with a half page footnote, leading the reader to further study).  While acknowledging that extra-biblical evidence for Exodus is thin, he is more optimistic than writers like Durham about the book's historicity. He also ascribes Mosaic authorship to the book.  His thematic approach to this book is to highlight the servant theme: Israel's' exodus from Egyptian servitude is replaced by servitude to Yahweh. The transition from being servants of a bad king to being servants of a good king is the overriding motif of the book, although Stuart lists eight other key themes, including the necessity of law, the promised land, and covenant relationship.  The commentary itself is a nice blend of giving the sense of the text along with the various technical considerations that need to be addressed. More scholarly discussion is reserved for the footnotes, which are plenteous and lengthy. Thus the main body of the text can be easily followed, but the numerous excurses and footnotes take the reader to more advanced levels, when deeper considerations are called for.  All in all this is a very fine commentary indeed, which should serve both student and scholar for many years to come 
 Once upon a time there were some very interesting movies made. This was during the 1980s. Some directors had some interesting ideas about showing how high school can have quirky moments and be educational sometimes but also give life lessons that will help down the road. Even the teachers have political viewpoints, not just parents. Maybe not anymore. After all that wouldn't be politically correct any more to talk about that in class.     I feel sorry for students today, so many things are not allowed I don't know how they can learn anything about life and having a personality. Well back to this movie. It is Jon Cryer's best from all his movies that I have seen. Funny and suspenseful with some love thrown in for romantics. Cryer is a stock broker, Andrew Morenski, that finds himself on the run from hitmen. He hides out with a nephew and finds that being high school student, Max Hauser, is a good cover. Cryer is excellent and the rest the supporting cast are great as well. Any fan of movies like "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" and "The Breakfast Club" will probably love it 
 Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is a great novel, but not at all comparable to War and Peace. Firstly, I think he should have gone with the original title: Two Marriages; because the book really has two main characters, that of Anna Karenina and Levin. The last book seemed unnecessary to me, book eight, in which Tolstoy explores death once again through his characters, as he was indubitably obsessed with mortality. I didn't think it entirely appropriate, and I've read much of his opinion on death in War and Peace and Ivan Ilyich already, so the ending did not seem fitting for the masterpiece that it was. Also, this version of the classic is abundant with spelling mistakes, typos that, though they can be overlooked, are somewhat irritating after a while. They are simple typos, and one wonders how the editors missed them. I wouldn't recommend this particular version if you want to read Anna Karenina and appreciate it to its full effect. Lastly, of course, I want to praise Tolstoy for his amazing writing style, which is much easier to read, I think, than War and Peace in this novel. Such scenes as the mowing scene with Levin and Anna's stream of consciousness when she is in utter turmoil at the end of the novel in book seven are inspiring. I also liked the scene in which Levin's brother lies in a hotel on the brink of death for days 
 Boyz II Men burst onto the scene with their classic disc Cooleyhighharmony. This is the expanded verison of the 1991 oringial disc and it throws in a couple of remix and soundtrack songs. Boyz II Men were pushed into super stardom with the song End Of The Road from the Boomerang soundtrack which is also included here in a spainsh verison.  All of the ballads from the orignal disc sound good including Lonely Heart, This Is My Heart and my personal favorites Please Don't Go and Uhh Ahh. Uhh Ahh is also inlcuded in it's remix version which is even more of a seductive groove than the oringial 
 The American Renaissance 1850-1855 was the time in which American Literature truly came into greatness. Melville( Moby Dick 1851) Whitman ( Leaves of Grass 1855) Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne. Matthiessen identifies the phenomenom understands that this is the real birth- note of American literature not simply as an insular provincial form but as a world- waking work. He writes with great understanding of the works themselves.  It has been many years since I read this work in graduate- school but I have no doubt it holds up , despite the waves of various critical schools that have tried to undermine its authority.  It is as literary criticism a great work which identifies and interprets great creative works.  It is an essential item in the American library , and a real help to anyone who wants to understand one of the great moments in the history of world- literature. 
 Hands-down, the best part of this collection are the liner notes.  They provide a rare insight into the band and the personalities.  The music is a fantastic smorgasbord of the early years on ZTT.  Those unfamiliar with The Art of Noise will probably be much better suited by acquiring one of the "The Best of the Art of Noise" collections.  Disc 4 (Into Battle, That Was Close, The Tortoise & the Hair, Besides Close) is possibly the highlight of the collection.  While completists would have most of these tracks, gems such as Love Beat are a treat.  The other discs are still excellent - you can see the seeds for what would become their later released versions - but there is little expansion into new sonic realms here.  While this project seems much better polished than "Bashful" (an Internet-only collection of early/unreleased tracks that was put out in 2000 - and where some of these tracks have appeared before), it lacks the variety and newness found in that release.  It is a shame that this is a label-bound project.  Art of Noise is a magnificent band, and a collection including such B-sides as Instruments of Lightness, Who's Afraid (of Scale), Hoops and Mallets, In the Mood (a cover of the Andrews Sister cover on the bootleg "On the Road to Tokyo"), Why Me?, and the Dreaming remix series could help make a smashingly great set.  There's a wealth of great material available, and this indepth collection sadly barely scratches the surface 
 This is a very gripping, interesting story.  I would especially recommend it to "Phantom" fans who would like to learn the background of the characters 
 Like Byatt's previous collections, this book is a well-written quick read with gorgeous visual imagery. Its focus is how characters negotiate extremes--of emotion, of circumstance, of temperature and more. But for a book subtitled "Stories of Fire and Ice" there is very little passion; and I felt little emotional engagement. The writing is exquisite, but the emotional life of the characters is not fully realized 
 I have to confess to not having read this book in over 30 years, when I was young and easily impressed, but it's a book I've never forgotten. It may have been the source of my own wanderlust (satisfied, fortunately, by the US Army).  Gypsies are universally scorned, often by people who never even met one. Reading this book taught me more than about Gypsies, but also the need to keep an open mind in the face of uninformed prejudices. (As if a Jew wouldn't know that.)  It doesn't hurt that the author was also a gifted writer. This book is a delightful read from first page to last.  [May 2005: Have discovered another, maybe better, book on Gypsies: BURY ME STANDING, by Isabel Fonseca. Less romantic, more factual, more pieces of the puzzle filled in.]  
 This cool book has really nice pictures, and is very informtive. Very cool 
 This was perhaps the best book I have read, aside from the Word of God!  It's accurate biblical references and the predictions made when the book was written, WHICH HAVE NOW COME TO PASS, tell me that it is truthful and to be prayerfully considered 
 This is an excellent presention of EFT for couple therapy. The theoretical underpinnings are presented in a way that does not detract from the aim of the book to help one learn how this work is done.  There are lots of clear examples and explanations that give one the feeling they are ready to apply what they have learned in their next session.  Written in a clear style free of jargon 
 I never was required to read this book in school and only picked it up 20 years later at the continued insistance of a friend.  I hesitated to read it, not thinking I would like it, and to my surprise I loved the book.  Not only is it a great read but Harper Lee is a masterful storyteller whose prose and craft are exceptional.  I think I may need to reread it in the future 
 When I was a child in the early '60s, Captain Kangaroo (remember him?) would read different books on his TV program. That was my introduction to Caps For Sale. I thought I'd come across the NEXT GREAT BOOK, not knowing that it was already over twenty years old when I'd heard it. Back then, I'd always marvelled at how the monkeys stole every cap EXCEPT the peddler's own checkered one. Now my little four year old genius asks the same question, except it's more in the line of: "Mom, didn't the monkeys like the checked cap?" Or, "Mom, how did they have enough monkeys for all the caps except the checked one?" I am amazed at the concepts this story can bring about. Counting (the caps in each group), sorting (the caps by color), how 'simple' the monkeys were ("Mom, didn't they know that the caps would fall?"). And here I thought it was just the NEXT GREAT BOOK (at least, in my six year old mind). Having my kids gave me the perfect 'excuse' to have this book as an adult ;- 
 The little diva in your life will love Fancy Nancy! I bought her as an alternative to all the Corporate Princess stuff out there and my 4-year-old niece adore her! Well writeen children's books with great art are treasures. Snap this one up for your favorite fancy gal today 
 This a beautiful consolation of a book, yet with a kind of energy.  Uplifting and calming:  stunning colour pictures of cats accompanied by  "soundbites" of quotes from poets, philosophers, etc.  It leans towards Zen, although other shades of belief are represented too.  A great gift for yourself or for friends, family, and associates 
 Important literature that tells of post emancipation United States and the problem of the color line. Perspective amazing. 
 I would have given this book 3.5 stars, but since that wasn't an option, I went ahead and bumped it up to 4. I believe I'm correct in saying that this is Olive Etchells' first mystery book (though she has written other novels), and it's not a bad effort at all.  The story starts out by introducing us to the Baxters, a family consisting of Sally, Robert and their three children. They've recently moved to village in Cornwall and Ben, the youngest son, soon discovers the body of a 17-year-old girl on his favorite beach. The oldest son, Luke, immediately comes under suspicion, since he was the last one to see the girl alive, but before long the whole family becomes involved, one way or another, with the murder.  DCI Channon, a quiet and kind officer, heads the case with his abrasive assistant, Sergeant Bowles, and the two soon discover that there is much more to the case than they initially expected.  The writing in this novel was solid, though I found some of the dialogue, especially Sally's "internal dialogue," to be a bit awkward. One of the major problems I had with this book is that I just didn't like the characters all the much (with the exception of DCI Channon). Having said that, however, I would most likely pick up another mystery by Etchells, should she decide to write more of them. 
 Having only ever heard the name edgar cayce, and not knowing, what person it belonged to, I was intrigued to find out with this mystical name was all about.  I was led on a journey I did not expect to take. It helped open my eyes to the interconnectedness of everything.  One major thing I liked about this book, is it's not written in a way that sounds like hokey spiritual, better your life crud....IT's written in a way that is almost scientific.  The constant relation to the concious, subconcious, and the superconcious, allow you to contstruct relationships in your mind about everything this book goes into.  Well written, easy to read, and a great start at understanding the metaphysical...I highly recommend for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the metaphysical or spiritual realm, but has no idea where to start.  This will give you the background KNOWLEDGE-not experiance-to continue discovering all there is out there 
 The Cask of Amontillado is full of verbal, situational, and dramatic  irony.It is wonderfully written, and is one of Poe's best short stories.  Poe encorperates his fear of being buried alive into this chilling tale 
  Flush by Carl Hiaasen does not disappoint! Who knew that a story about raw sewage would rate five stars! Hiaasen's Flush does just that! Noah and his sister Abby acquire some strange cohorts along the way as they try to keep their family from going down the drain! Sorry, but I just couldn't resist that pun! Their father's action in sinking a floating casino leads them on a quest to not only help their father but to save the environment. Along the way you will see how setbacks will sometimes end up as a success while their successes often end up having unwanted consequences! This was a Christmas present for our oldest granddaughter.  She loved it! Carl Hiaasen is a terrific author. His writing has made us laugh out loud numerous times. While this was written as a children's book, it was just as enjoyable for me to read as those geared to adults 
 Training is synthetic experience.  This fake experience is valuable because greater feedback is possible, telling me exactly what happened in the clinical training session.  This "play " is inexpensive compared to the real thing-nobody is supposed to really die or become crippled, and the safety rules prevent criminal and civil charges when followed.  Training is great stuff because training can focus in on a specific aspect of life, an aspect that happens too rarely to otherwise gain enough real-world experience, such as exchanging gunfire with an armed opponent, and the trainee can experience handling this situation successfully.  Training is great-but it is phony!   Ralph Mroz points this out in different words.  His "Defensive Shooting for Real-Life Encounters" is not a recipe book of handgun techniques, but a yardstick to measure a training program.  This book may go over the head of the casual shooter, someone who is seeking only the minimum training required for professional certification (a majority of our professional police) and most of the private citizens who carry concealed handguns for self-protection.  These casual shooters' needs don't include self-criticism and introspection-they have a specific goal and just want a cheap, simple way to reach the goal.  Mroz is also certain to alienate many because he reminds us that not only is training NOT "real-life," but that it cannot be.  As many gun people have invested thousands of dollars and years gaining measurable skills that they can perform upon demand-on a structured shooting range-being told that their skills are not always the right answer is going to hurt their feelings.  Mroz states that most self-defense shootings happen at hand-to-hand combat distances; on page 63 he wrote that 54% of gunfights happen at 5 feet or less and 74% happen at less than 10 feet.  Then he turns around and states in the footnote that some of the shooting data is based upon self-reports and may not be entirely truthful or accurate.  For the serious (obsessed?) student of the gun, "Defensive Shooting for Real-Life Encounters" is a gold mine.  Miners know that a lot of gravel has to be moved to get a handful of nuggets.  This book's information can't really be used directly as a training blueprint or a performance yardstick.  The 74% of gunfights at 10 feet or less figure I quoted above doesn't take into account the dynamics of a lethal force encounter-that the participants don't just stand at a set distance from each other, but they move, sometimes several miles at high speeds.  Ever hear of a freeway shootout between two speeding cars?  Mroz writes of gun-FIGHTING rather than shooting because often, at these close distances, the defender has no chance to use his gun and has to rely on running or empty-hand techniques to create enough space.  Mroz doesn't call the skills imparted by intense competitive shooting useless.  Instead, he points out that the performance envelope for those skilled at these games is limited and that real-life lethal-force encounters take place outside of this envelope.  Here's and example: virtually no shooting schools permit their student shooters to shoot at moving targets or targets closer than 9 feet-in real-life encounters, most "targets" move (and move AT the shooter with deadly intent, else shooting isn't justified) and there's that 74% of shooting incidents taking place at less than 10 feet figure again.  On Page 51, the chapter that includes point shooting is worth the price of the book.  I was introduced to point shooting by Rex Applegate's "Kill or Get Killed" and I learned to shoot by using a cheap BB gun.  When I read the controversy about point shooting versus "aimed fire," I was mildly amused.  Mroz not only settles the issue (use both, depending upon the situation), but he details the strengths and weaknesses of both, discusses the psychological and physiological factors involved, and then in his examination of police departments who successfully use point shooting instruction to better their street shooting results, reveals the real secret of success: lots of realistic practice.  If you train to a performance standard that is related to real-world incidents, you are better prepared for those incidents.  Mroz covers subjects including shoes and eyeglasses.  How much detail can you get from 148 pages, anyway?  This book is a primer on THINKING.  One thing which can upset readers is that many of us buy a book to get the answer to questions such as "what is the meaning of life?"  Since real life isn't a fully-instrumented laboratory, there are going to be a lot of unknowns.  If you don't know the questions, how are you going to find the answers?  "Defensive Shooting for Real-Life Encounters" is a series of questions that I'm going to use to re-examine my own training programs.  Besides, in my case Mroz validated much of what I've been doing for years.  For example, due to safety concerns and feedback issues I use Air Soft "toy guns" for close-quarter shooting exercises.  I also insist upon referees for force-on-force training, and when I can, I videotape training.  The street does have video cameras (remember Rodney King?), but referees only intervene afterwards-in the courtroom.  In training, the referee is there for safety (training is synthetic experience) and to provide performance feedback.  Still, nobody's perfect! 
 In this album ,Paul WELLER showed how deep  he loved  SOUL MUSIC.Many British artsts show their enthsusiasm for BLACK MUSIC.This trend was apparent in the 80s,say CULTURE CLUB,ABC,etc....  PAUL WELLER still had  a radical attitude,that is THE MODS WAY OF LIFE.The beat is still aggressive and the vice is sweet,and gentle.I think this album is a MODS STYLE with a touch of SOUL.Also,this album proves that many British musicians show respect to the SOUL MUSIC 
 I got the back pack in time... but I selected the wrong color so I shipped it back and got my money back... no problem there either 
 I read Pamela Redmond Satran's "Babes in Captivity," and enjoyed it, but I thought this was even better. For one thing, the plot was much tighter, and filled with fun twists and surprises.  This is the story of Alice Green, a dowdy, 44-year-old housewife in  suburban Homewood, New Jersey. Alice has always looked young for her age, though she hasn't bothered with her appearance for a long time. She's married to a dentist, who leaves her for his hygienist. Then Alice's daughter leaves for Africa, leaving Alice alone.  In the year following her husband's departure, Alice whips herself into shape by working out for a couple of hours a day. When she tries to re-enter the workforce, she is less successful. She tries to get a job at the publishing house where she worked before she had a child, but they dismiss her as dried-up and middle-aged.   After Alice tells a gypsy that she wants to be "younger," Alice's best friend gives her a makeover. With her gray hair dyed blonde and her newly fit body on display in tighter, more fashionable clothes, Alice decides to give the work thing another try. She returns to Gentility after taking all the dates off her resume and omitting the years she spent as a stay-at-home mom. She also goes to a bar and meets a young man named Josh.  What makes the novel work is not only the riveting plot, but Satran's careful look at the ups and downs of being young and old. She doesn't portray youth as a perfect haven, but instead shows how the "young" Alice must deal with an overbearing boss who doesn't take her seriously. She shows the pressure that the young women at the publishing company feel to get married and have kids before they're 35.   Alice's relationship with Josh is a little less plausible. After he sees her naked, he still thinks she's 29, and can't tell that she had a kid! It's hard to believe that after having a child she wouldn't have stretch marks or something.   However, Satran follows Alice's deception mostly smoothly from beginning to end, and it makes for very engaging reading. 
 If you're looking for a legal thriller, "Bleachers", neither legal nor thriller, is certainly not the drink for which you thirst! In a quiet, pastoral yet moving style of writing which he was to re-use to incredible effect in "The Last Juror", Grisham has treated his audience to a powerful, evocative novella that paints a portrait of the final years of the century in Messina, a small town in deep south USA.  The story opens, develops and closes with Neely Crenshaw, the all-American quarterback who led his 1987 Messina Spartans high school team to an undefeated season, reminiscing about the life of coach Eddie Rake, who drove his players and teams mercilessly to an unrivalled win-loss record. Much of the team joins Crenshaw - Silo Mooney, the bad boy nose tackle who revelled in hurting his opponents; Nat Sawyer, the weak link in the team; Paul Curry, Crenshaw's best friend in high school; Mal Brown, now the town sheriff - as they wait for the symbolic dimming of Rake Field's lights to signal the coach's death, relive their glory days, replay the miraculous championship game of the 1987 season and struggle with their decision as to whether they love or hate the coach's memory and the effect he had on all of their lives.  I'll admit it ... this sounds like the stuff of one spectacularly boring novel and yet, somehow, even when it is read only on the surface as a tale of small town Americana, Grisham has succeeded in telling a warm, moving tale that I found every bit as compelling as the best of his thrillers. But, perhaps even more important, Grisham has provided the fodder for hours of controversial discussion on the best and worst of amateur and professional sports in North America! The worst - the win-at-all-costs attitude; the adulation and elevation of sports heroes and celebrities to an extent far beyond any real conceivable value in this world; the punishing, physical destruction of the bodies of young people as we force them to compete in contact sports up to our unrealistic expectations; and groupies willing to sacrifice their bodies on the altar of unthinking hero worship! And the best - the colour blindness of physical achievement in sport; the translation of the drive and mental discipline of sport into other life endeavours; the camaraderie and the synergy of a team willing to sacrifice individual performance for team success!  And Crenshaw's conversation with the Cameron Lane, the "good girl" he tossed over for Screamer, the leggy, short-skirted blonde floozy who was all too willing to roll over for the team quarterback, was so sticky sweet but, damn, it was good!  What an enjoyable read! And all over in the too short space of only a couple of hours!  Paul Weis 
 Rather than attempting to explain how snow is made, this book discusses the good and bad things about snow. For instance, snow protects plants and animals from harsh winds and can keep things warm. However, snow can also bury food for animals and cause floods in the spring. This book is fairly easy for pre-schoolers to understand though there are a few difficult words they have trouble understanding at first (thermometer and temperature). The illustrations that accompany the text are colorful, yet not overpowering. A great science book to use for preschoolers when talking about winter 
 this movie is a laughable , u could see it many times. really funn 
 I've dealt with all other kinds of pocket notebooks, all of which fold, deform, get pages easily folded over and ripped out and stained. The Moleskine is an elegant little solution that protects itself with a thin, unobtrusive cover and a small elastic strap which has avoided every other problem that's plagued previous notebooks.  I also like the price

One of Stephen King's ABSOLUTE BEST ! A Ripping Tour-De Force ! I can't recommend it Enough !  
 I got this book when my son was 2 months old. I find this book very helpful, especially for first time moms. The book is very clear, it tells you when to start your baby on solids, how much to give and how to prepare it, and much more 
 No actor could portray Jim Rockford as well as does James Garner.  Mr. Garner lends humor, finesse, and skill to a man who states, "There are two things i won't do for money.  I won't kill for money; I won't marry for money.  Everything else is open to negotiation."   Excellent entertainment 
 I have been into behavioral optometry and natural vision therapy for the last 6 months or so and I have found this book to be excellent in explaining the causitive nature and subsequent corrective techniques for the various eye disorders. I am myopic and have been wearing glasses since I was 14. After 6 months of eye exercises and relaxation techniques I have reduced my prescription by 5 dioptors (from -4.50 to -3.25). I still have a ways to go but this is exhilerating because there is hope that I need not be a visual cripple the rest of my life. For those people that want to rid themselves of their eye crutches, this book is an excellent tool in helping achieve that goal 
 Early Motorcycles: Construction, Operation and Repair was first published in the 1920s, when thousands of motorcycles were already in use. Author Victor Page himself was an early transportation pioneer: his background lends to a lively survey of motorcycles, from engines, lubrication and materials to gear types and standard equipment. It's hard to believe EARLY MOTORCYCLES first appeared in 1924 - and that the instructions on operation and repair remain as relevant today as it did when it was first published. 
   This book is really great.  At first, I put off reading it because of the title and the bright blue and yellow cover. I'd read other similar titles and didn't feel like I got much out of them, or they presented lengthy exercises and didn't offer much real-life advice.   I just thought it might be too much psycho bable for me, but I was soon presently suprised when I actually began reading Stephen Pollan's book.   This book is really amazing.  It offers information anyone can understand and adapt in their daily life.  Yeah, there is no ONE thing to make your life 100% better in one split second, but did you really think any similar books or this book would offer some magical tip to instantly make your life better??  If they did, it certainly would be short-lived.  Instead, this book offers real life tips, amazing quotes, and actual representations of how you can put these thoughts and activities into action.      The quotes throughout the pages are probably worth the price of the book itself.  I love all of them, and am planning to go back through and select a couple for other uses.     This book is really great though.  I've read several other titles, and none were so straight forward, easy to understand, and easily applied as the techniques and ideas in this book.  I think many people would be able to benefit this book whether you are unhappy in your life or if you've just hit a snag working towards the goals in your life.  This book will inspire you, put you back on track, and show you how to find the happiness that was already inside of you to begin with.  Definitely a good read!  It's also really up-tp-date with information as of 2006. 
 A wonderfully thoughtful and comprehensive book.  This one goes beyond the usual healthcare descriptions and pictures of breeds that fill the pages of most such books.  The most compelling part is the research presented into a kitten's early environment and the effects on its future personality. Great insight into cat behavior for breeders and cat lovers alike. 
 I wanted to set a timer for certain events. This does exactly what I want very well, at a very fair price. After reading the reviews, I had expected it to gain or lose minutes each day, which would be ok with me, but have had it for a month or so and it keeps the correct time. Pleasant design, works fine, I am pleased 
 this is a very funny CD.  When I heard the joke about the two starbucks across the street from each other I crapped my pants, because I live around the corner from the end of the universe(the 2 starbucks).  I have been to both starbucks and have always wondered why there were two of them, now I know 
 My kids 4 and 6 both love this, I bought it for my 4 year olds birthday.  I really liked the fact that it folded flat and was easy to store, however, my husband and I have yet to figure that out!  
 Joy Writing: Discover And Develop Your Creative Voice by published author Kenn Amdahl is an expertly presented introductory guide to the artful approaches to creative writing. Covering the major aspects of the writing process, Joy Writing begins with the fundamental question of "Why Writer?" and then presents five major sections in methodical order: "Before You Write"; "Beginning to Write"; "Thinking about Language"; "The Overall Flow of any Work: and "Improving". For its outstanding perspective, interpretation, and quite stimulating presentation, Joy Writing is very strongly recommended and "user friendly" reading for both novice and seasoned writers alike, but most particularly those aspiring writers struggling with expressing or developing their own distinctively artistic and creative style. 
 We have followed this Jet Lag diet for about 5 years now. We combine it with the NO-Jet Lag homeopathic remedy. We never have more than one day of slight jet lag. Interestingly, the airlines seem to use the jet lag diet strategy in the meals they serve on the plane--at least in business class 
 This is a beautiful book with both excellent photographs and good thoughts. It is proof that simple things can be a means of conveying great ideas. Well done and highly recommended to teach values to children 
 A book dealing comprehensively with discontinuous asset prices has long been overdue. This is a first attempt to fill the gap in a manner both rigorous and accessible. The reason why it has taken so long for a book of this kind to appear is that price jumps give rise to a host of issues that are simply not present in continuous models such as Black-Scholes. The authors tackle most of them admirably. The book also contains valuable comprehensive bibliography.  Every pioneer can make a mistake. The authors do not shy away from very complicated questions, such as (locally) optimal hedging in the presence of jumps. I'm afraid they haven't done their homework properly in this case. They claim on page 339 "the minimal martingale measure preserves orthogonality", which happens to be true for continuous price processes but it is false in most models with jumps. Pages 340 and 341 go on to compute the locally risk minimizing hedging coefficients based on the false premise. I hope this can be fixed in the next edition. 
 Dan Simmons has written a masterfull work.  I have marked down four stars when I really give it 4 1/2.  This is wonderfull to read.  Simmons also writes an anecdote to each story about the story or his connection to writing the story.  In his anecdotes, you find that he loves where he lives and loves the annual neighborhood get togethers.  He also loves writing, but not necessarily the business of writing.  Taken together, they add a nice depth to his writing and gives you a greater appreciation to his stories.  There are five here and not one of them is a dud.  He returns to Hyperion in one of the stories and the reader would enjoy the story more if they had read the series, but the story still stands on its own legs.  He also writes about mountain climbing with aliens and the brotherhood that develops with such an activity whether you are human or not.  The "End of Gravity" is about an American writer going to Russia to look at their space accompishments.  The "Ninth of Av" is about Jewish decendents going through another dark period of history.  If you are new to Dan Simmons, then this is a good book to start with becasue you get a wide variety of his style and abilities.  Highly Recommended 
 This book was stunning - I was enraptured with the writing and loved the story. So many emotions in one book. Looking forward to reading more from this author 
 This CD was great. You can play the whole thing straight through without having to skip any songs. Nowadays that rarely is the case.   I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes quality music. It is great for a night of intimacy with your favorite woman

 Dr. Kovacich has updated one of the classic management works for the people who are responsible for the overal design, development and delivery of a comprehensive, enterprise-wide protection program.  There are lots of books out there that will assist those who have technical responsibilities for security in doing a better job.  There are very few that help develop the manager's who must harmonize people, processes and technology to address the rapidly increasing range of risks that can impact organizations that are all becoming ever more dependent on information technology to accomplish their objectives.  If you are now or aspire to be a manager or director of information security for an organization this is an essential guidebook that will advise and assist you in meeting the challenges inherent in that role 
 Ira Glass is my all-time favorite media personality and I consider myself quite fortunate to be in a part of the country where I can hear his weekly radio broadcast.  Listening to him gives me a glimpse of what life must have been like before the Idiot Box was ever invented.  The stories are all thougtful, interesting, passionate, and absolutely the best.  For an hour each weekend, I laugh, I cry, and I remain glued to my radio.  Now all we need is a follow-up to this anthology.  Thank you Ira & NPR.  Please keep up the great work 
 This is another tape I wore out back in the day. Why can't they make rap this good these days 
 Robert Parker has a certain love for ironic plots.  Bad Business, with its cluster of detectives following various spouses to determine who is cheating whom, is full of irony and misdirection.  Spenser is hired by the wife of one executive to follow her husbands who seems to have hired another detective to...  Well, you get the idea - open marriages gone psychotic.  Or so it would seem.  But when murder begins to become a part of the shenanigans Spenser realizes that something more important is at stake in a story that picks up on the Enron scandals and then stands loyalty and faithfulness on its head.  Kinergy has its own variations on corporate corruption, and layered on top of this is a talk show host who wants to maximize bed sharing.  Of course, Susan Silverman, Pearl the Wonder Dog II, and Hawk put in regular appearances so that us Spenser junkies will get our filp of flip and sarcastic dialog.  After all, it is Parker's wizardry with dialog that keeps us coming back.  Even if the story is a bit frail, the players make up for it time and again.  Spenser is the last true knight of Boston.  He still compulsively comes to the rescue and can't stand to see a woman cry.  The times change in these novels, but the main characters remain stable and attractive as if they lived in a time line all there own.  And frankly, I can never resist them.  My one complaint with any Spenser novel is that it is too short.  Parker's writing ability draws the reader through the book at lightning speed, and it's all too easy to finish them in one or two sittings.  On the other hand, they never cloy, and are often just the right length to refresh one after reading too many serious stories 
 There's no getting around it. Paul Simon is one of the greatest pop music songwriters of the 20th century. I've been listening to his solo albums in chronological order, and the work is fantastic up through the underrated One Trick Pony (which has always been a favorite of mine). I have no complaint until we get to Hearts and Bones. I think I'm more critical of it now than when it was released. The strong material is as good as anything Simon ever wrote. The weak material seems much weaker to me in retrospect.  It is easy to skip the lesser tracks, and consider Hearts and Bones a fantastic EP. Allergies, Hearts and Bones, Train in the Distance, Rene and Georgette Magritte, and The Late Great Johnny Ace are the ones to treasure. Simon displays his talent for melody, complex and interesting chord structures, and sublime lyrics. A tour-de-force of pop songwriting.   The rest is listenable, but well below the high standard Paul usually sets, and most of the time I skip the other tracks. Cars Are Cars is just silly. (Simon contributes vocals to Art Garfunkel's album Scissors Cut on a beautiful song titled In Cars, but I think that one was written by Jimmy Webb.) Maybe I Think Too Much is probably a true reflection of Mr. Simon, but the two versions of this tune aren't that much fun. Song About the Moon lopes along amiably enough, but a song about writing a song is a tricky thing, like a movie about making a movie. I don't find the song that clever.   The album's overall mood is a bit depressed, and I guess Paul must have been in a bit of a funk while writing it, emotionally (the wake of a failed marriage) and apparently physically (the song "allergies") -- though Simon didn't let these obstacles stop him from writing great music.     When Hearts and Bones is good, it is very, very good. The Rhino remastered CD is recommended for its sound quality. The extra bonus tracks are nothing to write home about. The earlier CD release without the bonus tracks would also be a good choice. 
 Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) is working to improve the lives of the poor in New Orleans.  She receives a request to visit a prisoner on death row.  Her compassionate  nature makes her visit the man.  When she meets Matthew Poncellete (Sean Penn), he is a humble man who is desperate to have some one help him out.  But the man she met is not the man who committed the crimes or is his humility just an act?  Through the movie she finds out it's a little of both.  When she attends an appeal hearing, she meets the parents of the two kids he killed and realizes that there are two sides to every story.  These parents are still feeling the pain and cannot understand why she is giving the killer any sympathy.  She realizes that to understand Matthew, she needs to understand the crime.  She meets with both sets of parents to understand their pain.  These are very effective scenes.  In the end, Matthew comes to term with his fate and Sister brings him together with his family.  Tim Robbins once again proves that he knows how to direct a film.  This film is definitely an actors' film.  His wife Sarandon wins an Oscar for her textured performance. Sean Penn finally starts to show what he is capable of and receives his first Oscar nomination.  But it is Robbins' casting of the supporting players that makes the film great.  Stage star Roberta Maxwell is compelling as Poncellete's mother.  While Celia Weston was best know for her TV role on Alice, proves that she can manipulate an audience as on the victim's mother.  And look for Jack Black in a very subdued performance - it would be nice if he repeated this more often.  This is definitely an anti-death penalty film but it does show that there are two points of view to every controversy.  DVD EXTRAS: Commentary by Tim Robbins 
 This game is great for when you have a group of friends come over. It really breaks the ice between you and anybody you may not be familiar with and it is incredibly entertaining.  I suggest this game for everybody 
 This could be one of the greatest albums ever released. But the stupid cockney accent that Damon puts on in most of the songs its ridiculous. "Girls and Boys" is one of the most catchy pop songs of all time and "End of a century" is a very meaningful and likeable song but "Parklife" is awful, especially as its the main track on the album. Its just a nusery rhyme of a load of rubbish.  Best songs:  1. End of a Century 2. Girls and Boys 3. This is a low    
 I was searching for a way to balance my life. I work hard and have two kids, but I always found that my swings and shifts of moods and body made me crazy. I suffered from PMS, bloating and moodiness. I couldn't bear another diet! This book changed my entire life focus on eating and living. I don't follow every little detail within this book, but I do heartily endorse the lifestyle it advocates.  Drink tea, eat small meals, treat your body well. Listen to the ancient wisdom of other women. Why are many other women around the world in better physical condition that we are in North America. We must look at history for some of the solutions, instead of just popping pills for quick fixes. It has taken me a year to get to where I am - but I am soooo much healthier, happier and more balanced. This review is my way of saying Thank you to Dr. Sonia. As a woman you must read this book 
 I co-lead a Bible study group which is using this book right now.  Honestly, we haven't totally finished it yet, but so far, this is a great book.  It is easy to read so it doesn't mean an overwhelming amount of homework for the group.  The study questions in the back do not simply ask you to "fill in the blank" from what you have already read.  The questions suppliment the reading.  The author intertwines her writing with scripture and quotes from a poll of husbands.  Many contemporary wives will see themselves in this book. In the end, this book is more about a wife's relationship with God than about a wife's relationship with her husband.  This book can change your life and improve your marriage 
 I ordered this item in September 2005, and after multiple extensions, Amazon let me know last week (Feb 2006) that this item was no longer available. They should be taking this item off their listing -- it is a great book to have, but regrettably unavailable 
 I thoroughly enjoyed reading "Women of the Vine" by Deborah Brenner. This book not only will appeal to those interested in the world of wine, it also provides thought-provoking stories about great women "at the helm" who will inspire all of us to follow our dreams!

 THIS IS A CD THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE! THERE ARE FOUR GREAT VOICES AND THEY DO COUNTRY MUSIC THE WAY IT SHOULD BE! LORRIE MORGAN IS THE BEST AND I LIKE EVERYTHING ON THIS!! BUY IT AND ENJOY! CHERY 
 This is one of the most engaging biographies I have ever read. Whether or not you are a Parker fan, this is a fascininating look at her life. I didn't know too much about her life prior to reading Meade's book, other than the common info about her drinking and suicide attempts. Everytime Parker headed for disaster, I wanted to shout "what were you thinking" but then her life wouldn't have been so memorable. This book is also a very interesting look at society and the role of women in publishing in the 1920s-1940s. Reading this biography will give any reader a greater understanding of Parker's work 
 This is an excellent CD and I recommend it to anyone that remembers the chipmunks and to those with kids.  Your kids will love it 
 New York Times best selling author Robin Cook creates yet another frightening novel to add to his arsenal.  His novel Vector opens a window into the life of three terrorists who plan to contaminate New York City with anthrax..  Yuri, a Russian chemical engineer whom is contracted by two neo Nazi leaders who ask him to create a large amount of anthrax powder.  The tow men plan to release the powder in a federal building on a windy day so that the poison will blow over Central Park..  In order to determine the potency of his anthrax, Yuri poisons a Jewish rug dealer.  Its not until Medical Examiner Jack Stapleton is given an intriguing case of  undetermined death.  The corpse belonged to a Jewish man named Jason Papris.  Determining the cause of death for Jason Papris will reveal a case of anthrax poisoning and be the first step in foiling the terrorist's plot. Vector is a race against time on both ends of the hero/villain spectrum.  The terrorists race to finish making the anthrax powder before their plans become apparent to authorities and Jack Stapleton races to discover the cause of death of the Jewish rug dealer.  Vector is a great addition to Robin Cook's collection of medical thrillers.  If you like this book, also try these titles by Robin Cook: Shock, Abduction, Fever, Godplayer, Toxin, Invasion, Chromosome 6, Contagion, Acceptable Risk, Fatal Cure, Terminal, Blindsight, Vital Signs, Harmful Intent, Mutation, Mortal Fear, Outbreak, Mindbend, Brain, Sphinx, Coma, and The Year of the Intern. 	 
 Well, let me start by saying that this is going to be a very biased review, considering the fact that I believe Paul Weller to be one of the coolest individuals to ever live. And I adore most of his music (the reason I didn't say "all" can be summed up in two words: Style Council). But he really launched into the stratosphere with this album. I can honestly find no fault with this wonderful CD. It's all there. If you want to rock out, listen to "Sunflower" or "Fifth Season". If you want to relax, try "All The Pictures on the Wall" or "Moon on Your Pyjamas". And if you're an acoustic fan, "Foot of the Mountain" is your song. Needless to say there's a lot more, but the only way you can find out is to pick up a copy of your own. Do so immediately! 
 I recently reread "Empire" and "Hollywood" and it occurs to me that these two books contain the most explicit elucidation of Vidal's theory of US politics. So what is it? As I understand it, it is this: Sometime between the Civil War and the turn of the century the US political system was taken over by the big money generated by mass industrialisation. Since then, US politics has been essentially theatre in which the Congress and the Executive haggle over the trappings of power. Because the US was the ascendant industrial, and hence military power, not even world war could seriously threaten this cozy, somewhat incestuous situation. I think, in a nutshell, that's about it. There are a few problems with this position, particularly the minimal treatment of economic factors (although Vidal's assessment of finance is usually insightful), but with Dubya in the White House, and the very real threat of US political dynasties (including Vidal's own relative, Al Gore) taking over electoral politics, I'd say Vidal's thesis is looking pretty good 
 Alright, some fans fall into the "Gentlemen" camp, and it's certainly a classic album - consistently good songs all the way through, Greg Dulli in perfect self-loathing form, etcetera.  Others fall into the "Black Love" camp because it's a fantastically dark, if overblown, caricature of Greg Dulli's persona - menacing, pleading, hypersexualized, and excruciatingly out of key.  "Congregation" is a worthy choice as well, the grittiest and grungiest of them all, not to mention the near-perfect "Jesus Christ Superstar" cover.    I love all of these albums, but "1965" is the one that I pop into the CD player most frequently.  The lyrics seem a bit trite compared to the brooding "Black Love" and desperate "Gentlemen" - an acquaintance of mine, whom I forced to listen to "1965," called it a "40-minute pick-up line," which probably isn't far from the truth.  But frankly, I couldn't care less, because this album has that indescribable groove that compels you to shake your ass and sing along.  Many musical elements absent in past Whigs recordings - the sultry female backup singers, screeching horns, all products of the New Orleans backdrop - shine through in "1965" and help Greg Dulli effortlessly channel the soul, funk, and R&B that came so naturally to the "Uptown Avondale" EP but were forcibly and often awkwardly incorporated into the "Black Love" recording sessions.  Words can only describe these intangible feelings so much.  Just listen to the album and wait for those moments of transcendence, like the soaring chorus to "Uptown Again," or when the female vocalist coos alongside the mantra "I've got the Devil in me, girl" on "John the Baptist," or Greg Dulli's anguished "yeah, yeah, yeah" as his voice drowns amidst the squealing horns and careening guitars in the final minute of "Omerta."  There's nothing like 'em on any of the other Whigs releases, and that's why "1965" is their standout record 
 Shelton's popular bear books are the only source for those interested in resolving bear-people conflict.  You may have to forgive Shelton his politics, and get beyond that to understand what he is saying.  But for the careful reader, his views are well founded.  Those who know Shelton also know that he has done more for bear protection and protection for their habitat than I suspect all of his critics combined.  Those of us in the city seem not to understand that when we go to the store or a fast food joint for our food, we are just letting someone else do our killing, and are part of a system the slaughters millions of animals every day. Those of us who read our newspapers seem to forget that we are the problem, and part of a system that results in millions of trees be cut if the forest.  Those critics whose arguments seem to be about politics, and feel inclined to resort to name calling, should take a deep breath, reconsider, and get back to the real issues.  The Deadly Truth is an important book if you really want to understand and do something about the problem 
 She stood with a bullhorn and a bright orange vest in front of a doctor's home protecting the children who lived there, unarmed.  The invader's armoured tank kept on coming, hitting her, and backing up over her to make certain she was dead.  But she wasn't. Her spine snapped, she died painfully hours later as she was stopped at the invader's "security" checkpoint.  As any decent human being she stood unarmed and defenseless to protect children's ancient homes from destruction and land grab, even to the ultimate consequences. Such morality and courage is very rare today and shines in such great fellow American heroes as Jean Donovan, Sister Ita Ford, Sister Maura Clark and Sister Dorothy Kazel.  But they were in the last millenium, raped and murdered by other US allies and organs. Rachel is now, a hero for our new millenium. Our only American hero.  Please read her words and weep, not for her, but for all the children who loses homes and lives to faceless, relentless immoral military aggression 
 Casino Royale is an excellent portrayal of the 1960's era in its attention to British, USA, & Russian spying and the cold war. Enjoy 
 This is one of my favorite books from Agatha Christie's later years.  Her grip of story telling, plotting and planning is still strong.  There is some humor in the narrative and amusement is provided by many of the characters.     Agatha Christie tries her hand at the girls' school setting here.  Older reader will suspect that she was well-acquainted with similar settings chosen by A A Milne and Dorothy Sayers, and that she had been brought up on the once popular school girl annuals.  Of course there needs to be a raison d'être behind the series of murders that occurs at the school and this is well narrated also.  I have mentioned the narration several times.  It is an element that helps explain this writer's phenomenal popularity.  She gets the timing right.  Other writers in this genre produce more elegant prose but somehow fail in this regard.   At this time in her career, Agatha Christie was experimenting with narrative methods.  She attempted the "quick scene change" method here, and brings it off with skill and flair.  She also, at this time in her career, frequently milked the situation where something was briefly glimpsed in a mirror, or a familiar face briefly glimpsed at a great distance.  Watch out for these occurrences as you turn the pages to reach Hercule Poirot's final revelation of just who is the cat among the pigeons.   
 The novel just before this one in the DCI Alan Banks series, _The Hanging Valley_, was pretty lackluster, but Robinson springs back in this one with a major winner. A young woman is found murdered in her own parlor by her lesbian partner, Veronica, a classical recording playing over and over on the stereo. Caroline had been involved in a local amateur theater production of _Twelfth Night_ -- nice bit of irony there, and a plot-point as well if you pay attention -- and the director and the other cast members are all suspects. So is Veronica's ex-husband, so is the husband's current girlfriend, and so is Caroline's emotionally strained teenage brother, all with different and quite reasonable possible motives. The plot becomes more complex but it won't necessarily stay that way, a point the author has the Chief Inspector make several times. Banks is a humane man, not ordinarily quick to judge, and his growing regard for Veronica is very nicely rendered. Also heavily involved is newly-promoted DC Susan Gay -- an unfortunate surname, in the circumstances -- who was only a spear-carrier in the earlier installments. She's young and bright and has a great deal to learn, not least of which is to distrust her prejudices. The writing is smooth, the plotting holds together, the pace and the atmosphere of Eastdale in a rather bleak Christmas season are very well done, and the characterization is excellent. The best of the series so far 
 These shoes are the best pair ever! I can wear them with jeans, a skirt, I can go casual or I can go elegant or event business. Awesome buy definatly worth the money 
 I mainly picked up this CD becuase of the inclusion of Songe d'Automne, the purported last song played by the gallent musicians of the Titanic, and the White Star March.  As big as a Titanic buff as I am, I never knew until reading the liner notes that the Titanic had an electric organ.  I did enjoy the "diary" by Wallace Hartley and the poem Convergence of the Twain.  When I listen to this CD I can just imagine myself sitting in the Reception Room on D Deck attending an afternoon concert in the company of Molly Brown, John Jacob Astor, and Benjamin Guggenheim.  The selections are wonderfully performed and very rare.  I'm not sure of any other CD that has such a varied collection of tunes from the turn of the century.  On my 20th birthday, my mom used recipies from the book "Last Dinner on the Titanic:  Recipies From the Great Liner to throw me a Titanic themed birthday.  This CD was on repeat in the stereo.  It added just the right atmosphere to the procedings.  I'm not particular to any one song, they are each treasures.  If you're looking for a change from the drivel that passes as "popular" music nowadays or a Titanic fan, this disk will surely enhance your listening enjoyment 
 This book is so important. I swear she should write school courses for children K-12 & beyond because she is so wonderfuly full of knowledge and sound advice. I strongly urge everyone to buy this book if not for yourself then for someone you love. It is so enlightening you will not want to put it down. 
 This book is great! There are some parts in the book that had me crying I was laughing so hard! My dog even came over to see what was wrong with me! :) So I definately recommend this book. 
 There's a writer, Sebastian Junger whose face is plastered everywhere for his two novels; one of which is a sea novel about the sister ship of Ms. Greenlaw's vessel (name of book; "the perfect storm") which was lost at sea. Linda is one of the best swordfisher captains in the east. The fact that she is a chick makes her take even more interesting. She tells a salty tale of one of her goings to sea. Nothing much ever happens, it just talks about a nice girl who wants a boyfriend who happens to have a really scary job as Captain of a swordfisherman vessel. BTW, she prefers the sobriquet, "fisherman" -stating that it is obvious she is a female: no "fisherwoman" neologisms are needed for her. Cool broad. Cool story 
 This book is an excellent source of information on Alzheimer, especially if you haven't read any other information regarding this disease.  It is easy to read........in layman's terms.  It explains the various levels of Alzheimers and the different types.  Good information for the caregiver as to what to expect as the disease advances.  Also good information on what to look for when visiting Alzheimer facilities.    To sum up..........(even though I had researched other articles on this disease), this book was easy to read, informative, and good suggestions on what to expect and how to handle a problem/issue. 
 This is a great book for personal reading if you are interested in learing about the many issues facing modern human society. A few of Brown's personal views are out there but as a whole it explains the story in detail. My personal view is that everyone alive should be reading chapter 2, "Beyond the Oil Peak. 
 I also saw Persephone's Bee's in Detroit and bought the CD at the concert. As a "veteran" rocker I am not easily impressed with a lot new bands and their music. However, this is the best new material that I have heard in years. Excellent musicianship, writitng and lyrics.   Tom Ayres guitar work is incredible, Angelina Moysov lyrics and vocals are awesome. Mike Farrell' bass, and Eric Valentines drumming provide and excellent backdrop for the progress sound of the band.  I believe this is a must have CD and is the most refreshing talent to arrive in years. 
 Back in 1996, I was heavily into primarily dance music (house & trance) with a smidgeon of punk (not the Good Charlotte sort of garbage) and alternative music. A roommate of mine at the time worked at local radio station and brought home free cds for everyone. One of the free goodies I got was the single "Curlylocks" by Baby Fox. I loved what I heard. It was nothing that I had ever heard of at the time with its slick icy melodies, slow electronic beats, and sensual female vocals. At the time, I did not know this was trip hop music. I eventually got the group's full length cd ("Normal Family") that had "Curlylocks" on it. I recently excavated "Normal Family" from one of my many piles of cds and slipped the cd into my stereo. Baby Fox reminds me of Portishead, Motorcycle, Hooverphonic, Olive, and Telepopmusik with their slick, laid back beats and ethereal female vocals. I almost forgot why I loved this cd so much several years ago. It is truly ahead of its time before chill out music became the rage on the electronica scene today. All the songs on "Normal Family" are top-notched. I could not find one song that I didn't like. I especially love "Ladybird", "Curlylocks", "In Your Dreams", and "Alienway". It is a shame that this band was short-lived. Considering just how big chill out music is today, Baby Fox definitely could have sustained a career in music today. "Normal Family" is one of those forgotten gems that got sidetracked by the current music scene at the time. I'm glad I re-discovered Baby Fox 
 This book confirms and illustrates beautifully the principles of Atelier work. The later sections could be extended considerably and I hope it will be. A good reference to have on your shelf and a lovely present for an artist 
     This book needs another fifty to a hundred pages, particularly in the begining when Sandel contrast Liberalism and Republicanism at the theoretical level. Because of the brevety of the treatment of the subject many fundamental issues were over simplified. Further, I disagree with Sandel's conclusion (implied) that Holmesian jurisprudence formed a basis for contemporary liberalism. It certainly seems to me that, although some of Holmes' work is liberal, the "Lochner" jurisprudence that he was reacting against represented true liberal (in the libertarian sense) orthodoxy, and that the likes of John Harlan (which he views as representing republican values) posited the more exspansive view of liberalism.  Of particular interest is Sandel's pursuasive argument that this nation was not founded upon liberal pronciples, but rather republican principles.   All in all this is a good book, It just needed a little more development.   
 Do you love historical romances?  Do you want to watch a movie full of beautiful costumes, set in Venice, with a wonderful cast and even more wonderful dialogue?  This is your movie.  I can't believe I didn't know about this movie sooner!  Catherine McCormack is Outstanding!  ***NOTE: Don't read on if you are easily distracted!***The only thing that slightly detracted from this movie was the fact that Rufus Sewell has an eye that doesn't quite match his other.  When the camera hits his face head on, it is hard to miss and once I noticed it, it became distracting.  But hey, you can't complain about something the guy can't help.  He did a great job with his role and has been great in the other movies I've caught him in (Tristan and Isolde) 
 Gwen Stefani can make her voice high pitched or can rap with a deep voice. The two best songs on here are "Hollaback Girl" and "Rich Girl." Both have her good singing and rapping voice making the songs what they are. The album does have a little too much adult material for kids under 12 or 13 though. But this is a classic that any of America's youth (ages 12+) should have as they grow up today. 
 Unlike a lot of "Greatest Hits" CD's that you can purchase, I think this CD might actually have all of Journey's Greatest Hits on it.  Almost every track is great song that you will remember within seconds of it starting.  I am very happy I purchased this CD, and I think if you get it, you will be too 
 If you are put off by the current actions of Michael Jackson, find comfort that he wasn't always such a screwup. This album, which is arguably his best, is really good! It has great songs like "Billie Jean" "Thriller" and "Beat it." Full of danceable beats and tender love songs, it is really some of the finest music of the 80's! 
 This is a wonderful, wonderful book for teenage girls.  From a 12 year old in 6th grade to a girl in college, this book is a must-have.  Dealing with issues such as puberty, friends, family, and learning to accept yourself, any girl would be glad of this book on their shelves 
 Excellent book.Draving are fantastic and informative.I just bought the book and would recommend it to everyone who needs help in drawing a human figure 
 Visible Ops set me in the right direction for performing the research I needed to prepare a proposal for my boss.  The book was a great tool for understanding the different CONTROLs I  NEEDed to grasp, in order to REALLY know how my job/workflow is part of the IT Operation.  I was finally able to design an acceptable outline of the metric components that my IT job needs to "perform".  And now I'm on my way to setting the stage of value in my job.  
 For those looking not only forward but back into the Old Testament, they will find this book quite enjoyable and useful to tie the whole story together.  
 I'll start by saying I loved the book.  But that's too simple.  I wanted to sit down figure out what I really loved about the novel and I came up with the following:  First of all I have to say that I don't typically read horror, so if you are looking for insight into this novel as a horror novel, you won't find it here.  It's not that it isn't horror, well maybe it isn't, but i think we can at least call it New Horror.  As I have said, I don't primarily read horror.  I have read a few novels by Stephen King and I have to say that Blue bloods shared a kind of similar interest in character and realism, but I think that's where the similarity ends, but the book may be all the better for it.    I know Stephen King has said that he has little interest in fashion, so I am going to go out on a limb and say that Blue Bloods is Stephen King for girls.  You may disagree, you may not even get what I am after, but hold on and read the entire review before you judge.  This is probably the most I will talk about horror, because Blue Bloods is really a great fashion/society novel set in the horror genre.  So what did I like?  And this is the sad, part, because it leaves me waiting for what I can only assume is going to be the next book, but I have to say I loved the the love triangle.  I am a sucker for them.   I cried at the tragic ending, I couldn't believe that so much was left unsolved, and I loved it!  Ok, enough about that fact that I kind of like the fact that Blue Bloods teases you.  My big question:  Is Schuyler going to find somebody?  If you haven't read the book, I realize that this doesn't make sense, but I am firmly against giving away the plot and everybody knows you can't write a fun review if you just summarize the plot, so just believe and if you like that sort of question keep reading!  It goes further....  There is a kind of triangle between Schuyler, Oliver, and Jack.    Oliver is the best friend ( I am not giving anything away here).  In the book he is described as her conduit, a kind of human link for the Blue Bloods (Okay I am giving away a little).  It is not quite a professional relationship, he is more of a guardian and helper, a kind of best friend. Except it is not a best friend of choice!  Which is kind of odd in itself.  It turns out he was actually born to be her conduit.  Born for her!  But throughout the novel you get the sense, that he may care more for than a friend would.  That's Oliver.  Jack!  Jack is bonded the Mimi.  It appears to be a kind of Blue Blood marriage, except you don't get to pick the person.  More of an eternal arranged marriage let's say.  The only hitch is that he appears into (in love with?) Schuyler?  It's juicy.  It's complex,  I liked it.  Twilight felt a little clichï¿½ to me.  (Okay now I am admitting that i have read some other vampire novels).  So what inspired me to write this?  In part I wanted to share my questions, I am curious what everyone thinks. But for the most part I was excited to find a horror novel that felt like it could be entirely about fashion and society (and love) without sacrificing anything 
 Carl Deuker's fourth book for young adults is another winner filled with fast paced action and surprises all along the way. Night Hoops is a fantastic book for sports lovers and Mike Lupica fans. All four of his books were nominated for ALA best book for young adults. 	  Nick Abbot always thought of Trent Dawson as a punk or a thug who was always getting himself into deep trouble. But when Nick Abbot only wants to make it on the school basketball team at school. But so is Trent Dawson and Nick tries to learn more about him than his family saying that Trent is a bad influence because his brother gets into to much trouble and his mom is a bad influence. But Nick doesn't care what he hears because when the coach tells him to help Trent or sit on the bench he decides to keep his spot on the team and become friends with Trent. While trying to figure this out Nick needs to show his family the same thing. But it gets harder to do when Trent makes a big mistake and Nick needs to help Trent see his mistake.   By the end of Night Hoops you will see the friendship that Nick and Trent have becomes stronger than ever. It will keep you thinking hard about this book from front to back. 
 The fun section showed great suggestions on things to do for fun. I would have never thought to stick my toes to the sky. I enjoyed the part about starting your own band. It made my friends and I start our own band. I  enjoyed learning about different women and what they achived. My favorite  saying and comeback was You throw like a girl. Just like Jackie Mitchell.  Thanks! I have used it on some of the boys at my school and they were  speechless. The comeback was simple but it blew their socks off. Girl Talk  is a great book about the power of girls!!!!!! 
 Help Yourself gave me the chance to do what I am doing right now; fixing computers. In this book, Dave talks about the pains of his childhood, but that didn't stop him from being alive. Just because you are in a negative environment does not mean that you will succeed. In this book, he helps you that only you can make a chance, and nothing is impossible if you put your mind to it. He also credits people like Colin Powell from coming up from poverty to become the Secretary Of State (but he did not put the Secretary Of State, just the Joint Chief's of Staff because this book is kind of old). He also gives you the courage to live out your dreams, and to make yourself a better person. He writes in the book that if you can get rid of the negative crap out of your life, and try to look at the positive things, then you will be a much more happier person. The pain that he describes is real and very painful. No matter how hard he tried in school, his drunken mother always told him that he was stupid and she hated him and wished that he was dead. He survived and proved his mother wrong. The thing is that he does not hate his mother, or his father from turning a blind eye to the abuse. Dave wrote that no one should hate anybody no matter what they put you through. This is a very good book, and a real life saver 
 This product adds flexibility to the excellent device Street Pilot GPS340.  Thanks. Yakov   
 This is a very interesting book, and while it would be best if someone was a salesman to use this it has theories and practical applications that are useful and that I use everyday.  
 this takes a few listens to get accustomed to. but once you get settled, it's a nice ride. tropicalia, electronica, folktronica(?) alot of unique influence and it could have been a giant mess. but david pulls it together to form a cohesive album whose results are touching, and sometimes humorous. my favorite song would no doubt be "A Soft Seduction." great lyrics to that one. the cover and design concept is also quite great. my only complaint is that it could have been alot more streamlined and better if it were about 3-4 songs less. but all the songs are nice and it would have been hard to choose the ones to leave off. good go, then 
 I liked this film from start to finish and it has top notch performances. The story is about a terminally-ill mother has to settle on the new woman in her ex-husband's life, who will be their new stepmother. The mother dosent like the way the new women acts and the why she worksa nd has kids. The acting is good from Susan Serandon, Julia Roberta give's a great performance also. Sadely this is a film that is forgotten fast and is underated. Overall it's touching,moving and funny it should entertain the whole family 
 Richard Fox's book is not a Church History, a Christian History, or even a religious history.  What it is is an American History analyzed through the lens of how people responded to the life, example, and image of Jesus.  It takes the reader through the life of the early Catholic missionaries, then the Protestant Puritans, the American Revolution, the Revival Movements, World War I and pacifism, to modern evangelicism.  I believe that every high school student should be required to read this book in order to develop a more balanced view of the role of religion in American culture and government 
 The first time I heard of Chesty was from the DI's at MCRD.  I am glad I have finally gotten a chance to read about his career.  How the banana wars were fought was very interesting.  The book as a whole was fascinating.  The only negative was that the letters to his wife were starting to get uninteresting.  Otherwise a very informed book about the greatest marine ever 
 This movie explores the questions:  Can good love create bad consequences?  And if so, what is the cause?  And regardless of the cause, what is to be done?  I had considered renting this movie & passed on it, thinking, "I don't want to see another torrid love story about non-sensical romanticism & obsessiveness."  But the film proved to be much more practical and smarter than my expectations - something I love about art.  The title of the film is "Possession".  There are probably many reasons for the title, but the film might ask the question:  Is it the love & friendship of some that causes the tragic decisions of others?  Or is it some characters' desire to solely possess another person that is the reason for the tragic choices?  And regardless of the cause, how do the people who remain cope with such a tragedy?  How do people in love deal with such a dilemma?  Dilemma - A situation that requires a choice between options that are or seem equally unfavorable or mutually exclusive.   For the movie to have been more interesting, I think the characters of Ellen Ash and Blanche Glover would need to have been more fully drawn, so that we felt their multi-faceted beauty, spice, & layers of loss.  Of the 4 main historical characters, I don't know enough about the characters' levels of suffering and sacrifice to comment on whether 3 of them made mistakes.  But with as little as I know, I don't agree with Blanche Glover's final decision.   Martyrdom lost its appeal for me long ago.  If you really want to help people, stay around and think; stay around and face the neverending fight.  Don't hinge your existence on one person or principle.  Please comment, express feedback, or suggest related works 
 Great photos of the now-defunct Bethlehem Steel plant in Pennsy.  Photos are all shot in black-and-white format and capture the ghostly and grungy aspect of this abandoned site 
 I like Jane Yolen's work - the children do too (lol).  But Owl Moon is probably the most poetic of her works that we have read.  The word choice and imagery is wonderful; soft and soothing.  You can hear the crunch of snow, and feel the biting cold.  Like the others I give it 5 stars, and would add that it makes for a good bed-time book.    Five Stars.  Top notch Read-aloud.  Artwork is nice, in darker shades than Yolen's other works.  Perhaps not quite as nice in detail, but well suited to the story.  
 Enjoyed it so much, we just ordered ten copies for College Graduation gifts.  Look forward to more from this dynamic duo 
 "Herbie Fully Loaded" has Herbie returning with Lindsay Lohan as his driver, a college graduate known as "Mags" looking to make a bit of money to pay the rent by way of the races. It was fairly good for the most part, lot of practical effects, and when there was computer animation it was minimal and tasteful. Went on a bit toward the end, but it was fine. Funny moments. Three and a half stars 
 This is one of my least favorite Bellow novels. But because it is Bellow it has a lot worth reading in it. His thoughts about society and culture may not always be exactly on the mark, but they usually stimulate and inspire. In this novel the hero is a bit less sympathetic than many of his other main characters. Henderson, Herzog, Humboldt, Sammler , Augie March have vivacity and life that Dean Corde does not.  The Dean's wife too falls short of Bellow's livelier and more appealing feminine creations, for instance the Ramona and Madelaine of Herzog. So too the whole spirit of the work has about it a pessimism and bleakness which contrast strongly with that of Augie March, and Henderson, and even in its way, Herzog. This book is really a winter book, and it has coldness and dying in it. And it has the oppression of the Communist Iron Curtain world in Romania, and the depression of Chicago's most beaten and desperate streets. The characters and the story seem less alive than the ideas.  Again this is not one of his best. Far from it. But it is Bellow and because of that a worthwhile read. 
 The world is full of experts at what is wrong with the things that we do. Dr. Carver has a rock-solid, well thought out suggestion concerning how to do it right. One reviewer complained that Dr. Carver's suggestions are not realistic. Right is  not often realistic, but right is always right. It's far better to start with an ideal and compromise from that point than to capitulate from the outset. Boards that Make a Difference is well worth reading 
 I thought this was very great, descriptive, informative, and much more.  This book is for those who can't achieve an outer body experience.  It tells about all of the creatures, scenery, travel, and everything else there is to know about the astral plane.  There's not much more to say  about this book except that it is a great, informative book 
 This complete musical score to one of the greatest works of art by mankind comes in quality paper and print that I find quite satisfying. The lack of an English translation is no problem for me personally, because I have separate libretti with translations I can refer to when needed, and I use this book when I want to follow the musical score and sing along with the original Italian verses. One disappointment is that the German verses are in normal print, directly underneath the musical score, while the original Italian is in italics and under the German (therefore harder to read and follow), almost as if the book is intended more for people who want to follow the German, not the Italian. Since the opera is originally in Italian, it makes more sense to me that the German text and Italian text should be switched in terms of location and font. Nevertheless, I'm highly satisfied with the overall quality of this book, and it is definitely one of my favorite books within my music-related library 
 As a teacher of Romeo and Juliet, this version stays pretty close to the original.  There are some parts that are left out, but most students do not notice those.  They are more likely to notice the "skin scenes" of Romeo and Juliet's wedding night than the comic relief that has been excluded.  While the Luhrmann version always hits closer to home, this one is good ancillary material for more reluctant readers, or those struggling to find a theme in the pages of something supposed to be watched 
 I love this book.  I am almost done knitting the embroidered crew neck sweater (my first sweater EVER), and I have found the pattern to be very simple to follow, and quick and fun to knit.  I love that there are so many different types of patterns in here and such clear instructions.  I am a beginner knitter so I don't know how to adjust my knitting for errors in patterns, so the clear and accurate instructions were much appreciated 
 Outstanding. If you have Rheumatoid Arthritis ...get this book. Practice it and your life will change. Barbara has done an excellent job of combining personal experience, reviewing the scientific literature and inspiring the reader, to produce a life-changing book. She goes through extraordinary lengths to find answers to the disease that once haunted her and  comes up a winner. And you can get the benefit of her vast experiences and research for the cost of a book.  As a physician who treats Rheumtoid Arthritis I realized that modern medicine is very limited in what it can do for this disorder.This book will give you options beyond anything you dreamed possible ..and (from second hand experience) it works. I tell my RA patients - even if you do nothing else for now - just read this book!  
 This is a gotta-have if your working with herbal remedies. I just can't say more than, its well worth the price, just buy it 
 Make no mistake.......this is a great album. If you like the Hammond-Leslie sound then this is a must buy. I liked all but one song but it hasn't dampened my view. The songs cover everything from clean to distorted sounds. A pleaser for most styles. Just remember.......the Hammond sound ain't squat without the LESLIE. Let's quit forgetting Don and move him to the front page 
 Ellis' book makes the life of Washington come alive.  The narration on the CD is well done.  Worth your time 
 The Complete Success Guide For The Immigrant Life by Monette Adeva Maglaya is an informed and informative self-help guide written especially for American immigrants. From practical problems such as getting legal status and employer sponsorship; to economic budgeting; to learning how to tap into inner personal strengths and making a difference for the better, The Complete Success Guide For The Immigrant Life is well-rounded, useful, practical, and very highly recommended reading offering a wealth of applicable advice for all immigrant Americans regardless of their cultural or ethnic origins 
 "1920s Fashions from B. Altman & Company" provides over 700 black & white illustrations, detailed descriptions, and prices for clothing for the upper class of the Jazz Age.  The focus is primarily on women's clothing and accessories, with everything from sophisticated evening wear to bathing suits, but you will also find a complete array of clothing for men and children as well.  Please remember, because they buy directly from the manufacturer, "thus eliminating the no inconsiderable profits of the middleman," B. Altman & Company are able to offer patrons the benefit of the savings.  This is a superb record of the styles worn by flappers in the Roaring Twenties; note than this is not simply the reproduction of a catalog from a particular year, but has fashion culled from the B. Altman catalogs of the entire decade.  Interesting Footnote: The B. Altman & Company Department Store is now the New York Public Library Science, Industry & Business Library.  Dover also has a reprint edition of "Altman's Spring and Summer Fashions Catalog, 1915," which records the fashions worn in the United States in the years before the First World War.   This volume will be of interest to the fashion historian and of great use to costume designers working with this period of American History 
 "Teach Your Child the Multiplication Tables: Fast, Fun & Easy with Dazzling Patterns, Grids & Tricks!" is one of the best materials that I have come across for helping children not only learn their multipications tables BUT also retain them.  I can't thank the author enough for making  math fun again!  I highly recommend this book!! 
 Walid Shoebat is a former member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and in his book: Why I Left Jihad: The Root of Terrorism and the Return of Radical Islam, he shares how he came to be an advocate for the Jewish people. As a youth he witnessed Israel's victorious Six Day War while living in Jericho, and after that time a pervasive atmosphere of hatred towards Jews and Israel spread in Arab communities and began to be taught in schools, along with Islamic eschatology. He also noted that many displaced Palestinians were kept in refugee camps as a kind of political pawn by Arab governments. Walid Shoebat, speaks on how a racist ideology is used as recruitment by such groups as the PLO, who start off by denying the Holocaust, and seek to change all Jewish holy places into Muslim ones. As a teenager, Walid Shoebat joined the PLO and was involved in rioting in Israel, where he was briefly imprisoned. Later, while studying in the United States he came to the realization that everything he was taught about the Jews was a lie, and he eventually began speaking out on the issue.  According to Walid Shoebat, the war is not against simple terrorism (not on terrorism, not on those few thousand of radical muslims that Bush proposes, but essentially on all Islam. Muslims believe that infidels should be eliminated. Whether we should have invaded Afghanistan, Iraq or Iran or Syria or Saudi Arabia is almost a mute point. They are all muslim and according to Walid, all muslims attending mosques are exposed to recruitment as jihadists/terrorists. All Imams are recuiters of death and destruction. It is how we have waged the war after we claimed the overthrow of Sadaam. We have had to adhered to the policy of respond in kind. Which guaranteed to lose our soldiers lives and prolong any conflict which will cause more deaths. 
 Such a complex story written deftly by an exceptional writer.  This book is my second by Ms. Due and I enjoyed this one so much more.  I connected with Hilton and his plight and found myself trying to distinguish what was real and what wasn't as well.  There are definate moments of the Shining and even a zing of that Nicole Kidman movie 'The Others'-I think this one was written first.  Ms. Due has won a new fan and I can't wait to dive into her other works of fiction.  Highly, highly recommended 
 This is a solid electro mix from start to finish.  Nothing too surprising - just a solid mix.  
 I'll join those who are more favorable about this disc than Edith Eisler.  I agree that this is certainly an unconventional approach to Baroque material, but the results are wonderful -- very lush and expressive.  The eminent Ms. Eisler expresses an opinion that is not strictly musical concerning the CD's packaging.  Query whether this opinion colored her view of the music 
 My favorite costumes (not pictured on cover) are the lilac croquet costume and purple and gold velvet tea gown. Good quality 
 But so are most books of this type.  The book's best feature is a nice combination of detail with theory.  There are lots of exercises and a generally cheery "you can do it!" tone.  That's good, but the book's recurring emphasis on developing multi-modal approaches to problem-solving is better (i.e., creativity means trying approaches you're not as familiar with).  Concluding sections on interacting with people of dominant types that differ from you, and how to sell your ideas to them, is probably worth the cover price alone. The author loves examples. These examples are not always correct (salons peaked in the 1700s, not the "seventeenth century" to cite one of more than a dozen examples), nor do they fit as neatly into their creative categories as the author supposes. In part, though, the reader comes to see this as the unique characteristics of a certain creative style--seeing this and making allowance for it is good practice for the rest of the book.  After all, true creativity is aware of variant creative modes, especially in colleagues or even competitors. The morning after skimming the entire book I began to experiment with some of its suggestions.  Within two hours I had come up with a metaphor that will solve one of the most intractable process problems for my company--an idea that literally took my breath away, on something I'd been struggling with for months.  I put a lot of work in; this book didn't give me any answers.  But in a sense it reminded me of the answer, or gave me ideas about how and where to look for the answer.  I was a college football player already, to use a metaphor, and this was a long look at a pro playbook.  It won't work unless you're playing college ball; if you're a top pro player, you should look at something more advanced.  But if you want to develop a basis of creative talent, this'll help 
 If you're like me and don't have time to pore over the Wall Street Journal every morning or stay online 10 hours a day watching the stock trends, this book is for you. It gives a simple, easy to follow, and "unemotional" system for picking top performing stocks. If the market is doing well, you will too. If it isn't, he describes when to get out. I made money with this system at a time when many of my friends were losing money on their stock "hunches.&quot 
 The Kellog school is renowned for their marketing school standing head and shoulders above their competitors.  It is fair to say that this book, Kellog on Branding, demonstrates in no short manner why.    It remains the great mystery of business: how to get consumers to recognise the value of your product over others, such that they are willing to recognise this in the price they pay for it.  Innovation in product design is not businesses greatest challenge today, making it pay is.    This book has plenty of great examples of companies that have managed to pull this off, some of these examples should be relevant to your business, and give practical examples of how ot make it work.  More importantly, the articles, or chapters, give a step by step process to help your company create unique solutions.    My only real recommendation is not to tell your competitors about this book. 
 Doesn't it seem like the best books are the ones that you've had on your wish list forever and just seemed to keep skipping over?  I've had Jacqueline Susann's `VALLEY OF THE DOLLS' on my Amazon wish list for years and never got around to actually ordering it but I decided to start of the New Year with something different and this cult classic was just what the doctor ordered!  Anne, the wide-eyed girl from Lawrenceville escapes her doomed future as a housewife by moving to New York City in hopes of finding a life for herself.  But no sooner than she arrives and gets settled in her new job and home does she end up on the cover of every newspaper and the talk of the town.  But over the years Anne learns that the life she'd always dreamed of wasn't all that it was cracked up to be.    Neely is seventeen with all the enthusiasm her little body can handle.  A performer in vaudeville since childhood Neely has what it takes to be a star.  She is the ultimate triple threat she dances, sings like no other and can act too!  Inevitably, by the age of twenty-one Neely becomes the biggest star around; unfortunately her ego grows just as big as her rising star.  And with the help of her red, yellow and green "dolls" washed down with a little scotch nothing can stop her.  Jennifer has the face and the body to go far, however all she really wants is love.  But unfortunately love doesn't pay the bills.  And after a few failed marriages to some of Hollywood's most prominent players Jennifer realizes that her body is her ticket to stardom. Soon she becomes Europe's biggest star... because in Europe anything goes.  I absolutely could not put this book down.  Originally it was the old school style that hooked me, I felt like I was watching an old movie with the 1960's dialogue such as "Hey, what's this, a gag?" or the regular use of the words geez and golly but soon I was sucked in by the lives of Anne, Neely and Jennifer as they each rose to stardom and fell just as easily. 
 What a fun album, full of great tunes from a much better time in the TV world and music world. I play my copy often. The lounge format is adhered to loosely by a couple of the selections. However, there is a cool "lounge" version of the My Three Sons theme. I'm hooked on the Spies theme. My kids like the Batman and Munsters themes a lot 
 This is a great book - not only is it absolutely beautiful, but it actually does the job.  After years of struggling with Pythagorean Commas and Syntonic Commas and all the other tricky little bits in music I was given a copy of Anthony Ashton's little book and the pieces finally fell into place.  A simply delightful book with truly awesome images and clear concise mathematics.  I have given copies to every musician friend I have and they all love it too.  Well done Wooden Books - clarity, brevity and beauty combined.  More please 
 Fred Hammond is the best thing that ever happened to gospel music.  He truly ministers with every song. I mean that's what gospel music should be about, songs that ministers to you as well as worship the Father. Fred is truly the Minister of Music 
 "El-Hazard: The Magnificent World" is an anime very much in the "Tenchi Muyo!" mold: a romantic comedy/adventure in which blank-slate protagonist Makoto is thrust into a sci-fi scenario and gets to play hero while being chased by multiple women. Though the characters in "El-Hazard" aren't developed as deeply as the "Tenchi" crew and the show occasionally suffers from awkward pacing, "El-Hazard" has a charm all it own. The mysterious antiheroine Ifurita is compelling, and the kids' hard-drinking teacher Fujisawa is consistently funny. Most impressively, "El-Hazard" tells a complete and satisfying story, tying up its seeming plot holes with an ingenious last-episode twist. Usually these types of shows start strong, only to end up limping through anticlimaxes and false endings. Even the romantic tension is unambiguously resolved!  The dub is also pretty darn good, though it tends to get overly shouty, especially in the segments centering on Jinnai. Can't the guy ever just speak in a normal tone?  "El-Hazard" is hardly the type of show that will change your life, but if you like "Tenchi" or other anime in this vein, this box set is probably a good bet. (The set actually contains two separate shows: the original "El-Hazard" OAV and its 4-episode sequel "El-Hazard 2." The sequel is an inconsequential side story that unfortunately doesn't really add any value.)

 The cord appeared to be pretty messy. But the product is just fine.   -Good quality sound. -Accept/Hang calls. -Volume control.  I don't think I want more. The connector is a Pop-port connector. It's showed just as big in the product's image. If you have a 2.5mm jack and still insist buying this after look at the image, then what the h... is wrong with you? 
 Lucille Ball is one of the greatest comedians ever! If you love I Love Lucy, you will love her movies. 
 I was drawn to THE GIANT'S HOUSE because of its marvelous cover.  I read the first paragraph while still in the bookstore.  I was knocked out by the straightforwardness of the language.  Reminded me of my mother's relatives in Brookville, Pa.  I had withdrawal when I finished, so I quickly scooped up HERE'S YOUR HAT. . .  Loved it, too.  What a shocker I had when I came to the end of the story "Secretary of State."  The narrator says she goes from being a "Savitz" to being a "Barron."  Well, darned if I'm not a Savitz.  Not a common name, so I'd like to know how to get ahold of E. McCracken.  I love her work.  I sure hope we're related.  Bobbie Savitz, Portland, Orego 
 even though it has the name foo fighters on the front this is not a foo's album as the first offical foo's album was the colour and the shape two years later in 1997 with pat smear-guitars-nate mendal-bass-dave grohl playin' most of the drums  this is dave grohl's solo album of excellance  from the first song "this is a call" you will be sucked into believing this is grohl doin' another grunge album starin' off were nirvana left off..that is not so this is by far not a grunge album...it has all the charms from the tracks "big me" with the fluffy poppy guitars and the delightful "for all the cows"  but also you get distorted guitars and growled vocals  in the shape of "alone+easy target" "floaty" "oh george" and "x-static" all them songs are grade A++  yeah grohl's lyrics may not make sense but isn't that the point of rock and roll sometimes..yeah it's great to have meaningful lyrics but sometimes you need a bit of fun and goofiness  i think grohl was trying to target the grunge fans who loved nirvana but also trying to get too the pop fans aswell and he suceeded in makin' a great solo album with the foo fighters  P.S greg dulli plays guitar on X-static

 This adventure and fantastic book is about a boy named Bud. He lived in a Foster home. After Bud went through cruel treatment at a home, he decides to runaway and go to who he thinks is his dad. This is an amazing story with a surprise twist in the end 
       Many of my happiest memories are of summer days spent at my grandmother's house.  Removed from parental eyes I was pretty much free to do as I pleased, and eat the wonderful food that my grandmother prepared.  In addition to the fun games and mornings of reading in a hammock I well remember the hours my grandmother spent in the kitchen preparing a full breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Fortunately, she loved to cook.  However, if she'd had a choice I'll bet she would have liked to have more time to enjoy the other activities she loved, whether it was quilting or her  needlepoint.    	Cooking for a day to eat for a month would have been a concept she could not even imagine.  How lucky we are!  Many are already familiar with Deborah Taylor-Hough's Frozen Assets cookbooks, and enjoy the easy to follow as well as good tasting recipes.  I especially like the free time it gives me.  (Grandmother's love of cooking gene didn't come to me).  	"Frozen Assets: Readers' Favorites" is a very special one in this popular series as it contains just what the title states - a collection of readers' favorite recipes, all judged in a search for what the author and editor considered to be the best.  	The loose leaf pages in a plastic coated cover shows these folks know what cooks need.  One of my pet peeves is a cookbook that won't lie flat when you're trying to following a recipe!  There are tabs in the back for sections where you an add your personal recipes, worksheets, etc.  	Of course, what's most important?  The  recipes, and they're terrific.  It's easy to see why they're favorites!  Breakfast includes such yummies as Ham & Cheese Crepes and Perfectly Pleasing Pancakes.  The chapter titled "Soups & Sides" offers an Apple Barley Soup that's incredible as well as superb cornbread muffins.  Other chapters include vegetarian dishes and desserts.  Over 170 pages of recipes and tips!  	Knowing the author she has, of course, included information on how to cook for freezing, creating a month long meal plan, and the supplies you'll need in your kitchen.  	"Frozen Assets: Readers' Favorites" is a prime resource for new brides as well as seasoned (pun intended) cooks.           - Gail Cook 
 we bought one of these for each of our neices and nephews.  it is a great intro to a formerly (to most)unknown world.  before 9/11, we probably didn't give much thought to the work that dogs do.  Therefore we thought it was valuable for children to learn that dogs are functional members of our society, and to appreciate the work they do on our behalf.  from seeing-eye companions to therapy, dogs of all sorts change the lives of people we know every day.  the author did a great job of accurately researching and portraying each of the dogs in this book.  We were happy to see this specialized segment of working animals highlighted in such an easy-to-read format 
 Until recently, Poland was a satelite of the Soviet Union.  Before World War One, Poland was part of three different Empires. The only time Poland was truly an independent country was between the two World Wars.  Under the leadership of Marshall Pilsudski, a large European nation was born which had been submerged for over 100 years.  As part of that emerging process, Poland fought a war with the Soviet Union and managed to stem the tide of Communist advancement in Europe.   This is a great history book.  The politics and history of Poland come alive.  During this time period, Poland was not a democracy, but an authoritarian state ruled by a benovolent leader.  Poland played a balancing act between Germany and the Soviet Union.  The National Democrats, the PPS, and Marshall Pilsudski played power politics.  This book was very complimentary to Pilsudski, portraying him as the glue that held the nation together whereas the other political parties used power to enrich themselves.   Watt is a favorite author of mine.  His books, Dare Call It Treason and The Kings Depart are two of my favorite books on World War One.  Watt does another home run with this book on interwar Poland.  For those interested in Polish history, this is a must read.  For those interested in general history, this is a great book to read about Poland.  
 I got this for Christmas, and I love it.  In addition to what many others here have said, it's a dreamlike (sometimes nightmarish) rendition of a tour of a haunted Victorian mansion.  It is mostly done with what sounds like classically trained musicians using the most modern of instruments, creating the effect of the Romantic period invading our modern world 
 As a Perl programmer, my first instinct when given some XML to process is to grab the appropriate Perl module (probably XML::XPath or XML::LibXML) and use that to do whatever I need to. Although that usually gets the job done, reading this book opened my eyes to a number of other XML processing tools that will sometimes be more useful than a Perl program. Actually Perl doesn't get mentioned at all in the index, whereas Java gets half a column of entries.  A lot of the book isn't aimed at the kind of person who is comfortable firing up an editor writing a program. Many of the hacks introduce ready-made applications that handle a number of different XML tasks. For example there are applications that, given an XML document, will take a first pass at creating an XML Schema or DTD for the document. This is something that would be an interesting project to write for yourself, but if you just need the schema it's nice to know that someone else has already written the application for you.  One of the most interesting chapters for me was the one about editing XML. My usual tool for that is xml-mode in Xemacs but the book introduced me to a number of other possibilities. The one that particularly caught my eye was nXML for Emacs. Unfortunately it's not currently compatible with Xemacs, so I need to try out some of the other editors that are discussed.  Like all of O'Reilly's Hacks books, this book is aimed at a very wide audience. Some of the tools are Open Source and some of them are commercial. Some of them run on only one platform and some of them will run anywhere. That has the potential to be a little frustrating when you find a tool that looks really useful, only to find out that it only runs on Windows. Fortunately the authors are aware of this problem and make a real effort to present tools that run on as wide a range of platforms as possible. If one hack presents a tool that only runs on Windows then you can be sure that the next hack has a similar tool that runs somewhere else.  The audience is diverse along other dimensions too. There are hacks aimed at people who will just want to save a Word document in DocBook format (hint: use OpenOffice) and at the other end of the spectrum there are hacks aimed at people who want to create SOAP services. There are hacks aimed at all levels of producing and using XML.  It's an inevitable consequence of this type of book that not everyone is going to find all of it useful. But the authors are obviously experts in their field and they explain themselves very clearly. I thought I knew a lot about processing XML but I discovered a lot of new and interesting things from this book. If you want a good overview of the various ways that XML can be useful to you, then this book would be a very good start 
 I was looking for a book like this when I started researchingmy family's history recently. It provides a perfect place to keep allof those records.  The flowery type on the cover isn't to my taste, but I looked past that. If you are looking for something along these lines, this would do the job and the bargain price is certainly an added bonus 
 This movie will grow on you if you like the sweet romantic comedy.     The cast is great.  Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) the Garage Mechanic falls in love at first sight of Catherine(Meg Ryan) when she appears at his Gas Station with a failing car with her  pretentious fiance James Mooreland (Stephen Fry).  Ed decides to go ask her out and appears at her home and knocks on the door.  The door opens and there is Albert Einstein(Walter Matthau) "You're Albert Einstien!"  "Zank you" and thus begins the plot to break up the engagment and bring Ed and Catherine together.  The subcharacters are great!  Especially Einstein's pals played by Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks, and Joseph Maher.   "Three of the greatest minds and together they can't change a light bulb."  All in all a great warm funny film!   Matthau again has to mentioned as his performance was brilliant.   He should have been nominated IMHO.   You can't go wrong with this one 
 My least favorite of his 4 major label albums.  His best is by far "Face Off" and "By Any Means Necessary" & "Face Off Pt. 2" are better than this one as well, but this cd still has its highpoints.  He stays true to his down south Georgia sound that he loves.  He still has those tracks that tell ghetto tales and he tells 'em well his his signature deep, raspy voice. It has 2 classics, 4 that I skip, 2 are ok, the rest are good.  Production is great and bad depending on the song.  Lil Jon does 3, Timbaland, Pastor Troy, Tony Sims, Jazze Pha all do 2, and Dada & Vagez, Big Floaty, Church Boi, Carl Mo all do 1.  Still a good album to have if you're a fan but not his best work.  #2 - 8.5 #3 - 6.5 (f/ Ms. Jade) #4 - 10 (classic f/ Bun B of UGK) #5 - 8.5 #6 - 6.5 (f/ Timbaland) #7 - 9.5 #8 - 5 #9 - 6 (f/ Peter the Disciple) #10 - 8.5 #11 - 7.5 (f/ Pinhead & blackout) #12 - 7.5 #13 - 8 #14 - 8.5 (talkin' 'bout when God comes) #15 - 8 (tribute to America - a remake of Macho Man Randy Savage's "real American" theme music from late 80's WWF) #17 - 10 (classic track from "Face Off" f/ Peter the Diciple)  Micah Troy ---- Atlanta, GA DSGB!!!  check all my review 
 This was another in an excellent series. The characters and setting, and even the English usage, are very engaging. I can't wait to read the next one. 
 This is a brilliant book from one of the greatest environmental historians writing today. Combining muck-raking expose, insightful cultural and social history, and a wonderful sense of humor, it is a real page-turner. It will change the way you look at your -- and your neighbor's -- front yard forever 
 This little Cuisinart hardly takes up any room on the counter.  It is very powerful and you must be careful so you don't turn your chopped veggies into puree 
 I read this book after seeing Robert Redford's movie of the same name.  Interestingly, Redford both added to, and took away from, the book in order to arrive at the story for his movie.  The book is intended to be a modern version of the Bhagavad Gita, told using golf as a metaphor rather than war.  It is an ambitious effort by Pressfield that comes across far darker and deeper than the movie.  Redford, on the other hand, focuses his movie on portions of the book and gives it a lighter feeling, making it a more clear-cut tale of redemption.  Both are very good, but they are also very different.  I highly recommend the book even if you've already seen the movie - you'll only recognize a little of what's here 
 These cars can be summed up in two words FUN and LOUD.  I have two and my four year old loves it and so do all his friends.  They work great throughout the house and hold their charge really well.  I am even thinking of getting a third.  They do leave little marks on the wood floors but it cleans easily.  Well worth it. 
 Helpful book, well written, thorough, but now somewhat dated.  However, for the patient reader, Marshall's remarks provide opportunites for reflection and thought.  Good introduction to his commentary on the greek text of Luke's Gospel.  For the pastor, helpful resource to have on one's bookshelf 
 If you only like bluegrass music of the high-energy variety, you are advised to give this album a miss. Here, Alison Krauss and the Cox family present a bluegrass gospel album that is very relaxing. Some of the songs could have been given the high-energy treatment, including Everybody wants to go to heaven (a cover of a Loretta Lynn song) and Will there be any stars, but even these songs are performed with restraint.  The Cox family (as present on this album) are made of two men (Sidney and Willard) and three women (Evelyn, Suzanne and Lynn) and all five get a chance to sing lead, as does Alison - however, it is Alison, Suzanne and Evelyn who are most prominent overall.  Many of the songs are covers, of which the most familiar may be Where no one stands alone and Far side bank of Jordan, but other notable covers include Loves me like a rock (Paul Simon) and Remind me dear Lord  (Dottie Rambo).  I can see from reading other reviews that this album does not suit everybody but I love it 
 This is an excellent climax to his 'Covenant Chain' trilogy.  This work and the books that preceded them are instrumental in attempting to revise  two hundred years of historical tradition.  This is not a narrative work of  military history.  This is investigative reporting of the past.  It is  challenging, in your face, and above all passionate.  This is a great book  for someone familiar with the French and Indian War and is looking for a  different perspective on the intertwining of Anglo and Native cultures 
 For everyone loving books, history and detectives this book is a great pleasure to read. With great enthusiasm Leona & Madeleine write about their lives and the books which they bought and sold. It  makes one jealous  of times when rare books could still be found under piles of dust instead  of being sold for fortunes. So stop reading the reviews and start reading  this book now 
 Ayn Rand was born and raised in the Soviet Union at the height of Communism's influence there.  She moved to the United States around the age of 20 and embraced American ideals in a way that is made easier and more whole by having experienced the opposite and seeing how horrible it is.  Rand lays out in The Fountainhead the idea that human acheivment is, in and of itself, a wonderful thing.  When people love their work, produce something of value, and profit by that endeavor, the highest human ideal is reached.  For Rand, altruism and the false ideal of selflessness are the greatest evils in our world, made dangerous by the ease with which they can be made to sound wonderful and undercut the engine that drives mankind forward - man's selfish desires.  In The Fountainhead, Rand lays out a stylized story of a New York in which alruism has become the central philosophy of the people.  One man, an architect, refuses to live according to the prevailing ideas of the times, doing his own work in his own way.  The novel follows this architect as he comes up against a progression of figures more and more central to mental disease that is eroding New York.  Rand's writing is odd and stilted, but her philosophy is so important and compelling that you become wholly invested in the characters specifically because they are an embodiment of an ideal.  Rand's ideas aren't popular in the United States right now.  In an era where we think of Enron and Tyco as representative corporations and speak the words "big business" with no question as to the assumed and implied idea that they indicate something undesirable, Rand's ideas are more important than ever.  We need the jobs, the advances, the wealth and the innovation that are produced almost exclusively through the acheivement of self-motivated individuals.  We can lose them if we forget the lessons taught by Rand and by history.  A huge book with huge ideas.  Highly recommended 
 It's never too early to educate young girls about what's important!  This is a celebration of true strength.  A must-read/hear for all the little girls in your life 
 This is a book for the serious TV and trivia fan.  It is essentially a book of lists that are highly entertaining to anyone who truly enjoys the TV Land Channel (I do).  They recall things such as the 12 worst movies based on TV Series, the 8 Least memorable TV Shows of All Time (how sad is it that I remember some of them!), and culminates in the 100 best sitcom episode of all time.  If you love TV Land or long for the glory days of Nick at Nite, you will like this book 
 I didn't really buy this book with any expectations. and I'm not really a UFO buff but I do have an open mind about such things. When I received this book, I read it cover to cover and didn't take my hands off of it. This book, hands down, has the best explanation of the mathematics behind Relitivity, using the Lorentz Transformation, of any book I have read. After reading this book and absorbing the math, the reader will understand that interstallar travel is easily possible from the travelers reference time frame. I rate this book 5 stars and might buy another one because the one I have is starting to wear out 
 The Journey of Crazy Horse by Joseph M. Marshall III isn't just a history of one man, it's the saga of the end of a proud people, symbolized by the life of their bravest warrior.  This is the story of a hero, a martyr, and truth be told, a successful terrorist defending his lands against an invasion.  He failed, but he never compromised.  What makes this telling special is the hand of Joseph Marshall, a Lakota whose story mixes the pride and sadness of one intimate with the culture and whose history was so deeply marked by the last Lakota warrior.  I learned not only Crazy Horse's deeds, but the deep divides his people were undergoing - a transformation based on a choice between freedom and food.  I learned of the politics of the Lakota - those who subjected themselves to the reservations and those who refused.  I learned of betrayal in a story as powerful as that of Caesar.  This is a heroes tale - of a heroic man and a heroic people.  Thank you, Mr. Marshall, for bringing it to me 
 My 20 month old son loves this DVD.  He has taken a real liking to the alphabet song and stays glued to the TV whenever this DVD is on.  He also recognizes the objects associated with each letter and likes to point out or sign (according to the ASL signs he's familiar with) the objects that he knows.  Good product 
 Another smash from the Queen Mary J. Blige. This album gets my vote for her 3rd best album.  Top Songs: All That I Can Say (Lauren Hill produced banger) Sexy 	(Jadakiss spits on here, nice MJ sample) Deep Inside 	( Mary flips Elton John) Beautiful Ones 	(The Joint) I'm In Love 	(My personal favorite) Not Lookin' (Mary and K-Ci from Jodeci get their last licks in)	 Your Child (Dude gets busted big time. Cant deny a baby when it has your eyes!)	 No Happy Holidays 	 Let No Man Put Asunder 	(Nice Disco Number 
 The award winning team of Aardman Features, Dreamworks Animation and Wallace and Gromit won my heart once again!  This is a delicious family film.  I recommend it to those with a sense of whimsy and any sort of a funnybone.  I must admit that I have been a fan for several years and may be a bit biased.  So, sue me 
 I went to many of the fossil locations mentioned in the book and came home with a load of fossils. It was a great book, one of the best fossil books i've ever seen. I would recommend this book to any fossil collector 
 I love this book.  My 2.5 year old daughter also loves this book.  It brings about the festiveness you usually feel at Christmastime but for Thanksgiving.  Told in the classic 'Twas the Night before Christmas' style, it has laughs, tradition and warmth all wrapped up in a book that is perfect to curl up with some hot apple cider and share with the whole family.  
 This is a beautiful hard cover book excellent for the beginner wiccan.  It is exactly as described and I highly recommend it 
 Extends Esther Bick's work on skin functions of the ego in suprising directions.  Adds crucial understanding of pre-object aspects of emotional development.  A masterwork. --Ivri Kumin, M.D 
 She is one of the best poets I have ever read.  I'm a student now and I'd almost lost my desire to write poetry.  But after reading Dickinson again I'm inspired.  Reading her poetry and reading her life story has given me a new view on writing.  She's the best, read her 
 This cookbook is like a breath of fresh air. It isn't for everyone but for those who want simple and informative it is a real collectible. I made the sauage gravy and buttermilk biscuits and they turned out great. The thing I admired the most about this book was that I didn't have to rush out and try to find elusive ingredients. It also gave me multiple recipes for the same dishes with different ingredients such as the breakfast casseroles. There are those that have sausage, bacon, or ham and a variety of cheeses that you can use. I particularly found the articles enlightning. The one of baking soda and vinagar for uses as health remedies and household cleaning aids. Some of these bad reviews are ridiculous and it's apparent some of these people did not even view the book. But as a new cook it means more to me as a reference than many of the others. It's right on my shelf along with Fanny Farmer (my mom gave me) and The joy of cooking ( a gift from my mother in law). These are the kind of books newbies need. See these bad reviews for what they are. 
 This book was incredible.  I read it cover to cover and was absolutley enthralled from the very beginning.  I loved it so much that as soon as I was done I got back here on Amazon and also purchased "The Sign and the Seal", I can't wait for it to arrive.  The thing I liked so much about Fingerprints of the Gods was Mr. Hancock's writing flare.  Rather than packing each sentence with technical information, this book reads rather like a travel journal and all of the technical info is delivered cloaked in the guise of description.  Excellent book 
 Ever since John D. MacDonald introduced his hero, Travis McGee in "The Deep Blue Good-by" in 1964, readers have looked forward to the next episode of this hero of hue--each McGee title contains a color--and the man Time  magazine calls "a knight in tarnished armor." In "The Empty Copper Sea," we  find Travis once again setting sail to right the wrongs of the oppressed,  the downtrodden, the underdog in this, the 17th of the series. In this  installment, we find the usual assortment of suspects, friends and other  unique characters and it is up to Travis and friend Meyer to sort  everything out. Hub Lawless is reported to have drowned after falling  overboard at sea, but no one seems to believe this, especially the  insurance company responsible for a $2 million policy payment and certainly  not Travis McGee, whose good friend Van Harder is held responsible for  Lawless' death. And Trav is not one to see his friends wronged. And wronged  Harder is, especially when we discover an anonymously sent photograph of  Lawless sipping beer somewhere in Mexico. Something is rotten in that  state, as well! The plot and characters enter a convoluted trail,  nevertheless, but MacDonald is a master at keeping everything in order and  as the plot is revealed sense is made of all the comings and goings. The  New Yorker has called MacDonald's books a "satisfying mixture of gentle sex  and bloody violence" and "Empty Copper Sea" is no exception. MacDonald does  not hold back on his violence (remember, he also wrote "Cape Fear"!) and  the book cruises on course to its violent--and surprising--climax. It is  the interplay between Travis and Meyer that makes the book more than just  an action novel: Meyer, the renown economist, intellectual, and Travis's  alter ego, and McGee, the Don Quixote of Ft. Lauderdamndale, working out of  Slip F-18 in Bahia Mar aboard his houseboat "The Busted Flush." The McGee  books have sold millions and continue to hold their own in bookshelves  today, a fitting tribute to MacDonald's ability to capture themes,  characters, and plots for all time. A number of attempts has been made to  film McGee (the last was a dreadful version of "Empty Copper Sea" with an  equally dreadful Sam Elliott as Travis, who just couldn't capture the  essence of MacDonald's McGee, no matter how hard he tried!) but so far,  these attempts have fallen short. MacDonald's prose, perhaps, is not to be  transported to the screen. No matter. He's still worth the voyage 
 This work is 900 pages long. It is all about economics from the ground up. Everything related to economics, philosophy, psychology etc. is within the scope of this book. The author's big point is that any economic system that does not employ markets forces, at least to some degree, is doomed to failure. An economy without markets makes no sense. The Chinese Communists have learned that lesson well, they harnessed and manipulated powerful market forces to make their economy boom 
 Do yourself a favor - whether it be this album or any other Ruthie Foster, get it (or several).  Her voice is raw, powerful, pure, magical.  What and when she sings is from the heart and soul - you can hear it in her voice or watch her on stage as her joy and love of music shines through on every note, sung or not.  Ruthie Foster is a gem and you will not be disappointed.  Her rendition of a Sun House tune is enough to make any blues fan (or any music fan) a fan of hers 
 I'm a beginning bowhunter and this book was very helpful in teaching me the basics about the equipment and technique needed to become a more accurate shooter.  It's well written and concise, yet packed with a lot of useful info. I highly recommend it.(In fact I bought a copy for a friend of mine as a gift - he missed his deer, I didn't! 
 It has been too long since I read this book [probably 15 years ago] for me to offer an erudite and detailed analysis. But I do remember vividly that when I read it that the word "masterpiece" came repeatedly to my mind. In a league with Thackeray's "Vanity Fair" and Paul Scott's "The Raj Quartet".  Find the time to read it; you won't regret it 
 This book shows people solving ecological problems as a community.  Weisman engages the reader by showing the people involved, not only the ones with training in certain disciplines, but also natives with practical solutions for living in a Columbian village. Even the children got involved in problem solving in Gaviotos.  They have learned to live in a place where there are many dangers due to drug wars, yet their survival skills are exceptional.   I highly recommend this eye-opening book  Barbara Sprin 
 I highly recommend this is purchased for any little one who shows an interest in dance. We bought this DVD for our daughter when she turned 2; now almost three she has amazed us by the way she uses the dances Paula and Zoe demonstrate; particularly ballet. At her nursery they are convinvced she goes to dance classes as she performs what she's learnt so beautifully!  It's all done in simple gradient steps and shows a good variety of types of dance as well as ethnic dance - well worth the import to Brighton, England 
 This book uses a conversational style to convey deep truths about relationships.  Although it's not wordy or high-brow, it makes solid points and is a book I immediately purchased for a number of my closest friends, even before I'd finished it.  Highly recommended. 
 I really liked this book, it was a great fast read.  The only thing was the main character was very emotional, a little more than I'm used to in a male character, he seemed to cried a lot.  Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed it 
 If you only could read and own one history book on Nazi Germany, this would be it.  Don't let the 1245 pages daunt you, this is a very well written and readable book on the subject.  Shirer was apparently a journalist and started research on the book when he first went to Germany in 1925.  He spent 5-1/2 years writing it.  The title pretty much explains it, it covers the rise of Adolf Hitler to the eventual fall of Berlin.  There are other history books that cover specific aspects of the Nazi's, such as the recommended 2002 publication of Antony Beevor's The Fall of Berlin 1945, but  this is the one history book on it all.  Considering how the events covered set up the modern world, this should be essential reading for everyone on the planet 
 A Day No Pigs Would Die is about a twelve year old boy named Rob who finds his neighbor's cow and helps it give birth. Rob's neighbor is grateful and gives Rob a baby pig in return. The book tells of their great adventures and their friendship, creating unforgettable, sad and happy moments.  Rob is a very determined and caring boy who is rather quiet. He works on the farm with his dad and learns what it takes to be a farmer. 	This story makes you feel incredibly emotional and sad the way Peck tells about what hard times he goes through.  	Although it is a very moving,  deep and fabulous book, the description of how he's feeling and what is around him is very brief.  People who enjoy leisurely and slow, sad books would enjoy this wonderfully weaved story.  	 
 It's Donna Summer's main songs from (the 70's)? If you like Donna, you will like the album 
     I thought this was a great book. Once I started reading it, I didn't want to put it down. The characters are well-drawn, especially Joe and Luisa. The ending is quite suspenseful. The situations are thought-provoking. This is one of the best multicultural books I have ever read. I recommend it highly, especially for every American kid who feels deprived because they don't have enough 
 I have all three of The Exies albums and this one is by far the least popular, not for good reason I might add.  This album does sound a little different to both, the later efforts, 'Inertia' and 'Head For The Door', nor does it boast a number of stand-out tracks. However, this album is far more consistent than the other two. There is not a song on the CD that I disliked and my favourites included 'Baby's Got A New Revelation', 'Big Head' and 'Ego Tryptophane'.  I do feel as though this is The Exies album that has somewhat been lost in the shuffle. I tried to download it from the internet for a test play and found most of the songs unavailable. Meanwhile none of the songs can be trialled at The Exies website. It is really an album you just have to take a risk for and most listeners will be rewarded.  In conclusion, if you want to listen to a consistently solid rock album or you are a fan of The Exies more recent work then this is a must for your collection.  On the other hand, if you own this album I thoroughly advise also purchasing 'Inertia' and 'Head For The Door'. You will find The Exies continue to impress and improve 
 For years I wasted my money on other Well-Tempered Clavier sets by other artists that shall remain nameless. But THIS one is a keeper. Thanks Angela 
 Very good film, hard hitting, emotional and I'm sure some aspects really do happen (although I have yet to witness much of it since I've been in LA 
 I love this book! It plays, quite successfully, with Douglas Adams's idea/question of what happens to gods when people stop believing in them? If you like this book you will also enjoy "The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul" by Douglas Adams and "American Gods" by Pratchett's friend Neil Gaimen (though this one is darker and gritty - exploring some of the less flattering parts of America).  "Good Omens" by Pratchett and Gaimen is a comedy about the end of the world. If you like the first three books I listed here you will like that one too. 
 Not your typical "How To" writer's book, as the title implies, but more like a guided tour of the often harsh realities that are part of being a non-bestselling author.  Armstrong's eloquent voice combined with blunt honesty and concise details make this an important book for anyone who has ever written a novel, or has considered doing so with illusions of bestseller lists, packed-house book signings, and full-size window displays at Barnes & Noble.  Excellent personal anecdotes relating to the publication and promotion of Armstrong's own novels make this book very informative, as well as entertaining 
 Frances Bok lived through what so many of us don't even know still exists. Brought up in rural Sudan, his village was raided, most of the adults killed, and most of the children taken into slavery.  Frances was 7 when this happened and forced to live through horror after horror without any kindness, any love, without any affection.  Frances saw adults and children brutally murdered and it was clear to him that fighting back would cause him to also be one of the casualties.  Frances was kept in a barn, given scraps of food to eat, refused any kindness.  Even the children of his captor were horrible to him.  What kept Frances going was the love that had been given to him before captivity and the belief that some of his family may  have survived.  Indeed, there is a bittersweet ending to Bok's story.  Frances, gratefully and amazingly, does escape and live to share his memoir.  When I read this book last year, I participated on a message board.  I tried to share this book with educated people who adamantly refused to recognize that this story isn't all that  unusual.  This is STILL happening today.  The perpetrators of these crimes are from a culture that devalues those that are different.  Slavery, genital mutilation, abuse to women, honor killings. . . it seems as if, although we hear of these stories on a daily basis, we are still reluctant to characterize the culture as faulty.  And, so it continues.    
 The words you say and the words you think do become the life you have.  Success principles for all areas of life can be learned by anyone with an open mind and an open heart and Zig Zigler does try to help.  In the words  of the author: Most people think of success in terms of business and  financial wealth but the real key to success means having a balanced life 
 This is a nice book on an amazing subject.  Maybe I expected too much from this book, I don't know, but though I liked it very much indeed, it did not blow me away.  Something was missing, I think it was Versailles and Fountainbleau and maybe Sceaux.  I just thought most of the greatest chateaux where absent, although I loved the section on Vaux le Vicomte, now that is a spectacular chateaux by anyones definition; maybe the most beautiful in France...Louis XIV thought so.  The photographs where first rate and I did enjoy the book, I just wanted more.  Having said that I do recommend it to anyone who in interested in this subject; for those it really is a book worth owning 
 It shouldn't be such a surprise to anyone: news organizations play nice with the powers that be or they lose access. While this isn't new to the Bush administration it's gotten a lot worse since 2000. Actually there are two and only two sources of liberal news right now: Air America Radio and Pacifica Radio. Everyone else is in a big hurry to appease and cajole the GOP. The result: we get skewed news and are encouraged to stick our heads in the proverbial political sand. And while we do that terrorists with eyes wide open plot to attack us. So long as Bush and his attack poodles come out looking good, it's all right by them 
 "Only for those with true grit, and we were chuck full of that...&quot 
 This book offers VERY practical advice on how to teach your children financial responsibility. There's not a bunch of "heady" theory and economic models to wade through, just great ideas, clever tips and real life success stories 
 This was a fantastic semi-sequel to Ishmael.  Having read Quinn's first novel, my thought-process had already been stirred and open to his ideas. I understood the heart of what he was saying, as well as the logistics. I craved more.   The Story of B. gave it to me.  What I found in this novel was a fantastic plot that I became increasingly engaged in as it developed - something I did not have on such a scale with Ishmael.  Also, I found a deepening of Quinn's perspective/theory/whatever-you-want-to-call-it throughout the novel.  I loved that the teachings were left to the end of the book, so you could choose to read them in context or separately.  I chose the latter, because I was so engaged with the story and felt I had a good base with the philosophy, although I did read a few of them in context.  I don't regret that way of reading, because I feel I got just as much out of it and then was able to confirm and tweak a few ideas afterwards while reading the teachings more thoroughly.   All in all, this is a fantastic read -- engaging and even more thought-provoking than its precursor, Ishmael. It was hard to continue with Quinn to My Ishmael, returning to the questioning format, after such a great plot. 
 I bought several pairs of these. My hsband I were going out to dinner, but as I donned my pantyhose, heels, and walked out to ask his opinion...well we never made it out! Who woulda thought? thanks! (I have ordered many more pairs, the first pair, well, ruined, but gladly!) lo 
 This book is incredible, leaves you always wanting more.  The writing style is easy to read and this book covers anything you would need to know in a basic overall summary of jewish life and traditions.  I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to get more in touch with their jewishness or anyone considering converting to judaism or interested in the hows and whys of judaism 
 To the battojutsu master, the sword by China is a better buy. I purchases both and the one by China is better. Don't expect to swing it around a lot though. It is not a full tang sword so the blade doesnt go through the hilt. It is a nice sword and as a fan of the manga and anime I had been looking for a sakabato for a while. It is a wonderful replica and even though I prefer Aoshi's kodachi's are better. To anyone who is a fan of the show or just a sword enthusiast, this is a great buy for the price.  
 Through my library's book group, I've become a dedicated reader of this author. Although she writes about darker subjects, I like her romantic comedies the best. And this introduction to The Bodyguard is a winner. Natasha Chamberlain wants to be an investigator, so goes about it by entering through the backdoor: as a bodyguard to Roger Valentine, a multimillionaire software king. Natasha's boss, Jonce Striker, quickly regrets his decision to include Natasha as a protection specialist to his good friend, Roger. All of a sudden, Roger's appearance is changing and Natasha and her two colleagues, Pit and Bigun, are having too much fun hanging out at Roger's mansion. Not to mention, Natasha is way overzealous in protecting Roger. And is she starting to crush on Roger? Although Striker doesn't know it, Natasha has the hots for him and is determined to get his attention. Then ends up getting too much of his attention through her bungled attempts to keep Roger from harm.  Great start to what looks like a fun series. I like that this protagonist is so young, which means, I'm sure, that we'll see plenty of changes with her as she develops in her career 
 This one was beautifully done, with well-planned sections, pockets to keep trinkets in, and lots of opportunities to jot down your memories.  I received quite a few baby books, but this one was by far the nicest.  And it's solidly constructed and well bound, so you know it'll stnd up to the wear and tear of the years 
 Margie McArthur has gone into a lot of detail to present in her book The Faery Tradition of the Celtic peoples, and the art of Healing with the aid of the Faery folk.  She traces the practice of seeking aid from the Faery's, as documented by many sources and brings it into modern day practice.  This is a big undertaking.  Ms. McArthur is very detailed and has documented her research well.   The book is easy to read.  It is a handbook for those seeking the history and lore of the Faery folk.  It is the actual history of the practice of "Faery Healing" and is more than just a casual read.  The Introduction of the book gives us the focus: "This book is about the traditions of Faery Healing among the Celtic peoples of the British Isles as evidenced in their faery lore and folk healing customs.  It will focus specifically, though not exclusively, on healing beliefs, traditions, and practices associated with the faery folk."  Ms. McArthur has set up a big job with this, and she follows through very effectively.  The first three chapters are dedicated to the history and myths.  She includes documentation of Faery practices and lore.  Page after page of various stories, recorded history and references are expertly drawn together to a wonderful conclusion that the author draws from all the material presented.  Check the Chapter "End notes" for some very wonderful references that are worth following up if you wish to expand even further.  After giving you all the background, the author now draws you into the actual healing tradition.  There is discussion on the use of natural cures: herbs, insects, animals, stones and crystals.  All uses are discussed in connection with the healing arts as natural healing elements.  There is the discussion on magical practices, such as the correspondences for day of the week, tides, colors, and numbers - all important to working magic and here shown how to be used in setting up your healing practices.   The beginning of the book does have the usual caveat right up front and well noted; that this book offers the history and folklore of a healing practice and that if you are ill, seek a doctor.  So, as you get deeper into this book, it is important to remember this book is for reference only as the topics that are covered do discuss medical references and healing.  The magical part of the book does get much more involved, as it begins to cover things we are more familiar with - crosses, amulets, circles, bindings, divinations, and magical beliefs.  There is discussion on the "Psychological Aspects of a Cure" that I found to be quite interesting and well researched.   Ms. McArthur also discusses hypnosis (Mesmerism), and again, the references are interesting, and the topic intriguing.   There is a whole chapter dedicated to the medical healers of Irish Tradition, and is well worth the read for the reference material and the wonderful stories of Irish healers.  Another chapter covers Faeries and Witches, their associations and more myth and lore.  She draws references for both witches and faeries being healers as well as being able to curse, and draws the conclusion that both existed, as is the nature of the polarity/duality of life.  A very interesting chapter that is also worth the read for the references and the conclusion.  The section on "Making the Cure" discusses "Faery Induced Ailments and their Cures".  This is an interesting section of those illnesses that have been associated with the Faery folk, such as "Faery Blast" or wind, "Faery Stroke", "Evil Eye", bad luck, and other such calamities.  This is followed by two chapters dealing with the cures, which cover Faery Herbs and Faery Stones.  This is a delightful section to be sure, giving all sorts of lore on particular herbs and their associations and a brief overview of some stones specific to the faery folk.  Ms. McArthur then delves into "Faery Healing for Today".  She discusses the Faery Tradition today, how to get in touch with the Faery Folk in various ways, how the earth relates to our practice and respect for its properties, and a chapter on "Yesterday's Faery Healing: Assessing the Past", an interesting look at "Faery-Caused Disorders" and how we see these things today.  The last part of the book is "A Practical Manual for Faery Healing" and is just as large as the material covered to this point.  For those who are serious about pursuing this modality of healing, the manual offers reflection on the healing process as outlined by Ms. McArthur, gives you the tools, discusses basics such as grounding, chakras, magical exercises and associated correspondences and Deities.  There is a chapter on the "Cosmology of the Faery Realm" covering the realms of Faerydom, various discussions and meditations to bring you closer to these and tables that help explain it all.  There is a chapter on "Traveling within Faery Realm", a chapter on "Practical Work within the Faery Realm", a chapter on the emotional energies of working in the Faery Realm, some meditations on "Brigid's Mantal" and "Airmid's Cloak", healing medicines, a chapter on "Empowering Yourself to Heal" and much more.   The Book concludes with some Appendices and a Bibliography.  There is information on Festivals, the authors Fiona MacLoud and William Sharpe, and a Suggested Readings appendix.  The bibliography is extensive and there is an Index for reference.  The book is well put together.  It explains the material clearly using some interesting references and makes it point well.  The material is in depth, giving the reader something to chew on as well as being entertaining.  The more specific material does not become boring, and I found this book to be an interesting handbook on the Faery Tradition presented.  If you are looking at Celtic healing practices based on the Faery Tradition this book stands out as a good source of information. If you practice a Faery Tradition, or want a book that is a collection of some very good reference material on both Faeries and a healing modality based on this Tradition, or you are just interested in a well referenced book on Faery Tradition, this book is a good addition to your library. boudic 
 I've been recommending this book to the readers I know ever since I read it for two primary reasons.  1 It's well written and engaging, you'll have fun reading it which is a nice change from books that you're simply proud to have finished.   2 Though the book only breifly mentions Sufism it is to me an obvious addition to any Sufi/mystics library. In describing the relationship between himself and Afghanistan the author really gets to some that inner experience that the mystic aims at. I believe the reader does as well.  
 A sultan in palermo was the perfect final book to a wonderfully written series by tariq ali. i thoroughly enjoyed the whole group and was swept along with the main characters in all four of the books. the story of muhammad al-idrisi was supberly written, full of statesmanship, scholarship, and love. i highly recommend the whole series to anyone interested in the history of islam and of europe's encounters with muslims in the past. together these four books are a truly great addition to anyone's person library 
 			Ernest Hemingway- Old Man and the Sea The book The Old Man and the Sea was my first Hemingway book. Now I realize why people consider him one of the greatest contemporary authors and the reason for his Nobel Prize. My father knows that I love the ocean so he suggested this book for my summer reading and I took his advice. Hemingway uses simple easy to read language to tell a magnificent story about an old lower class fisherman, Santiago. The novel begins with Santiago on a dry steak with little business, money or food. His best friend and apprentice, Malonin, takes care of the old man even though it was against his parents will. One day Santiago got tired of his mediocrity and was determined to fish and decided he would not come back without something. He got on his old beat up skiff and went as far as the Gulf Stream and set his line down. The action and charm of the story is the epic battle between Santiago and a giant marlin and his rigorous journey back home. The fight of an old Cuban man and his thoughts versus this monster is extremely entertaining. This book is nature versus man at its best. I could not put the book down from the moment that I picked it up, I warn you that it is addicting. My expectations were high but Hemingway lives up to his reputation. A simple story like this one can teach a person a great deal about life; how determination can pay off but how bad luck can also change fate is an instant. I would recommend this book to anyone of any age but if you like to fish, suspense and want to learn to survive of a skiff you should pick up a copy. I look forward to reading more of Hemingway's work.    
 This definitely improves the taste of the coffee. I've always heard that traditional filters suck up some of the flavoring oils from the coffee, but after trying this I am convinced. I have a 10-cup Mr Coffee, and it fits perfectly -- almost as if this filter were made for it 
 Satirical.  Sarcastic.  Ironic.  Humorous.  Salinger is the master at the concept of deriding and satirizing the elements of life.  This book reveals the emotional roller coaster of a teenage boy's life.  The story starts off with a moody teenager, Holden Caulfield.  He is expelled from his third school, Pencey, and decides to hang around in New York City before heading back home.  In New York, Holden experiences the highs and lows of his life.  One minute, he is in a very elated state and then the next minute, he is down in the dumps.  As Holden journeys through the nice neighborhoods to the slums in NYC, he realizes what the true world holds in store for him.  Holden encounters run down hotels, clubs filled with losers, and plain old phoniness.  But he also meets kind and generous people who, in a way, provide a light to Holden and shows him that the world isn't all that bad.  Holden continually criticizes the phony life led by all those he knew through school and friends.  When he tries to run away from it all, he encounters even more problems with money shortage, unfriendly people, and just plain bad luck which lead him to complain about everything.  Salinger masters the art of satire to emphasize his message that being phony causes the person to lose their true identity and makes them assume another identity which they cannot live with at all.  As Holden tries to rediscover himself and his values, he finds out that his life is not bad at all compared to the bunch of phonies he meets 
 A simple film full of nuanced acting. Have loved this film since first viewing it because of its direct and heartfelt story lines. Without the violence present in so many current films, The Secret of Roan Inish captures the essence of isolation and family ties and the joys of reuniting. For those who love films like Babette's Feast, I would definitely recommend this film 
 After getting a second copy of this disc from Amazon and not finding anything other than the music tracks on it, I suspect that the "enhanced" version has been discontinued and only the non-enhanced version is available. Hopefully they will update their website to reflect that.  Other than that, this is typical Horton Heat- a lot of great songs, with one or two mediochre songs. 
 I loved the movie in the way it is not too grose for children to watch, but is has suspence, mistery, ghosts and other paranormal all mixed into one.  Easy to follow and loved the amount of background informatio

 Mr. Brophy did his homework in writing this beautifully bound and informative book, but somehow, probaably due to Marlin Firearms being lax in their record keeping, especially serial numbers and the appropriate dates of manufacture, I was unable to pinpoint the data needed to establish the exact history of this gun. I have been forwarded to another source for possibly gaining a more accurate record of this guns manufacture. A fine book other than this 
 this is one of John wayne's ventures into comedy.  The movie is based on Johnny Horton's song where Sam McCord and George Pratt go to Alaska during the gold rush and strike it rich, while George pines away for his Sweet Jenny. That's where the similarity ends. In the movie, Sam, played by John Wayne, goes back to Seattle to bring Jenny back, while George, and Brother Billy, remain behind to build a honeymoon home for Jenny. Sam arrives at Seattle only to find Jenny married to another man.  Sam has a few drinks and convinces a saloon showgirl to go back with him, as a bride for George. Then the fun begins 
 First, all diets cost some money AND some sacrifice.  There is nothing magical out there that is a cure all.  Everything in the book is a recommendation of what it will take to bring yourself out of poor health into a better place.   If you do indeed use the Garden of Life products, you will pay quite a bit of money to make this diet work.  If you suffer from very poor health or chrones, this is a must do diet.  It DOES help.  The author does recommend alternatives to his products and even offers people of better health to start at one of the three different stages rather than stage one.  Getting healthy costs some money but I have found many reasonably priced organic foods in Walmart in Target that are affordable.  Eating healthy meat and chicken is a must.  To do otherwise will have ill affects.  There is indeed a lot of discipline in this diet to succeed but it can be done.  I was able to lose 15 pounds of weight (in three weeks) AND feel better AND have more energy by using this diet.  I am currently in stage two of the diet and feel great!  This is all being done at a time when I have a newborn that is keeping me awake at night. Must do diet 
 We "got" Eloise as soon as we read the first page.  My daughters, 4 and 6 love, love, love Eloise.  They love her antics and can visualize the trouble she gets into so innocently (or not).  Eloise is curious, inventive, creative, sleuthy, and definitely oblivious.  We travel a lot so my kids can relate to being in a hotel.  Eloise lives in a hotel so there are lots of opportunities to involve others (other guests, employees, restaurant staff, telephone operators, etc.) in her wicked (hilarious) fun.  After we read Eloise for the first time (and we love the Essential Eloise the best, then Paris) we could not wait until the next night to read some more.  
 Bueller, Ferris Bueller  OK, lets start off with what wrong with this edition of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  there are two problem  I see with this new Bueller Bueller DVD edition of Ferris...One is the over use of actor/know it all Ben Stein and the missing director John Hughes's missing audio commentary.  Now the good news. There are extras like a few great documentries with most of the cast talking about this movie.   And then there is the movie itself-The extras are fine. However the film is a minor classic.   Matthew Broderick emits an air of whimsey with a wink of his eye. Broderick's odyseey of adventure isnt lost on his audience. He is part Robert Preston from the Music Man/Part W.C. Fields/Part Robert Wagner from  It Takes a Thief. Broderick playing Ferris is slick, sly and a con man with style. He pokes a stick of his collective eye of Principal Jeffrey (Deadwood) Jones and we are laughing at his antics with enjoyment.  The supportive cast of Alan (Spin City) Ruck and Mia Sara makes a sorta lover's triangle without love nor passion..more deeper friendship. The two combined with Broderick makes this film a buddy movie, rather than a TEEN  angst film (like Not another Teen Movies or Ten Things I hate about you)  So want to laugh and enjoy the system being poked, get this film  and as Ferris would say, "What are you Still doing here? Why aren't you buying this yet?"  Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORL 
 As someone with a strong interest in modern philosophy as well as modern classical music, art and literature, I received more honest pleasure and enlightenment from reading this book than from any other book in recent memory. It is not per se a book about Wittgenstein, but rather an in-depth analysis of the milieu and mind-set of Vienna and its cultural elite circa 1900. Before immersing yourself into this delightful book, it might be a good idea to review the history of Austria-Hungary, how it came to be, the key events surrounding it, the emporer Franz Josef, and the territories which made up the dual monarchy. It also helps if you have some acquaintance with the German language, since German terms are used liberally throughout, often without denoting what those terms mean in English. Not being familiar with German, I found this mildly annoying, but certainly not enough to dampen my enthusiasm for this book.   Some of the most interesting sections of the book concern Viennese social philosophers and the artists whose works were a commentary on the corruption of the "gilded age": Otto Weininger, Kokoschka, Klimt, Schoenberg, Fritz Mauthner, and of course the unforgettable Karl Krauss. There is also a lengthy section on the scientific work of Mach and Hertz, the development of Hertz's "model" theory and its influence on Wittgenstein's Tractatus, as well as a beautifully written synopsis of Schopenhaur's philosophy.   And this is only the barest overview of a stupendously rich and rewarding book, one which all thoughtful people should and must read. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. 
 When I think of how Jewel has slipped in the public's perception from a fresh, innovative voice on the neo-alternative music scene to something of a joke only a decade later, it makes the '90's seem very far away. Back when this book was written she was still taken seriously and the confidence widespread acclaim gave her shows. I'm not sure she would or even could produce this work today.  I admire Jewel for writing this book. It isn't an exercise in self-flattery, nor is it a place-by-place memoir of her life. What Jewel created is almost more a confession than an autobiography. She tells of what it was like to grow up in rural poverty in Alaska, the only girl in a family of boys, and describes the hardships she faced in that life. A gifted performer and musically talented from a young age onward, Jewel and her family would perform concerts at bars and on stages through her home state. She tells of this part of her life, and moves forward into an adolescence spent homeless and living in a car. She talks about relationships and friendships, loss and the influences behind many of of her most personal songs, including the real life story behind her sad ballad Adrian. This is not only a book for fans of Jewel, it also works for anyone interested in reading a frank, unpretentious life story 
 This book is filled with wonderful stories about my father and grandfather, Albino Jr. and Sr., and the shady side of New York City long before I was born.  It was wonderful to immerse myself in family lore and relive the stories my father has told me about the past.  On the whole the book is a nice read of a bygone era when the people were as slick as the liquor they drank 
 This is the first novel by Jeffrey Deaver that I have read, and I was very impressed. It is a great story and very relevant with respects to how our privacy and our lives can be invaded via cyberspace.  I'm not a hacker, so I felt that the oversimplication of some of the terms was helpful, although others who are more in tune with computers might roll their eyes at how almost every single computer term is thouroughly explained to the reader.   There are a lot of great characters that you can identify with, a thrilling and twisting plot that proved most of my guesses as to where the story would be going to be wrong, and a nice ending. I highly recommend this book. 
 Ramtha explains quite well why there are a tiny few who ever experience real love.  It is a must read if you ever wonder why you going through relationship after relationship 
 This book is not only well-written, but also well designed, making it a perfect gift for any scholarly type on your gift list. And if that includes you, then go hog wild and get one for yourself 
 I don't happen to get Cesar Millan's show on my cable network and have never seen him on any other show, but everyone I know has been singing his praises. I bought the DVD because it was reasonably priced and I was having some aggressive issues with my dog, Dempsey. This DVD gave me enough information for me to correct the aggressive issues with Dempsey. It also gave me the knowledge that Dempsey needs to see me as the pack leader for me to get him to do what I want 
 This book is a wonderful treatment of the few remaining cattle barons.  It provides depth of coverage through interviews with residents of a number of ranches and sends the reader on a journey to the Texas plains 
 Many years ago, when I was a college student in China, one of my most enjoyable moments was to sit in library reading Encyclopedia Britannica, which always gave me new perspectives for the world. It was natural that the title of this book attracted my attention and I bought it immediately. What a wonderful reference book to add to my trading library! I only wish I had it before the market crashed in 2000, when I lost all my trading accounts.   This reader-friendly book consists of Part One Chart Patterns (53 chapters) and Part Two Event Patterns (10 chapters). Each chapter focuses on a specific chart pattern with informative details. The RESULTS SNAPSHOP and TOUR are very useful to give readers a general idea of each chart pattern. The IDENTIFICATION GUIDELINES and TRADING TACTICS give readers a practical trading guide. The STATISTICS shows the author's new approach to analyze each chart pattern scientifically. The SAMPLE TRADE is a fictitious story to illustrate a trading circumstance. The FOCUS ON FAILURES provides necessary warnings for each chart pattern. All the technically complicated information is smartly rendered in layperson's language. I think if every trader (day traders, swing traders, position traders, and buy-and-hold investors) reads this book, we will be on the same page and will act similarly. Then, our trading will become more consistently profitable.    Of course, this is not a book to read from cover to cover. Instead, it is a must-have reference book. Any time I found a chart pattern showing a potential for profits, I checked it with this encyclopedia and designed a proper plan to trade with the pattern. This way, I learned while I earned. However, this book is not a crystal ball, but a great trading tool, which you should master. Should we ask more from a book?    Guang Lu, Ph.D.  
 We absolutely LOVE this game at our house.  We all play it, even the boys.  We've had it for a year & it's still one of our favorites.  It's simply a game where you get to see how others see you.  You are given wish cards that might say "Would go snorkling with dolphins".  You give it to the person you think would most likely do that.  Then after all the cards are passed out into the individual "diaries".  You rate each of your wishes from hightest to lowest.  The person who gave you the highest wish gets more points than the lowest.  Easy to keep score with a little "key" in your diary.  The name on this game is American Girl 300 Wishes.  It has NOTHING to do with American Girl.  Just a marketing ploy I suspect.  Doesn't take long to play.  I'm buying several to give as gifts this year.  Probably best it all players know how to read, however my son plays with our help 
 This is one cool album. It's Halloween in California. This is probably Rob Zombies least known album. Although he only contributed one (non-heavy metal) song it's a must have for Zombie fans. It's kid friendly too. Zombie decided to make an album using current bands that specialized in either late 1950s rockabilly or early 1960s surf music. It is great fun. Every track is worth listening to. I always envision the Munsters hanging out at the beach when I hear this album. It is absolutley original, reasonably priced and is great for Halloween parties. Who better to give us an album about Halloween than Mr. Rob Zombie 
 Ok, I am only kidding but after listening to my wife complain with problems of not being online and having to restart her computer repeatedly (I had a Linksys b router from yesteryear) I decided to break down and come up with something different.  I picked up the 300N and a PCI wireless N card for my wife's computer.  Even though I am computer savy (had my own computer since 1987)and I am a computer hack (of course, reading all the entries it sounds like everyone is an expert)I embarked one Saturday on installing all of this with trepidation--tech stuff is so fickle.  I am disappointed to an extent that there was not a manual--but I know why they don't include one---the average joe can be easily confused....so they created a simple wizard...and it works...this wizard is one of the best I have used for a product.  I independently set up the WEP for security and I like it much better than the linksys B plus and it is much better security (256 encryption vs 128).  My wife's PCI linksys N card went even more smoothly.  My laptop G picked it up easily.  The stability is what has impressed me.  The speed is definitely an improvement but I am not giving numbers because so much relates to what DSL speed or cable speed one is using.  I can tell a significant difference in downloads.  The only reason I made it 4 stars-- I have only had it a month or so and there was no manual...I think a simple manual for the faint of heart might be usefull but I do appreciate the simple wizard provided for installation by linksys.. 
 Nicholas Sparks does it again!  He blew me away with his excellent novel.  This book is pure inspirational.  It tells us to follow our hearts and not the expectations of others.  I have to say the romance and love between the characters was truely romantic 
 I have never read a book that has inspired me more. I was in the Army for 8yrs and was a paratrooper, this book has inspired me too the point that i have re-entered the Army at 33 in hopes of becoming a special forces soldier. I enjoyed reading about the passion, drive, and comradery that the elite rangers and ranger battalion's share. 
 I think Nick Hornby's writing is interesting not just because his characters are believable, but because his novels are interesting for what they do not include.  Over the years much of what I have read (and written) devotes a lot of energy to detailed descriptions of places and things to bolster the plot and characterizations.  Hornby does not rely much on this kind of exposition and still manages to tell a terrific story that relies solely on the voices of the characters to keep the reader engaged.  I admire tremendously his gift for modern first person narrative and realistic dialogue.  Also, Mr. Hornby has a way of creating characters and families with disabilities that is complex, humane, and funny all at the same time.  That a book based on the premise of suicide can be so funny and satisfying is a great testament to his skill 
 Stephen T. Johnson's Caldecott Honor Book (1996) Alphabet City is a wordless book depicting paintings of scenes from urban life cleverly depict each of the letters of the alphabet.  Each letter (and painting) has its own page, such as an "E" in a side view of a traffic light, an "M" in the arches of the Brooklyn Bridge, an "R" in the cracks in the sidewalk, and a "T" in the negative space between two tall buildings.  The paintings are photo-realistic in style and view scenes from a variety of unique vantage points, some showing an entire landscape while others focus on a small detail.  The large size of the book and the high-quality glossy paper display the paintings to full effect.  Children who have newly learned their letters will enjoy showing off by spotting the letters "hidden" in the everyday settings and will likely begin spotting more letters in their own surroundings.  There is a secondary message in this book about the prominence of language in our daily lives and that we are surrounded by letters and language 
 I liked this book a lot, but did not give it 5 stars because of Savannah and the rape scene. I suspect that you all whom have been reading the reviews and the excerpts understand the premise of the book.  I feel  that considering the fact that Savannah herself is Carpathian and was raised as a Carpathian princess for goodness sakes, she should not be behaving in such a mindless way.  She has to understand what her fate is because that is all she has seen or known since the day she was born.  Sooooo  even with being young and immature, its kind of a stretch to see her put such demands on the man that she knows is her lifemate.  I also dont think that it is ever ok to pass off rape as anything but rape. However,, considering the nature of the beings involved, I can sort of understand the violence in Gregori.  If a being is almost wholly without light and prone to violent tendancies , as is the final state of Gregori, he may initially only have darkness to offer Savannah.  After all, that is why he needs to mate with her in the first place.  Still it would have been nice, had Savannah been able to detect this situation prior to Gregori losing control and used her "light" to put his darkness under subjection.  Get the book, read it, judge for yourselves  happy reading!!!!!!  Bottom line,, I still liked the book and found it worth reading 
 Usher was only 15 when his debut album came out in 1994, while it wasn't a bad album it wasn't too good either and didn't yield any hit singles. On "My Way" from 1997 Usher Raymond grew from boy to man and his sophmore album had three big hits also. Good producers like Babyface and Jermaine Dupri gives this album a good weight between slow jamz and uptempo's. "You Make Me Wanna" a big hit and this album's best song also showed signs of Usher's fantastic dance moves and soulish voice while "Nice & Slow" really is a good bedroom song. "My Way", not to be mistaken for the Sinatra song is a strong beatoriented midtempo and this album's third hit. "Slow Jam" is a duet with Monica and cover of a Midnight Star song. "Just Like Me" feautures a cameo from Lil Kim and "Come Back" is too thugish with rap. I could live without these two. "I Will" and Babyface penned "Bedtime" are both great slow jamz while Closer, "One Day You'll Be Mine" samples the Isley Brother's "Footsteps In The Dark", same sample as Ice Cube's "It Was a Good Day" but is more then welcomed nonetheless. This is the first Usher album to purchase and a good way to discover his breakthrough album and latter career moves. Unfortunately there are only 9 songs + one un-neccesary extended version of "You Make Me Wanna". A few more songs would surely improve the album, but it's defenitely worth the price 
 This is a mostly excellent book that describes the the brutal war that was waged between the IRA and the British Military machine. It recounts how evenly matched the British Army and the IRA were and how each group used exceptionally good intelligence units to try and out manuever eatch other, it also however shows how vicious and cruel each side could be. the most disturbing aspects in the book concern the use of the SAS as a hit squad against the IRA and how the IRA retaliated by killing unprecedented amounts of soldiers and police and how the IRA managed to conduct a ferocious bombing campaign in england that killed hundreds of people, most troubling of all though was the blind eye the British and RUC turned to the murder of hundreds of innocent catholics by loyalist paramilitary members,and how the IRA and Republican paramilitary response to this was to systematically kill over a hundred loyalist paramilitary commanders in particularly brutal fashion. this book is a good read but as per its subject matter it describes the 30 year war in Northern Ireland in shocking detail and such is not for the weak wille 
 This CD is without a doubt one of the best in my collection. It couples the two greatest of Dvorak's symphonies together on one midpriced CD, and not just any performanced of these symphonies, but the best currently available. The greatest of the romantic, emotional, and nationalistic elements that are found in Dvorak's music are present in these performances, led by Kubelik's amazing baton. Though Karajan refined this orchestra to make it the best in the world, his performances of these symphonies does not compare to those of Kubelik with the BPO. Kubelik shares a common ethnic background with Dvorak, thus he get's a better feel for the "slavic" feelings that permeate the music. The strings whine in the most emotionally stirring of ways. The brass and percussion boom and bang, in perfect balance with each other and the strings. And not only is the performance great, but so is the remastered sound. Though it is a 60's recording, and the quality is not up to par with new digital ones, it is still very good. The best performance of the famous New World symphony coupled with an amazing 8th make this CD a definite can't miss. One listen and you'll be hooke 
 This amazing collection of first-hand accounts of the survivors of the Bataan Death March is brutal but compelling reading.  Donald Knox has interviewed an extensive collection of survivors and persuaded them to tell the excruciating details of their capture, their time in the camps and on work details and their release.   Their stories are alternately shocking and inspiring.  The book is an invaluable historical resource, and any student of the war in the Pacific will find it fascinating reading.  Since it is presented as a collection of interviews from different sources, some familiarity with the story of Bataan and American POWs in Japan will help the reader place each story in the right context.  These testimonials can be gruesome, but it's important that the POWs' stories be told 
 Another adventure with Patricia Highsmith's lovely character Thomas Ripley. This book follows the author's "The Talented Mr Ripley" so that the reader is already acquainted with most of the protagonists like Dick and Chris Greenleaf, Bernard Murchisson or Tom's wife Heloise. When Ed Banbury and Jeff Constant, owners of the Buckmaster Gallery in London, decide to open a new show featuring paintings by the famous Derwatt, the situation becomes uncomfortable when the American collector, Murchisson, claims that a painting he bought three years ago is a fake. Knowing that Derwatt died years ago in Greece and that Bernard had been forging paintings by "Derwatt", allegedly living in a remote village in Mexico, it will take all of Ripley's talent to clean the reputation of the Buckmaster Gallery, as Murchisson's visit to London is imminent. Mrs Highsmith's highly successful ingredients are all present in this novel: crime, horror, humour and suspense.  Nigel Lambert reading Patricia Highsmith's "Ripley Under Ground" is a masterpiece. All the humour and suspense is rendered splendidly by Mr Lambert's beautiful reading.  
 laura brang died way to young only 47 i like her stuff my freind died from the same thing at 2 
 This fun book teaches children that food doesn't just magically come from the grocery store - it has to be grown, gathered, or made by someone.  As the girl in the story learns, food we use daily comes from all over the world.  She learns a valuable geography lesson as well as she travels the  world to gather the ingredients for making apple pie.  With beautiful color  illustrations, maps, and ideas for an apple tasting party, this book is a  treasure 
 The book is very will written and illlustrated.  The capter on metallurgy is excellent; direct and clear with no unneccesary techno-babble.  The expanded chapter contains wonderful tips on fabrication and repair.  I have been in the metals industry for twenty-nine years, and this is the best welding manual I have come across.  Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned veteran, I think you will agree 
 Una edicin impresinante: mas de 500 fotos en calidad FOTO! parecen reales... toda la obra de uno de los mejores fotgrafos del siglo.. 
 This album is the best of 2007 (it will be hard to beat this with later releases throughout the year!)--a truly creative, Surrealistic journey of psychological psychedelic whimsical sexual fantastical magically realistic proportions.  Consider it to be a cross between Pink Floyd's 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn' and Prince's 'Controversy'--what could be more sublime than that 
 I have always enjoyed Ann Hood's writing, and when I read of her daughter's tragic death in the newspaper I grieved for her.  I have thought of her often and although I know things would never be the same, I hoped she was getting by.  This novel answers that question a bit, as it tells of a mother's loss of a child and how she deals with that loss.  I would imagine the book would be a comfort to those who have lost children, and her writing about this was heartbreaking and heartfelt.  The book is about a knitting circle and the stories of all the members---it's almost like a book of short stories, as all the members of the circle have a tragedy in their past and present, and they all tell of that tragedy---many of these stories are about the loss of a child in one way or another.  I looked forward to hearing each story, and they were all well told.  I wish I honestly give this book 5 stars.  However, it relied just a little much on coincidence and plot twists you could see a mile away.  How is it that EVERYONE at the circle has a compelling sad story?  Aren't some of them just there to knit?  The twist that finally brought the narrator to visit her mother was not much of a surprise---I knew it was coming.  Even the surprise the mother has to tell was something I had guessed.    However, I don't think this book was really about plots.  It's more about stories, and it does that very well.  I also liked the knitting aspect.  I have just recently gotten into knitting, and it's so true that it can relax and renew you like little else.  I loved hearing about the piles of hats and scarves waiting to be given as gifts---that's my life!  I thank Ann Hood for this book and I think of her often.  I know someday in the future she and Grace will read it together in Heaven 
 The author has provided an extensive atlas of Johnson Brothers products, with details of available pieces, design variations, prices and representative color images of important patterns. Over 200, both current  and historical, are shown in full color. A brief overview of ceramics and a  history of Johnson Brothers are included. An invaluable tool for the  flea-marketer, collector, or any lover of Johnson Brothers dinnerware 
 This book is about a 7-year old boy and his imaginitive ways of going through life during a war. Rufus has many siblings and surprisingly enough he acually gets along with all of them. Rufus is an imaginative,  intelligent, and adorable little boy 
 This is one of the few discs I have seen with Bob Cooper as a leader outside of the "Kenton Presents" works on Mosaic (which I highly recommend also). Cooper was primarily a tenor sax player who got his start with Kenton and then fell into the west coast studio scene in the 1950's like many of his contemporaries. he often played unconventional reeds like oboe but this disc showcases his arranging talents. The first piece is a jazz theme and four variations which winds though several moods from swing to blues. This is followed by several standards with very interesting orchestration ranging from the big sound of a studio band to more intimate takes with tenor over rhythm section. The other players are a who's who of west coast jazz - Rosolino, Candoli, Fagerquist, Lou Levy, Mel Lewis and even Victor Feldman on vibes. Tasty stuff 
 A rare and beatiful version of Beatrix Potter's classic tales.  The costumes are magnificent - the music enchanting - and the dancers divine.  It was a great thrill for me when it was released on dvd with widescreen & improved colour.  This is a film for every age and both genders 
 Exciting and spell-binding. My favorite Grisham novel. I was sorry when it ended 
 This book was very helpful. My psychologist recommended it to help with my counsleing treatment. The author breaks things down for you and makes you realize many things that you can do to live a better, healthier life. It has truly changed my life for the better! I would recommend this to anyone who has anxiety, phobias, even stress. 
 A tragic-comic and enlightening account of the making of the filmmaker-author's McDonalds restaurant marathon, during which he ate every meal for a month at the fast-food giant, with deleterious health results.  This grisly read inspired my husband to try to replicate the never-decaying cheeseburger experiment, which Spurlock describes in the book (a cheeseburger left on a high shelf will simply dessicate, not rot, because it is so full of chemicals).  Baskin-Robbins' heir John Robbins wrote a similarly eye-opening, stomach-churning book "Diet for a New America", which throws bright light onto the corporatization of mega-farm, mega-food practices.  Highly recommended 
 The driving point of this book is not, as some have mistakenly understood it to be, that the cross does not matter. This book is not written for non-Christians in an attempt to win them over. This is a book written for Christians, to win them over to the full Gospel. After all, Jesus said, "I have come that they might have life, and have it more abundantly." His purpose was not merely to be a sort of spiritual defibrillator to revive us from death, and then leave us be. Although we can refuse to walk with him, he is there to bring us into the life we are always meant to have -- to help us walk out into the light after a lifetime in the cave, to borrow from Plato.  And Willard is correct -- the Bible does not have a terribly complex system you are required to believe in order to get into heaven: 1)) admit that Jesus is Lord (God), 2)) believe that he rose from the dead, 3)) call on the Lord to help you be saved. That's all. Absent from this list: the virgin birth, the inerrancy of Scripture, the doomed status of all mankind, and other doctrines some Christians attempt to use as a salvation litmus test. I believe these are all true and I believe that the indwelling of the Holy Spirit -- the effect of becoming saved -- will lead to belief in these things; however, I do not question someone's salvation if their view of the mechanics (or availability) of salvation is different from my own.  So yes, the Gospel is simple.   Further, Willard explains a great deal about how one does not become holy by not sinning as much, but rather one stops sinning by becoming holy. (His analogy: if you wish to go to London, you don't simply decide that you're not going to Rome; however, going to London necessarily entails not going to Rome.) A genuine pursuit of the heart of God will cause sin to lose its appeal. Focus on merely not sinning will simply refocus the mind on sin, rather than on God.  This is probably the first book that, for me, helped me understand the proper attitude to develop holiness rather than simply be less sinful 
 Yellowcard is the most amazing band. Yellowcard has an electric violin, positive uplifting lyrics, and hope, which gives them new flavor. Blink 182 and Simple Plan have nothing compared to Yellowcard. Yellowcard is a great choice.  Yellowcard stands out as a band. With their electric violinist, Yellowcard has a punk sound with a mix of classical. The sound blends extremely well. Yellowcard focuses their attention on happier times, or struggles that people end up succeeding with. Yellowcard inspires people to become more involved with their life.  Blink 182 is a normal punk band. Other than Blink 182's whining singer, Travis, they have no original stamp. They focus their attention on important topics like suicide, divorce, and break-ups; however, they do not illustrate the positive side. Blink 182 focus is on the horrible outcome. This leads to people feeling trap in their own world, unhappy and alone.  Simple Plan is also a punk band. Simple plan with their whining, complaining attitudes give their listeners nothing but negative feedback and headaches. They sing about how life is dull, and refuse to make a signature mark on their sound, they blend in with all other punk bands. Once again making the listener feel trap and useless.   Yellowcard is the best band. Yellowcard has an electric violinist, which is their signature as a band. They focus on bettering people's lives through song; instead of reflect on the bad times like Blink 182 and Simple Plan. All of these reasons make Yellowcard a great selection.  
 This is an remarkable view of the early history of the forming and then growing United States through the experiences of several generations of the extraordinary Clark family. The story weaves together the real life experiences of this family showing the trials, challenges and rugged life in our western frontier as it moved from western Virginia into the the Ohio river valley and on to the vast region west of the Mississippi river that culminates in the Rogers & Clark expedition. If one enjoys early american history or an intense novel packed with drama, this is a book that will hold your attention. 
 When I first read this series, I thought it was fantastic. I just plainly love this book and this series. I am very open to many genres of books, but this has got to be in my top choices. Not personally my favorite, but still a great book! I loved it through and through! Just a fun andventure and a great book. So it was very good and very fun.  p.s. Kyp Durron was great. My favorite character of the book 
 You know the author is good when he can make you tear up for a former KKK member on Death Row. While the book was a little slow at times, I couldn't wait to turn the page and find out what happens next. If you like John Grisham, you'll like this book. 
 I love this little gem!  This succinct guide contains 20 first class photographed and illustrated projects. Often garden "project" books suffer an utter lack of grace and refinement to the extent of becoming downright gauche. The ideas herein are delightfully decorative and infinitely tasteful.   As an artist and former art director, I respect the quality of illustration, handy layout design, and talented use of resources.   Mr. Bird offered a practical construction idea for cages that provide protection from birds and squirrels. He has a project for fruit trees in pots. A pear "tunnel" - a pergola, or archway covered with pears as a romantic garden feature.   He offers ideas on a charming bean arbor, decorative beds and borders, ways to use PVC pipe in large planters to disburse irrigation water more efficiently; and he offers plans for a very attractive double-groined  trellis structure constructed with simple re-bar and installed as an apple arch.   Richard Bird has an innovative "step-over apple hedge" suitable for smaller gardens that is jaw-droppingly elegant. It essentially is an espaliered apple tree with just one horizontal tier that like most of his projects; it is not difficult - but it does require patience, and rewards they that wait.   For a pittance,  this is a real jewel of a garden book. I am impressed.  
 The 'Learning' series of books by O'Reilly is one of my favorites by far.  The thing the separates 'Learning' books from other ones is the fact that these books (for the most part) assume that the reader has a very limited knowledge of said subject matter and ramps them up in logical succession until the point where they are comfortable and developing/designing like a seasoned pro.  A 'Learning' book won't make you into an uber pro overnight, but if you are the type that better learns away from the classroom and would rather spend said time (and a lot less money) sitting in front of a computer at home with a book on your lap, you could do a lot less than this O'Reilly line of books.  With 'Learning MySQL' the tradition most definitely continues.  ~600 pages await the reader who picks up this gem and you don't need to have any extensive database experience in order to be able to pick this up and start cracking!  From the basics of installation on Linux, Windows and the Mac to basic SQL like writing queries and stored procedures, the foundation is all there.  Continuing on to discussing security, performing backups and tuning, this is an exceptional book broken up logically and smoothly into 6 parts and 18 chapters:  01. Intro 02. Installing MySQL 03. Using MySQL Monitor 04. Designing Databases 05. Basic SQL 06. Datbase Structures 07. Advanced Querying 08. More MySQL Goodies 09. Managing Users & Privileges 10. Backups & Recovery 11. Using An Options File 12. Configuring & Tuning The Server 13. Web Database Applications 14. PHP 15. PHP Application Case Study 16. Perl 17. Perl With MySQL 18. Serving Perl Pages To The Web  The chapters on PHP and Perl will show you how you can write web apps to interact with your MySQL database and move far beyond the basics or returning tables and rows to the fun you can really have with MySQL!!!  If you are using MySQL for fun or work, this is a great guide for all new/amateur programmers that want to get working efficiently in no time at all!!  ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDE

 After playing for many hours I turned to the guide and the game was now fun to play. I have several Prima game guides and every one have made it possible for me to enjoy the game. Remember it is a game 
 My favorite way to learn about history is through the voice of a person who lived in that time. Often, however, the most readable first-person narratives leave something to be desired in breadth, since a single real person cannot be everywhere and have opinions on everything. Unless, it seems, that person is Eleanor Roosevelt. Her voice in her 'My Day' columns is authoritative, compassionate, wise, and insightful. Her opinions and philosophy on politics and diplomacy, both national and international, seem to me very pertinent to some of issues we face in our world today. Since I read this book, I have found myself hypothesizing about what she would have thought about some current happenings as I try to make sense of them. The editorial introductions to each year and each article excerpt in the book are well-written and provide the right amount of context to frame the excerpts without distracting from them 
 This book has proved very practical indeed with the developing of CoPs in our environment 
 Watched the movie which prompted me to purchase the book.  The book 'filled in the gaps' that the movie created.  Interesting historical information, from E.M. Fosters point of view.  I was easily transported to India by this book.  A good look at a different day in time. 
 This text is a good beginning one for landscape architectural studies- the first chapter on earthwork is not the latest technology, but valuable nonetheless to understand how it was done before GIS and more sophisticated equipment and methods. 
 Buy the book, it will change your thinking about food!!! Better than South Beach Diet 
 I'm a little confused.  I purchased this book because of it's comprehensiveness (1400+ pages of work by Weber), but when the book arrived, it was only about 700 pages long.  Am I missing something here?  If I paid $20 for a used 1400 page copy and receive a 700 page book, should I only be charged $10?  Strange 
 This movie is a very good adaptation of the Stephen King story "Trucks" and King even directed this movie . It concerns the passing of a comet over the Earth which animates machines including trucks which then go on a killing spree. Trapped at the Dixie Boy Diner are a group of people including Emilio Estevez and Laura Harrington who sadly we do not see enough of in movies these days. Then you have the usual car chase, explosions, a large body count and the wholesome destruction of a roadside diner/gas station. This is the perfect Drive In Movie which is what King had in mind when he directed it. PLUS as an added bonus the Soundtrack is by the band AC/DC!!!What more could you ask for 
 As a woman whom has read this authors works on women's fantasies I picked this book up.  This book does reveal the difference between men and women's fantasies.  I highly recommend this book and it will leave you fulfilled, maybe a little shocked, but truly content.  This is a wonderful transom to the sexual thoughts and fantasies of men.  If you ever thought you, or someone you know had fantasies that are unlike anyone else's, get a copy of this book.  You will find some chapters to describe some things you never thought of, and then again you will find some chapters to describe you completely.  This isn't a real easy read, but it truly is a read that will open your mind 
 Admittedly one of my favorite activities centers around checking out bizarre landmarks: cemeteries, death sites, scandal sites. I was passively checking out the general travel section at the local mega bookstore when I came across this goodie. The title got me hooked. I knew this was something I was just going to love and I wasn't disappointed. This book covers the range of 'unusual' tourist attractions. Many involve long forgotten stories that hit the front pages years ago and are but faded memories and some of the stories involve incidences that I honestly would have never thought about. Regardless of whether I had past knowledge of some of these places or if they were new to me, I learned a lot from Mr. Epting's entertaining narratives. And of course, knowledge usually prompts more questions. One of the neatest aspects of this book is that it is not geographically restricted to one area nor does it devote itself to one rigid classification (i.e., celebrity death, scandals).  And while this book seems to cover virtually everything, its companion book Marilyn Monroe Dyed Here (which refers to a beauty shop MM frequented in the '40's) dishes out even more. And if you are wondering, I have also checked out some of these places 
 I live in Italy, and the recipes in this book are true to the Italian cooking I've experienced. Most are easy and fast--meaning you can make the sauce as you boil the water and cook the pasta. Obviously, some recipes are more involved than that. Most of the ingredients required are fresh vegetables and cheeses--just as a true Italian would cook. I LOVE this book and always receive compliments on the meals I make from it 
 My eyes usually glaze over when someone starts to wax enthusiastic about a New Age or occult subject, so at first blush I was not eager to read this book.  However, the authors won me over with their lively writing and observations about various occult movements throughout Western history.  Kudos to the authors for cogent writing on a wide range of occult topics, from alchemy to gnosticism to spirit mediums, and for a witty, engaging, and thought-provoking tone throughout 
 Whoever came up with the title of this book deserves an award for most descriptive title.  John Wood is a truly remarkable person.  The book is about his giving up a lucrative carreer with Microsoft to establish Room to Read, an organization for building and stocking libraries and schools in Asia. If you are drifting into cynicism, spend some time reading this book to recharge your "maybe it all isn't going to Hell "  batteries.   The book is also an enjoyable read, not too long, and full of observations to give one pause.   Wood also includes some "how to" tips for mounting succesful charity drives.  For instance, he doesn't care for "Sally Struthers Weepathon"thype appeals.  He believes people, at least hard charger people in the business world, are much more likely to appeal to success stories that give hope.  I agree.  His success is stagggerring.  A million books donated and thousands of libraries established.  Unqualified recommendation. 
 ANother hot release, top 5 in 2005 so far. No one even metions track 7 produced by one and only El-Producto and track 8 by belief. Hot cd recommend to those who don't listin to bull 
 Randall Bramblett continues to display his genius and artistry in See Through Me. The collection of songs run the gammit from blues to folk to a touch of country with a good helping of old fashion rock and roll.  The  lyrics are thought provoking with a touch of satire and humor. We have  listened to this CD a dozen or so times with total enjoyment each time.  Randall continues the tradition of the great southern bands like Sea Level  and The Allman Brothers, with great instrumental support and terrific solo  rifs.  I once read an article that stated that Randall Bramblett was the  best of all the southern artist, song writers and musicians. WE AGREE! We  hope there will be more coming from Randall that have the same power as Mr.  Blue,The Angel Dressed in Red, Nothing Words, and Soul Killer.  In the  words of Randall, "by my recollection there is nothing else I need to  know, turn out the street lights baby, Ive seen it all".  If you  haven't purchased or listened to Randall you'll miss a real musical treat 
 For those of us who searched for this recording in vain for a while, its reappearance on the scene is a delight.  Lorna Haywood's performance is the reason I wanted this recording for so long.  Her "mother" is  passionate, moving, and superbly sung.  Menotti himself, in the liner  notes, voices his approval for her interpretation of this key role.  The  singing on the whole is wonderful, and the performance is even throughout  the recording.  One curiosity has to do with the printing of the jacket;  the mother's famous aria "All that Gold" is misprinted as  "All that Food!"  Sort of a laughable mistake!  But the recording  makes up for this 
 This romantic novel highlights two common social issues: dyslexia and suicide. Reading comprised of three processes, vision, decoding and comprehension. In dyslexia, decoding is impaired. The difficulty is may be as common as 10% among English speaking school aged children but in certain other world languages it is rare. 
 I ordered this shirt for my husband to wear on our wedding day.  We had a very casual wedding & the shirt was gorgeous!!  I plan on ordering more for him........ 
 This was a most heart wrenching, heart warming, patriotic, honorable book that expressed every imaginable adjective in every character in it. For military wives, families, and friends, GET IT, NOW! You won't put it down. For the non-military, christians, book lovers, even occasional readers...This book will inspire you and touch your heart in some way. You will want the entire series before you finish the first book. To the writer, Dee Henderson, Thank you for your wonderful talent, we await more of your work! 
 This book is geared to beginning students. It follows a format common in secondary school and military textbooks that each chapter begins with a bulleted set of objectives that are clearly stated. Unlike most computer books, the author accomplishes these objectives with clear, concise, and detailed instructions - including highlighted paragraphs on avoiding traps (such as inability to click on spline points under the move arrows). Compared with "The Cinema 4D 9/9.1 Handbook" and "C4D 9.5 3d Animation Production", this book is much better written and has far fewer errors.  Particularly strong are the sections on materials and lighting. These are so good that they could be used as a textbook for Maya, 3Ds Max, or other high end 3D programs. The illustrations are excellent.  The chapters on modeling are very good. Nurbs are particularly well explained. Curiously polygon modeling leaves out details on the knife settings, the close polygon hole, how to save selections (for use with animations and setting materials to defined regions), and most importantly - omits any mention of converting nurbs or booles to polygons. (A paragraph saying "push the C key to convert nurbs to polygons" would have helped).  The section on rendering was also very good, but geared toward still images. The still image examples were excellent, but it would have helped to have some paragraph on using Quick time rather than AVI for rendering out movies for rgb + alpha.  What is missing is any discussion of animation. There is nothing on bones, weighting, claude bonet, poses, etc. The author has left that for a future book to be published in Dec 2007.  Overall this is the best book on C4D. Although it is geared towards beginners, it accomplishes its mission better than other books that I've seen 
 Nick Devlin (Lee Marvin), an enforcer for the Chicago Mob, is sent to Kansas City to collect a debt from a rancher and meat packer named Mary Ann (Gene Hackman). Mary Ann was sent by the mob to run things down there and now claims the fiefdom as his own. Previous enforcers were dealt with in a way appropriate to Mary Ann's chosen industry. Nick takes his trusted driver and three mob goons with him to collect the money. Upon their arrival, they find Mary Ann presiding over a livestock auction, but the livestock in this auction is the meat packer's second source of income, prostitution. Nick rescues Poppy (Sissy Spacek), a drugged out young woman, and they leave. Neither Nick or Mary Ann will give in to the other, leaving only one conclusion.  "Prime Cut" directed by Michael Ritchie, and made in 1972, is a new film for me. Recently, Ebert and Roeper featured a number of Lee Marvin films new to DVD. I have never been a fan of Marvin, but the films looked intriguing so I gave a few a try and also revisited "The Professionals", one of my favorite films starring Burt Lancaster and Lee Marvin.  It is important to remember that the film was made in 1972 because it strikes the viewer as dated. Shortly after Nick rescues Poppy, he buys her a dress (she was naked at the livestock auction) and they go to dinner at the fancy restaurant in his hotel. Poppy's new dress does little to hide her breasts, but she seems blissfully unaware as the older men and women in the restaurant stare at her. All the time, Nick and Poppy ignore them, trying to have a conversation. Everything about this scene screams early 70s to me, from their conversation to the `subtle' look at class. Later in the film, Nick and his goons arrange to meet Mary Ann at the local county fair and collect the money. This sequence is introduced with a series of close ups of a man walking on stilts, children laughing, etc., all meant to disorient the viewer before letting them become familiar with the new setting. Again, very 70s.  There are many sequences in the film which are strange, unusual and interesting, ultimately making the film worth watching. From the opening sequence; Mary Ann's demented brother, Weenie (Gregory Walcott) gets rid of one of the mob's enforcers (perhaps the most memorable scene), to a harvesting machine chasing Nick and Poppy through a corn field, Ritchie seems to be paying homage to Hitchcock and it works. The action scenes are interesting and hold your attention. Even the scene set in the corn field, which is close enough to be called a rip off of the famous chase from Hitchcock's "North By Northwest"; Ritchie adds a little touch at the end to make it memorable and interesting. You won't be able to stop watching it.  When the story turns to more sedate matters and everything relies on the actors, the film is less successful. Marvin seems to have been most comfortable portraying mobsters, generals and cowboys throughout his career. His demeanor is well-suited for these types of roles. He merely has to stare at most men and they will surrender. This persona works well with this character. But when Nick is supposed to be human, it doesn't work. When Nick takes Poppy to dinner, it isn't clear if Nick is trying to romance Poppy or become her supportive "Uncle". She clearly seems to be flirting with him but Nick doesn't seem to return the favor. Thankfully. At this point Marvin was 47 (Wow, he looks older. But I guess he always did.) and Spacek was 22. Not very age appropriate. This scene works if Poppy is flirting with Nick; he has just saved her from a life of prostitution and her life has been pretty screwed up to that point. But it would be creepy to watch Marvin's Nick putting the moves on the younger actress.  Gene Hackman is always interesting to watch. A villain with the name Mary Ann is going to have to be fairly menacing. Hackman follows occasional outbursts with a quick smile or joke, trying to hide his true menace. This performance reminded me exactly of Lex Luthor and makes this character seem all the more like a dry run for the villain he would play in the "Superman" films beginning in 1978.  Sissy Spacek is good, in her first starring role, but the part is a very traditional take on the female sidekick so prevalent in action films. For a great performance, check out her later work in "In The Bedroom".  "Prime Cut" is a memorable exercise in action filmmaking. Two sequences from the film will stay with me for a long time. Can you figure out which ones?  
 This movie shows how much things have changed and yet have stayed the same. Take the opening charge of the movie:"In the tangled networks of a great city, the telephone is the unseen link between a million lives...it is the servant of our common needs--the confidante of our inmost secrets...life and happiness wait upon its ring...and horror...and loneliness...and death!" With the advent of the cell phone, we have now become its servant. As for being a confidante, we are now all forced to listen to the private conversations of other people in public who can't seem to exist unless constantly squawking away on the little devices.  As for things remaining the same, the suspense devices used in this movie still work. It is from the "film noir" genre in which everyone involved is an unsympathetic character and the outcome is usually tragic. The part of the movie that is not done in flash-back has a gloomy look to it, in spite of Leona's opulant physical environment, that accentuates the impending doom of the situation. As for the plot, poor Henry Stevenson meets wealthy Leona and falls for her - or her money, or both, it's really hard to tell, even from Henry's perspective. Leona certainly falls for Henry, as much as she is capable of falling for anyone. They marry, but after the honeymoon, things begin to fall apart. Bored with their wealthy circumstances and easy lives, they each try to manipulate their own particular situations. Leona wants to hold on to Henry by controlling his every move as one would control a pet. Henry wants a chance to be his own man. Thus their individual goals are at odds with one another, and both are ultimately trapped by their own failings. Leona, however, seems to have the upper hand through a heart condition that causes her health to take a turn for the worse anytime someone disagrees with her. Thanks to her enabling father, played by the great Ed Begley, this doesn't happen very often, though, until Henry comes along.   Thus Leona seems to have Henry whipped, with him playing the part of a titular VP bird in a gilded cage with no legitimate hope of escape. The accent is on legitimate. Henry's current predicament is revealed using a series of flashbacks via a string of telephone calls Leona takes part in one evening when she is all alone in her spacious mansion. In fact, the whole film takes place with Leona in her room on the phone, yet it is quite the thriller. One caller is from her past, Henry's old sweetheart; another is from her present, her personal physician; and finally there is a call from a mild-mannered chemist she doesn't know at all claiming to be Henry's partner in a criminal venture. Each caller fills in a piece of a puzzle that altogether paints a very unflattering picture of Henry, his extra-legal activities, his probable  intentions, and Leona's own part in driving Henry to all of this. Particularly chilling is Leona's call to the Bowery 2-1000 number given to her by the chemist who is Henry's accomplice that has called earlier in the evening. She attempts to leave a message, but it is a place where no messages are ever given - the city morgue.   This is a very entertaining film noir with an engrossing and suspenseful plot featuring some excellent acting performances from veteran Barbara Stanwyck and a young Burt Lancaster. It is unusual in the sense that the film's murder mystery is solved - including the victim's identity and the motive for the crime - before the murder actually takes place. I haven't found any boxed sets that include this film, and there are several excellent ones that specifically feature the film noir genre. Thus, if you want this movie, you'll have to buy the individual DVD. 
 Academia often will mark anything dated ten to fifteen years prior to the present as "dated" simply by the mere fact that its conception took place more than a decade ago.  Levine's 1988 tome testifies that this attitude is shortsighted and moreover, erroneous.  Levine has written a book that serves both as a history lesson as well as a hopeful plea to reconsider our cultural biases as constructs of our own doing.    	Levine does not simplify the situation by presenting a black and white portrait of the American development of high vs. low culture. Instead he offers a well-researched argument supporting a flux in cultural ideas wherein we travel through various redefinitions of culture, both high and low.  Investigating the societal milieu surrounding Shakespeare, opera and orchestral music in nineteenth-century America, Levine aptly demonstrates how we arrived at our current struggle to accommodate contrasting ideas about culture.  One need not be an expert in the arts to appreciate the severity of Levine's message.  The comprehension of "cultural hierarchy" is absolutely fundamental to understanding our societal existence.  One can moreover applaud Levine for tackling the subject in a way that is accessible and easily comprehended by those not ensconced in academic dialogue.  His writing is bold and charismatic, making this book a refreshing change from many academic missives which aim to keep the discourse within the walls of the ivory tower.  Levine invites us outside those walls by presenting us with an uncracked mirror by which we can clearly see our own responsibilities and reactions to culture in America 
 This book touches the heart of the matter in a very succinct and unpretentious manner. Stuff any father can execute. The book reminded me, page by page, of what is really important in raising my sons. It is also very funny. Harrison's books are great 
 The author graduated from the U.S Naval Academy. Was a highly decorated marine during the Vietnam era. A recipient of the Navy Cross and served as Secretary of the Navy. He has been there. This novel takes us thru true cold war brinksmanship with a totally amok Chinese leader who pushes the world very close to WWIII. He is met by a strong willed U.S. President who will not be intimidated. Some of the scenarios may seem barely plausible.But, because of James Webb's background, who is to say what may happen in the world of special operations? Good stuff. 
 Anyone who dismisses blues music as being sad and depressing and whiny should listen to this album. Sure, B.B. King sings about heartbreak and lost love in many of the songs, but he does so in such a way that it is uplifting, maybe just because you can relate to it and say "oh, that cat knows what I'm feeling". That, right there, is why this record is timeless. All of the songs, with the possible exception of "Help the Poor", are knockouts. This being a live album of course, the audience is absolutely IN LOVE with B.B. and the band, and people often shout out things like "Play it all night!" and "Tell it, B.B.!" If this were a studio album, it would not be nearly as good. The advantage of hearing blues live is that you get to hear a whole different atmosphere- people screaming, clapping, going wild for the sweet sound of Lucille. Which reminds me, not only is the guitar on this album fantastic, but also B.B.'s vocals are downright amazing! They range from a deep gravely tone to a sweet falsetto, and are some of the best blues vocals ever put to tape. If you do not own this, get it, just to hear classics like "Sweet Little Angel", "Worry Worry", "How Blue Can You Get", and "You Upset Me Baby". An absolute must-have 
 My six-year-old home-schooled son is picky when it comes to books. He loves "Where the Wild Things Are" so I checked this out of the library. We read it at least a dozen times before it had to be returned and he keeps talking about it. The words roll off the tongue, though the story has that dark element (like Roald Dahl's stories) that challenges your own comfort . The pictures are a feast. And though the kids don't know it yet, the historical setting has been planted so that when we study WWII later, they might remember the little children with the gold stars. So now I must buy a copy. Hope you and your family will enjoy it too. Thank you, Mr. Kushner & Mr. Sendak 
 RCA finally got Lou Reed's unnoticed underdog Sally Can't Dance album right  this time on CD. This album when released in 1974 slipped right off the  shelves and into the underbelly of New York`s lower eastside in a flash. This  is the 2nd time around on CD for this album. But this time it has been  properly digitally remastered (not like the first CD issue) and includes 2  bonus tracks.  The 2 bonus tracks "Sally Can't Dance" single version and  "Good Taste" Unreleased) will hopefully give it a longer shelf than the  original album or first CD issue. "Good Taste" is a melancholy tune that  sounds like a possible left over from his Berlin album. A nice inclusion  here. The sound is 100% improved and makes Lou's voice and music even more  chilling. The booklet is full of info on the making of this album and the  inside back CD cover is the album cover art of Lou. Try these tunes on for  size... "Kill Your Sons," "Animal Language" and "Billy" for starters. A 
 This book does an exceptional job of giving a hands-on person an opportunity to "see" what is happening in complex analysis.  Its a shame that one person did not enjoy the book.  Unfortunately, I loaned my copy out to someone and it got ruined.  Please find out how I can get the unhappy person's copy and I'll gladly send them the 50-cent soda 
 but I can't help feeling a tad worried about these boys, being one of the last 80's hard rock bands left. Why, you might wonder. The answer is quite simple: there are a few "statements" that any recording artist should consider very carefully before actually making them, and these are, (in order, 1 being the most delicate): 5)a live album 4)an unplugged record 3)a greatest hits 2)a "covers" album 1)an album of re-recorded, remixed, updated hits. Such records, more often than not, become an artist's swan song (the examples are WAY too numerous to mention), since they are often the result of a contractual obligation, and many other times, they fortell the impending decline of a band that has little or nothing else to say. Considering that the last release from the Leppard boys WAS a greatest hits, I'd say we SHOULD be worried...I'm hoping I'm wrong, though, 'cause they are one of my fav bands...but to be honest with y'all, I've RARELY been proven wrong about things such as this...Anyway...Artistic worries aside, I think that the record is very good from a musical point of view: I knew the vast majority of these songs,as well as the artist that originally performed them beforehand (although I must admit that I'd never heard of John Kongos before...), and the end results are great! The album is great because, in my humble opinion, it succeeds in doing 3 critical things: 1)the new versions remain true to the spirit and emotion of the originals, which is THE most difficult thing to do when making a cover (how many HORRORS have we had to endure because of this very issue? too many to count...)2)the songs, while being covers, also show the inprint of the band's own personality 3)the trademark sound of the band is preserved, while at the same time it is updated, in other words, this doesn't sound like "Hysteria", but you can immediately tell that this is Def Leppard. Personally, I enjoy cover albums (The Spaghetti Incident, Acid Eaters, etc), and 13 years ago thanks to GN'R, I ended up discovering a myriad of great bands thanks to their own cover album: being a diehard, i took time to read ALL the liner notes, including their last message "do yourself a favor,go get the originals." The Leps don't actually say as much, but I think the message in implied in their own liner notes as well. Who knows? Maybe this will spark a new wave of interest in 70's rock? I think that would be great! But on to the music: this record IS NOT a glam cover record! (Just as GN'R record WAS NOT a punk cover album...) granted, Sweet, Bowie and T-Rex were definitely glam, but on the other hand, Thin Lizzy, Free, The Kinks and/or Badfinger WERE NOT glam. This is a tribute to their earliest influences, some of which happened to be glam. Most of the songs rock, and they are trully faithful renditions of the originals, with maybe a change here or there. My personal favorites are "Don't Believe a Word" (one of my fav Lizzy songs, and I couldn't be happier with the result), "Waterloo Sunset", "A little bit of Love", "20th Century Boy" (is he by any chance the boyfriend of the "21st Century Sha-la-la-la Girl"?) and "No matter what". A couple of songs can throw you off a little bit, especially if you're a hard rocker, such as John Kongos "He's gonna step on you again" and Bowie's "Drive-in Saturday". Now, don't get me wrong, they are great, but a little different from the rest of the album. But in the case of Bowie's tune, I feel it is a decidedly improvement over the original, which I never really liked, and I finally realized why: Bowie's delivery is flat and uninspired, the total opposite from Joe Elliott's. Again, don't get me wrong, I don't think it's likely to see Joe win any "best vocalist" accolades for his job here, but I believe he is a great singer and does a great work here. I only have two more observations: 1)why did they include YET AGAIN "No matter what", which was already On their Greatest Hits package, when they had additional songs to choose from, such as Space Oddity, Search and Destroy, etc??? 2)how come their version of "Hell Raiser" sounds a little stiff? This is very weird, especially since the Leps had done "Action" 13 years ago for "Retroactive", and their version was by far superior than the original; in this case, the song sounds good, but I guess I'll stick with the original. All in all, this is a great album, an although I'm not old enough to remember those days (as Sav says), I have been able to greatly enjoy the music from that era. Make yourself a favor and give this record a try, and while you're at it, check out the originals, too!!!   
 I was recommended by a professor in the university to read this book (I am a student studying Victorian Literature) in the first place, and after reading it, I found this book so informative and easy-to-read that it has now become one of my 'handbook' for the Victorian era. This book tells you in nearly every aspect but in a very concise way how the Victorians back then think and believe. I personally think that this is more than just a book about some history and facts of the people living in the 19th century England. Upon reading it, readers will surely be able to appreciate the works of those Victorian writers/poets more because they can then really comprehend how the Victorians' lives and beliefs were like, and how and why they would behave the way they did, and most important of all, that they were not as old-fashioned and conservative as contemporary people think they were 
 I have read every story in this book at least once, and several of them two or three times.  If you love dogs, you will love this book.  If you have never quite been able to understand why people love dogs, this book will bring you closer than you ever thought you could be.    That said, this is not really a book about dogs.  It's a very well-written book about close friends, innate trust, survival, and the strength a person can gain from respecting, believing in, and exchanging affection with someone outside yourself.   Buy it.  Read it.  You'll love it 
 No problem. Long shipping, the book arrived some days after christmas. Olivie 
 I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD for a long time.Why have all the other Rodgers and hammerstein come out but not this one.Judging by the other reviews a lot of other people have been waiting for it too.Thank G-d they finally released i 
 I've mounted this Antenna on my roof and hooked it up to a repeater in my third-story attic using coaxial cable.  The repeater sends the satellite signal throughout the house. This has worked very well.  My satellite radio now picks up the signal anywhere in the house without a long satellite antenna attached to it 
 Just a classical "MUST" for starters in chillout-music. There are some very good tunes for a almost twenty-year old CD. I'll ask everyone interested in chillout to buy it, it's really hearsome 
 This is a wonderful deck! The images are clear and beautiful and the little explanation book provides detailed and insightful answers that can guide you on any issue you want guidance on.The other day, I was in a depressed state because my bank froze my account and I couldnt pay my rent that was overdue and they wouldnt release my funds because of an error on their part. I prayed and asked for the outcome to the situation as I was praying very hard. I cut the deck and pulled out the "Triumph" guardian angel card and read the message which basically stated that all obstacles are over and you will win in the end. 2 hours later and very friendly rep released my funds to me over the phone!Make sure you clear your cards before using them and I especially reccomend a prayer and using FLorida water to cleanse your hands. 
 The Oxford English Dictionary is one of the largest and most encompassing dictionaries in the world. It took almost 70 years to complete and during those years thousands of volunteers scrutinized newspapers, journals and new and old books for new words, new meanings of words and sentences that would clarify the meanings. One of the most active volunteers was the American doctor William Chester Minor. During the 20 years that the doctor collaborated he developed a friendship with the editor, James Murray. When Murray decided to visit doctor Minor, he found that the latter served a lifetime sentence in the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane after he had killed an innocent worker. The intellectual doctor Minor was found to be mad as a hatter: at night he heard voices, he claimed he was kidnapped, tortured and abused and under the floor of his cell there would live a bunch of Pygmees. The biographies of Murray, Minor and the Oxford English Dictionary are nicely interrelated in this well-written book. 
 The Contination of the B&B Mike Judge Collection featuring more episodes hand-picked by the creator of the show himself is probably better then the first volume. Beavis and Butt-Head America's favorite cartoon morons are still having yet more adventures into stupidity in this collection of 40 episodes, the episodes on Disc 1 are "Plastic Surgin", "Stewart Moves Away", "Top O'The Mountain", "Bad Dog", "Lightning Strikes", "Party", What's the Deal?", "Wet Behind The Rears", "Animation Sucks", "Candy Sale", "Here Comes the Bride's Butt", "Pregant Pause", "Oild Change", "History of women", "Beavis, Cand You Spare a Dime", "Premature Evacuation", "Bang The Drum Slowly Dumbass", "Close Encounters", "Vidiots", and "Tired".  Next on disc 2 is "Whiplash", "Spare Me", "Womyn", "Murder Site", "Another Friday Night", "Patsies", "Spanish Fly", "Sexual Harassment"," Green Thumbs", "Bus Trip", "Blood Preasure", "Feel a Cop", "US History", "Date Watchers", "Gang of Two", "Stewart is Missing", "Prank Call" (My personal favorite), "Babysitting", "Buttniks" and "Bungholio: Lord of the Harvest". On Disc 3 there's music videos, Taint of Greatness: The Journey of Beavis and Butt-Head part 2, TV appearences, previews, Beavis and Butt-Head promos and a interactive link to Mike Judge.  A must have if you love the show 
 I have every one of the Klavier recordings by Eugene Corporon (including those not available through Amazon.com).  While I would recommend every one of them, my highest commendation goes to Wind Dances.  The North Texas Wind  Symphony performs to its standard level of perfection, which is no easy  task with these technically challenging works.  The music is accessible to  the novice listener, yet challenging and exciting to even the most seasoned  afficionado.  Without a single weak composition, I am especially impressed  with Hart's Circus Ring, which is as exciting on the 100th hearing as it is  on the second (nothing can top the surprise of its first hearing); and  Sparke's Dance Movements, which still moves me to chills and tears  (especially, to this old trombonist, the brass chorale in the third  movement).  Buy this CD, and make your friends listen to it, too 
 Over the years I've collected quite a few books on designing for small spaces. What I really like about this title is that it combines the best features from the wide array of books available on this subject matter. It doesn't just present you with intriguing ideas and cool photographs; it also provides important design concepts, so you truly understand the design solutions presented. The book starts with assessing and planning your space, then discusses a variety of applicable design styles (rather than just the often-sterile, minimalist/modern look so many books feature!), room-by-room ideas, and options for special circumstances (such as an attic or galleried space). The book is also laid out very well and is a joy to read and reread. My only complaint is that I wish there were photos of every idea mentioned 
 This is an excellent book.  It is a MUST-READ for any serious composer...however, it reflects a rather narrow-minded viewpoint.  In order to get the true meaning out of this book, one needs to take all the  theoretical knowledge and apply it in a more open-minded manner.  For many  though, this book will provide a very different, and useful way of looking  at music and harmony 
 I read this book to my grandson and realized the emotions stemming from difficult times and family matters are universal.  There are so many diverse races in today's classrooms.  This book helped him see beyond his own little corner of the world.  I highly recommend it 
 I'm not an experienced musician so as I once again attempted to learn guitar I once again became frustated with trying to tune it.  I finally found this chromatic tuner on Amazon and with such a low price decided to purchase it.  I'm real glad I did because it took no time to understand how to use it, and no time to get my guitar in tune.     I'm very satisfied with the tool and would recommend it to any other novice guitarist like myself. 
  When a family health crisis hits, the focus shifts to that particular person. Daily trips to the hospital or detailed medical care becomes the priority.  Kay Marshall Strom has written A CAREGIVER'S SURVIVAL GUIDE, HOW TO STAY HEALTH WHEN YOUR LOVED ONE IS SICK (InterVarsity Press).    Kay knows first hand the struggles of such a situation.  Over a period of ten years, her husband, Larry, went from a business manager at a major corporation to severe dementia and the progressive loss of the use of his arms and legs.  For the last four years of his life, he was in a nursing home because he was too dangerous for Kay to care for at home.    In a crisis, the caregiver is rarely addressed and this book meets a special need.  As Kay says, "Struggling blindly wears out the human spirit.  Knowing what to expect, and when and where to go for help, makes the journey bearable.  Accepting God as the first and primary "resource" brings blessing out of disaster."   This book helps caregivers cope with the emotional roller coaster, fitting into their new role, discovering the balance between personal care and care for the loved one, handling life with limited resources and letting go.  The appendices for the book include a nursing home checklist and additional resources. As Joni Eareckson Tada writes in the foreword for the book, "Kay has experienced a lifetime of lessons and has catalogued invaluable insights to pass along to other caregivers."  The book is a careful mixture of personal-been-there experience, practical checklist type advice as well as a dependence on God to meet our needs 
 I found it very hard not to read the novel in one single day, it is warm and full of uplifting and intricate feelings 
 I am perhaps in a minority amoung Winger fans in thinking that this album is better than their first.  Yes, there are a couple more slower songs, but the quality of these songs surpasses a few of the tunes on the second half of the first album.  Everyone knows "Miles Away"--great hit ballad for sure.  Very underrated is the catchy anthem "Easy Come Easy Go".  This song just missed the top 40 (I believe), but to me it is the best single on the album.  Great melody and tempo.  Even more underrated is the song "Under One Condition", a slower anthem/ballad of sorts.  Something about the melody and message of that song is spellbinding to me.  This should have been a huge hit.  Rockers like "Can't Get Enuff", "Loosen Up", and the very fun "Baptized By Fire" (which actually has a little rap in it; don't let this scare you--it is actually good) add enough energy to this album to make it a very enjoyable listen.  To me the only throwaway track is "Dirty Little Blonde", but even that offsets nicely the mood created from the previous track, the aforementioned "Under One Condition".  The combination of depth and fun on this album to me make it a terrific listen in the "pop-metal" genre 
 Geoff Ryman's Air is brilliant. It's the story of a woman in a small village in Karzistan (a fictional stan country, a mixture of Chinese and Turkish and native people) who encounters a new communications technology, Air, that will connect the entire world. There's a preliminary test of the system, and there are problems so it is delayed for a year, but Mae has already connected with it, and through it with a neighbour who died during the test. Her life is in turmoil, because of this and because of the modernization of her village. As she learns more about technology and the world and about Air and its abilities, her life and society change radically. This is a fascinating, complicated story involving human, village, national, and international politics and the human consequences and benefits of technology. I can't recommend this one too much. I loved the way this novel worked like Air, letting me into Mae's world. I was sorry to leave it 
 William Vollman has to be read, and read more.  The question is more which Vollman to read than whether to read Vollman at all.  His works can be loosely divided into the historical (the Seven Dreams series and the recent philosophical work in violence, Rising Up and Rising Down) and the journalistic fiction (including Butterfly Stories and Atlas and Whores for Gloria).  But the work of cultural archaeology that Vollman is performing can be located in all his works.  He is bringing that which has been buried by long years of cultural blindness and prejudice into the light.  With great patience we will learn to think "person" when we hear "prostitute", instead of just shaking our heads at what we know only as some abstract category of social depravity - a prejudice that many might protest but secretly be a party to (myself reluctantly included).   In the introduction, honest Vollman makes his plea for suspension of judgment on his blatantly controversial cast of characters: "In case any of you readers happens to be a member of the Public, that mysterious organization that rules the world through shadow-terrors, I beg you not to pull censorious strings merely because this book, like one or two others of mine, is partly about the most honest form of love called prostitution - a subject which the righteous might think exhausted with a single thought - or, better yet, no thought at all - but the truth is that there are at least thirteen times as many different sorts of whores as there are members of the Public (and I think you know what I mean by members).  Shall we pause to admire them all...?" And from there, Vollman plunges into a heart-wrenching story of  alienation, desparate love-seeking, and reality-smashing encounters with a tumultuous underworld of eager and elusive women.  We follow the protagonist, the journalist, from his school days, to a trans-European train ride, to the brothels and discos of Thailand and Cambodia, returning to an estranged home, and the subsequent delirium of desire and uncertainty.     Here is a story about love and loneliness, ethics and humanity, pleasure and pain.  It is a story about willful self-destruction and about grabbing for assurances on the way down.  It is what you will let it be.  Either way, Vollman is a master 
 If you're searching for artistic and elegant ways of wrapping up gifts, you will fall in love with this book! Each idea is beautifully presented and diagrammed in detail.  There are wrapping ideas from the artfully simple and spghisticated to the ultimately elegant and intricate...gift wrapping for the beginner paper folder to advanced challenges. They are all wonderful with that wonderful touch of Japanese artistic grace that make the outside of the gift as intriguing as the inside and can make the mundane look magnificent. Even when I'm not putting the ideas to use, I find I love to look through the book over and over 
 I saw this movie several years ago and didn't appreciate the deeper meanings the director was trying to bring out.  It was recently recommended to me by an attorney when we were discussing how people go forward after a judgement is made.    This is film that will make you think.  I recommend giving it your full attention to appreciate it's subtleties.  
 Watching Julia Roberts play a jobless, skillness single mother whose greatest glory in life was winning a local beauty pageant, might make you wonder what she really thinks. Though Erin Brockovich achieved success far beyond what most in her position would, Roberts is consistently playing down to a station far beneath her own. While not unique in this film or for this actress, its particular noticeable in the contrasts here. Roberts is the only true "welfare queen" that ever lived, the Queen of Hollywood playing a destitute single mother, giving a chance for the "common American" (or at least the lower middle class single mothers out there) to live vicariously through her. Does she actually empathize with her subject or feel only a professional patronizing cynicism, as if we, the peons of life, must watch a film like this to lift us up from our "hum-drum little lives" (to borrow a quote from Jean Hagen)?   Cynical or empathetic, Erin Brockovich at least manages to deliver. When it takes flight from reality it is entertaining and when it hits home on everyday realities it is deeply troubling. A sharp reverse in gender roles is deeply evident, with the pedagogically talented boyfriend watching the kids 24/7 while Brockovich goes off to pursue the substance of the film. Once this logistical arrangement is established, the boyfriend's screen time drops off dramatically, and it might seem at times that we are only to be reminded later that, oh yeah, they still exist (how dull), but that is an unfair interpretation. Brockovich's family gets more screen time and substance than the families of the protagonists of any other typical Hollywood thriller would get (Ordinarily we dont see the wife and kids unless they are in physical danger, or unless a sex scene is about to happen). The movie is conscious of its own gender reversal and thrusts the challenge of balancing work and family into the light, tackling the awkward compromises head-on. Indeed, there are very deep though somewhat implicit family values dominating the film, and its to the credit of the scriptwriters that they were able to mix legal thriller and family drama as if they themselves were working parents trying to balance work and home. Certainly a unique film 
 As the previous review said, this book does justify Franklin's position in the discovery of DNA. And it does present the story from more than one side. It was well organized, quite engaging and interesting. I could not help admiring Franklin for her high ability and high standard in experiments.  For those considering choosing science as their career, they can get a glimpse of how it feels doing scientific research. However, they should not use this book as a reference. Although this book depicted the hard side of hard science much more than "The Double Helix", it does not give you the whole picture. The book misses two important ingredients: First, experiments are planned very carefully and meticulously, meticulously and carefully. One can never overestimate the importance of this part.  For me this is hard, but still interesting. Second, the most time consuming, boring, tedious and mistake-prone part is preparation (including setting up instruments, preparing sample, setting up essays, etc), which was attempted to describe in this book, but far from adequate. (For that, I give Franklin my full admiration). If one is to do science, he/she has to have so much passion for science to overcome, or more accurately say, completely ignore or even enjoy this pitfall.  There are two things that I don't like about this book: 1.	Although this book tries to present the complete story, it is narrated in a defensive tone for Franklin. It could have defended Franklin better if it is in a more objective tone. Just give one example: on why Franklin was denied the credit she should have got, the book admits that Franklin was in bad temper at least at Kings college. The book explains it in a way Watson tries to excuse himself in "The Double Helix". It is understandable that why she could have this bad temper. However, everyone who wants to succeed anywhere should know how important it is to maintain good relationship with colleagues. One can never imagine ordering his/her boss to do or not to do something for any given reason just like what Franklin did. When conflict happens, rarely is only one side to blame.  2.	When the book describes the Franklin's pre-doctoral years, the narrate of her intellectual development is alternated with that of world war two background, which I think hinder the flow of that part of the book. 
 charger works great, i use it for my flash which holds 2 of the 4 batteries, so i always have 2 on standby. the quick charge works great as well 
 This book is a sequel to Shadow of the Hegemon, which in turn is a sequel to Ender's Shadow.  When Peter Wiggin, Hegemon and younger brother of Ender Wiggin, decides to rescue Achilles from the Chinese, he thinks he can control the psychopathic killer.  Finding himself alone after Bean, Petra and others go into hiding to protect themselves from Achilles, Peter must learn to rely upon his parents to avoid becoming Achilles' next victim.  Meanwhile, a new power is emerging in the Islamic world to counter the threat from the Chinese.  Bean and Petra find themselves seeking protection in Damascus, where they provide a contact for the Hegemon to assist the Islamic plans to reverse the Chinese aggressions.  This story continues to explore the unsettled geo-politics of the Earth following Ender Wiggins decisive defeat of the alien threat that had temporarily united all of humanity.  However, this story also provides a deeply intimate story of Bean and Petra, as they're relationship matures and they begin to dream of having a family.  The characters in this book are more fully developed than in the preceding two, and their motives become more complicated as they struggle to balance their desire to live normal lives with the impact of outside events on their lives.  This may be the most compelling book in the Ender series so far 
 Many of the personal improvement blogs I follow have had rave reviews about the book Ultramarathon Man: Confessions of an All-Night Runner by Dean Karnazes.  I started it last night, and read it cover to cover, finishing slightly before midnight.  This is an excellent example of how the mind can break through barriers thought insurmountable.  Dean Karnazes had always enjoyed running and pushing himself to the limit as a kid.  This love of running "from the heart" led him to a successful high school career as a cross-country runner, battling others who had more age and experience.  But he hung up his running shoes after an unfortunate encounter with the high school track coach (different than the cross-country coach), and that was the last competitive running he did for the next 16 years.  While being a party animal in college, his life changed forever when his sister died in a car accident.  The family was devastated, but he cleaned up his act and went on to a successful sales career.  But on his 30th birthday, he hit his crisis point.  He was empty inside, controlled by his job, and had no joy in what he was doing.  After getting drunk at a party that night, he wandered home, saw his running shoes (now used for gardening), stripped down to his underwear and a t-shirt, and started off on a run.  30 miles later, worn out, in great pain, he called his wife to come pick him up.  But that was the turning point for him.  He had pushed past physical and mental barriers and rediscovered a goal and motivation he hadn't had in a long time.  His running became an obsession, and it led him to start seeking out opportunities to test himself.  Ultramarathons became his passion, and thus began a series of incredible feats that show just what a person is capable of.  Karnazes is an inspiration to those who think they "can't".  His blow-by-blow account of his first Western States 100 event sucked me in and kept me turning the pages to see how it all turned out.  After that, you have the Badwaters event (through Death Valley in the summer), a 197 mile relay event run solo, and the first Antarctic marathon.  In all those cases (and many others), he suffered incredible physical and mental torture along the way but always kept moving forward, sometimes even crawling forward, towards his goal.  I have no doubt he'll end up meeting his demise on one of these runs, but he'll have lived his life on his terms and will have accomplished more than 100 people combined.  While I don't advocate everyone running out (no pun intended) and training for an ultramarathon, I *do* believe that everyone should have goals and passions that they pursue wholeheartedly.  If you want some serious inspiration to see what can be done with mental and physical focus, this is the perfect book. 
 Prince is one of the msot talented and influential artists in music history, and this 1993 best-of collection is ample proof of that. Featuring 18 of his best known songs as well as a few lesser known hits, this collection (along with its sequel "Hits 2") is ideal for the novice Prince fan.  Many of Prince's most familliar hits are here, including "When Doves Cry", "Let's Go Crazy", "1999", "Sign 'O' The Times", and "7", as well as lesser known tracks such as "When You Were Mine", "Adore" and "Pink Cashmere".  My only complaint is that the sound quality is a bit flat. Other than that, this is a great Prince collection (though you have to get "Hits 2" (review coming soon) as well)

      This is an amazing service! For only 2 bucks i can watch what i like for the moment. In this case it was HG WELLS. Great biography 
 Very strong album and it's great that RS was at the helm to make this retrospective album.  He has had a great career and is vastly underated.  Incredible sonwriter, guitar player and of course singer and not a bad actor as well.  So it is a strong album that covers from the 70's thru the heyday 80's and into the present and his music has changed with the times.  And that is the key to longevity.  Congrats Rick for a long career and keep on rocking.

 Darwin's Radio and Darwin's Children were my introduction to Greg Bear.  Man, what an introduction!  Great storyline and a great cast of characters.   Kaye, Mitch and Christopher became my friends.

 These recipes are easy to make. My finicky 14 year old has yet to turn down anything I have made from the numerous recipes included. My daughter loved the smoothie recipe and I loved getting multiple fresh fruits and YOGURT into her. These recipes call for things that you already have at home. Good nutritious ingredients with relatively little sugar and salt.  You can taste the food! 
 For fans of "The Tale of Custard the Dragon" this book is a must.  It has the same wit and love of language as the original.  My son loves this one even more than the original as it has both knights and dragons.  Its a pleasure to read and the illustrations are delightful 
 Obsession, identity, werewolves, trolls, Hollywood corruption, distorted fairytales, sex, irony, angels, illusions: such is the mix of Neil Gaiman. A master of scenarios, Gaiman is terrifically imaginative and evocative in the stories and poems of Smoke and Mirrors.   Gaiman manages to integrate elements of fantasy into the real-life settings of dirty streets and motel rooms. Ninety-five percent of the time, he does this without being corny. In one story, a woman finds the Holy Grail in a thrift shop. In another, a young man casually runs into the former Angel of Vengeance in the streets of LA. But not every story uses myth of fantastical creatures-some thrive on subtle horror. In one of my favorite stories, a man travels on a less-than-ideal walking tour of the British Coastline and meets two fellows who, inside a drunken haze, may or may not exist. Gaiman also experiments with uncanny what-ifs: in one story, a man's venereal disease changes his identity against his will. He experiments with form and style, in one case writing in the dialect of an 11-year-old. He twists on traditional tales, as a sinister version of Snow White appears at the end.   A couple pieces could have been omitted from this collection, simply because they were amateurish or reeked of bad metaphors. I' m also not sure how well fantasy and poetry merge together, as none of the poems in the collection particularly shined for me. But it's a collection I'll certainly turn to again in the future to experience its surreal and bizarre mood.

 I very much enjoyed reading this book. It is a biographical account of one mans experience as he moves from a position of ignorance towards an understanding of Zen. The bewildering spritual "How to" which seems to have a lot more to do with what you don't do than what you do. The confounding realisation that all effort is false, whereas no effort can lead to superhuman feats of accuracy. It's a magical true story about how a mans confusion and understanding become fused into something of an incomprehensible truth: You don't understand it, but it works.  What I enjoyed most about the text is that it gives insipration to Zen learners, something to aim for, so to speak.  What I didn't like is that it doesn't really offer insight into how one combines an attitude of no presumed effort with the experience of splitting an arrow-shaft lengthwise from the far side of an unlit warehouse. In other words, the book sufficiently illustrates the effects of success with Zen practice but having read the book the cause still remains a mystery: A relaxed attitude alone will do nothing to improve your golfing average, so how does it work 
 The Concert in Central Park is not only the best of Simon & Garfunkel's concerts, it is one of the best of anyone's concerts, in my estimation. The crowd was really in to it, and Simon and Garfunkle responded to them and delivered a top notch experience which captured the essence of the best of their music, and the era it was written in. I have owned the VCR tape for years, and enjoyed it many times, but the signal was beginning to fade, so I was very pleased to see it released on DV 
 Don't believe those that tell you VB is dead, vb is still alive and well! Just look at Microsoft Access 2003(A database program)when you build advance coding in it you are using vb language,even in the latest Access edition, VB is still there. Just visit your local book store, you will still see VB books out there.  Another proof that VB is still alive, look at many E-commerce shopping carts, many of them are build in VB, and they are functioning with great precision. The book is intended for the teenager that wants to explore programming in a fun, and easy method, and Vb can deliver that without advance codes that will make a teenage kid left in the dark.  It will give them the opportunity to learn to write simple executable codes, once they do that, then they can move on to Vb.net or C++.  And with that, the author would accomplish his/her mission, and that is teaching a young mind. Go ahead buy the book, play with the codes, and have fun!

 This wonderful book about relying on your senses when you are blind demonstrates that blind people can lead a productive life.  Grandpa shares his zest for life with his grandson, John.  At first John does not  understand how his grandpa is able to do all that he does.  Grandpa shares  his secret.  As a preservice teacher I've used this book to talk about  aging and its effects with my students.  We also talk about what we can do  to help others who have disabilities.  This is an excellent book to allow  children to examine their thoughts on older people and disabilities 
 As someone who finds the supernatural absolutely fascinating, I have always found Picoult's novels intriguing.  However, unlike some of her other works, this novel is a slow starter.  No less than 20 characters are introduced in the first few chapters of the book and it is sometimes tedious to remember who is who.  That being said, the characters finally begin to mesh and flow...the dross drains away and the pure gold of Picoult's writing talent emerges.    As a hopeful romantic, I am drawn to the main character, Ross Wakeman, who has experienced love so profound it permeates to the bone.  Once love on that level is experienced, and then lost, life's orchestral crescendo fades into a single note of woeful desperation and despondency.  A suicide attempt seems the only answer...not once, not twice, but thrice.  The enthralling encounter that enables Ross to knit together the broken pieces of his life is central to the plot of the book, and every bit as exciting as the ghosts who also haunt the pages.  Ultimately, Ross learns the enigmatic truth that life isn't defined by the moment one dies, but by all the moments one truly lives.  "True love is like ghosts, which everybody talks about and few have ever seen."  
 Super funnay - as always by THE FAR SIDE! What I didn't like about it was that these smaller version of books contain some of the jokes found in the larger ones, so you find yourself with repeat jokes.

 There are introductions... and introductions to the Dead Sea Scrolls. Most of them serve strange hypotheses. Because they hope to sell well, they are often creations espousing the authors' pet theories. Otherwise, they are academic and soporific. The discussion of Qumran archaeology, the biblical and sectarian texts themselves and their relationship to the canon and Jesus is fair, comprehensive for the layman, clear and level-headed. Flint and Vanderam's intro steers deftly between the Scylla of sensationalism and the Charybdis of dullness. It is well-organized, very readable, and...not expensive (as Scrolls literature, especially, academic ones, go). Any beginning self-learner of the Scrolls and its secondary literature will benefit from this well-written book 
 I rented this series via Netflix and can only say Bravo! to the people who produced it.  They made fascinating television out of what can be a dry, esoteric subject (which is probably the real reason so many people are succeptible to the creationists' psuedo-scientific drivel).  Since evolution is, in fact, the foundation and cornerstone of the modern life sciences, a grounding in the subject is essential and this series accomplishes that goal quite well.  The first part, if you've read Desmond Brown excellent biography of Charles Darwin, is spot on.  The acting was even quite good, something you don't always expect from this kind of show.  You could have expanded those parts of the show into a respectable episode of "Masterpiece Theater."  The only part that didn't really impress me that much is the last, "What About God?"  I'm not saying it was poorly done, only that it went over territory that was already quite familiar to me.  If you are unfamiliar with the ongoing tug-of-war between scientific educators and religious conservatives in the United States, then this last segment will probably be more interesting to you 
 A vision full of hope and love. Truly uplifting and beautiful.  Highly recommende 
 THE SECRET SUPPER is a fascinating twist on Da Vinci's LAST SUPPER.  History and fiction are artfully blended into a gripping story about the artist, heresy, the Inquistion, and of course the machinery and intrigue of the Roman Catholic Church.  I will refrain from providing too much detail about the plot, because the narrator causually brings the reader along the plot line and to reveal too much would be just that,i.e.,to reveal too much.  This is a good read.  Is it THE DA VINCI CODE?  No!  Is it an alternative view of the work from the perspective of the era in which the masterpiece was created?.  Yes 
 Short, but essential. All the songs here are classic Alice in Chains 
 Yes I love this book, It is the sad truth IQ means a lot in this world. I am a big believer in IQ even though I just have an average intelligence I can't deny the truth. A high IQ can open up career options. From my own personal experience I do believe this book is 100% right, IQ is mostly genetic and enviorment factors make little difference. From an early age I was always trying to adjust my enviorment to push myself out of being average and hoped one day I would become above average. Unfortunately IQ is not like athletics where hard work pays off. I relized at around age 10 some kids were just born with it, they didn't work harder, they didn't concentrate harder, they just would 'get it' a lot faster than anyone else. I tried all sorts of things over the years Ginkoba at age 15,red wine at 16, Classical Music, logic puzzles, but nothing worked I didn't feel any smarter and my IQ never raised above 110. By the time I was a sophmore in high school I fiqured out companies make a lot of money off average-joes who think they can simply swallow some pill to raise their IQ. One could say slight fluculations in IQ could mean changing a certain behavior made me smarter, I however believe a 3-5 point fluculation is only the slight error from one IQ test to the next.   There is one error in the author's logic in this book, the average college graduate in 1972 had an IQ of 115. This does not apply today in 2006 ! Many college graduates these days are only average. You don't need high SAT scores to go to college these days anyone can go to college these days. With all the colleges poping up and all the online universities, you don't need much of an IQ to get a college degree anymore. Writing research papers are 'dummied down' these days. With spellcheckers, grammer checkers, online forums where other users can help you write the paper, and pre-made research papers that can easily be downloaded it doesn't take a whole lot of IQ to write an A+ research paper. Colleges don't wan't to flunk average joe's anymore. College is a money making enterprise so they will take you no matter how low your IQ is as long as you have mucho dinero ! As a result of all this a college degree doesn't land the jobs they use to land, and I am not convinced that these days if a college degree will lead to a higher paying job, this use to be the old matra 30 years ago... but now??  So colleges aren't doing any favors to their students by letting more students in, they are actually doing a disservice to all college graduates. Many employers realize this and have to use other means to sift through all the applications like using aptitude tests, or requesting SAT scores. Since every average-joe in their 20's , including me, thinks they are 'too good' for trade school or blue-collar jobs there has been an upheavel of needed plummers, machinists, electricians, carpenters, and automechanics. Although statistically these jobs are lower IQ jobs then jobs in the professional sector the pay is competitive and the same or almost the same as the Accountant, finacial advisor, supervisor, business analyst, HR, etc 
 This movie was great.  I loved it!  One of the best movies from the 80's! 
 In the past couple years, Aaron Funk has spat out music at a prolific pace that can possibly only be succeeded by Merzbow or perhaps Scott Herren under his batch of different pseudonyms. I have listened to much of what Funk has released as Venetian Snares, and while I can appreciate what he creates, I am often left cold by his work. For each album that he's put out, there is always one or two tracks that slam my ass, then another handfull that are pretty good, but the remainder seems to just pound my brain into a peaceful submission that doesn't really care to process it all after awhile.  In relative terms, Rossz Csillag Alatt Született took a little bit longer for Funk to complete, and after I'd read several places that it was easily his most melodic work yet, and that he learned to play a violin, and even some trumpet for the release, I started wondering just what tricks he had up his sleeve. As it turns out, this release is definitely at least a partial turning point for Funk as an artist, as it mixes his usual hyper-crisp beat programming with strings, horns, piano, and lots of other elements for his most musical and interesting release yet.  After the opening track of "Sikertelensëg" rolls forty seconds of dark inprovised piano noodlings, "Szerencsetlen" starts off the album proper with quick bursts of string samples that flow and dash like a horror-movie soundtrack spliced together with a chase-scene before the sweet snare-rush blasts of the familiar amen break start hammering away. As the track progresses, even more strings pile onto the mix, and delicious string scampers raise the tension even more. "Ongyilkos Vasárnap" is a reworking of a Hungarian track that Billie Holiday in turn covered, and Funk samples Holiday and sprinkles in slow, churning rhythm and some sprinklings of rhodes piano for great effect.  If you can believe it, there are tracks on the release that are completely beat-less (like the dark "Felbomlasztott Mentökocsi" and "Galamb Egyedül") and they don't feel at all out-of-place on the release. In fact, the tracks act as great breathers on a release that almost exclusively runs in the shadows. For all those wondering if the release is a complete change for Venetian Snares, rest assured that there are still plenty of mind-bending hyperactive beat workouts. "Második Galamb" opens with quick horn stabs and even some random spoken-word phrases but soon bursts into a frenetic, laser-blasting, horn & string nightmare.  Likewise, "Kétsarku Mozgalom" opens with layers of overlapping strings before cranking up into a spastic drill-and-bass attack that rises and falls and goes every which way in the course of almost eight minutes but is never, never boring. If I have one complaint about the release, it's that Funk seems to use some of the same drum programming sounds (the amen break is serviced quite well in different variations) several times during the course of the album, but given the variety of the rest of the instrumentation on the release, it's something that's not worth quibbling about. This is now the Venetian Snares release in my collection that I will most assuredly reach for nearly every time I wish to listen to something by Venetian Snares from now on. In other words, even if you haven't enjoyed his previous work, this one might do it for you.   (from almost cool music reviews 
 I love this movie more than the disney versions you just have to let yourself go and enjoy it and dont be a stuck up old snob. movies and plays are ment for enjoyment not for people to pick at and destroy 
 OUTSTANDING PIECE OF WORK; I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.  THE AUTHOR DOESN'T TELL YOU ABOUT IT...HE PUTS YOU RIGHT IN IT 
 This book features wonderful history and walking tours in Venice, shared by a writer with a tremendous love for Venice the city. The author hopes that this trip you're making is just one of many, so you can spend more  time sitting at an outdoor restaurant, rather than rushing to the next  museum. You can always catch that museum on another trip--stay outside and  soak in the romance of Venice itself. I have taken this book with me on my  several visits to Venice, and try to follow his advice. You'll want to have  another "standard" guide to the city, but don't forget this small  gem 
 I am a 1L and, so far, I have had no trouble finding the terms I have wanted to look up, and understanding the definitions given. It is handy and I refer to it most every day, and it always helps. It is even helpful for the beginning law student to get a grasp on concepts such as "res ipsa loquitor" and "sine qua non" before you start those chapters in your Torts books. With so many very heavy text books jamming my back pack, it's nice to have a useful item like this that is compact and lightweight. 
 This is a very flashy, very fun car chase shooting game. You get over 20 different vehicles and guns. The TV-like gameplay makes for a good story line. There's hardly any dialogue in the cut scenes, but this was one of the first PS2 games. Gran Theft Auto:$50. Driv3r:$30. Starsky and Hutch: priceless 
 Lots of car action! If you like to see cars doing great stunts this is a movie that would go great with others such as hooper, and cannonball run. Buy it and enjoy it 
 I received this "Year of Meteors" as a premium for becoming a member of the local NPR station.  Little did I realize what a gem I had until I listened to it with an open mind- I knew immediately that it was the kind of album I've been wanting to discover in a long time.  The layered instruments and harmonic, electronic vibes lend Veirs her rich yet mellow qualities.  A guitar often accompanies the fresh, fluid melodies that go remarkably well with her lyrics.  The words themselves are descriptive and dreamy, easily conjuring calm images to mind.  The songs overall have a unique strangeness that will be refreshing to Indie/Indiepop and singer/songwriter fans.  I enjoyed it, and have been listening to several of the tracks over and over again.  It's got something special 
 IT WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE EPISODES A WAY TO GET BUFFY AND ANGEL TOGETHER WITHOUT CHANGING THE STORYLINE. AND THE CHARACTERS WHERE ABLE TO EXPRESS HOW THEY FELT TO EACH OTHER 
 We are teaching my 6YO to ride a bike, but it's not going well.  He wanted a scooter, so I got him the Razor A2 and ordered the Razor Pro for me.  Very nice!  Supports my weight, is easy to maneuver, and is inexpensive!  The only problem is folding it up again when we're done - this is sometimes a bit tricky 
 I received this for Christmas, and so far every recipe that I've used from this book has been excellent!  Flavorful, healthy, vegetarian food that is quick and easy to make.  This book is also nice for the single guy or gal as the recipes make moderate amounts - just enough for dinner and a couple of leftovers 
 This is a classic Sasha and Digweed album.  Ambient sounds mixed with great beats and trance "melody" that most others DJ's in this genre of music can't achieve.  This album shows true skill and I enjoy listening to every minute of it.  I'm a huge Sasha fan and together with Digweed they can't get much better.  Sit back, relax, and enjoy.  
 This book is a must read for young black teenagers without a guide or any direction. It is almost like reading the gospels in the bible. You have three different people telling the same story 
 As a professor of a course titled, Justice in a Pluralistic Society, I am always searching for a text that will grab students and challenge them to think about about gender, race, and ethnicity in this  country from both  historical and current perspectives.  This text does just that.  With well-written introductory essays that a lay a needed context for students, this text provides primary sources which take students across the landscape of American history in light of these topics.  Our students are excited about this book even though this is a dreaded required course.  Well-done 
 Sure it's spendy, but you will spend countless hours drooling over this book by one of the premier modellers in the world right now.  As mentioned, every facet of AFV modeling is covered in this publication.  From equipment to the process of painting the entire vehicle, groundwork, accessories, etc.  Do not expect a lot of text to be included with this books.  The techniques are covered with high quality color shots.  Did I mention all the pictures in this book are color?  Just don't forget to add a bib to your order when you get this 
 what a ride! a romantic romp through the world of the rich and famous! Hoping this book hits the silver screen. I LOVED IT!!! 
 I'm a college student and had spent a summer travelling in Europe. Among all the travel guides that i used, this is the best one and the only one i recommend to my sisters. Rick is very resourceful. His recommendation restaurants were great. This is a very user friendly travel guide. I feel like this is the only guide book that i'll always bring with me when i go to europe. I bought both Paris 2005 and Italy 2005. They were both great. 
 Wow what an excellent little ep from the melvins multi talented drummer. These songs rock!! they are definately grunge, no other word for them. Mediocre lyrics and riffs, which are constructed very well and performed beautifully. Simple yet so very effective! Definately the best of the 3 solo eps from the melvins, dale crover shows us he's not just an awesome drummer but an accomplished song writer in his genre 
 this is a cheap, lightweight pan, if thats what you're looking for, buy it. if you want heavier metal, move on 
 What a miracle -- a CD that mother and child both like to listen to!  My daughter is 2 and is a picky listener.  She requests CDs and even individual songs by name -- and this CD is a popular choice.  One of her favorites is "Four of Two".  She likes the rhythm changes in it -- she will dance fast, then dance slow, then fast again, right along with the song.  I was surprised that she had the ability to notice these changes when she was less than 2 years, and it made me realize how many boring plodding children's songs out there are really not giving our kids enough credit.  In addition to requesting "Four of Two", my daughter will jump around the house singing hippo! hippo! mop! mop! (from "Violin"), and swing her arms and sing "Robot Parade!  Robot Parade!".  And, being two and it being her current favorite word, she giggles at singing along with the word No over and over again in the song of the same name.  "The Edison Museum" (a song with the word mausoleum!) and "Where Do They Make Balloons?" are my personal favorites.  I will note that this is definitely not a CD to calm your child down or for relaxing.  Most of the songs make my daughter get up and dance.  Though we like some songs more than others, my daughter and I will listen to this CD from start to finish.  What a relief not to have to hit the replay button and listen to "Elmo's Song" just one more time 
 This book is everything that the VSI (Very Short Introductions) are supposed to be: it's short, it's to the point and it's up-to-date. It reviews all the major events in the history of thought on human evolution, as well as all the major landmarks of that evolution as we understand them today. When there are several differing interpretations of fossil evidence, Wood impartially points out all the strengths and weaknesses of different positions. Although this is not a book on evolution in general, the early chapters position human evolution within the context of primate evolution, and even more briefly, under the evolution of life. For the review of evolution in general, "Evolution: A Very Short Introduction" would be an excellent choice 
 I had been looking for a good squirrel book, and this is definitely IT!  It made me laugh, cry, and re-read the darn thing 3 times in one month!  In "Fahrenheit 451" by Ray Bradbury, he tells of a future where all books are banned, and those that love books must commit them to memory in order to preserve them.  This is the book I would memorize.  I've bought additional copies to give to family and friends for Christmas.  If you love squirrels, you'll love this book 
 This is the 4th greatest album of all time.I don't know why people don't give Common the respect he deserves.He is definetly in the top 5 rappers of all time.I say he comes 2 right after the great Krs-1.Ressurection is Common's best work and should be a 5-mic classic.It came out in 1994 along with other classics like Illmatic and Ready To Die so it didn't get much recognition.Ilove I used to Love Her but my favorite song is Chapter 13.Common shows his lyrical skills on songs like ressurection and Orange Pineapple Juice.If you want another classic aded to your collection then buy this.Then check out "Be 
 "Call For The Dead," was John Le Carre's first novel, and first George Smiley novel: it was an astonishing debut.  In her Foreword to the 1961 reissue, P.D. James wrote,"The novel is a finely wrought and compelling mixture of three types of crime writing:...a thriller, the spy story...and the detective story...."  Much shorter than his great works to come,really novella length, the book works ingeniously on all three levels.  We are, firstly, kept breathlessly guessing at what will come next.  We are then fascinated by the spy craft, a subject Le Carre knows from his years in the intelligence-gathering business.  We meet George Smiley, a character who will turn up in Le Carre's later, great spy stories, and also a handful of other characters who will turn up again too.  We can, finally, follow the clues of the mystery well enough.  The currently desk-bound, formerly assigned in Germany, British spy Smiley is sent to interview a just-promoted Foreign Service employee, Samuel Fennan, after an anonymous letter accuses the man of Communist leanings.  The interview goes pleasantly enough, spent in a London park watching the ducks and swans,and Smiley comes as close as he may to reassuring Fennan that his report will clear him.  Nevertheless, Fennan apparently tells his wife that the interview was an ordeal, and commits suicide.  The Foreign Service Officer supposedly leaves a note that reads, in part, "I cannot spend my remaining years under a cloud of disloyalty and suspicion.  I realize that my career is ruined, that I am the victim of paid informers."  Yet, many features of the crime scene, including an 8:30 wakeup call the dead man had requested for the next morning, do not ring right to Smiley: it calls out for further investigation.  This investigation will, as is frequently the case, prove dangerous to many people, including Smiley, and will result in Smiley's once again crossing paths, and swords, with an extraordinary one-time German protege of his.  The book is beautifully written, long on wit, though short on the midnight mandarin meetings that will become a mainstay of Le Carre's later works.  Characters are fully rounded, and treated with a compassion that will not always survive to his later books.  Le Carre also here begins by flashing us his ability to open a book with a bang: a first chapter entitled "A Brief History of George Smiley" is enough to leave us hungry for more 
 Finally a book that is written for the advanced practioner. This is not a rehash of material written by others. This is unique. This is material you haven't seen before. Mrs. Ashcroft-Nowicki and Mr. Brennan have put together a true workbook for those interested in the advanced magical work of the creation of the homunuculus, along with practical exercises for developing the ability to do so. Make no mistake, this is work. But if you are willing to put in the effort to perform this art, the tools you will need are here 
 Typee was a difficult book to read but worth the effort. There isn't much plot beyond "Tommo's" rehabilitation at the hands of the Typee and his fears that they might be cannibals. Is he being nursed back to health or fattened for a future supper? As with Moby Dick, the bulk of the text is in the form of essay and commentary. There are lengthy discussions on the language, the architecture, the music (or lack thereof), taboos and tatoos, and diet of the Typee. These extra chapters though don't have the humor that is present in Moby Dick. They are still an interesting observation on one subset of Polynesian culture 
 If you want to grow as an artist and put some new "tools" in your watercolor know-how kit, this is the book for you.  If you have never taken a workshop with Jean Grastorf or, even if you have, you owe it to yourself to buy this book and learn or reinforce her exciting and  unusual method for achieving beautiful, luminous paintings.  If you are expecting the average, ordinary same-old, same-old watercolor how-to book, you will be unexpectedly delighted and surprised with this volume.  And when you see her work, so beautifully reproduced in this book, you will understand why Jean uses this technique to create her award-winning paintings.  Jean has done an outstanding job of demonstrating and explaining her method of pouring brilliant, glowing watercolors, and Northlight has done an outstanding job of setting up the book, complete with masking maps and other goodies that tell you exactly how to get from Point A to Point B to achieve the beautiful results possible only with this method.  It's a book that every watercolorist should have on their shelf.   
 It was a birthday gift for my husband and it was a hit.  He loved it 
 Overall a nice product, but I have noticed that this flatware seems to get more "spotty" in the dishwasher than my previous set.  Also, a few of the knives have developed rust-like blemishes where the handle meets the blade, but it's hardly noticeable.  This is definately nicer than my previous cheap set, but it doesn't have the same heft or "quality feel" that the my Heirloom Oneida flatware has.  Overall, I love the way this flatware looks, and it has very nice serving pieces included in the set 
 This book was my favorite bedtime story when my kids were younger.  We had fun going back and forth telling each how much we love each other.  The illustrations are also really nice for little ones 
 This book made me think how much I wish it were around 10 years ago or so when my mother was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma. As a person in my early twenties then, I was unprepared for dealing with a family member with a terminal illness. My mother, too, though she suffered from many health-ailments in her life, was also unprepared for death and dying. Often, she would send me to the bookstore, searching for some type of diversion or something that might give her solace. I usually returned empty-handed or with books that made her feel worse. (The only exception was "Don't Sweat the Small Stuff" which she did get some comfort from.) Morrie, I think, would have been just the thing for both of us back then. Unfortunately, it wasn't there, but it is now, so if you know a family going through a difficult time, I think this is just the book. One doesn't need to know suffering to appreciate this book and get something from it. Don't let the fact that this is a book about death deter you from picking it up. It is much more accurately a book about living 
 The final chapter to the "war" between brothers, a page turner which does lead to somewhat of a anti climax. I expected a more elaborate ending after such a build up during the three novels. But nevertheless a good ending to the series 
 I am a fiction writer who also wants to write ad copy.  I got this book on the recommendation of a professional copywriter and have been glad I did ever since.  The book offers sage advice, a comforting hand, and many amusing anecdotes from both Ms. Paetro (herself an advertising professional) and several of the industry's stars.  It has informed and inspired me.  It has answered questions that troubled me and others I didn't even know I had.  It even includes an address to contact Ms. Paetro at for advice-something I've done a couple times.  If you want to get into advertising, I highly recommend this book 
 Football experiences are connected to life experiences in this book.  You'll learn how to better yourself and motivate others toward self-improvement 
 Reading this book improved my sewing technique and also encouraged a new freedom and joy in my design work. After using it for a while, I treated a "nervous nellie" to a private "get over your fears" sewing lesson. When she felt confident enough to go home and try a project on her own, I let her browse my quilt library and this was the only book she wanted to borrow. 
 I love this series! This is my favorite book out of this series! It is a really good book. Janete Oke is one of my favorite authors. You have got to read "The Meeting Place"!!! 
 This is a CD best described as "nice". It's a little gem of  great music wrapped up in a sugary shell. It is a great record to listen to  after a date (I'm serious) when you are really lovestruck. It also works  well at night, although the lyrics are sunny. There are equal shades of Yo  La Tengo and Velvet Underground here, but the latter shines through more  clearly. It gives me a great feeling like no other, especially Dear Diary  which is one of my favorite songs. The only problem with this is that you  can't listen to this all the time, for example, on a sunny day, I find it  hard to enjoy this. But at night, with the lights of the city, it's  perfect. I'm really not sure. But I do know that this is a great album and  should be picked up very, very soon. Luna are very talented, and I am  planning on checking out some of their older stuff. But once you buy this,  you have to listen to Dear Diary, it is simply amazing. I also like Sweet  Child O' Mine and Four Thousand Days too. Really good 
 The Hardgainers' Bodybuilding Handbook is a fantastic guide for hardgainers like myself.  For the first time I read a book on the subject that has all of the information that I needed to accomplish my goals.    This book covers everything, from setting goals, to providing an exact workout routine that one can follow and that changes every so often in order to maximize results.  The author calls this method periodization and he explains why this works better than just trying to constantly add weight to ones' exercises. Also, the best exercises for mass building are provided and Mr. Rivera even gives a solid explanation of why some exercises like the squat are better than others, like the leg press for instance.  Rivera says that everytime you move your torso through space (as in the squat) more fibers are needed to move the weight so therefore the exercise is more effective and you build more mass.  In addition, nutrition is really explained in detail with sample diets, nutritional information for foods and even shows you how to design and personalize your own diet.  The supplement chapter I found to be extremely valuable as I used to go to the nutrition stores and buy everything and anything spending a fortune every time.  Now by using Rivera's Essential list of supplements and some creatine and glutamine I have cut down on my supplements bill dramatically.  I did not realize how much garbage I was getting that was really doing nothing.    In addition to this, the book also has fantastic illustrations with realistic looking models and detailed exercise descriptions.  While I did find a mistake on page 154 since it had the wrong illustration for the exercise I went ahead and sent an e-mail to the author (his website is listed on the book) and though it took him 7 days he did got back to me personally and set me straight.  I was surprised that I got a personal reply from him as I am sure he is pretty busy.  That alone made the purchase of the book worth it as I have bought many other bodybuilding books and #1 they do not cater to hardgainers and #2 the authors can never be reached.  Another thing I liked about the book is how nicely organized the information is.  If I need to refresh my memory on nutrition I just go to that chapter.  For training I visit the training chapter and so on.  Also the appendices on the back help with easy access of info too.  I'll conclude this review by sharing that since I started the program in 10 weeks I have put on 15 lbs of solid muscle by following the advise from the book.  My wife cannot believe the changes and neither do my co-workers.  While the book advises to only work out 4 times a week, it is really hard work and the book indicates so from the get go; Rivera does not sugar coat things.  Also while at first I was a bit scared as the volume of the training is higher than what I have seen in other hardgainer books, as long as you eat as advertised and rest you do grow.  So if you are a hardgainer and really need a guide to set you straight on gaining muscle this guide may be as helpful to you as it has been to me 
 As a group probably most famous for their tenure on Season Three of MTV's occasionally lukewarm series "Making the Band," one almost certainly wouldn't expect Danity Kane to produce a great album, right?  	Wrong. Surprisingly enough, Danity Kane's freshman self-titled album is actually good in a unexpectedly engaging type of way.  	Granted, they probably aren't the next Destiny's Child or TLC, but they can certainly push their voices out there and sing. The singers, handpicked by P. Diddy in "Making the Band," do P. Diddy proud in this compilation.   	Of course, their oft-played single "Show Stopper" is evidently in the album. However, while most albums only contain singles as songs that are worth listening to, Danity Kane's entire CD is actually quite enjoyable and even (gasp) pleasant.  	There's "Touching My Body," which is a good clubbing song to bounce one's groove to. There's also "Sleep On It," which is apt to get stuck in one's head because of its incredibly (and astonishingly) catchy chorus. "Ooh Ahh" is reminiscent of Destiny Child's earliest songs, and "Heartbreaker" is appealing with a sound similar to that of the Pussycat Dolls.  	Some people may groan at the idea of yet another female R&P/Pop/Hip-Hop group that will parade its music videos on MTV, but they should listen to Danity Kane's newest album before making any judgments. Danity Kane manages to distinguish itself with a catchier and alluring sound than that of its MTV counterparts.   	And don't worry if you're worried about pop continuing to be generic junk- this entire Danity Kane album is better than Paris Hilton's infamous single "Stars are Blind" any day. 
 This is an excellent dictionary.  I'm a high school student in an upper level French class, and I'm just beginning to translate French novels; this becomes more and more important every day.  A word to the wise; if you don't like large dictionaries, don't buy this.  It's also not the most concise dictionary--Larousse takes that honor--but it is the most superb one for usablity.  Even with its large size, this book stands out because the words are large and readable, the references easy to read, and the amount of words stunning.    One other note is that it doesn't include a lot of synonyms; this is both good and bad, as you will not be forced to use a word that does not fit the particular nuance of your sentence but are on the other hand limited to a specific vocabulary.  Overall this takes the top of French-English English-French dictionaries simply because of its usablity and breadth of words, but it's not hard to see that one can find everything they need in this book.  It also comes with a Speak French CD-ROM, which I don't think they mentioned at the time I bought it two months ago or so.  At any rate, this dictionary can make a great supplement to whichever resource you are using to increase the knowledge of the French (or English) language that you foster 
 An excellent resource for anyone involved in public sector land-use planning.  Contains great detail on many different subjects.  Good illustrations throughout.  Not the best resource for site planning, though 
 Walter Borneman's 1812, The War that Forged a Nation, is a narrative popular history with a thesis designed to get the reader to understand the significance of perhaps the United States' least understood war. Not much is known of this 1812-1815 war in popular memory, which is a shame. The American national anthem, the Star-Spangled Banner, was written after the seige of Baltimore, the capital city was burned by an invading army, the US Navy acheived some of its greatest acheivements this side of Midway and the nation had its last real fight with a European power until World War I (considering the Spainish American War of 1896 was more of a rout), and it was the last time until Pearl Harbor in 1941 that America was attacked on its own soil by a foreign power.  Borneman's principle goal, to inform and entertain the general American public on why the War of 1812 is significant is done with his thesis: that the war forced the United States to a greater sense of national unity than it had yet acheived at its ending than in 1811, when President James Madison was a weak executive and the nation was 18 states that coalesced into three or four distinct regions.   It contains excellent maps for a popular history book. For the casual reader of American history, this book is reccommended as an enjoyable read and a solid introduction to a little understood time period of American history. The book could have been a bit stronger in reference to the societal reactions to the war throughout the United States and British Canda more attention could have been paid to the political machinations of the time. Borneman's work is almost entirely made up of secondary sources, so no new ground is broken with the book, but for 300 pages, it is effective prose that tells a strong story. 
 The field of cultural criticism can be difficult to approach.  Madan Sarup's book provides exactly what the title states, an excellent introduction to Post-Structuralism and Postmodernism.  His coverage of the critics and philosophers who espouse these schools of thought serve as a solid foundation for further studies.  His comparisons of the theories of different authors was especially helpful, as was his treatment of the feminist critics, who seem to be often overlooked 
 Scott Pilgrim Volume 2 has it all - dorky hats, gay roommates, skateboarding battles against evil ex-boyfriends, a slightly psychotic teenage girl called Knives out for chopsocky revenge and, if all that has left you tired and hungry, a recipe for vegan shepherds' pie. As you may have gathered, the second instalment of Bryan Lee O'Malley's series of graphic novels is quite unlike anything else on the market. The brilliance of the storytelling lies in the fact that O'Malley is able to deviate from the central storyline, playing with different genres and even breaking the 'fourth wall' to address the reader directly, whilst all the while keeping his eye fixed firmly on advancing the plot, so that these asides and deviances never slow down what is, in effect, a narrative told at breakneck speed. O'Malley's art is joyous and vibrant, but also capable of incredible subtlety, so that Scott and his friends - and, most especially his wronged ex-girlfriend Knives, come across as fully-formed characters whose stories carry real emotional weight. If you have not yet read Scott Pilgrim's adventures, I strongly advise you get in early so that you can follow the excitement of each new volume as it appears 
 I feel kinda cheated. The best songs were the same three that were available for free on Jean Jacques's website [...] The other tracks were mostly just filler - Perrey doing what he can do the best - but they didn't quite reach Moog Indigo's status of uniqueness in my opinion. Crazy music nonetheless.   And it's impossible to be serious if you're listening to this -- strongly recommended to all you serious people 
 Contrary to Peter Caldwell's posting below, the character of "Joanie Phoanie," a Joan Baez look-alike in bare feet and love beads, was the creation not of "Doonesbury" creator Garry Trudeau but of "Li'l Abner" cartoonist Al Capp, a former liberal turned '60s pro-Vietnam war rightwinger. Capp also came up with Students Wildly Indignant about Nearly Everything (SWINE), a parody of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). Capp was invited to numerous campuses by prowar groups till multiple allegations of sexual improprieties surfaced, after which he withdrew. Online sources say Ms. Baez successfully sued Capp for libel. Capp's cartoon strip satirizing "hillbillies" died more than 30 years ago. Joan Baez has continued a distinguished career, both in politics and music, though she never surpassed her first albums for artistry and purity. But I say that just because I prefer the old ballads to anything modern, except early Dylan. Just me: an unreconstructed old fogie from the great folk song scare of the early 60s.  Of course, it goes without saying that Joan's first three albums are essential. Others have said this better so I won't add more 
 What a story teller. I really enjoy all the disc world books 
 This book is a must for a medical student! The illustrations are clear and are drawn in a way that is very easy to understand. The pictures are not always "real", they reflect what you should look for in a particular area of the body,a fact that helped me a lot. Comparing to Sobbota, this book contains more information in every aspect, although Sobbota may be found more usefull for dentistry students. The book is reliable (unlike Sobotta which contains mistakes), clear and understandable. It is simply the best atlas there is. I am a general Med. student, but for a dentistry student I would recommend Sobbota because it contains a more detailed skull region.  
 I found this book in my mom's book shelf when I was 16 and never gave it back. The cover has fallen off and I lost most of the last page!  It is exciting, colorful, sometimes funny, sometimes frightful but a great step into the history of the US through the eyes of a proud mother of 10 
 McGovern and Polk were right about Vietnam; they are right about Iraq 
 As always, Mark Twain is a pleasure to read. However, after a while this book sort of lags along. Twain's tale of his post-civil war trip down the river is not interesting enough to take up the space and detail that he devotes to it 
 This book gave me some great ideas on building benchwork, with clear illustrations.   It also covers topics such as selecting roadbed, building materials, etc.  A must have 
 This book offers a perfect way to introduce someone to the works of Lovecraft. The tales within offer chills in a way only Lovecraft could do. Ordinary people thrust into the heart of madness. The pace of the stories builds nicely, often erupting into a frightening climax. Be sure to check out "The Strange High House In The Mist" and "The Evil Clergyman". There are also some early work and fragments here for your reading pleasur 
 Annie Wilkes is off the chain. You all know that this book is about  Paul Sheldon who gets into a car accident because he was all buzzed up with don pariogone. Then this psychotic biach (Annie) takes Paul and "nurses" him if thats what you wanna call it.Then she dause stuff to him that you need to find out by reading this amazingly written book. If you've seen the movie then you stillhave to read this book it's that good 
 First of all, I appologise for my poor english. But I felt I need to write something about this big return of Donald Fagen to his solo work. Although I do not always underestand the lyrics, I can comment on the work and production. The production, as always with any other Steely Dan production, is flawless. Crystal clear sound and exellent musicianship. It's even more jazzy then the previous albums like Two against nature and Everything must go. The tracks are significantly longer. A bit long for the avarage pop music listener, but I am used to listen long music. I think Donald simply wanted to create something bigger, longer, and more sophisticated use of jazz. I cannot really comment on the tracks because anything that I write will be my own personal choice. I personally enjoyed "What I do", "The great pagoda of funn", "Security joan" and "H gang". The others also I enjoyed, but the weakest track maybe in my opinnion is the title track.  I think Donald had made a great return and showd us he is still doing one of the best grooves around. I am so unhapy that I will be missing the Steely dan tour this summer. I hope you guys from US, had oportunity to be there. 
    EXCELLENT ALBUM,CANNOT WAIT FOR THE VERY BEST VOLUME  
 This cd give you the perfect example of Coltrane's stylings and musical persona.  For anyone who wants to know what jazz is and has been, they need this cd in their collection 
 Rubinstein was the ultimate concert pianist. He played 100-plus engagements a year for some seven decades. Even as an old man he had ten recital programs and twenty concertos at his fingertips. For half a century he maintained a busy recording schedule, ranging from Mozart to Villa-Lobos and including a full dose of chamber music. He was the Caruso of the keyboard, the Babe Ruth of the 88s.   Sure enough, back in the early 1940s American critic/composer Virgil Thomson headlined him as the "King of Pianists," and Rubinstein wore that crown for the next 35 years. Other big names made periodic splashes (Gilels, Richter, Cliburn, Gould) or emerged briefly from hiding (Horowitz, Michelangeli), but when the dust settled Rubinstein still sat on the throne. "Nobody will put up much of an argument," the N.Y. Times' Harold C. Schonberg once wrote, "when he's called the greatest living pianist." Yet in his day he was such a familiar and accessible commodity, listeners seldom pondered exactly where his superiority lay.   It was simple enough. As Lauritz Melchior was the greatest of heldentenors, Rubinstein was the preeminent "heldenpianist." Boasting both an enormous dynamic range and phenomenal stamina, he could play not only long seasons but heavy heroic programs (e.g., both Brahms concertos at one sitting). He was renowned for his deep full tone, his cataclysmic volume, his velvet cantilenas, his huge declamatory octaves. Rubinstein came honestly by it all: after a youthful brush with repetitive stress syndrome, he adopted a temperate practice regimen and developed one of the most efficient virtuoso mechanisms in the history of his instrument. Its foundation was a centered posture, participation of the entire torso, and exceptional lateral mobility; working strictly with moderate-action instruments, he could dig deep into the keys.   It's significant, then, that the end came for him not from fading fingers but failing eyesight--macular degeneration. His frontal vision suddenly went, and it was enough to take the edge off his accuracy and reliability. He prudently retired. At age 89.   Luckily the present video (three Rubinstein blockbusters--the Grieg concerto, Chopin's Concerto No. 2, Saint-Saens' Concerto No. 2) had been taped some months earlier on April 22-24, 1975. Of the assorted Rubinstein DVDs currently on the market, this is easily the most cherishable. Not surprisingly, picture and sound are far superior to the 1990 VHS release, and by any criteria this is first-rate analog stereo--though the piano is appreciably forward, sometimes upstaging the string tremolos in the Chopin middle movement. As for the picture, it's in plush technicolor: the camera favors both left and right profiles as Rubinstein digs in, close-ups of his hands ditto, head shots are framed by the piano lid. Previn and individual deskmen enjoy occasional close-ups as well, but the full orchestra is on view only from the rear of the hall.   With Previn and the LSO providing elegantly phrased backup, the performances themselves are invaluable. These, literally, are Rubinstein's final thoughts on a trio of audience favorites he'd performed over many decades (three-quarters of a century in the case of the Saint-Saens). Even at 88 he's easily equal to the stiff technical demands (cleaner and firmer with Chopin's passagework than in his Philadelphia recording seven years before). Unforgettable moments abound in each of these performances: tempos are generally more spacious than earlier, with the expected gains in precision and clarity; he's more economical, too, with half tints and pedal washes in cantabile passages, but the arching phrases and tapered cadences are as eloquent as ever. Astonishingly, his fortissimos are still colossal in the big Grieg cadenza, and the old man can still burn up the tracks in the finale of the Saint-Saens.   Further, and maybe even more affecting, Rubinstein was still reconsidering, still revising, still working on things. Here, for instance, you'll find the most intensely operatic of all his readings of the Chopin Larghetto--sharply phrased, stinging in the filigree, downright ferocious in the central recitative, ultimately turning gentle and nocturnal in the recap.   Finally there's a splendid bonus: a 29-minute conversation with PBS newscaster Bob MacNeil, recorded in the late 1970s after Rubinstein's retirement. The pianist tackles a range of material with humor and shrewdness: communicating with popular audiences, producing his famous sound, his concept of God, life after death. It's easily the most articulate and stimulating interview I've heard him give.   So this DVD paints the regal close of a colossal reign: as indicated, the bonus is a delight, and you'll never hear more opulent, more exhilarating performances of these three pet concertos. Heartily recommended for all viewers. Including folks who normally avoid classical music.  
 Sass offers a beautifully written and densely textured close reading of schizophrenic experiences in this book, adroitly weaving a fabric of connections between Schreber's bizarre subjective world and Wittgenstein's  lucid philosophical writings.  Through this juxtaposition, certain  frequently ignored features of the worlds of schizophrenia are brought to  light, such as the  quasi-solipsistic structure of the schizophrenic's  experiential world and the intricately tangled web of psycho-logical  paradoxes that this structuring entails.  Though Sass speaks little about  the interpersonal, historical, or biological contexts in which delusions  arise, such is not the point of the book.  We need, Sass argues, to get  clear on what a delusion IS if we are to accurately interpret why one shows  up.  And to do that, we need to do this sort of close phenomenological  reading of schizophrenic experience.  The previous reviewer misses the  point.  Not only is it flatly untrue to attribute to Sass the idea the  schizophrenics do not act on their delusions (he simply does not say this),  whether they do or don't is not what Sass is trying to determine.  What is  important here is the phenomenological texture of the delusion itself, and  Sass explicates that admirably 
  This book is filled with "fun facts" about the past: from cooking methods, to garbage collecting, to pollution in the past, etc...  For the price, this book was worth it to me. However, the paper was a bit cheap, so I wish the publishers had used better paper.  
 I have read many books, but I have never cried reading a book. This book is very sad and goes right to the heart. I could not put this book down. I wish that it never ended. I laughed at some moments and I cried. This has to be one of my favorite books. I dont have a top ten list yet but when I have one I know that this book will be in it. I recommand everyone reading this book.  Author of The Truth Aboutt Caffein 
 Daughter got it for her 2nd birthday as a gift, and she could hardly put it down.  The pop-up images are very cute, and she loves listing the colors and talking about what each dinosaur is doing.  The verse is short but fun to read.  This is definitely one or our most favorite books 
 I have the VHS tape of JANE EYRE, starring Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles. Felt both characters were well-cast, with the quiet and sensitive Fontaine as Jane Eyre, and the brooding, inscrutable Orson Welles as her employer, Mr. Edward Rochester. The black-and-white movie is more suitable for this genre, in my opinion, than the color version, as it depicts more accurately the brooding and eerie qualities of Thornfield Hall, the Rochester residence where his mad wife (of whom Jane knows nothing) is shut up in one of the towers in an unused part of the house with her "keeper" Grace Poole.  I felt the acting as well as the cinematic quality of this movie accurately reflect the atmosphere that Charlotte Bronte was trying to portray in her novel.  
 Dolores Claiborne is not an easy read. Not because of the language or the storyline. But because of the story itself, which is quite un-King-like. He wrote many books about the supernatural, monsters and the like but few books about the true monsters - human beings. This book's about these monsters and it's more effective and seductive than King's other books. Don't expect any of his "usual" horror here, though.  The book discovers two mysterious death cases and the strange relationship between two woman who seem to have nothing in common. The first death case is of Vera Donovan, the woman Dolores worked for many years and has just died and Dolores is accused of killing her. Dolores and Vera are two women of different backgrounds, and seemingly different lives. The other death case is of Dolores' husband, who died long ago. How the two cases and the two women become intertwined is the key to the book and I don't want to spoil the fun. But this is only the frame.  What's within this frame is a masterpiece. The book is narrated by Dolores who makes a confession. In a one chapter, monologue style. Her confession introduces us to a woman who suffered a lot, whose life was anything but fun; however she possesses a stunning will to live. The characters she describes are vivid and she, herself is unbelievable. The story is a triumph over injustice and false beliefs.  As a man I was surprised how King knows the soul of women and how he knows what women could think of some situations and things (the starting quotation of the book is from Freud: "Woman! What does she want?"). However, the true motto of the book is one sentence from Vera: "Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has hold onto." True. How many people do you know who live this way? I know a lot and after reading this book I seem to show more respect. One never knows what hides behind a faade.  If you want to have a good read, a deep analysis of a soul that's suffered a lot, if you want to have a true catharsis, this is the book to read. You won't regret it 
 This is a must have in your collection Sondheim fans!  This box set has titles that appeal to both the children and adults in a family.  My children love Into the woods and the Carnegie Hall concert especially!  One of the best purchases I've made this year 
 This was one of the most interesting books of its kind that I have ever read.  The descriptions of the geography, characters and environment were most real.  I stayed "glued" to it reading into the night and until my eyes were tired.  A truly wonderful boo 
 I will not simply stand by and see my favorite author disparaged.  I enjoy every AB installment and await them with baited breath.  I "read" them in audio form mostly and treasure each.  You simply have to allow LKH to develop these characters as she sees fit.  If its too hot or too nontraditional stop reading her.  If you can stand being challenged or stand for your IMAGINATION to be stretched, then stay tuned. We're working up to a knockdown dragout with the Mother of All Darkness and Jean Claude's sire. How can you stand to miss that?  DM was thoroughly entertaining, intriguing, and noncompromising.  I hope LKH never changes her original vision to accomodate any lightweights who maybe should stick to lighter faire.  It's so hard to find an author like her.  I wish she was as prolofic as Nora and could write a different book every 3 months 
 Ever since Tuesdays With Morrie I have been intrigued by ALS and the ways that people cope with its devastating debilitation. Morrie has given us so much with his aphorisms and insights regarding living life 
 After watching Following (1998) last night, I've determined that writer/director Christopher Nolan, who would later do the immensely popular film Memento (2000), is either a raving psychotic, mad genius, or possibly equal parts of both (I'll elaborate more on this later).  Appearing in the film is Jeremy Theobald, who appeared in Nolan's first feature short, Doodlebug (1997), Lucy Russell, who is going to appear in Nolan's take on the Gotham Knight in 2005's Batman Begins, and Alex Haw, who has no other credits, which is too bad as I thought he did very well here.  Theobald plays Bill, an aspiring writer (i.e. the starving artist type...you know him...greasy, unkempt, living in a shabby apartment subsisting off macaroni and ketchup...or is it catsup?  I guess it doesn't matter) whose curiosities have developed into a rather odd compulsion of picking people out of the crowd, randomly, and following them with no other reason than to see where they go...I guess it beats working.  Anyway, after Bill gets caught `doing his thing' by one of his subjects, a slick, smartly dressed man named Cobb (Haw), he learns the man is a burglar, the two develop a sort of partnership, and Bill begins tagging along with Cobb (who seems to have an awful lot of insight about those who he robs), supposedly to gather information for his writing...but soon Bill finds himself not only learning, but participating, using the tricks of the trade taught to him as Cobb becomes the mentor, Bill the student.  Bill also becomes involved with the occupant of one of the flats the two have burglarized, a pretty blonde woman (Russell) with a somewhat shady past and a penchant for manipulation.  So what happens next?  Well, let's just say once you begin your downward decent, regardless of the illicit activity, the momentum generally takes hold and becomes a force of its' own, and not stopping until confronted with an immovable object, in this case, rock bottom.  So what the heck did I mean when I referred earlier to Nolan's mental state?  The story seems pretty straightforward, from the way I described it, right?  If you've seen the film Memento, you'll have a better understanding about what I'm talkin' about, Willis.  The story is straightforward, when played in the linear, chronological sense, but that's not the case here.  The film begins in the present, with the Bill relating his story to what appears to be a police detective, and then bounces between three different timeframes, the past, the not so distance past, and the present, highlighted by noticeable physical changes in Bill (hairstyles, facial hair, distinguishing bruises and cuts on his face...Bill gets the beating at one point).  Now, this might make the story sound confusing and hard to follow, but I didn't think so as Nolan seemed to know exactly how to best put things in the order without actually putting them back in order (if that makes sense).  As I said before, he does allow for variances to become the key indicators between the various timeframes, so if you're paying attention, you shouldn't have problems keeping up.  The story, when told in chronological order, is actually pretty simplistic, but Nolan manages to complicate things just enough to keep you in the dark right up until the end.  It is strange how much different the same story can play out depending on how it's told.  As I said, Nolan seems to be able to extract the most out of his skewed chronology of events, heightening the tension greatly.  The whole notion of understanding a story enough to completely tear it apart, re-assembling it in a completely different fashion, ultimately getting the same ending though a different route, and doing it successfully, is amazing.  The film, which was shot in black and white, is kept minimal (i.e. sparse) in nearly all aspects (script, story, characters, etc.), and runs lean and mean with a runtime of about 70 minutes.  There seems little, if anything, in the film that was unnecessary, so there's little to distract from the story.  Bottom line is if you're interested in a sharp, smartly paced film that wastes little and requires a bit of thought from its' viewer, Following won't disappoint.  The full screen picture (aspect ratio 1.33:1) looks gritty, serving to give the film a `noir-ish' quality, which accentuates the story well.  The 2.0 Dolby stereo is adequate, but there are English subtitles if you have difficulty hearing all the dialogue.  There are a whole slew of extras including commentary by director Nolan, the ability to reconstruct the film into chronological order, theatrical trailers for this film and Memento, second angles with the director's shooting script, along with cast and crew biographies.  I was surprised to learn Nolan was directing the next Batman film, Batman Begins, as it doesn't seem like the kind of thing he'd be interested in, but then many had preconceived ideas when it was announced Tim Burton was going to do a Batman film way back in 1989, and that didn't turn out too bad.

 In combination with 2001's "Flu", by Gina Bari Kolata, you can trace the race to isolate virus that caused the 1918 Flu Pandemic.  Some science to be found here, which I enjoyed.  Read news stories about the 1918 Flu from October 6th, 2005, for a nice afterword.  All in all, a quick and relatively easy read suitable for home, on a plane or even on the toilet!  Good book 
 This is a wonderfully illustrated, easy to understand, easy to read, unintimidating book. It's intended audience is Pre-School thru Grade 3 which I feel is critical information for anyone looking into buying this book. It is a wonderful book for those parents who want their children to learn at an early age the correct names of body parts and the basics of where babies come from. This book has been on my children's (ages 4-9) book shelf since the oldest one was two years old! It sits on the shelf right along-side all the other 100's of bedtime books. They go back to it time and time again either to read to themselves or to be read to. From the start they learned the accurate words for body parts, understand the basics, and take in more and more information/digest the information as they grow older. As the oldest (9) has questions she openly asks them. I either go over it again from the book or we talk openly. Parents who wait to discuss the topics until age 9 will find this book to be an untimidating first book -- very good. As the children grow older (puberty thru teens) I intend to add more detailed (less cartoonish illustrations) books to our discussions

 I was impressed and entertained by this biography of William Marcy Tweed, the man who ran New York from the Civil War to the early 1870s.  I was fascinated from the very beginning by the retelling of Tweeds role in quelling the New York draft riots.  And he did it in such a quintessentially New York way: money!  But what emerges is a remarkably three dimensional portrait of the man and his cronies in all their splendor.  One of my favorite characters in this biography was Mayor Oakey Hall, the poet-politician who didn't mind a little kick-back or two.  The City came alive through the telling of this important, though little understood period of New York History.  The "Gangs of New York" fantasyland version of the facts has done much damage to an accurate understanding of this period of our history.  But Ackerman brings great writing and depth to the story of the Tweed ring and its speedy collapse.  Interestingly, Tweed himself was the only member of the ring to go to jail.  And while it is hard to argue that he didn't deserve it, it seemed a manifest unfairness to let the others off without any repercussions.  Tweed, on the other had, spent the rest of his life in jail (except fr when he escaped to Cuba and Spain!)  The other part of the tweed story that was so intriguing was his everlasting popularity.  He was the champion of New York's poorest and their loyalty to him was eternal.  He was larger than life and projected a charisma that probably delayed his day of reckoning for years.  This is a great telling of a great story of a fallen man.  It is interesting to compare him to others who have this route, such as Nixon, Delay, Cunningham, and the like, and see how much of a difference there seems to be. 
 Although this excellent piece of work is more suited to Lovecraft's fans or people with some background on his work, it serves equally well the interests of newcomers into the subject.I shall just point out the utmost care and respect for the Master's original work, the passion and scholarship pervading every single line of the encyclopedia.I did not grade it with a fully deserved 5 stars,though....because only the Deep Ones are perfect.. 
 Love Field is a wonderful film about a confused relationship between a man  and a woman. The acting is fantastic, the script is great, an the direction  is inspired. Pfeiffer definitley deserved her nomination for this great  film. I loved every minute of it 
 This is a really cool CD!  I love Wolf's Rain!  It just makes it even better to be able to listen to it's music whenever I want!  If you like the series you should buy this CD!  The songs are just mind blowing!  It's amazing!  But you don't have to take my word for it...just go buy it yourself and see!   P.S. Gackt Rocks 
 Nick Bantock needs to be congratulated for his amazing work in the Griffin and Sabine triology.  His superb illustrations bring an intriguing story to life.  Watching the correspondence of Griffin and Sabine unfold in these  wonderful books is like watching a private moment unfold from the window.   As you peak in at these two wonderfully real characters you not only can't  wait to turn each page to see what is said but what is drawn.  The style of  these books was so well done they deserve the highest recognition.  The  realism used to create actual letters and postcards between Griffin and  Sabine for the reader to take out and hold only adds to this amazing  experience 
 I have read this book three times now, and intend to do so again.  Dreman is obviously an outstanding investor, and his strategies flesh out and arguably "modernize" the techniques used by the noted fundamental investor Benjamin Graham, who was the mentor to Warren Buffett (although, I might add, this book does not emphasize the study of financial statements, which is something Benjamin Graham did in painstaking detail).  Dreman's approach is most notable because of his use of investor psychology and his forceful rejection of the efficient market hypothesis.  Instead, Dreman cites any number of studies and examples to support his main thesis: investors over-react to events, and those over-reactions create opportunities for savvy investors to make money.  His approach involves a two-part strategy: first, preserve capital, and second, take advantage of market over-reactions to profit.  His point is that the market is like a casino, but one in which the odds can favor a knowledgeable investor.  In other words, no one can guarantee that a particular stock will do well, but over time, investors who follow a contrarian strategy will outperform the market generally.  Dreman's approach to investing is notably different than much of what is considered "conventional" wisdom within the financial markets (for a good contrasting view, read "Expectations Investing" by Rappaport and Mauboussin).  In particular, Dreman takes the position that experts err predictably and often, and that humans base decisions on a minute portion of the information thrown at them.  In this respect, his skepticism differs notably from some other authors (example: Mauboussin in "More than What You Know").  From this, he demonstrates how buying low p/e, high yielding, low price/book, and low price/free cash flow stocks results in higher-than-average returns.  Dreman shows how favored stocks tend to underperform the market, while out-of-favor companies tend to outperform.  However, reappraisal can happen slowly, even glacially.  I found this book to be both enjoyable and informative, and it inspired me to read a couple books about behavioral finance (Paulos, "A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market" and Belsky and Gilovich "Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes and How to Correct Them").    In all, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in investing.  A few other recommendations (other than those listed above) include:  Klarman - "Margin of Safety" (out of print) Whitman - "The Aggressive Convervative Investor" and "Value Investing" Greenblatt - "You Can be a Stock Market Genius" (horrible title, great book) Graham - "Security Analysis" and "the Intelligent Investor"  Each of these books sets forth a somewhat different approach to investing, but at the core, each of them shares a skepticism of the principals underlying the efficient market hypothesis.  
 A BRIGHT SHINING LIE is proof that $14 Million in today's Hollywood dollars buys a great picture.  This is the platinum standard of HBO Films (nominated for an Emmy for Best Picture).  Terry George shows the Vietnam War form a fresh perspective and the film moves well.  The siege of Saigon is accurate and strong, as is Bill Paxton's portrayl of John Paul Vann.  This film makes a prima facia case for Vann's name to be added to the Vietnam War Memorial.   
 Well, if you are just starting out with sound, or need to fill in gaps in knowledge about sound reinforcement hardware or audio principles, this book is very plain english and explains everything in an understandable manner without being overly technical (not much math!). It covers all the topics one should be familiar with, speakers, amps, frequencies, microphones etc. and what they do. The discussion of practical techniques was rather slim, although a book to cover even a decent quantity of scenarios would be huge and expensive, and people may not want to part with knowledge for which they receive fat paychecks!  As a musician and amateur soundperson for the school where I work, I was familiar with most of what was written and only found a few new ideas for doing sound reinforcement. A great book for anyone getting started. 
 Can Anna Gavalda become the new generation Françoise Sagan of French literature?... Most probably not, in terms of the much settled life style of hers but when it comes to her style in literature, most probably yes, for in her stories you can find the warmth and the detachment; the happiness and the loneliness; the laughters and the tears of human beings, intact and strong as they were in Sagan's works.. 
 A good starting point if you want to transition from the discrete to the integrated. A useful book if you quickly move on to more advanced books such as Logical Effort and Skew-tolerant Circuit Design. The later edition of this book is more voluminous and up to date (and more muddled as well) 
 Thank you so much for making this gospel CD. It's so uplifiting and I love the cut "Praise Him" it really gets me going. I also enjoyed your interview  with Brother Gerard Henry a couple weeks back on BET. Congratulations on your new arrival and your marriage.  May the blessings of the Lord continue to be upon you and your family and give us another GOSPEL uplifting CD real soon.  
 Never before have I been moved so completely by a simple reference book. The author skillfully weaves his understanding of our democratic system with a profound love for L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics -- not an easy task. I bought this for my grandmother... and she hates books. That's how good this is. "Better than Cats," she says. I can't say I necessarily agree with her -- for starters, the private sector's influence on public policy and decision-making is nowhere near as entertaining as Mister Mistofellees' song and dance -- but who am I to argue with an old woman? Nobody, that's who 
 This is southern literature at its finest. Nordan finds a way to be dark, brooding, disturbing, and hilarious all at the same time. I reccomend this to anyone interested in modern literature 
 This book will be used by my builder for my new home.  The photos are magnificent.  The display is exactly what I wanted him to learn 
 Brief story about how I discovered this cd.  I was at work on a Saturday afternoon, trying to catch up on work and had my radio playing the great WXPN in Philly.  One song caught my attention and as I listened, I thought to call into the station to find out who the artist was.  AS that song ended and I was about to dial, another song came on and immediately attracted my attention.  I called in after both songs were over and found out that the first song was Yellow by Coldplay and the second song was Sing.  I had only heard the names of these bands mentioned on the radio and seen Coldplay's cds in the store, but had never really heard them.  I bought both and haven't stopped recommending either of them since.  I have told people and still stand by the statement that Invisible Band is one of the best cds to come out in the last 10 years, by any artist!  The songwriting is perfect the singing is beautiful and the melodies are soooo memorable.  If the members of the band read these, please accept my congratulations on a masterpiece!!  I do call it one of the greatest cds I own (out of a collection of over 3,000).  Some side notes... some of the songs sound inspired by the Moody Blues and I always thought that Flowers In The Window sounds like a cross between the Moodys' Dr. Livingstone I Presume and an early Kinks song.  Have the guys in Travis ever talked about who their influences are?  Just curious.  I would recommend this cd to everyone 
 Oh, what a wonderful, living, time machine of a book.  The subject is "daily life in 19th century England."  More directly, the book is addressed to anyone who ever read a book by Dickens, Austen, or one of the Bronte sisters, and found themselves struggling along as best they could to grasp the importance of whist, calling cards, and the different types of carriages.   I would think that if you're a fan of Victorian literature, you'll love this book, but honestly, I'm not a fan of Victorian literature, and I enjoyed it intensely.  We live in a rapidly-changing, diverse, multicultural society now, and while this certainly has its strong points, there seems to be some pleasure in reminding ourselves of the vitality and strength of English society at the height of its 19th century influence.  Somewhere underneath our current world, we subconsciously sense a shared heritage here worth remembering (and this has nothing to do with bloodlines; I'm Czech by blood, but still feel the power of a world I care about stirring back to life in this book.)  It is -- for lack of a better word -- fun -- to read through these various explanations and to see this forgotten world coming back together.  How do I make change, what are shillings and pence again?  How do you play the card game, "whist?"  What terms of address are people of different social ranks supposed to use with each other?  Why are the English eating pudding all the time in these novels?  What's the difference between a brougham and a curricle?  When am I supposed to leave my calling card, and to whom?  And what are all these dances that Elizabeth and Darcy are doing?  Victorian literature allows readers to swim in this cultural landscape but never really explains it.  One just has to try to pick it all up by osmosis.  That's actually a perfectly good way to learn about a culture, but for those of us who like a little more straightforward explanation, this book fits the bill.    It's as though you took the Time Machine back to 1835, made your way along as best you could for a while, and finally someone sits you down and says, "OK, THIS is how all this works. Use THIS spoon, and don't call Mr. So-and-so that, it's rude, etc. . . "  The light bulb finally goes on in your head, and you feel much better.  If the book simply explained all this stuff without being vivid and fun, I wouldn't give it five stars.  But it's written with a lively humor and contagious affection.  I raced through it, and I think most other interested readers would as well 
 The disaffected viewer in Canada, I wish him  a greater awareness of what's in front of his face.  This film approaches the level of a sutra.  Be not distracted.  
 I really enjoyed this book from beginning to end. There are some very touching passages that get to the heart of what a good marriage is and the unique bond that husband and wife share. I am glad this story wasn't about finding new love soon after losing someone who was clearly her best friend and soul mate. For the most part it is about finding other areas of pleasure in your life through exploring different types of bonds with friends old and new. It is also about new beginnings while still honoring the memory of the one she's lost. I could read this novel over and over. The deep respect for marriage is refreshing in a world that can be dismissive of marriage's sanctity and too often focused on those that fail 
 Goes down in my favorite hip-hop videos of all time.  My favorites are this, breakin, breakin 2, and freshest kids.   This actually helped lead me into breakdancing. From there I got "How To Do The Robot" and "step-by-step." These ones turned me from a hip-hop spectator into a serious breakdancer.  All of these are essential 
 If you are a designer you can't miss this wonderful movie, Tati was a genius to understand the big mutation in early '50 european society....made by mass production theory that was coming from USA 
 This is a very underrated movie about 4 women who are trapped by their circumstances in the Old Wild West. Mary Stuart Masterson and Andie McDowell are both prostitutes who dream of a better life and when that chance comes along they run with it into unknown and scary territory. All of the female  leads in this movie give very solid and real performances and Drew Barrymore proves that she has indeed grown  into a fine woman.I give this movie 5 stars because it is a novel concept which the makers of this film managed to realize very successfully 
 Mastering Cisco Routers is a great book for understanding many aspects of Cisco routers not typically covered by CCNA books. The author has great information on how to secure your router, usefull information on creating access lists to block standard DoS attacks, and some great information on VPNs. The book also covers TFTP, Syslog, and SNMP setup for both the router, and UNIX and Windows hosts. The last 2 chapters present very useful scenarios for both large and small networks.       The only things that were lacking was the chapters on routing (doesn't really go into any detail on setting up routing protocols), and the chapter on LAN protocols which barely touches on IPX, AppleTalk, and NetBEUI. Overall, if you already have a decent understanding of the Cisco IOS, and want to get some knowledge outside of the normal CCNA type information, this is the book for you 
 This book is fantastic! I loved every recipe I tried! Bravo Don! Bravo 
 as Darwin says, quoted in this book's introduction, and Mr. Konner succeeds well at demonstrating just that. Not that I don't have reservations: as a lay reader, the long descriptions of brain chemistry, the repeated attempts to salvage Freud, and the (not often) trite prose, were off-putting, but the wide range, the decency, the generosity of spirit, the insight and the beauty of this book make it well worth the 5-star rating. This is a book that you'll want to read in short snatches, and to savor, even though it is 500 pages long: it moves. Where E. O. Wilson, in "Consilience," sets out an agenda for a view of humanity based on Darwinian insights, this book actually gives Wilson's dream substance. It's hard to see how any critic of sociobiology, evolutionary psychology, or behavior genetics--especially those who keep saying that it's all speculation, that there's little empirical basis--can come away from this book not only edified, but enthralled

 Jim Rogers, an independent, insightful global investor, wrote this great modern adventure story. He made his money by being an investment iconoclast and that maverick attitude shows in his forthright assessments of entire nations and government bureaucracies. His ground-level adventures are entertaining, but they also provide fundamental research about global markets that economists and corporate strategists should find very valuable. If Rogers is right, his feedback could save strategists hundreds of thousands of dollars in research or consulting fees. He seems to report his observations honestly. He flatly states which countries he thinks are disintegrating, and which ones he thinks seem to be ascending. And, he throws in some disturbing opinions about the U.S. We find this book valuable for global investors, corporate strategists and people interested in adventure travel. While Rogers and his traveling companion had to endure months of inconvenience, inoculations and car trouble to make their trek, you can enjoy their story from your home or office - unless, of course, it inspires you to hit the road. 
 This is an opera I had never heard before with a cast I had not heard of, so I didn't konw what to expect. I purchased it because I was interested in seeing a Saint-Saens opera other than Samson & Delila, which is the only Saint-Saens opera that I am familiar with. I was very pleasantly surprised by this DVD.  This is a conventially staged opera with very good scenery & costume and excellent singing and conducting. Although it doesn't contain any well known arias, it is very melodic throughout. If you are looking for a less well known opera to add to your collection, I would highly recommend this DVD.  My only complaint is the lack of information (no synopsis of the story, etc.)in the one page booklet that comes with the DVD, although the (English only) sub-titles help in following the action.     
 This was super easy transaction..book arrived fast and in better condition than I expected. Totally happy with this seller. Mary An 
 I've listened to all of these songs side-by-side to the originals and Papa Doo Run Run's version are like somebody took the muffler off what the Beach Boys wanted to do. The harmonies seem fuller and richer, even though there are no acutal additions to the voices - it just sounds like you're listening to them on a better stereo.  The bass is definately enhanced on all tracks.  There are other extremely subtle differences - like on "Good Vibrations" the Theramin is brought out more - but it doesn't seem wrong.  In fact everything they do on this album seems incredibly right.  It's what the Beach Boys would have sounded like if they had the recording studios of the late 80's.  
 The book The Thin Red Line, written by James Jones, is the one story that makes readers see through the eyes of World War II soldiers.  This book lets the reader know the mental and physical hardships of being a soldier.  Within the first twenty pages of the book, James Jones gets the reader hooked.  He makes the reader crave for more after each sentence, not just by amazing writing and a great story line, but also by making the reader have sympathy towards the characters of the book.  If a person wishes to see into the life of a soldier's life, then this is probably the best book that person can read.  I really enjoyed reading this book, and I hope that you will too 
 Using Tibetan incantations, Mr. Bruno Coulais has composed some of the best musical scores I have ever listened. Every piece of music depicts the real life struggles of these people of Dolpo. The compositions are so strong, so natural, sometimes so haunting, it draws you ever closer to these people. To those magnificent and breathtaking sceneries, Mr. Coulais has added another dimension; his music tells the story, the drama, the struggles of life in its true authentic way of life of the Tibetans. With each piece of music you travel along with the caravan, singing their songs, sharing their moments of joy and sorrow. Unlike other soundtracks this one really belongs to the people of Dolpo. You must really listen to believe me 
 My one line summary is praise enough, but I will say that one of your reviewers appears to be miffed because a particular paragraph appeared to be arcane. I had expected, then,  to read something about, say, Penrose's writing style.  How could I have had such an expectation when that reviewer writes, ". . . there are a number . . ." There are a man who should read books on different topics.  There are a man who should buy a book on grammar.  There are no chance that he will do so 
 I agree that there should be warnings about a few of the oils mentioned in this book.  That aside, it is well worth getting if you are more experienced and know something about the oils already.  It is full of many  ideas and recipes specific to romantic and sexual aromatherapy, and would  help complete that area of your library.  I recommend it not as a basic,  but as something more in depth 
 Neither of them do a great job showing what kind of woman Ginger really was, though Furia has some scenes showing Johnny treating her as though she were nothing but trailer trash.  Let's face it, Ginger isn't going to be well thought of by any member of the reading public until she gets a full biography of her own.  Why not?  Ada had one--the wife of Vladimir Nabokov.  And after the two biographies of Johnny, we certainly need a life of Ginger as a corrective.  Lees hints that Johnny Mercer had a sexual identity problem.  Even if he did it wasn't Ginger's fault.  You know right away that as soon as some guy reveals that Judy Garland was the love of his life, well basically that is saying, well, he's gay.    That said, Lees is very good about exploring the general shape of Mercer's career.  It was a skyrocket that looped and billowed all over the night sky, and he never wound up in the place you might have predicted for him.  His writing was sometimes ornate and flowery, but just when you had him figured out as a Swinburne of popular song, he could surprise you with something austere and simple (like "I Thought About You" or "Autumn Leaves" or "The Sweetheart Tree").  His writing changed with the times, and yet it seems timeless, like the moods of "Moon River."  Gene Lees responds more than Furia to the claims place made on Mercer, from Savannah to New York to the famous Capital Records building in LA which he helped to build.  He remains an inspiration to songwriters everywhere; poets too 
 I bought the 100 pack for $23.. great price, not one error and they're made sturdy..what else can you ask for? 
 Well, I am really not articulate enough to write a proper review of what is one of worlds best metal bands, DARK TRANQUILLITY (DT). I will try anyway since I want to express my gratitude to DT for making such a masterpiece.   DT started in early 90s and had quite a lot of lineup changes and record label false starts. Initially, Anders Fridn (now singer of another great band, IN FLAMES) was in charge of vocals while the current screamer Mikael Stanne was handling rhythm guitars. But for whatever reason, Stanne switched to vox and Fridn left to join In Flames.  In 1995, DT released Of Chaos And Eternal Night with Stanne singing. Then came Gallery and Mind's I. I wonder where the term melodic death came from but underground metal circles in Sweden and around started refering to In Flames and DT as originators as the Melodic Death Metal movement, also known as melodeath now. But I strongly think that even At The Gates was part of that movement (check out the ass ripping Slaughter of The Soul).  In 1999, Dark Tranquillity released Projector (recorded and mixed at Studio Fredman, September 1998, Produced with Fredrik Nordstrm). The album experiments with electronic elements and an equivalent distance to melodeath really, while Stanne sang Projector with an extremely sad voice. Projector is a killer album with a great focus on melodies and sadness. But the beauty of this album lies in the fact that the metal sound was not left behind. If someones says Projector is not metal, I doubt he/she knows anything about what metal is. This is a METAL album albeit with experimentations.   Anyway, out of the 10 tracks on the CD, I dont think there is a bad one. The album opens with the fantastic FREECARD, Stanne's vocals bringing blood out of my eyes. What a song and Stanne ripps us apart by singing from his stomach. But wait, what come next is equally pleasing/disturbing in the name of THEREIN, another excellent song. Followed by track after track of carefully crafted melodic, metal masterpeices.   From the entire album, my pick is DOBERMANN. Coming in the second  half of the album, this one kicks in so hard right from the begining...I am never amazed at the shelf life of this song. Every single time I hear this, I see sun shine. I mean it, the opening riff makes me so optimistic about life and crave more music of DT, I cannot explain in words what this song is, if you havent heard it. Great song, one of DT's best in the league of Feast of Burden (Haven), Monochromatic Stains (Damage Done) and Lost 2 Apathy (Character).   Great album, and anyone with an interest in metal and its various fascinating sub genres, Projector is highly reccommended. I believe that this album will still sound fresh and great after 10 years. Thats the quality of music here 
 It's Simple, easy, and clear~!  For the foreign students who want to study American culture and values, it's the best choice.  Particulary, Ameriacan beliefs and values and American Government and Politics are recommendabe parts of this book.  It was very useful for a text material of the cousework such as "Anglo-Amirian Culture and History", or "Understandin American History".  Highly recommended~!!!   Scarle 
 i bought this phone's cousin (with the keypad, answering machine base) for myself six months ago, and like it a lot. i've since referred it to two other people who both had histories of crappy cordless home phones. they both bought this phone and both love it.  only identified probems: when recalling a caller id number, the phone will not add a 1 for out-of-area calls. so the CID return feature only works for numbers in my area code. once in a great while the phone, when picked up off the receiver, will search and not connect giving an "out of range" message. while this sounds like a major problem, it happens rarely and is fixed by simply picking up the speaker phone on the base. 
 this was probly the tightest Prophet solo joint. His underground solo was dope, but he sounds hella grown up compared to that one. I like the original version of Powder (on this cd) better than the Lil E remix.. 
 These are my standbys for entertaining. Look like Waterford, have a nice heft to them, don't break easily--when they do you don't cry!  I have been using these for years, but needed replacements. The price online including shipping was less than I could buy them for here.  
 One of the few Live albums -- by any artist -- that I have never grown tired of, and I've been listening to it for two decades. In the Bob Dylan catalogue, this is a highly underrated album.  This interpretation of Shelter from the Storm is as compelling as the original album version -- and very different.  Each track alone, and all of them together, is/are captivating.  
 The claim that the test requires only a couple of drops of blood is grossly inaccurate.  In order to comply with the instructions at least a dozen drops of blood are required.  I needed three finger sticks.  The results were consistent with the laboratory results I get through my doctor and the results I used to get with the now-discontinued Choice A1C Home Test.  I mailed the blood specimen on a Monday from New Jersey to Biosafe in Chicago and received the results the following Monday. Biosafe's privacy policy is very weak and their laboratory authorization form is intrusive.  I declined to disclose my Social Security number and  e-mail address.   
 This gem of a CD from my collection is classified as "My Parents Music."  I have been replicating my late parents' collection of long playing records (Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Dean Martin, Doris Day, Rosemary Clooney, Kitty Kallen, to name a few) in CD formats and it's been an on-going project for me and a very enjoyable one.   When I was growing up, my sisters and I just loved to sing-along with "Mambo Italiano," "Come-On-A-My-House" and "Sisters." Oh how we loved these songs by Rosemary Clooney back then and we absolutely enjoyed listening and singing along with so much gusto! ;)   This marvelous collection features sixteen of her biggest hits of all-time. My favorites include "You'll Never Know," with Harry James and His Orchestra, two beautiful songs arranged and conducted by Percy Faith - "Tenderly" and "Half As Much,"   and "Hey There," a selection from the Broadway musical "The Pajama Game."   And my very highlight is a song that she recorded in 1955 with the Benny Goodman Trio and charted as #20 for eight straight weeks at the Billboard. The Trio's superb accompaniment complements Rosemary Clooney's lovely classic voice.  "Memories Of You" ~ Words & Music by Eubie Blake & Andy Razaf ~  Waking skies at sunrise Every sunset, too Seems to be bringing me  Memories of you   Here and there, everywhere  Scenes that we once knew And they all just recall  Memories of you  How I wish I could forget  Those happy yesteryears That have left a rosary of tears  Your face beams in my dreams In spite of all I do Everything seems to bring  Memories of you.  Add this wonderful CD to your collection and let Ms. Clooney take you back in time and enjoy her greatest and biggest hits of all-time. 
 I bought one when it first came on the market back in May. Half a year and 5,000 pictures later, here are some of my comments:  - It is a GREAT digital camera in its own class. By "class" I mean one should not compare it with a dSLR because the S3 is not one. So do not expect it to overcome "shutter lag" easily, although among other DC (digital camera) I have used, shutter lag on S3 is greatly improved--to a degree that I feel comfortable taking photos in very fast pace, e.g., catching flying birds. (However, only good dSLR can completely eliminate shutter lag and S3 is not a dSLR.) One also should not compare the S3 with the "small" point-'n-shoot DCs. S3 is not as small as those--it won't easily slide into your pocket, unless your pocket is relatively big and loose (like mine). But the slightly larger body brings great features none of the small DC can offer.   - Big optical zoom (12X) and IS. 12X is GREAT and combined with Canon's Imagine Stabilization, S3 turns into a powerful large zoom camera with superb imagine quality. My recent trips included shooting (with cameras in case you wonder) wild wolf at Yellowstone National Park. And this little S3 came out as the only one that can capture the animals at great distance, along with other "big guns" the professionals carry. The IS feature eliminates hand shake with great effect and I could shoot at 12X with low light and still get quality photos. I also highly recommend the "TC-DC58B Tele Converter Lens" for the S3 (or S2) which gives you another 1.5 zoom that effectively make S3 18X zoom (equivalent to a 600mm lens). Check how much those big telephoto lens cost (close to 10K) ...   - Excellent video shooting. Again a feaure one almost never finds on any other DC or dSLR. The S3 takes DVD quality video in stereo sound, not just video clips that most DC can do. This little (almost) pocket-size camera now forces our digital videocam into an early retirement.  - Many other great features. However those are more or less standard and one can always try to argue some other DC may have similar or better features. I won't comment on those.   In summary, the S3 is a great small-size DC. Its superb lens offers big 12X zoom and IS, two technology of Canon's pride. It also offers DVD video shoot with stereo sound--this feature alone can save you a digital vidoecam.  One suggestion--do get a big SD card if you want to shoot video too. I have a 4G SD card and I think 2G is a must. Also battery life is excellent. It uses 4 AA-battery, which seems a lot odd at the beginning. But it comes in handy because as long as you can get AA battery you never worry about power. With typical dSLR, if the battery is out you are done for the day unless you find a power outlet to recharge (and have your charger with you).  I do have one small complain. The Menu button at the back of the camera is at the location where my palm presses the body. Sometimes I raise the S3 and I see the menu in viewfinder because my palm has pressed it strong enough to trigger it. Another press is needed and I lost several shots because of this.   I have other dSLR with quality lens. But I always take the S3 with me on any trip 
 This is an informative and sobering review of the root cause of the conflict we are in. This conflict we are in is the most serious that we have faced in my lifetime because our nation is divided concerning the cause and results that face us. Our people are asleep and subject to attack. One would think that the WTC disaster of 9/11 would have awakened them to the danger. Perhaps it did for a time but they have returned to their state of apathy and need a dose of "The Everlasting Hatred" to awaken them 
 Squares Beware!!! The kings of Psychobilly are hear and they don't plan on surrendering anytime soon. These 12 tracks of psycho insanity will leave you demented and deranged and you'll love every bit of it. This album has got it all. Creepy instrumentals like, "Hell & Damnation(Meteors Won't Die), "K is for Chaos" and the western influenced "Ride Bastardos Ride", show off Mr. Fenech's spine bending guitar work. There are also plenty of straight from hell rockers like the classic "Hell Ain't Hot Enough(For Me), the raucous "How Mad Is Max?", and the moody "Raging Thunder". "No Surrender" is a Psychobilly anthem that is sure to make all the undead rockers out there proud. This album also boasts two killer covers, a Psychobilly take on Ronnie Self's "Petrified" complete with psycho sax and a rockin' version of The Johnny Burnette Trio's "Midnight Train". Every song is guaranteed to get all of you sick psycho guys and gals wreckin' like there's no tomorrow 
 I came by this book quite by mistake.  As there are "no mistakes in the universe" just consciousness at work, I am so grateful to Emma for writing a concise and informative book on "miracle healings" in Brazil. I had been aware of John of God but not the other healing centers nor the "popularity" of these centers in Brazil.  Being American and not exposed to "alternative healings", Emma's book brings to light tangible hope for those in need of emotional, spiritual, physical and menetal healing.  She includes in the book very sad statistics about our American health care system and the very need that WE regain our senses back to simple and common sense approaches, including following the Spiritist Doctrine in our daily lives.  My only sadness after reading Emma's book is not being able to run down to Brazil to be a part of these healing centers because I do not speak a word of Portuguese.

 Live Rhymin' is a very good live record from Paul Simon.  He perfectly mixes songs from his first two solo album with songs from his Simon & Garfunkel days.  The songs are done in mostly the folk-rock vein, but he does sprinkle in some nice instrumentation on the sweeping "El Condor Pasa (If I Could)" and the touching "Duncan" as well as gospel singers on "Love Me Like A Rock" & "Bridge Over Troubled Water".  The latter song is quite interesting to hear as the original is a showcase for Art Garfunkel, but Mr. Simon's interpretation is strong. Other strong songs include "The Boxer", "America", "Mother & Child Reunion" & "American Tune" 
 This book is great for anyone who is interested in fantasy or Lord of the Rings but doesn't want to take the time in effort to read them.It is also good as a prelude to the series altough I'd recommend the Silmarillion too.It is a short little book about a sensible and yet adventurous Hobbit who goes on an adventure with Gandalf the wizard and a group of dwarves to find a lost treasure guarded by a dragon in a far away land.There are many references to the Lord of the Rings books such as the finding of the Ring and Gollum,Mirkwood and the wood elves(Legolas' kin),and Sauron(the Necromancer).It is a fun book that you can probably finish in a week without too much effort.Not deep like the Lord of the Rings,but fun,active,and adventurous so it's great for kids as well as adults.I was disappointed with the ending,however,because it did seem rather anti-climactic 
 This book is filled with lovely pictures of altered artwork. Although it's not a how-to book, it does include some brief descriptions of various techniques used in altered art, including one by Melissa McCobb Hubbell on digital artwork. It's about time someone thought to include this in a technique listing, since most of us are now using our computers for some aspect of our art. If you're looking for a book on basics, this probably isn't for you. If you want something that gives you lots of visuals to spin off into your own ideas, it's well worth the cover price 
      "Two hours and yards of catgut later, we dusted the patched up peritoneal surface with sulphanilamide and pushed the entire mass back into the abdomen. When I had sutured muscle layers and skin everything looked tidy but I had a nasty feeling... The extensive damage, all that contamination- peritonitis was inevitable.       'He's alive anyway, Tris,' I said as we began to wash the instruments. "We'll put him on to sulphapyridine and keep our fingers crossed." There were still no antibiotics at the time but the new drug was a big advance."  This series is the absolute pinnacle of slice of life stories, and this volume continues the strong precedent set out in his other books.  James Herriot once again relates a score of experiences from his past; in this case, the running theme is his service in the Royal Air Force and the pregnancy of his wife, Helen. As always, Herriot presents us with a lifestyle that we can all envy, despite his self-deprecating asides.  He paints a graphic, lovely, and seemingly true-to-life portrait of life in the Scottish Dales.   Herriot is at his best when describing visits to local farms when he does hands-on work under the watchful eyes of the farmers. Their stoicism is always amusing, and the technical details of the veterinary practice of the time are always fascinating. I found the RAF adventures to be a little less engaging, but the book is well worth reading.  Highlights of this book include a depressed man whose dog, Digger, starts to go blind; a sick farmer whose calf has severe stomach problems; and the care of a horribly wounded stray cat that turns out to be rather remarkable.  I didn't read these books in order, and now I wish I had. You can really enjoy all of the stories without any background, but you can probably enjoy Herriot's life a little more if you see him go from newly appointed apprentice to respected top doctor.  
 David Baldacci has again hit a home run and shows why he is the top thriller writer in America. Unlike other major writers of thrillers, DB keeps his merit-earned place at the top of tier-one storytellers by excellent writing and a super storyline. Weaving two intricate plots together in a very satisfying and enjoyable way, DB also exposes real time possible senarios in the powerful corridors of political Washington. His excellent vehicle of using the clever and complimentary members of Camel Club to fight the bad guys works well for readers and keeps the pages turning to keep up with the action. An absolutely excellent read which will win DB more fans! 
  Perhaps, in NORMAL LIFE, director John McNaughton never realized his luck in combining the right timing, assembling the right actors and actresses and the right story, all wrapped into one movie, considering his other boring one, Lansky, that was a sleeper, for example.  NORMAL LIFE is quite skeletal in its complexity (or in other words, is not unnecessarily convoluted), telling a dynamite story, hitting viewers not unlike a hammer hits a nail on the head, such is the shock of seeing the progression of a upstanding, law-abiding police officer mutate into a hidious, stickup artist, on the word of a hot, crazed, libido-filled, drugged, delinquent young chick, played incredibly well by Ashley Judd, known to not shy away from controversial, shocking and out-of-the-norm roles.  A Christian friend of mine, having seen this movie, admitted having cried from having seen it, in dispair of the damage borne by the man, in an attempt to preserve that monogamous relationship with Judd, satisfying her many wants and needs, to the point of sacrificing  his own line of work, and putting his life on the line in criminal enterprises for profit. Other people loved this movie, from its originality, all praised Judd's natural feel in playing the role that she did, and the maturity of Luke Perry, who very well conveyed to the audience the anguish and emotional torture  endured from this wild ride of a relationship.  Of course, NORMAL LIFE's ending, condemns the entire behavior, as it obviously had to, considering the movie is taken from a real life story, from almost 40 years ago, in USA. 
 Excellent reading. It begins with the history of the invention of the lamp and goes all the way to the invention of the computer. Great historical references and a very unbiased view of the history of all inventions. My favorite chapter is on the invention of the Television, which has not one but 5 inventors. Great reading 
 I declare! I've read all seven "Miss Julia" books produced thus far, and although at times the situations are a little too outlandish or I lean toward thinking perhaps the series has run out of steam, like any durable serial, the characters draw me back again for the next installment.   I'm glad I picked up the newest offering because author Ross gets back to the basics that attracted me in the beginning, e.g., Miss Julia's relationships with Hazel Marie, Little Lloyd, Lillian, Mr. Pickens, the church folk, Sam, and others. Among its finest charms, this book features a timely balance between the narration of the present-day situation starring a more "evolved" Miss Julia and some lovely mid-book chapters reminiscing about the first Christmas Little Lloyd and his mama roomed under Miss Julia's roof and how that contributed to Miss Julia's personal evolution. Typically, Miss Julia first tipped toward one extreme about Christmas giving and then in reformed-Scrooge fashion flipped to the other extreme.   These antics of extremes are amusing but they also point to some recurring tight-rope acts a reader faces regarding the way Miss Julia herself (the sole narrater) is portrayed within this series. Her opinions, even as a more evolved character, spill out at the reader in a way that make one wonders whether one would really like to know her because she tartly tends to give with one breath and takes back with another! Her tendency toward being judgmental is very much in evidence. It is as if author Ross is either consciously or unconsciously putting a two-edged sword in Miss Julia's mouth.   For that reason, I tend to feel more empathy with those who surround Miss Julia. I love sweet-souled Little Lloyd and wish he were more an actor than one-acted-upon in the stories. More development of the Pickens/Hazel Marie relationship would be welcome too. On another a high note, how glad I am that in this book, dear Sam, that enlightened man of Miss Julia's, is not a source of plot conflict but a genuine partner with her in diffusing the book's main problem. Her growing bond with Sam is such a fine juxtaposition to Miss Julia's disfunctional previous marriage.   "Miss Julia Stands Her Ground" is a definite high-note-addition to this series.     
 The abriged audio tape version of "Emotional Itelligence" conveys highly technical information on the exact topic identified by the title:  why emotional itelligence matter more than IQ.  The two tape set identifies area after area in your life where emotional intelligence interacts with and occasionally superceeds IQ.  This information is interesting, and well supported with cited case studies.  The presentation is highly technical, as you might expect from a graduate level course, and mostly lacking the entertainment aspect emphasized by most audio tapes.  The only problem I have with this tape is that it offers no advice whatsoever on how to improve your emotional intelligence.  There isn't even any advice on where to go to get such information.  Aspects of emotional intelligence are defined, and the impact they have on your life is identified, but nothing more.

 Lizzy Enders is ripped to pieces with grief after losing her very sick mother on the Santa Fe trail. But she is even sicker when her father abandons her along the way- at a Catholic boarding school run entirely by nuns. She is a Methodist, and the other girls look down upon her. She is also stuck sharing a room with her horrible cousin, who can only think about herself. While trying to understand the ways of the strict Catholic church, Lizzy is asked to accompany a strange lady who lives at the convent up to her son's grave each day. She learns more from this lady than she could immagine. But when she and her cousin, Eleanorea, end jup in the town on an escapade in the middle of the night, Lizzy meets a carpenter, desperately in need of a job. Lizzy gets a strange feeling about the man. She knows the church needs a staircase up to the choir loft built, so invites him to come talk to the nuns. She forms a tight bond with the man, who preforms one of the most famous miracles in history before he vanishes. Lizzy is wrapped up in a whirlwind of excitement around every corner. A very good book. It was a little descriminative against Catholics in my opinion, but that takes little away from the book itself. An all-around great story 
 this book is of great help as therapist and the information has helped me to assist others in understanding the connective tissue bette 
 Winner of the Oklahoma Writers' Federation Best Young Adult Novel of 2003. I wrote this book because there is a lack of powerful and empowering role models for Indigenous children in the world of literature. Many stories about American Indians are full of stereotypes and inaccuracies and the characters wallow in poverty, alcoholism and despression. I hope readers of all backgrounds will enjoy this adventure story. Grand Canyon Rescue can also educate those who never think they will find themselves in an outdoor emergency.  When Oklahoma Choctaw Tuli Black Wolf's famous search and rescue tracker mother is called to help locate missing hunters on the Grand Canyon's North Rim, 14 year old Tuli is allowed to go with her on the dangerous search. Although Tuli is assigned to set up camp and care for the tracking dogs, one evening while accompanying her mom on a quick search the two are separated by a rainstorm. Now alone in the great, dark forest and in a potentially dangerous situation, Tuli makes a big decision. Should she stay put like her mother taught her to do if she became lost or should she utilize her knowledge of survival to embark on a hunt to find the lost men? The answer comes easy the next morning when she discovers the hunters' tracks. She locates the lost hunters, but one becomes seriously ill and they find themselves in an early snowstorm. In order to save the scared and humiliated men, Tuli must embark on another trek through deep snow to find the base camp. 
 Frederick Beuchner seldom dissapoints. This is true of this delightfully poetic view of Jesus' life. Based on some of the more famous pictures of Jesus by various artists, the paper back edition, while handy to have and easily portable lacks the charm of the larger hard cover original edition which contains reproductions of the art work. Typical of Buechner's immently readable style, this book delights the senses while deepening the faith.  
 We were looking for a cheaper TV.  I searched online and made a list of 3-4 possibilities and checked them out at my local Best Buy.  This won the contest hands-down.  Not only is the TV packed with many features, but the built-in DVD player just makes the decision more than easy.  Picture quality is great.  Ghosting isn't evident, but can be seen easily in 24 fps video.  In fact, that's my only real complaint, but it isn't a big one, so don't put a lot of weight on that, ok?  Additionally, even though the screen is 16:9 aspect ratio, playing 4:3 at 'normal' aspect ratio still looks good, and there's a button on the remote to 'stretch' out 4:3 images to fit the screen without losing any of the image.  It's a very handy feature that's easy to use.  Close Captioning is also available at a single touch of a button, which is better than most TVs out there.  Using the HDMI input is a breeze, and the image quality is great and crisp when using it.  However, please heed the warning in the manual and DO NOT connect your PC to the HDMI input.  There's an analog D-SUB connector specifically for your PC.  The DVD player is easy to use.  The only complaint I have about the DVD player is that it has a slow load time.  But image decoding is good, and I haven't run into a problem with playback yet.  In fact, one REALLY STRONG point this unit has in its favor is that it plays DivX files.  If you download movies on your PC and burn them to CD-Rs, this will play them, and plays them really well.  Also, as per standard, the DVD player also plays audio CDs, mp3s, photo CDs, etc etc etc.  All these work well.  Audio is also good.  If you don't connect the audio outputs to a separate audio system, you might be a little disappointed with the low volume from the built-in speakers.  I wasn't disappointed, as I do care about my eardrums.  But otherwise, it works just fine.  My wife complains that switching channels is slow.  After she pointed it out, I agree that it's slower than other TVs, especially any Sony model.  But it doesn't bother me, I'm not the kind of guy that tries to see how many channels I can scan through in 30 seconds, because I know exactly what I want to watch and when it's on.  For this price, this TV/DVD combo is an unbeatable deal 
      Ok, I was kind of fat.  Not fat, like that those people whose behinds they show on the news when doing stories on obesity in America, but I was in the process of going from thick, to fat.  "What Would Jesus Eat?" reversed that trend.  What I like best about Dr. Colbert's book is that it provides information on how to achieve a real lifestyle change, not some sort of fad diet.  Also, kudos to Dr. C for helping change my life while heaping praise on the Good Lord.      What separates Dr. C's ideas from those of other people is that in the case of diets like the South Beach diet, and the Atkins diet, no group in history has sustained civilizations based on them, the Mediterranean and Kosher diets however have sustained the civilizations of major peoples life the Romans, Greeks, and Hebrews, over long periods of time.  The fact is also that cutting out processed foods is a wonderful idea being this artificial bleaching and processing of food is a modern phenomenom, so eating a whole grain minimally processed diet will provide a centuries-proven benefit.      I have lost ten pounds since being on the diet.  I think most of it came from following the parts of the Bible that mention the consumption of deserts, but only during special events.  Me being a slob who ate at least one candy-bar a day took that to heart, and started from there, and it has worked wonders.  In fact the very few times I do eat desert now, it tastes much better being that my body is starting to be conditioned to see sweets as more of a special thing, and less of a normal boring activity.  What a wonderful book.  Praise be to God 
 This is truly a remarkable book.  It contains a compendium of knowledge on civil defense approaches for surviving a nuclear war.  Much of this material will apply directly to impact threats from asteroids and comets.  It's a book you can stake your life on 
 This book may be difficult to find - take the time!  A fantastic read.  Alesia Holliday has crafted a wonderful representation of the world many of us live in nowadays.  She presents her story in an interesting format of email between herself and her husband (with narration at the beginning of each chapter to introduce the topic of that chapter).  Illnesses, job changes, children, deployments, and much more.  It really runs quite a course, and is highly recommended for anyone with a relative in the military, new (or experienced!) military spouse, or just someone who would like some insight into the everyday life of today's military family.  Warning however!  Be careful drinking hot liquids while reading this book!  I have a sweatshirt that took many washings to get the stain out after laughing so hard that I completely lost control of my coffee mug.  Alesia has managed to turn some very stressful moments on their ear by relating it through humor.  What an extraordinary woman, and a must-have book.  Keep them coming 
 Excellent. Saunders' satirical tongue is in full effect, as in his CivilWarLand In Bad Decline (a wavemaking machine eats a small boy while the protagonist watches and is upset that he'll have to clean up the mess.) A hilariously scathing indictment of corporate America, a la our fascination with amusement/theme parks, Pastoralia is worth picking up. Let the hilarity ensue. 
 Very good CD,   even though it did take me a long time to finally listen to the CD in it's intirety(did I spell that right?)  It is definately mood music, but don't let that scare you, groovey, sexy, funky even dance, all tracks are very easy on the ears.  I beleive you won't be dissapointed 
 I really liked this book. I think it's the perfect book for anyone who wants to start learning about wicca and for begginers, as well as more experienced readers. The book of shadows is great and the book has many examples, which I like, and it's also easy and fun to read. I read almost the entire book in a day since I enjoyed it so much. I defenitely recommend it 
 I have read all of the books in this series and this one was my favorite and i think that it is sadest one of all.  all the sisters part and they find the real meaning of the pants and how close they really were to each other even though they were a great distance apart. 
 Where I Belong is a great debut album from a new inspiring artists. I just had to listen to it once and I fell in love with it.  1) Days Like This: 5/5  2.) Me and Emily: 5/5 (her 1st single, the lyrics are beautiful) 3.) I'm Gonna Get You Back: 5/5 4.) Strong As A Oak: 4/5 5.) Shame on Me: 5/5 6.) If that Chair Could Talk: 5/5 (my fav slow song, the lyrics are so well brought out. It really makes the album stand out) 7.) If You're Gonna Leave Me (Leave Me Alone): 5/5 8.) Didn't I: 5/5 9.) So Close: 5/5 (True lyrics on how hard it is to find someone and sometimes how close you can get) 10.) We Did It Our Way: 5/5 (My fav fast song. Its a nice song about a naive, young, and green couple) 11.) Where I Belong: 5/5 (The music in the song is so beautiful, Rachels voice is so dazzling)  
 I was introduced to this book by a friend while staying at their vacation home on Lake Champlain in Vermont.  It had rained most of the stay and I had exhausted my own supply of books and was wandering through their dusty library shelves when the dame of the home entered and knowing that I am an avid reader, recommended this book.  She is a woman in her 70's and said that to this day she reads the book about once a year.  I was instantly smitten and spent the next day and a half reading constantly, much to the chagrine of my husband who could not believe that I took the book in the tub, on the boat, to bed, and to a hidden spot in the servant's quarters in the attic to finally finish the text.  The writing is easy and eloquent.  The story is funny and simple.  I love how Ms. Fisher gives us the ability to see what's going on in Betsy's mind and the haughty-taughty little gal is a hoot!  I found myself wishing I was 12 and had just read the book.  I know I would put on the character and emulate the old-fashioned principles idealized in this quaint story 
 This is a great album.  My daughter does not care for old fashion gospel music but she likes this album.  She is 16 years old and to me this speaks volumns for this album 
 The Bloodshot Gang knows how to have a good time!  If you're into the whole Alt.Country thing, you know that some of it is very sincere and serious (ie, Uncle Tupelo, Jayhawks).  Now I love "No  Depression," and "Blue Earth," but this is an altogether  different quadrant of alternative country known as Militant Honky Tonk, or  just Insurgent Country.  Truth be told, this incredible anniversary  compilation does have some poignant, serious numbers (Rico Bell's  "Money to Burn," the Texas Rubies' "Blue Diamond Mine,"  Mike Ireland's "I'd Like To"), but for the most part these  maniacs are not taking themselves or the world that seriously.  You've got  Andre Williams and Sally Timms singing "I'll stick to you like  glue...", in mock romantic seriousness with background singers going  "G-L-E-U, GLUE!"  You've got a song with a man and a woman  serenading each other saying with deep country feeling how much they miss  each other's bodies.  You've got Kim Docter and Moonshine Willy belting out  "Turn the Lights Down Low," which really ought to be a hit it's  so catchy.  And you've got some great deadpan covers -- the Waco Brothers  do a country rave-up of the Who's Baba O'Riley," Red Star Belgrade  does it to AC/DC's "Highway to Hell," and best of all, the Unholy  Trio turns Public Enemy's "Bring the Noise" into an understated  redneck anthem.  I'm only scratching the surface here, with 40 tracks over  2 discs.  This is a great introduction to the rowdier side of that  sprawling beast that has not a name that can be agreed on...     And don't miss the fantastic earlier Bloodshot compilation, HELL-BENT (Insurgent Country, Volume II) -- see my 9/5/04 review 
 I found this book to be a wonder expose' of historic patterns in the decline and fall of great civilizations.  I consider myself a well read amateur historian, and I rate this book a 5. I recommend it for everyone. Ronald Wright makes great observations and he brings them full circle by relating history's lessons to today's problems regarding fossil fuel and war in the Middle East.  This is a must read.  
 I remember reading this book for the first time - over eight years ago as a ten-year-old.  Each of the several dozen times since that I have re-read it, I discover new things to love.  Alexander writes so beautifully that not a single word is wasted; he creates images that linger in the reader's head for much longer than the average writer's creations.  His protagonist, Theo, is so vivid, so real, so painfully human that you agonize with him over every decision and gasp with him at every tug on his heartstrings.  You also laugh with him, but the humor in this and the other Westmark trilogy members is comic relief. I've read that this series is too dark for children, but I would say that, for an thoughtful reader, the Westmark trilogy is perfect.  Although the series has been targeted by publishers toward a younger age group, teenagers and adults (I convinced my mother to read the series) would appreciate it as well 
 Sayreville,New Jersey-based Bon Jovi put out their self-titled debut album in the spring of 1984 on the Mercury label. Mercury had a lot of hard rock/heavy metal clients such as Kiss,Def Leppard and the Scorpions. This album spawned only one Top 20 hit,RUNAWAY. It wouldn't be until 1986,upon the release of SLIPPERY WHEN WET, that the band would gain a much greater deal of attention,personally and musically. 
 Few movies have evoked emotions such as this one. The movie is a spectrum of beautiful elements that encompass eachother. The music weaves perfectly into the script and highlights the subtile yet overwhelming interactions between Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung. The movie is emotionally and intellectually draining, and thus, cannot be viewed too often.. 
 I know only a little about the historical Anna and have read an excerpt from her Alexiad. This book was a nice fictional take on her life that I enjoyed reading 
 As popular as Prince was in the 80's, it's hard to believe it has taken 18 years for Under The Cherry Moon to find it's way to DVD.  Critics largely considered the film a stinker, especially considering it was only two years behind Purple Rain, but Under The Cherry Moon was a very good film, although very different than Purple Rain.  Shot in black and white, Under The Cherry Moon starred Prince as Christopher Tracey, him and his buddy Tricky (Jerome Benton from The Time) are living it up in Europe.  They wine and dine the rich and upper class and take their money, basically they are gigolos.  They swear it never gets personal until Mary Sharon comes into the picture.  Christopher falls for Mary in a big way, but her father Issac Sharon isn't having it.  Drama ensues. The soundtrack is awesome and includes the songs "U Need Another Lover Like You Need a Whole In Your Head," "Mountain," and "Kiss" and the DVD includes the videos for the songs shot for the film.  A must have for Prince fans. 
 "Beyond the Black Stump" may be the weakest of the novels set in Australia, but it is still an enjoyable book to read.  There are no mystical elements here ("In the Wet") nor has his ability to write dialogue for American English improved any.  Having said that, the book has a quickly moving plot, some excellent character development and lots of Shute's dry, killingly funny sidelights.  You don't want to miss the Chinese cemetary.  And there is a fine twist to the dénoument 
 Defoe wrote this in the late 1700s, and it was revised in the early 1800s,  with comical footnotes about how those antiquated business practices had  now been modernized!  Defoe was involved in various mercantile ventures,  and wrote from hard earned experience, providing a bona fide textbook of  business strategy and negotiating practices that is still very cogent  today.  I'd highly recommend this book to young people entering the  business world, but alas it's out of print, and thus impractical to obtain 
 This book will entertain for 4 through 9 years old.  This pig family would like to go out to eat but they don't have any money. So they start looking for money.  They look in the basement, bedrooms, and closet. The color pictures were excellent 
 The other reviews are accurate - this is a super bag.  I researched a lot of bags and settled on this one to replace my old Targus CityLine bag for my Dell M1210.  I would just add a couple of notes to what others have said:  First, it's a little heavier in the hand than you might expect, though the handle design helps distribute the weight evenly. BUT once it's on your shoulder, the ergonomic contour design makes it hardly noticeable.    Second, the shoulder strap is well padded and doesn't slip at all.  This can actually be a problem if you're wearing a heavy coat, however, as the strap can be a royal pain to remove - no matter what you do, it won't slip off your shoulder.  Instead, you have to sort of peel it off.  Takes a little getting used to, but this is a minor annoyance compared to the benefits of this case.  Also, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the handy ticket/passport pocket really is convenient when you're traveling.  The front pockets are also very convenient.  It's a little unfortunate that there aren't any CD sleeves built into the bag, given that it already has more pockets than a levi's factory.  Overall, a fantastic bag that looks good, and is great for travel.  Highly recommended 
 I found this book a real must for every sales professional. I am not saying that it reveals something brand-new; however, it really shows a power of questions in sales 
 As an artist, I am known for my color, and this book is bursting with color. I was able to view three of his pieces at the Chicago Art Institute.  One of  the paintings at the Institute was a transitional piece that I had just been  studying, so to my surprise I was delighted.  When I receive a book I rarely  know if it will have color plates.  This book and all of the research is the  best I have found on Rothko.  After twenty years of reprentational art, it  will be a focus of the colors of Rothko  that I may be using in my workings back to abstract.  This is a large book, it is a heavy paperback and has  many, many pages to puruse.  I have enjoyed it abundantly.  Also the history  is useful in the tranistion of his work.

 When was the last time you had a meeting that was so well organized and efficient that EVERYONE in the room complimented you?  Since I started implementing the lessons in The Manager's Guide to Effective Meetings, participants thank me for making sure everyone is prepared (there are tricks to that!), for keeping the meeting moving, and especially for not EVER wasting their time.  The use of easy-to-read formatting helps to make this book user friendly and, best of all, the shaded hint boxes with snippets of information make the suggestions, cautions, and concepts easy to remember when it counts most 
 I was expecting a more intense courtroom drama and mystery. While that was there to some degree, it is more a story of a small Mississippi town, and a crime and punishment that plays out over many years. I was not, however, disappointed. The lead character was ingriguing and he changed realistically with the passage of time. There is a good newspaper story and a friendship that grows between two very different people. Interesting and well-developed characters 
 I love this movie. Matthew Brodderick dose great in his roll as Professor Harold Hill, and Kristin Chenoweth lets her beautiful voice ring in "'Till There Was You". My absolute favorite though is Victor Garber as the hilariously tongue tied Mayor Shinn. With just a few differences in story line from the original, it is a great movie for the entire family, and all those out there that love musi 
 P.G. Wodehouse is famous for his characters and his marvelous mix-ups in English country houses that will remind many readers of the better Shakespearean comedies in which lovers run amok in the Forest of Arden.  Writers have always admired his original turns of phrase.    In his later years, Mr. Wodehouse often recycled his characters and the stories became impenetrable in some cases to those who had not read the earlier books.  But every so often, he took the time to develop new characters and put them into the usual country house run around.  That's exactly what occurred in The Girl in Blue, with very fine results.  Homer Pyle, an eminent corporation lawyer, is abashed to have to rescue his sister, the wealthy Barney Claybourne, from being prosecuted for shoplifting from Guildenstern's on Madison Avenue in New York.  It seems like there's a history in the family, and Homer doesn't know what to do.  When Guildenstern's insists Barney be taken out of town, that solution proves to be a relief.  Guildenstern's suggests that Barney be kept away from department stores so they agree to take Barney to a country home that takes paying guests in England, one Mellingham Hall, operated by the impoverished Crispin Scrope.  Meanwhile in London, Jerry West, Crispin's nephew, finds himself falling in love with a fellow juror.  That's a problem because Jerry's already engaged to one of the town's great beauties . . . who happens to be a gold digger.    Crispin's brother, Willoughby, becomes the London host for Homer and Barney and shares with them his pride and joy, a Gainsborough miniature that he has just purchased.  Homer panics and the fun begins!  The story proceeds at a comfortable pace to pose all kinds of awkward situations and dilemmas that lead the characters even more into the soup.  It's a delightful plot and the characters are even more wonderful.  Enjoy!  
 Patrick O'Brian continues his series of wonderful novels about the Royal Navy in the age of sail. I am amazed how he is able to continue to construct fresh interpersonal dynamics to keep the plot lively. I continue to be impressed with his ability to convey vivid images and emotions of his characters. Those who have served in the military will sympathize with O'Brian's characters through his great descriptions of how leaders wrestle with leadership and endure bureaucracy. Anyone unfamiliar with his work should start with the first in the series, Master and Commander 
 This is the best civil war book you will ever come across it is about a young man named Henry who is caught in the conflict of the Civil War.At first all he does is march all he could do is think about fighting but when the enemy attacked he wished he was still marching.Until the moment they won because of his bravery they won the battle and the war 
 My three-year-old nephew already knew his numbers. He loves watching this video---picks it over Dora and others.  He can now add all the single-digit numbers and some double digits.  He has some blocks that look like the quidgets in this video and that helps reinforce the concepts when he isn't watching.  He loves to stack them up, starting with, say, 2 blocks and 4 blocks, and putting them together to make !!6 blocks!! He gets so excited 
 This book consists of 1000 chess puzzles and their solutions.  There is also a very brief review of the major tactical themes and examples.  There are eleven chapters, generally groupings of puzzles by increasing difficulty. These also include chapters devoted to endgame puzzles and to tactics that turn out backfire.  Among the chapters are tests by which the readers can gauge their progress; the solutions are accompanied by a chart that compares scores with approximate Elo ratings.  The final chapter provides puzzles of highest difficulty that might challenge even grandmasters.  All of the solutions have been checked for accuracy using a computer.  Another thing I like about this book is that the vast majority of problems are given without any kind of hint (e.g., number of moves to mate, or which tactical idea to use).  Thus the reader has to approach each position with the same level of information as in a real game.  In this regard, it might have been even better if the "Find the Wrong Move" puzzles were mixed in with all the others.  All of the puzzles are from actual games from high level competitions, or from related analysis (detailed references to the players and events are given in the solution section) - as opposed to compositions or studies, which can be quite artificial.  Thus the positions are "realistic" and serve well for developing practical skills.  Most of the positions are from recent games, while others are from old Soviet Championships; therefore the reader can be assured that they are not a rehash from familiar old sources.  The position diagrams are absolutely crystal clear (unlike those in Reinfeld's books, for instance), and in all other respects the physical layout of this book is exemplary - something we have come to expect from Gambit.  The binding will hold up to the expect heavy usage.  Based on the level of difficulty of the puzzles, I would recommend this book to anyone who has familiarity with standard tactical themes, and is ready for the next level.  Perhaps USCF 1400 is a reasonable minimum.  This book is among the best for the intended audience.  Only Lev Alburt's "Chess Training Pocket Book" comes to mind in comparison (its 300 problems are complementary to those in the present collection, so it doesn't hurt to get both).  Reinfeld's well known puzzle books have comparable material, but the puzzles are grouped by tactical theme, and the production quality is marginal.  Those wanting something more elementary should turn to Seirawan.   John Nunn's marvelous puzzle book is yet more advanced still, and perhaps best suited to the 1800+ reader. 
 If you've always cooked with herbs, but always rushed off to the grocery store to get them fresh for your recipes, now is the time to stop and pick them fresh out of your own garden or pot! This book has a lot of great detailed information about how to grow, cut and cook with herbs. There are also a lot of pictures so you're not left wondering what something, you may never have seen before, should look like. The recipes are easy and tasty, the information is simple and this book makes a great gift or center piece on any coffee table. You'll be entertaining guests with your new recipes, indoor herb pots and wonderful cookbook, while explaining it all, in no time. 
 This is a great resource for those wanting to strengthen their midsection. The book contains a number of chapters, covering the importance of a strong body core, warm-up, stretching, and cool-down exercises, training guidelines, and exercises categorized into trunk stabilization and balance exercises, ab fitness exercises, ab strength exercises, and ab power exercises. About half of the exercises can be performed anywhere, and the other half require equipment such as a TheraBall, ab bench, barbell, etc. Each exercise is accompanied by a photograph and the proper steps to performing the exercise. The book is balanced nicely with different sections on setting goals, muscle physiology, proper exercise guidelines, and the like. A few sample programs are given at the end of the book, from which individuals can tailor their own program. All in all, this book has everything you need for a successful ab fitness program 
 We were asked to do a term paper on Adrienne Rich and some of her poetry. During my research I found this book and it changed my entire view of motherhood..or rather the institution of motherhood. I have never realized  how literally confining motherhood is. I look back at what my mom used to  tell me about how kids held her back from what she wanted to do, and I  realize (with the help of this book) what she ment. Not that was being rude  when she said this, just that it is a fact that our patriarchal society  uses motherhood to put women in 'their place'. Please if their is one book  you take time to read make it this one. Rich writes this analytical book in  such a way as to make it sound personal and interesting...not dry and dull.  Highly, highly recommend it if you are trying to understand your mother or  mothers in general. What an EYE OPENER

 I think "Big Shot" is the first important nonfiction work of the 21st century. With a clarity and an exuberance not often found in books about hard science, Patricia Thomas explains how politics, human frailty and corporate greed have prevented us from finding a vaccine for AIDS. Comparisons with previous books about AIDS and public policy don't exactly do justice to "Big Shot." If books must be categorized, Thomas' scrupulous research sometimes places this book with top ranking medical journals; but the wonderful writing -- you can almost dance to Thomas' prose -- places it  among the better mysteries. In the hands of a lesser writer, the workings of DNA, retroviruses, surface antigens and hard-working proteins would cause one's eyes to glaze over. Instead, I found myself turning pages with Evelynwoodesque speed to get to the next development and the next, wondering which young researcher would win the race to the vaccine goal. Thomas has raised the bar for future books about medical research 
 Rituals of Blood traces the impact of slavery on modern-day Black Americans in such an incisive way as to be required reading for anyone who wants to speak on the subject of the past, as it impacts on the prospects of Black Americans.  It's main thesis: the degradation of Africans from the day they entered this country until now, has been constant and devastating.  The conclusions Professor Patterson opine are supported by unimpeachable resources from some of the best sociological minds, past and present and hard data.  This is must reading for Blacks and Whites.   Henry William Sands, Esq. (Ret. 
 I command you to get this album before it'll be out of print 
 First some comments about the book in general. It's written by a working engineer who has spent a lifetime actually working in the field. He got into working on rotating machinery with an emphasis on alignment somewhat by accident. Then he developed his own expertise, and finally was persuaded to publish it in book form. This was done in 1986, twenty years ago. It has now been issued in its third edition that incorporates new techniques, new tools and as he incorporates his own additional learning.   The material covered here isn't covered in school. This is practical knowledge based on a lifetime of working with equipment out in the real world. The writing style matches. Mr. Piotrowski writes as he talks, one professional with a lot of experience talking to another who will be there one day.   Any maintenance man working in an industrial plant will quickly recognize the problems discussed here, and will find other nuggets of knowledge that will help him to identify other areas where he needs to re-think about a problem.   Highly recommended 
 I've been teaching IMPACT self defense training for 11 years at an all-girls school and I share several of the essays in "Beauty Bites Beast" with my students -- they love them!  Especially the one about the word "bitch."  Really changes the girls' perception of that insult and takes the sting out of it.  Which is great, because too many women let the horror of being called a "bitch" stop them from setting boundaries and standing up for themselves.  Oh and just to set the record straight with regards to an earlier review: in IMPACT's training, we ABSOLUTELY teach students how to deal with incoming punches from an assailant.  Always have 
 THIS NOVEL IS A FRESH AND UNIQUE APPROACH TO ILLUMINATING THE TERROR OF CULTURAL AND PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION OF A PEOPLE BY COLONIALIST ENSLAVEMENT.  THE SURREALSIT EDGE PROVIDES THIS ANGLE IN A VIBRANT AND SUBTLY MOVING  MANNER; ONE IS SO ENTRANCED BY THE NOVEL'S NARRATIVE VOICE THAT AN UNCANNY  AWARENESS-- AND EMPATHY-- FOR THE PLIGHT OF A PEOPLE, IS INEVITABLE 
 Heidi Holland, with an Ivy League education and a Fulbright in England under her belt, is a lecturer in art history, an expert on female artists virtually unknown in their lifetimes, though their work is as good as that of the male painters who dominated their ages. Using the art history "hook" into the question of women and their roles--as they see their roles, as men see women's roles, and as women search for happiness within these roles--Wendy Wasserstein has written a thoughtful and very funny drama about the Baby Boom generation and the price its women have paid as they have searched for fulfillment.    Exploring Heidi Holland's life from the late 1960s to the 1990s, Wasserstein takes us from Heidi's high school and college days, as she grows in her thinking and view of her role in life, to her experiences with women's lib focus groups, the Eugene McCarthy campaign, the rise of AIDS, the gay movement, and ultimately Heidi's realization of what is important to her, not just professionally and philosophically, but personally and emotionally.   Wasserstein uses wit and a keen ear for dialogue to create quick, often humorous interchanges which advance the action and the feminist message without polemics.  Heidi is, on the surface, a success by all external measurements, but she feels that she is missing something from her life.  Professional success is not enough for her, a revelation that made this play somewhat controversial within the women's movement when it was first produced in 1988.  Some feminists apparently believed Heidi's desire for emotional fulfillment through love to be a sellout to a male dominated culture.    Wasserstein emphasizes that women should be able to pursue both professional success and a personal life, however, and the rounded character of Heidi remains a nice contrast to the more strident and sometimes hostile female characters with whom she interacts on stage.  Throughout the action, the play's high humor and absurdity are nicely balanced with scenes of sentiment and sorrowful revelation, and Wasserstein maintains her light touch without trivializing the issues.  Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1989, the play offers insights into significant social issues, gracefully presented so that they do not alienate the audience.  Mary Whipple 
 I just accidentally ran across this product when looking for a replacement copy of Gardner's book on fractal music. How delighted I was to find this complete collection of Gardner's works for Scientific American on CD! The Mathematical Association of America that makes this CD apparently doesn't fully appreciate the value of Gardner's work though. Their own review on this product states "I can't think of a better present for a clever 12 year-old, bored undergraduate, restless retiree, or stay-at-home parent". To me, this is somewhat insulting to both Gardner's publications and the individual components of the potential audience that they point out. You would think by that statement that you are getting DVD sets of Bugs Bunny cartoons instead of the priceless gems contained in these publications. I bring this up just in case you run across this description too and get the wrong idea. All of the people mentioned above will enjoy this book, but not for the reasons implied.  Gardner makes math fun, but he doesn't trade depth for amusement. There is some serious math in each of his works, but even his most complex puzzles and chapters can be appreciated and enjoyed by people lacking advanced mathematics backgrounds. Besides the fun of experiencing math from the author's standpoint, there is considerable food for thought that can be the beginning of interesting programming projects, particularly in the realms of graphics and computer music. If you enjoy joining programming with mathematics as I do, Gardner's works are great idea books.   Note that Gardner has written numerous books besides those included in this CD since he left Scientific American. Some of them are on mathematics and puzzles as these works are, but he also has written quite a few essays on pseudoscience, philosophy, and other varied subjects, all using his trademark wit. You might want to check them out 
 This book, Waffen-SS Uniforms: In Colour Photographs is, without a doubt, a MUST HAVE for any WWII library! Although one of the earlier reviewers stated that the uniforms were mostly reproductions, he is wrong, as pretty much everything in this book is real! You won't get this kind of great colour photos in any book this cheaply -- if you don't buy it, you're an idiot 
 In Tibet, a Spiritual Friend is equivalent to one's lama or guru.  This book is a superior introduction to some of the best aspects of Tibetan Buddhism (i.e. Vajrayana).  It is written in a very readable form with sensitivity and grace.  I cannot think of a better book to give a friend interested in knowing about or starting out on a journey to Vajrayana.  I heard of it long before I read/bought it.  Presently, I've loaned it out.  It's a great book to have on your shelf for reference and especially to loan to other seekers 
 This book is the most decadent of all the English works in the canon of literature, I think. The prose is admirable, the characters are compelling, and the whole book is full of obvious and implied vice. This book, after having been taken to heart, is probably capable of reforming any provincial folk into cosmopolitan epicures 
 I've bought a lot of aphrodisiac cookbooks, and none of them have been as fascinating, educational, and practical as this one. I use this cookbook often. The "testimonials" from real people were wild! I commend the authors and designer on a job well done 
 Kagan has written a concise easy to read history of the Peloponnesian War.  While I decided not to read Kagan's 4 volume History I don't in away way feel confused about any part of the war.  The book reads like a good fiction novel where you just keep on reading to find out what happens next. Every character is this true to life drama is given in detail but not so much that is slows the book down, or so little to leave the reader wanting more. Anyone who wants a better understanding of this turbulent history of the Ancient Greeks needs to read this book.  The major themes of this book and of this civil war still ring true today and will into the future.  Anyone considering reading Tides of War By Steven Pressfield take note, this is REQUIRED reading before you read Pressfield's book 
 It's impossible to over-estimate the contribution this book has made to our understanding of intelligence. Before it came out, intelligence was synonymous with IQ and IQ was synonymous with the ability to reason. And, as our education system was based on these cultural norms, it was woe betide you if your intelligence didn't fit the one-dimensional IQ mould. Gardner's identification of other types of intelligence paved the way for a real appreciation of intelligence as a multi-faceted thing of beauty; and to our paying more than lip service to the notion of valuing diversity.   Though respected in academic and professional development circles, Gardner's work doesn't seem to have achieved the popular appeal of Daniel Goleman's Emotional Intelligence, which came along a few years later and took advantage of some neat positioning as the polar opposite of cognitive intelligence. This is a shame, as Goleman's work has been diminished by many who followed [who have stereotyped EQ as a feminine intelligence and IQ as a masculine intelligence] whereas Gardner's work provides no such temptation. His seven intelligences don't include EQ but his intra-personal and inter-personal intelligences more than make up for its absence.   Since writing Frames of Mind, Gardner, who never claimed his original list was exhaustive, has identified two more intelligences - naturalist [the ability to see patterns in nature] and existential [a propensity to ask philosophical questions and ponder the big picture]. And others have added to the multiple mix with Spiritual Intelligence [Danah Zohar and Ian Marshall], Social Intelligence [Karl Albrecht] and even Gustatory and Olfactory Intelligences [or taste and smell if you prefer less pretentious labels].   That we now have something of a multiple muddle of intelligences - where every observable ability is in danger of being named as an intelligence and where there's a rampant fashion for sticking the word quotient after a variety of traits, so you can identify everything from your Autism Quotient to your Success Quotient - is no fault of Gardner's.   Having spent the last two years looking for the order in the multiple intelligences muddle that has trailed in Gardner's wake, I've had cause to re-read this book many times and I have an even greater appreciation for it now than when I read it the first time - and, given how impressed I was on first reading, that's saying something. Our thinking about intelligence may have moved on since this book was written, but if you want to know where it all started, this is the book to read.  
      This is an excellent novel by Stephen King.  Fast-paced, suspenseful, an d chilling all are words that could be used to describe this story.  King does a good job in setting the mood of desperation but determination on the part of its protagonist, Paul Sheldon.  I love how King puts his characters through their paces without them becoming cartoon-like or boring.  Very unpredictable story and thought provoking.  This is a good read 
 I thought LeBron's book was excellent.  It had alot of facts about his life as a kid and as a teenager growing up.  Lebron and his mom never had a real home.  When LeBron was in 5th grade he missed around 80 days of school.  They bought a home and then there new life begins.  I would reccamend Recommend this book to people who like sports Especially basketball 
 Once again, Hybrid drops another spectacular album.  Teaming w/the washington orchestra the two boys from wales drop one of their best albums yet.  (i would have to say wide angle is still the best) however, since i started spinning back in 97, hybrid has been at the top of my list for their innovative sound.  Hyrbid steps away from the mainstream breaks movement to deliver a solid, techy, progressive break album with incredible vocals and synths!!! A must have for any break junkie or electronic music lover 
 The model 71385 is the spoon spatula, the all-purpose is 71383; if you order before Amazon fixes this, you'll get the spoon 
 These are fantastic.  Not dry or bland like some granola bars.  They're very chewy (kind of like Rice Krispy Treats!!) with lots of flavor.  I have these for a mid-day snack.  My 3 and 4 yr old love them too.  I also have tried the peanut butter version and found them to be equally as good.  I had been buying these bars at our local health food store.  Not only was I paying more money than Amazon sells them for, but they were not as fresh as the bars I got from Amazon 
 ...No matter what you think of the Clintons, this is not a hack job.  The writing is very balanced, if a little confusing during the Whitewater phase, and Hillary comes off as someone with flaws- her main one being her  husband.  Can't get enough of those Clintons 
 If you look for reliable information thoughtfully presented, as I do, you will like this book. The first author is a top-flight legal consultant specializing in jury selection. She knows what she's talking about. I especially liked the objective, analytic attitude that permeates the book. The authors never forget to qualify their statements and warn the reader that there always are exceptions and false leads. What a difference from the watered down platitudes delivered with solemn confidence that are all too common in the self-help literature! The first chapter speaks about the method---objectivity is key; there are no silver bullets; practice makes perfect. The second chapter lays out the people-reading process in broad strokes. Subsequent chapters take on specific issues: physical appearance, behavior, context, etc. Most specifics are plain common sense but there is great value in having them gathered together and systematized. There is a one-page summary of the key points at the end of each chapter. Two detailed appendices list the various signs and their possible interpretations. All in all, this book bears all the marks of a useful and trustworthy source. I enjoyed reading it and I'm sure I'll refer to it every now and then. The sequel, 'Put Your Best Foot Forward,' is good too 
 I hardly think Dave Barry needs yet another "He rocks!" review.  It's fairly clear that Dave Barry is the wittiest writer to come along in a generation (if not longer).  However, Amazon will stalk me until I write this review so here it is - This book is hysterical.  It's vintage Barry and a wonderful collection to have laying about the house for when you need a "hit" of Dave.  I highly recommend it 
 I really enjoy this book and it has helped me greatly, in getting things a little more organized! This is my first year I have begun homeschooling, and honestly, I am so happy I ran across this when I was starting out. It gives a very good outline of what requirements I should keep in mind for the grade level of my child, and is a reusable source for planning weekly, monthly and yearly schedules.   A word of caution though - this isn't a book - rather it is a binder. It is quite simplistic really, and you could find all of the information on your own just by looking at the internet for a couple of hours. However, this is already put together for you. Also, this is a book I would ONLY reccomend for people just STARTING OUT on the homeschooling path. At first homeschooling can be very overwhelming... and this brings a lot of information in a condensed form... I feel by your second year though, you would already have your own system in place.. and this book wouldn't be helpful then.  Very helpful and complete! (for first year homeschoolers 
 I first read this book way back when I was thirteen. A little young for that sort of thing, one might say, but my mom borrowed it from a friend and thought it might be good for me to read. She turned out to be quite right, as I haven't yet encountered a Koontz novel that I actually disliked. Some were better than others, of course, but I haven't read a novel of his yet that I wouldn't rered. In fact I read Dragon Tears at least once a year.   The story begins on a Tuesday morning like any other. Police Detective Harry Lyon starts his day by having breakfast at his kitchen table, then cleaning up the kitchen. He then heads to work just in time to hit the streets with his partner, Connie Gulliver. WHile stopping for lunch at a burger joint before resuming the search for their current suspect, they are thrust into a life or death situationwhen a man enters the restaurant and peppers the place with bullets. after an intense chase that leads them into the building's attic and a few close shaves involving a pair of hand grenades, the two cops manage to bring down the killer.   Things only take a more disturbing turn when Harry, standing outside the restaurant for a breath of fresh air, forces a young man back behind the crime scene tape and is subsequentl visited by a derilect in a black raincoat who warns him that he'll be dead by dawn before dissolving into a cloud of refuse.   Harry's day only gets worse as he becomes the target of a series of bizarre, supernatural events in which he suddenly finds himself holding objects he can't remember picking up.   Things only get worse for Harry when, returning home from the office he is surprised by theman who appeared to him on the street. Upon discovering that bullets are ineffective against this particular adversary, Harry is forced to flee for his life as his condominium bursts into flames. Later, with Connie at his side, Harry goes to see his friend Ricky Estephan, whom he visited after leaving the restaurant, only to find him brutally murdered, his eyes torn from their sockets and his house infested with an army of snakes and spiders.   Elsewhere in the day, others find themselves living under the same bizarre threat, from a former advertising executive fallen from grace thanks to a drug addiction, to a beaten down mother and son and their dog Woofer. As the day progesses, Harry and Connie find themselves fleeing for their lives from a seemingly invulnerable foe. Their search for the identity of their attacker ultimately leads them to an expensive private nursing home and a burned-out, forty-something-ish blind woman with a dark past and a connection to their persecutor that they never expected.   In his usual fashion, Dean Koontz delivers a tale of action and adventure and excitement. I've been hooked ever since 
 Great exercises and a good read. Put this book at the top of your list if you are looking into psychic intuition. It is the subtle messages that carry the most information 
 I bought this for my teenage daughter and she has loved it. It has been easy to use and is tiny, yet durable. In some pictures I did notice a blueish outline around people (their aura???) which was mentioned by some other reviews I had read, but I think that this is par-for-course with many of the digital cameras with a tiny lens. Since she primarily uses it to take pictures of reluctant parents, friends, family and her dog, this camera is just right 
 As is printed on the cover, Clanbook: Baali is not suited for children. It's pictures might offend people as may its content. So if you are religious you shouldn't buy it. But to put it right the Baali are not all  satanists! They worship old evil beings called the Children (of  darkness)called names of old babylonian and assyrian gods. They are cruel,  sadistic, perverted, spread diseases via insects and perform rituals  resembling satanic rites what leads to their image as whorshipers of Satan.   Afer some time the weak Baali started to think of themselves as servants  of Satan because of the other clans. Thats a very short summary of their  history. So if you feel offended by anything stated here don't buy the book  otherwise buy it and enjoy an Chronicle enhanced with pure EVIL 
 Well I listened to all Harry Potter audio books in a row on my way to and form work over the last few month. The 5th one is again a very good one. Many new interesting characters are introduced and the plot has many points of high tension. We also hear some very important new facts for the overall Harry Potter saga. Compared to the other bocks however I think the storyline has not exactly the same brilliance as its predecessor "The goblet of fire". Jim Dale the narrator does again a really fantastic job in bringing the over 120 characters to live single handed. By the way if you know the other books you will notice that he starts in this book with pronouncing Hermione as Her-mi-o-ne and not Hermani anymore. Maybe some one has ordered him to do so  
 I agree with most of those that have reviewed this book.  It really does work!  The couple of people who have torn it down as a book that is so simple you could fall asleep from the boredom or because they found it to be insulting for it's simplicity obviously didn't read the title of the book and take it to heart.  It clearly says that this book is for those who have "30 Pounds OR MORE" to lose.  The purpose is to get you started and then you move to the stuff that is more challenging when you are physically able to handle it.  Someone who has 75, 100, 150, 200 pounds to lose and has been inactive for extended months and/or years of their life are possibly not going to be able to do extensive aerobic exercise right out of the starting gate.  If you had less than 30 pounds to lose, why would you buy a book geared towards someone with more than that to lose?  It's one thing to say "Hey, I bought this book thinking it might work for me, but I found I needed something a little more challenging" versus sending a message that you believe it won't work for anyone.  Pay attention, read the title.  It tells you all you need to know 
 Bair works really hard at making it clear that Sartre and De Beauvoir were two sides of the same coin. Larger than life as always but deeply and painfully human too. Despite the eventual demise of their "professional" relationship, and the eventual move of Sartre to study Flaubert and De Beauvior to her feminist crusade, the two are inextricably linked. Did she really have as much control (specially in the end) over Sartre and his life? We will never know. What Bair does though is succeed in making her human more than all of De Beauvior's work ever could. Despite the fact that De Beauvior and Sartre are larger than life, and they always will be, Bair makes her subject - human, vulnerable and understandable. It is comprehensive and exhaustive journey (despite whatever errors there might be), one worth taking at any junction in the readers Existential journey.  Miguel Llor 
 F Scott Fitzgerald is the greatest American author of the 20th Century.  It's easy to see why with this collection of short stories.  What I enjoy best about this book is seeing the experimentation of Fitzgerald's writing from one story to the next.  It's fun to see the literary and thematic chances that he took as his career progressed.  You should buy this book 
 Dark Shadowds b/w soap opera t.v show - takes me back to my child hood racing home to watch,at 12 yrs of age it put chills up my spine.. today its out dated its a comedy,but still holds some magic. its fun, i am enjoying the jorney.. 
 DBC Pierre's ManBooker Prize winning novel "Vernon God Little" would have grabbed me more if it had not been for the somewhat pedestrian plotting. Pierre is beautifully sarcastic and I love his characterisations and observations of people, but having a bit more of a story to hang them on would have curtailed my impatience. That said, it's an extremely quirky piece of fiction and has taught be a lot of what I've always wanted to know about cursing. I want to share some of my favourite quotes with you, in no particular order. "Parents succeed by managing the database of you dumbness and your slime, ready for combat." "Famous Actors put toothpast under their eyes to help them cry. Did you know that? I'm just telling you for court, in case you look too impassive. You know how impassive you can look." "A receptionist with spiky teeth and a voicebox made from bees trapped in tracing paper sits behind a desk in Dr. Goosens' waiting room." "I end up watching these useless brown moths that thwack around the light in my cell, felty splinters torn from nighttime, lost and confused." 
 The book itself is beautifully bound with thick hand cut pages. I found it to be pleasurable simply to hold it as I read it. Frances took me on a gentle journey through various small towns, museums and trattorias throughout Italy, along with shadowing her personal journey during that 6 or so years. The book had everything I want from Ms. Mayes Tuscany stories. If you are looking for an escape to an Italian dreamland, you will like this book 
 I found this book to be insightful and very useful in administrative organization analysis.  It was a useful tool in developing a change management program for a public organization 
 This is the book that the Chicago Chamber of Commerce didn't want the world to see. Instead of pumping up the tourism and real estate industries with promotional-pamphlet blather, Algren's essay presents the real history  and state of Chicago: the back alleys, the dispossessed, the swindlers  dressed up in their Prarie Avenue finery, the kill-or-be-killed ethos of  this cutthroat "trader's town." Seldom has indignation been so  lyrical 
 If you like Peter, Paul, Mary at all, you'll love this live album. This album displays their best voices, humor, and solo selections 
 Good collection!  Has the long awaited b-side "Wasted Rock Ranger!" Only complaint is that it doesn't have enough songs from the album "hooked".  Other wise it would be perfect 
 I agree with Oceandweller who said he/she wished this book were still in print so he/she could send a copy to all his/her friends.  This book is terrific right from page one until the very end.  I bought this book used, I forget how much I paid.  Whatever I paid, it was worth it.  It's not often in one's lifetime that one comes across a book like this, both educational and entertaining.  Dale Carnegie pulls you right into the story from the very first page and you just can't extricate yourself from then on until the book ends.  Not only was the story so interesting, but Lincoln comes across as the wisest of men.  "With malice towards none and charity for all..." these, his words, keep echoing in my mind.  Though he fought the civil war, a terribly bloody war, he did this to save this great nation.  His words and his sentiment must be what is meant by 'love your enemies'(St Luke 6:27). Lincoln had no church; he said, "When I do good, I feel good, when I do bad I feel bad, and that's my religion". But through his life he exemplies the best which man can aspire to.  After reading this book, for me Lincoln stands head and shoulders above all the greatest men of whom I know something (there may be others like him but I haven't met or read about them).  This book should be required reading in all the high schools - in my humble opinion.      
 This should have been (at least) a three cd set.  King's X had such a vast array of great songs to choose from, they was no way they could have pleased all of their fans.  The three new songs are instant classics, as well.  The live version of "Over My Head" from Woodstock should have been the long awaited springboard to stardom, but it just was never meant to be that they guys would hit it big.  Please buy this as in introduction to the magic of King's X if you are not familiar with their work 
 This was the book more fantastic that I had read!!!!! This tell us about how a soul fell itself when your love is not recompensed. It makes a psycological interpretation of your mind in these  so sad and difficult situation.  It is a sensitive book for sensitive people 
 This book reads as if it were written yesterday--the writing sparkles.  After each chapter I looked up the philosopher in the Encyclopedia Britannica and compared the write-up there with Durant's.  In every instance, Durant's was far more interesting and insightful.  The book is more about history than about ideas.  This contrasts with the book Philosophy Made Simple, which is more about ideas than about history.  Reading both will give you a fine, intermediate level understanding of philosophy.  One disappointment is that Samuel Alexander and his work are not discussed.  I think that his major work, titled Space, Time, and Deity, is superior to anything done by Russell, who is covered.  Other than that, it's hard to find something to complain about.  The chapter on Voltaire is still so timely--the Arabs certainly need an Enlightenment thinker.  There is an article on Voltaire in today's Wall Street Journal 
 great work on clay building, includes everything from history to philosophy to detailed practical building guidelines 
 One hundred key discoveries of 20th century science are covered in a title which examines over a hundred years of progress. In 1900 there were no antibiotics, no radios, and no knowledge of Pluto, for example. The Eureka! Moment provides a short review of the 100 top discoveries in every field of science, using a lively tone which will lend to browsing by many a non-scientist 
 9-11 was meticulously planned out by our government. If people do not believe me, go read and study that day like it was your babay and you'll find the truth. I was a bit skeptical at first as well. Now my eyes are open to the totalitarian states that we live in. This isn't the UNited States of America, this is the beginning of a NEw World Order. Don't believe me, we'll probably never know, because we'll be spoonfed our news on the war in Iraq by the Corporate Media that controls and censors what we see and DON'T SEE! Don't think so? You, along with millions of other ignorant idiots who choose to follow the war in Iraq by watching CNN (Censored News Network), or Fauxnews. It pains me that people still don't realize that there is no fight for democracy in Iraq. Its a fight for Imperial Ambitions, we need Iraq for Oil, and to set up a puppet government so it doesn't scare Israel, our ultra conservative evangelical christian politicians can sleep better knowing their holy land is out of the hands of "radical muslim fundamentalists." No one will know until people actually open up a damn book and read for yourself, instead of relying on "experts" who "know" what is going on. I thought we were intelligent people, us Americans? Most of you can't even figure out wat the problem really is. Its our corrupt government 
 The Way of Ignorance and Other Essays is an anthology of writings by cultural critic Wendell Berry - one of Smithsonian magazine's 35 People Who Made a Difference - about topics ranging from what freedom is really being discussed when one speaks of "free market" or "free enterprise", to the costs of so-called rugged individualism in a democratic commonwealth, to sharp-laced observations on the Kerry campaign, and much more. Written in plain terms, The Way of Ignorance takes a cold, hard look at the doubletalk and doublethink that saturates modern American airwaves, stripping them down to bare conundrums, all with a heavy dose of the author's practical evaluation. An enthusiastically recommended, thought-provoking cross-examination of modern society 
 wat was the song n the beginning when rick snowboards down the mountain by himself 
 I adore this book.  It supplies you with gardening tips on growing herbs as well as info on garden layouts and cultivation information.  It also supplies uses for herbs for your household, culinary arts, and medical uses among other ideas for uses of herbs.  I highly recommend this book whether you're a gardener, a cook, or a homemaker 
 I really enjoy all of Hillerman's mysteries. I could tell this was an earlier one not just by the wear and tear of the book, but because his writing has changed and matured for the better in substantial ways. It's interesting how most women mystery writers tend to get worse with time, become more formulaic and can't break the mold. In Hillerman's books, I think the increasing emphasis on the culture and history of the 'four corners' area of the U.S. and the native Americans who live in that area, is as much a pull to his books as the mysteries are.   This book included a big part of the plot dealing with what are called Navajo 'wolves', which I guess does not exactly converge with European idea of witches, but rather a choice on the part of a person to choose to live out of harmony with their religious and familial beliefs. I actually wonder if we shouldn't come up with a word for that, because the idea of witches is archaic and from the Middle Ages, but many people make choices against societal mores everyday (and getting worse) and we need a new word for that.  Chee gets involved because of his own desire to become a practitioner of his tribe's religion as a shaman (though that word is wrong here also). Chee meets one of the women who have impacted his life and becomes torn about between the 'white man's world' and that of his own people. Apparently, several Indians are dying or have died from a long term illness, cancer, which  under normal condition cannot be given to a person like a influeza virus. At the same time, are several unexplained shootings, all having to do with a religion that became active during my teen years having to do with eating peyote buttons (cactus) with hallucinative abilities. I knew about this in CA because in the Bay area all the hippies were trying all kinds of drugs like LSD, and marijuana, and peyote was another one we would hear about, but of course this was outside the religious use.  This book and it's plot was very interesting. Hillerman just wound up the ending really fast without explaining some things concerning the gunman hired to hurry up the deaths of the Indians, and a man who had too many fingers in too many pies...a white man who was fighting with other white men and other Indians concerning this religion and a 30-year old unsolved bombing of a oil drill. We would hear all about those too when we would go to see our grandparents in Mesa, Arizona and the unfair treatment of the Native Americans over their lands and the mineral rights of those lands.   Hillerman's later novels are more satisfying, but as with most talents, some people do get better with time and age...  Karen Sadle 
 Of the recent films covering the lives and/or careers of artists, Basquiat is among the best.  While spanning less than 10 years in the life of this musician cum artists cum celebrity, it is all one needs to comprehend how this prodigy became overwhelmed by fame and fortune.  Juxtaposed against Warhol, who profoundly understood the dimensions of celebrity, we see Basquiat as quite the opposite--naive to the point of charming, overwhelmed at times, and utimately seduced by the all that is nefarious in a world in which booze, drugs, and sex are all there for the taking.  But this has all been seen before in the lives of people such as Belushi, Joplin, Hendrix, and a slew of others; so much that the early death of a young star seems to have become almost an archetype.  Yet it still intrigues us for multiple reasons, and, as pointed out early on in the movie, the death of an artist does seem to mystify both the work and the person.  Would Basquiat be nearly as famous now, had he cleaned up and continued painting?  We might guess that if that was the case there would probably not be a movie about him.  This serves to illuminate other burning questions indirectly offered by the film: was Basquiat really a good artist, or was he in the right place at the right time when the New York art market in the eighties was bullish in a way that will probably never be seen again?  And, is Schnabel canonizing Basquiat into the league of the mythical artist?  Whatever the answers may be, I can honestly say that my interest was thoroghly piqued, so that I was equally curious about Basquiat as I was his place and time.  Perhaps it is Schnabel the artist that shines through much of the film, moreso than Schabel the writer/director.  Basquiat the movie is replete with symbolism, both overt and covert.  To give an example of each, the narrative of the film is enhanced on several occasions by a sub-narrative of surfing--hopefully that is all you need to know.  Otherwise, the direction and cinematography seems to follow Basquiat's life and career, where choppy editing and eccentric montage play as almost as a sub-character.  It should be noted that many of the characters in the movie are in fact compounds of various people throughout his life during this time.  Of course, Andy is Andy, Rene is Rene and, largely, his art dealers are his dealers, but beyond that his friends and girlfriends in the movie generally cover multiple personages.    In the end, the tale of basquiat is tragic but compelling, and it is a movie that deserves multiple viewings, especially for those interested in the art world, or who like a good bio-pic.  Some fiction, some fact, but otherwise contextually acurate 
 This books makes you appreciate all of the advantages that one is afforded by simply being born into an advanced economy.  Yunus does an great job of explaining his rational for how he developed his bank and what has made it successful.  He truly does deserve his Nobel Prize as I am sure his banking model will have an ever-widening affect on the lives of millions for generations to come. 
 THE BAND: Jimi Hendrix (guitars, vocals), Noel Redding (bass), Mitch Mitchell (drums & percussion).  THE DISC: (1967) Originally 11 songs and approximately 40 minutes long, this digitally remastered edition (1997) gives you 6 bonus tracks and a total listen of just over 60 minutes. Included with the disc is a 22-page booklet containing song titles/credits, song lyrics, numerous photos, short bios on each band member, and a 4-page intro on the artist and the times. All words and music written by Jimi Hendrix except "Hey Joe" by Billy Roberts. Label - MCA Records.  COMMENTS: Hendrix only put out a handful of albums and it's a crapshoot as to which one is best. I'd have to rank Hendrix's top studio albums as follows: #1 "Are You Experienced", #2 "Electric Ladyland", and #3 "Axis: Bold As Love". As good as "Electric Ladyland" is/was, it was a double length album - so twice as many songs to choose from; not to mention Hendrix leaning away from just his power trio - using outside influences from members of Jefferson Airplane and Traffic. "Are You Experienced" though was his debut album (with the original 3 members only)... and his mark would forever be made. Distinct and brilliant guitar playing - full of energy and new ideas. Decades later, his abilities have rarely been matched... depending on who you talk, maybe they haven't. In comparing Hendrix's album to other legendary rock debuts - Led Zeppelin, Boston, Van Halen, The Doors, Chicago and Nirvana come to mind - I would say "Are You Experienced" is the mother of ALL debuts. Six huge hits are found here - "Purple Haze", "Manic Depression", "Hey Joe",  "The Wind Cries Mary", "Foxey Lady", and "Fire". Deep album gems include the mellow "May This Be Love", "Love Or Confusion", the 6+ minute psychedelic "Third Stone From The Sun" and the anthem-like title track with its backwards Beatle-esque overtones. The bonus tracks are nice add-ons. "Highway Chile" is always good to listen to, but the real gem is the blues tune, "Red House". The sound is better than on the original disc/album, but still not up to today's standards due to this being recorded in 1967, and so many improvements in the recording industry over the years. Classic disc (5 stars).  
 This novel was so utterly absorbing I scarcely noticed that I was on a plane and in airports the entire time I was reading it -- the time flew (as did I).  The first thing that struck me was the language: beautiful and sufficiently archaic to invoke the 17th Century, without being incomprehensible.  The second thing I loved about the book was the abundance of vivid historical information, researched in marvelous detail, about everything from lead mining and commerce, medical theories and herbalism, to comparative religion.  Some of the plot developments were so extreme that, despite often being moved, I occasionally felt a bit of ironic distance from the narrative, but overall I was fully engaged and just devoured this book and am currently enjoying Ms. Brooks' Civil War novel, "March." 
 "New Forms" was, is, and always will be the best Drum N Bass album out there.   Its not easy listening, its not very dancable, it is just pure music, and - I am afraid it sounds cheesy - it is really art. Its Jazzy, funky, very smooth, minimalistic, and its so subtle that you cannot express its quality in words.   Just let me tell you, you have to spend a little time on it - many songs are over 8 minutes long - but once you warm up to the album, you will listen to it over and over again, and you will find somthing new everytime you put it on.  This is as much 5 stars as it can get 
  Lance Armstrong's War, by Daniel Coyle, provides interesting insights into the seven-time Tour de France champion, his team mates and competitors, and many aspects of the sport that he has so thoroughly dominated in recent years.  This wealth of information is delivered in the context of the story of Armstrong's sixth Tour victory (in 2004) and the events leading up to it. The current edition also includes an Afterword touching on the 2005 season and Lance's ultimate victory.  The picture of Armstrong that emerges is one of limitless talent, relentless dedication, and compulsive attention to detail. It is a profile of greatness; larger than life in every respect. It is interesting to see the many ways in which Lance's leadership and drive positioned the entire US Postal team at a level beyond that of the competition.  Coyle does a good job conveying the intense vibe and pageantry of the Tour de France. An event poorly understood by most Americans comes to life through the reading of this book.  Unfortunately, however, at times the author seems to forget that this is a book about sports, as he lapses into flowery and grandiloquent prose. Here is an example:  "Each morning, even in winter, the European continent looks as if it is simmering over a cookfire. Not one big fire, but a thousand tiny blazes exhaling threads of smoke and steam until everything is bathed in a white-gray haze. The haze rolls over the countryside, filling hollows, flowing over the steeples of the thousand sleepy villages that float in and out of view like so many ghost towns, half dissolved in the heat of the modern world."  And then, on occasion, he goes totally over the top, for instance as he describes Jan Ulrich's pursuit of Armstrong in Stage 10 of the 2004 Tour:  "Ullrich took up his usual post on Armstrong's wheel, cruising with an aquatic stillness, his mouth open. He did not seem to breathe as much as filter-feed, the pink mollusk of tongue stirring sleepily."  Any idea what "an aquatic stillness" looks like? Beats me. And do we really need to know that Ulrich's tongue looks like a pink mollusk?  But, these literary lapses aside, Lance Armstrong's War makes for enjoyable and informative reading, worthy of a solid four star recommendation. 
 i don't know if there's any other album that's as fun as this one.    It has so much energy and it'll get in your head, but in a good way.  On the surface, they have the sound of any other punk or alt rock band, but their song writing is head and shoulders above the rest.    Doolittle strikes the perfect balance between catchiness and depth. It's been out forever but I still love it.    btw, Monkey gone to Heaven is probably my favorite track 
 This was a different direction for Disney in that it's not a musical, and it's a throwback to the silly cartoons of the fifties.  The story, the voice actors, and the style/design all work.  I laugh every time I watch this movie. The villain trying to poison the emperor, the henchman humming his own theme music, the chipmunk, the scene at the restaurant.... It doesn't stop. If you're a fan of classic/retro animation or just enjoy a big laugh, you'll love this.            
 Most of the tracks on this album are very good, but Lydia by Tim Story is special.  It is one of the most hauntingly beautiful pieces of music I have ever come across 
 I have performed many of these works with professional and amateur groups, and this is simply the best Billings I have ever heard.  It strikes the perfect balance between the raw energy and directness of this wonderful  early American music and the skill and refinement of great choral singing.   There are real adventures here as well, with several pieces, I believe,  being given their premiere recording, like the unusual New Boston/Hingham  and the simply beautiful Mourn, Mourn in Billings's final version.  Appling  is a tremendous conductor, and what is really remarkable is that this is a  live performance.  Most groups need many studio takes to do what this group  did in one 
 Frank Abagnale Jr. stands as one of the greatest con artists of all time. The story is inflated at times (in the introduction he claims to turn on the autopilot of a commercial jet liner, a task that in fact requires the actual ability to fly the plane to begin with). Still, the Catch Me If You Can is engaging, and Abignale's scams combine inventiveness and good humor. Enjoy 
 I'm drawn to chess for some weird reason but can't ever seem to get very good at it. Maybe playing more than once a month would help. Reading "Winning Chess Tactics" helped quite a bit. The text is very readable and the explanations are excellent. The book is divided into two parts. In the first part specific tactics are explained with numerous illustrations and examples. Just reading through this section will make you a more thoughtful chess player. The second section explores the moves of "Great Tacticians" and provides move by move commentary on their games. I've always found this to be pretty boring but obviously instructive.   Once you know the basic moves and have a feel for the game this would be an excellent next step. 
 Kabbalah and the Power of Dreaming is a magnificent guide to putting soul back in the body and walking a path with heart. Catherine Shainberg is a profound spiritual teacher who reminds us that dreaming is not only about what we do when we sleep but about waking up to a deeper life, remembering and navigating from our sacred purpose, tapping into Source energy - including the images that speak to the body and can make it well - and being present at the place of creation. Her book contains a panoply of practical exercises for transforming fear and anger into heart-centered energy, liberating ourselves from the rule of habit and healing the wound between Earth and Sky. 	Extemporizing on a common dream image, she incites us to stop being "passengers" on the train of life and instead become "switchmen" - which means catching ourselves every time we start giving our energy to a pattern or emotion, monitoring where the train is going, throwing the switch to take ourselves off the track of repetitive behavior or a negative emotion, and steering consciously toward a desirable destination. 	She knows that dreaming is a discipline, one of the most vital and powerful that our kind possess. "True dreaming calls for rigorous training", to take us beyond the snares of illusion and protection. When we grasp that "imagination affects the physical, and vice-versa" and that "the mind exteriorizes itself" and turn these insights into daily practice, we can consciously dream and re-vision the reality that takes form around us.  Catherine Shainberg was drawn to Kabbalah by a chain of dreams and synchronicities that led her to study for many years in Jerusalem with Colette Aboulker-Muscat, an extraordinary personality who was a leader of the French Resistance in Algiers in World War II and a lineal descendant of both Isaac the Blind (a medieval kabbalist in Provence) and Dona Gracia Mendoza (one of the leading Jewish women of the Renaissance). Though people sometimes think of Kabbalah as a bookish approach, heavy on numerology and difficult texts, Colette Aboulker's fundamental teaching was that the Book of Books is within us, and is to be accessed through images, after we have cleansed the windows of perception, and anchored in the wisdom of the body.   
 First the title. The Public Enemy leads one to think of such characters as he portrayed in "White Heat" now there was a dangerous character. Here it seems more like a collage of scenes that got linked together to form the film.   I never felt that Tommy Powers was a real Public Enemy like the Dillingers or the Little Ceasers . He was more or less a Kid from the slums who made it big by joining up with the more veteran criminals. He never really ran a gang and was basically just trying to make some money being muscle for the boss, he didnt  seem to have any ambition other then money and taking care of his mother.   The tension between him and his angelic brother was not as developed or fleshed out as it could have been which might have been interesting as a subplot including his brothers seeming manic depression upon his return from the battlefield of WW1.  What makes this film worth a thorough view is the countless innuendos that pass between Cagney and those dames he falls for.  One evening his bosses girl starts to get frisky touchy kissey feeley with him and in more words then not came just short of saying lets  f.....  The Next morning. While Cagney is at the breakfast table still hung over she come by on cloud 9   Bosses girlfriend: Thanks for last night Tommy. Cagney: You mean we?!?!?! Bosses girlfriend: We sure did.  Well how the censors let these obvious sexual ribbings get thru I dont know but it sure is a interesting piece of roaring 20s culture I would guess.  See this film as Cagneys first, enjoy him for being Cagney and watch for the scened between him and the ladies 
 I am listening as I write to this impossible, miraculous, tender, joyful, sorrowful music. I love all kinds of music, but I also know when I'm in the presence of truly great music, and this is it. This is music which reaches deep inside you and touches you where are most vulnerable, most authentic, most alive. To me it speaks of what is imperishable in the human soul, in spite of all the cruelties and vicissitudes of life, and of the love of God, which embraces and suffers with all God's creatures. It is alive with faith and speaks that faith to me. Arvo Prt must be one of the great souls of the age to be able to create art of this stature. 
 This wasn't for me, I gave it to my husband for his birthday.  He loves it.  Likes the pictures and likes how you can see the value of the cars as well as the Johnny Lightening Whites.  He also uses it as a check list to mark off which ones he has already collected.  
 If you've recently fallen in love with the "sport of kings" or simply wish to revisit the fundamentals that enthralled you in the first place, this is the book for you.  In Betting on Horse Racing for Dummies, Richard Eng somehow delivers the "rosetta stone" equivalent for horse racing -- breaking down the complex sport and art of handicapping into 26 trim chapters.    I wish this book was on the market when I fell in love with racing nine years ago.  
 From the first sentence to the last, this book had me sitting on the edge of my seat. If I had the time I would read it over and over again just to make sure i have every detail right. The ending was absolutely AMAZING and i would recomend it to anyone over the age of 13. The book is placed in england, in the 80's, and deals with love, jealousy, prostitution, drugs, stealing, killing, anger, running away, everything. The story line is mostly about a girl, named sara, looking for justine, a young girl with a torn skirt who she has only seen a few times before. While looking for her, she bumps into mental institutions, drugs, love/lust, prostitution, and crime.   I honestly think this is my favorite book of all time. And if you are looking for a different type of writing, and now the normal cliche book, i highly suggest this. 
 THIS BOOK IS A BOOK THAT IS GREAT FOR PARENTS OF KIDS WITH ADD, NO MATTER HOW OLD THE CHILD IS. MY SON IS FOURTEEN AND I WISH I HAD THIS BOOK YEARS AGO. IT IS THE BEST SOURCE OF INFORMATION I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS. BUY THIS  BOOK!  YOU WON'T REGRET IT 
 Most people have limited education in the building of the Panama Canal.  The sum total of my knowledge, prior to reading this book, was that Theodore Roosevelt fostered a revolution in the Columbian state of Panama in order to complete the work abandoned by the French.  That disease and pestilence was rife in the region and that American technology and know how carried the day.  Mostly correct, but woefully simplistic.  This book, written by the outstanding author, David McCollough, does an excellent job of tracking the canal project from its inception to completion, a story lasting about 35 years.  The financial and political intrigue accompanying the French effort is captivating.  The change of scenery (but with an equal amount of intrigue) to the American project breathes fresh life into the story.  And what a story it is.  It would be easy to attribute the ultimate success to superior American ingenuity and resolve, however, while this did indeed play a part, the impact of a national, government financed effort (as opposed to the privately financed French effort) coupled with huge strides in medical and mechanical technology in the intervening years probably was the most compelling reason for American success.    McCollough, in the course of the book, touches on virtually all aspects of both the French and American experiences, from scandalous  financial dealings, back room political deal making, the strong decisive personalities involved and the social and cultural factors which played such a huge part in the project.  In reading this book, you began to develop an appreciation for the immense scope of the undertaking and the effort required to pull it off. The level of organization required in such an effort is almost mindboggling.  It is difficult to imagine a project of equal magnitude (perhaps the NASA moon landings).  I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in history.  It should be required reading in all high schools 
 I loved this book!  I liked how the chapters were short, so I could read it in snippets.  Elizabeth Gaskell is amazing.  I loved the characters and how well written the plot is 
 Back from retirement, Detective Harry Bosch is still haunted by the kidnap and disappearance of Marie Gesto from 1993.  Now serial killer Raynard Waits is willing to lead police to Marie's grave as part of a plea bargain ensuring he will not receive the death penalty.  When Waits escapes during the outing and the tape filming the event is obviously doctored, Harry suspects politics and career advancement are involved and that, perhaps, Waits hadn't killed Marie after all but only been told how to find her grave.  The bones of this book reflect the usual excellent quality of Connelly's writing.  It has an interesting plot, Harry operating slightly outside the regulations, and descriptive, if slightly predictable, suspenseful scenes.  The references to Harry's past always make his an interesting character, particularly in the parallels to the killer.  What set the book back, for me, was the focus on the political mechanisms and the ending with it's classic conflict of legality versus justice.  There was also a major thread left dangling at the end.  While this was a more-than-good representation of Connelly, it was definitely not his best work.   
 Ok, yes, this isn't the next great American novel.  However this book is a great chick-lit to read when you're missing your best friend or if you just want to live the virtual life of someone on the NYC social scene.  Similar, yes, to The Devils Wears Prada but different enough to not have you guessing every beat of the book.  A worthy read for all fans of chick lit but if Hawthorne is your favorite writer you may want to pass 
 Cards are beautiful and book is well written 
 Prior to VHS or DVD - back in 1971-75 - when movie theaters (remember those, the ones where it was only $1 for two films and a short and the films were shown in BIG theaters - so what if the sound wasn't Dolby or DTS - films were still films not; just 1 of 10 stock plots enhanced by computer special effects.  Well, this film was so absolutely brilliant and profound, innocent and ageless that I saw it every time it was advertised "in the newspaper" - in the movie section.  I believe I lost count at around 75 - now with the DVD in my closet it just is not watched as mcuh but remains for times when it is necessary to remember that people are really alive and giving souls - whether they represent the protagonist or antagonist.  "Give me an "L"; give me an "I"; give me a "V"; give me an  "E";  L I V E,  live! Else you've got nothin' to talk about in the locker room."  A hint to the seeing of this work of art -"allow no preconceptions of what it will be or what it is, just let it be  - observe without judgement and you will KNOW 
 I enjoyed the film, it was comical,but had serious side to it. I really,really enjoyed the extra features on the DVD like the Backstage with interviews of the various cast members and my favorite producer Marc Platt. I also loved the music videos.  I truly recommend this 
 Don't mess with record companies. When Dylan left Columbia for Asylum in the early 1970s, Columbia apparently retaliated by releasing "Dylan" (as of this writing still not available on CD; not that anyone is really complaining). This album contained rather unnerving outtakes from "Self Portrait" (considered by many as his worst, or at least most confusing, album), including covers of "Mr. Bojangles", the Elvis Presley classic "Can't Help Falling in Love",  and Joni Mitchell's "Big Yellow Taxi". Dylan returned to Columbia two albums, and a little more than one year, later.  While on sabbatical from Columbia, Dylan played with The Band and "Planet Waves" appeared in very early 1974. Some rather exciting things followed. Dylan, in seclusion for years, toured for the first time since 1966 (and with the very same band). So, once again, fans had yet another "comeback" on their hands (1970's "New Morning" was also called a "comeback" as well as 1975's "Blood On The Tracks"; this speaks volumes about Dylan's repertoire). But this time the tour wouldn't stop. "The neverending tour" continues unabated to the present day.  On its appearance, "Planet Waves" divided fans and critics, and continues to do so. Some listeners outright hate it, calling it "rushed", "sloppy", and "obsessive". Others hail it as a hugely underrated masterpiece, calling it "edgy", "rough", "personal", or "from the heart". Most would probably agree that it isn't one of his worst, while conceding that it stands a little distant from his absolute best work.  A number of moods pervade "Planet Waves". The bouncy opener "On a Night Like This" will cause all still feet to twirl with glee. But the suicidal follow-up, "Going Going Gone" will plant those feet in concrete while perking up ears and brains. And then the very heavy and sandpaper rough "Tough Mama" (with the classic line "Today on the countryside it was hotter than a crotch") kicks the tempo up again, but in a very different way than "On a Night Like This." The album appears uneven but it actually conjures up a collective mood after repeated listenings. A straight reading of the lyrics reveals obsessions with love, death, the past, and youth. Dylan pleads with countless lovers on this album: "Tough Mama", "Hazel", "You Angel You", "Never Say Goodbye", "Wedding Song". Arguably, the songs on "Planet Waves" may explore the complicated dimensions of his deep love for Sara, his ex-wife. Perhaps all of the referents point to one person? After all, who hasn't felt both a deep passionate love and a self-deprecating hatred for the same person? "Dirge" demonstrates the latter, spewing invective such as "I hate myself for loving you." This intense love finally gets fed steroids on "Wedding Song". Here Dylan turns the phrase "I love you" into a dizzying mantra. And it's obvious by this point that he's hurting. Thematically, "Planet Waves" sits comfortably in front of, and in the shadow of, "Blood on the Tracks". That album also explored the many aspects of emotional and existential love (though "Planet Waves" arguably showcases more of the physical side).  Of course one exception shouts out: "Forever Young". And why do two versions sit side by side on this album? Apparently some friends of Dylan made fun of the slow version, and he decided to keep it off the album. But the engineer loved it and insisted that it remain. So maybe the two versions remained a compromise? Also, side one of the original vinyl lp ended with the first "Forever Young", so the CD somewhat ruins the affect of flipping sides. In any case, "Forever Young" has joined the ranks of classic Dylan.  "Planet Waves" stands as yet another complicated, sophisticated, and stratified Dylan project. His work always invites heaps of discussion that, for some people, never ceases. Not only that, "Planet Waves" was Dylan's first number one record (which seems impossible), though sales weren't as impressive as expectations. Though Dylan never regained the heights he attained in the 1960s, it doesn't seem like he really wanted to. In "Wedding Song" he sings "It's never been my duty to remake the world at large, Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge." Dylan had openly abdicated the throne imposed on him by some of his fans. He instead retreated into the personal and complex world that "Planet Waves" continued to explore. And he kept going going 
 Few books look at the decline of old ways of life the way "The Magnificent Ambersons" does. Booth Tarkington's Pulitzer-winning novel is a sharp, brilliant, sometimes mocking look at the way that old money crumbled away when the industrial revolution hit, and the way those Gilded Age millionaires ended up. It's undeniably Tarkington's best novel.  Georgie Minafer is the only heir and scion of the wealthy Amberson family, and unsurprisingly he's an insufferable brat. He doesn't improve as he grows up, believing that "there's a few people whose birth and position... puts them at the top" -- and his snottiness doesn't improve when he encounters and falls in love with an inventor's daughter, whose father was once smitten with his mother.  But soon the Amberson fortunes start to change -- family deaths, loss of money, and the encroaching city that is swallowing up their estate. George continues to believe that he is superior to others, but this belief is increasingly strained as "the magnificent Ambersons" lose the last of their property. And George's only salvation may be the man he once called "riffraff."  "The Magnificent Ambersons" seems at first to be a tombstone to the Gilded Age's beauty and glamour. Then you realize that George is a pain in the butt, not a noble figure, and that Tarkington had little affection for that bygone age -- the entire thing is an ironic look at how the "old money" refused to change their ways, and got swamped for it. Tarkington takes aim at rrogance, complacency, idleness and other flaws.  And Tarkington had a rare gift for irony. His writing seems a bit stuffy at first, with pages of details on clothes and parties; but as the Amberson fortunes fall, his prose becomes faster and more incisive. And the differences between idle "old money" and the poeple who "do" things becomes more pronounced, as well as the encroachment of machines and urban life into a once-elegant place. For example, the apartment buildings where the Amberson front lawn was.  It's pretty obvious from the start that while this is George's story, he's not the hero. He's arrogant, pompous, and genuinely believes that he is next to royalty just because his grandfather is rich. Only in the last chapters does he finally realize that he's no better than anyone else -- when even the people who once loathed him no longer even remember him.  The other Ambersons are humbler but no more useful. Aunt Fanny and Uncle George seem almost bewildered by their gradual downslide. And as a contrast to the formerly moneyed family, Tarkington provides readers with the car manufacturer Eugene Morgan -- George's opposite in every way -- and his sprightly, intelligent daughter.  Even the title of "The Magnificent Ambersons" is ironic, and it suits this quietly biting novel about how the world changed at the start of the twentieth century. The best book Tarkington ever wrote 
 Interesting projects,  but what I found most interesting was the history & other information about sheep, wool & felting.  Very good, detailed instruction for felting. 
 I remember the movie on Sky some weeks back, and as with all well written books, it knocks spots off the big screen version. Grisham's portrayal of the eleven year old kid is masterful as he jumps into the kids head in every chapter. Absolutely gripping and highly believable. 
 After reading the first three reviews, I put off buying this book. I got the impression that it might be just a rehash of Elaine Aron's previous HSP books which I already own.Nothing could be further from the truth!  This  book is packed with useful  information and practical strategies for HSPs  to use to build solid, fulfilling relationships.  I gleaned many insights  and ideas that I plan to use to enhance my relationships with my family and  friends as well as with my husband.If you're serious about building a  happy, fulfilling life as an HSP, I highly recommend this book 
 Featuring the exploits of a couple of sex-crazed characters, though the film undeniably has sex on the brain, Mischief's characters are likeable and engaging enough to ensure that the movie's raunchier moments feel organic. Watch the film and listen to the music. The recreation of the time and characterizations is very well done. One of my all-time favorites 
 Excellent coverage of basics of using a router and all types of jigs for special applications. There isn't likely to be any use of the router that is not covered in this book. Great illustrations sufficient to build any of the jigs described. There are 333 pages that are concise - no wasted verbage - and yet enough explanation not to leave a novice confused. This one book is better than the two I had from Patrick Spielman, "The New Router Handbook" and "Router Jigs and Techniques". Recommended for anyone beginning to use a router 
 From reading the reviews I've seen, it's clear that the book is not being reviewed on its own terms.  The following are axioms upon which the entire book must be read:  1. God is perfect. 2. Man is imperfect. 3. Forgiveness (becoming perfect anyway) is possible and necessary to be with God eternally. 4. It just requires a miracle of God.   5. And that miracle happens only after we give it all we've got.  If you have a problem with any of the above, you will have a major problem with this book, pure and simple.  The whole idea of the book (look at the title) is that the task is too great for man alone, it is truly a miracle, but one we all can enjoy.  To trivialize the task or to unduly dismiss its messenger is to trivialize the miracle.    Most, if not all, of the negative reviews are a result of overestimating the level of evil God can tolerate in His presence (hint: it's zero) as well as underestimating the level of goodness man can attain with God's help (hint: it's infinite).  To read it as what you alone have to do, you will certainly become depressed and discouraged, even defiant or rebellious.  But to read it as what God can make of you with your consistent, determined effort, you will be encouraged and strengthened.  The latter is the author's intent, I can attest 
 I found this book to be very insightful but also very disturbing as I'll soon be graduating from college and will surely encounter some of the topics Fraser discusses in her book. I think the biggest lesson I've gotten out of this book and all the other "business" books is to minimize your expenses and save whenever possible because you never know what is going to happen amidst your 40+ year working career.   Specific to this book, I connected most with chapter 8's discussion on downsizing and layoffs from mergers etc. As a kid I watched my father nearly drive himself insane with stress from three mergers Public Service of Colorado, New Century Engergies and Xcel Energy engaged in. I remember it being a frightening time as a kid, but can only imagine what it felt like from the perspective of having to provide for a family.  Overall, great book but quite depressing we live in such a society.  Thanks for writing the book.  LC Colorad 
 Quite simply, it's great, though a bit on the challenging side.  Gorgeous art style and some great music come together for an atmospheric title, and one that, despite it's 'rated 'E' for everyone' approach, will appeal to adults as well as kids.  It's not without some light frustration, but the good far outweighs the bad.  Ignore the mediocre reviews and pick this one up.  Replay value is in the four different cases, as well as some unlockable minigames and a 'touch' list.  If you like adventure titles like Phoenix Wright and Trace Memory (or Maniac Mansion, for that matter) then you'll really dig this game.  A good solid four stars 
 I've been reading a lot of the reviews, and for the most part they're all good things. Except a few. And the points that the few angry "Gamers" are making are absurd, and show exactly how dumb and pathetic they are. This book was not intended for the experienced gamer. It was meant for those longing to try the game but don't know where to start. Never once in my life have I ever seen or heard of someone just walking into a hobby shop and blindly buying all three core rule books. You HAVE to be introduced to the game, either by another gamer, or a book such as this. I think that this book is a great way to introduce people who otherwise might have never considered trying a role playing game. It just sounds like some of you sad pathetic LARPer's, who have spent your whole lives making D&D you entire existence, don't want to share with the General public. Because once it becomes "Main Stream" you think you'll have to give it up, because somehow it's been "tainted." IT'S A FREAKING GAME! MEANT TO BE PLAYED BY ANYONE 
 I can't say enough positive things about this book.  It covers just about every single mother situation imaginable, from issues for single mothers-to-be to issues for those already there.  It is readable, sensitive, thoughtful and highly informative.  As a psychologist, I find it helpful as a reference guide for my clients; I will recommend it heartily 
 Lorelai, Rory, Sookie and the Stars Hollow community return for the second season of Gilmore Girls DVD. A bad boy comes to town, Lorelai's father makes a couple of life changing decisions and Lane discovers the drum kit for the first time. Characters keep growing and developing, coming together in unexpected combinations and going to places they came nowhere near in the first series (Paris in Stars Hollow, for instance). Things get a little rocky at times, relationships are tested. Plus, there's a lot more of the awkward all-rounder Kirk (who's probably my favorite character). He even makes a short film in this series, which appears as a special feature, along with deleted scenes and a couple of other goodies.  Recommended for fans of the series. I'm only really a casual viewer, but I did enjoy watching this box. Good times 
 Just a line or so : Its a point of some note that years after the release of this CD, we are all listening to it and its made the Top 50 of Amazons' sales chart at the end of 2006! Whoa.  I remember cruising down the Naples-Fort Myers interstate (beautiful road) when I first heard "Bring me to life" and like many others was affected by Amys' voice.  However, many tracks on this CD are much more stellar than that lead single.  The song that kills me is "My Immortal". What beauty, what lyricism, and thank you Evanescence for bringing melody back to the American rock scene. If you havent got this already, well get it now 
 This is a breath-taking conclusion! Everyone at Marty's school is saying bad things about Judd Travers after a series of theft and house break-in's. They're even blaming him for murder! When Marty's sister Dara-Lynn naerly falls into a river, Marty is too focused on her to see Shiloh rushing down the river. Judd sees it all. Will Judd help the poor Beagle? Or let him  drown as punishment for running away from him? Read the book and see for yourself 
 This is one of my favorite soundtrack of all times.  The atmosphere, the emotions, the dreams and reality shock, come beautifully and amazingly together to become a music that can't be forgotten 
 The essence of Salinger is his ability to take a static situation and run with it.  I found the first of the two stories to be the most effective.  Don't expect Catcher in the Rye here, and the way Salinger slows down the pace, describing each character to a tee, getting the reader to concentrate on the energy of the characters, and not merely a premise, is why this book is so wonderful.  The story almost has a "slow motion" feel to it, and in my opinion, that is what makes it so genius.  Readers who quickly dismissed this book, likely don't have much patience, and are more proned to reading supermarket varieties 
 I read this book to learn the basics of model checking, and I found it an excellent introduction. Logic can be a dry and intimidating subject but this text presents the theory in an engaging style. Concepts are always introduced with concrete examples to explain them and to show how they should be used to reason about software. This  book is essentially theoretical, there is no presentation of real world uses of the methods 
 very didatic and easy to understand, that explains all about the vet virology in a very easy way for the college students,contents many examples about real cases and variety on important viral strains into the veterinary medicine and microbiology. 
 We discovered that my son liked the swing when he would fall asleep at the gym nursery in thier swings. I chose this one because we already had the Baby Einstein Pack-N-Play and  for the timer feature which works perfectly by the way. My 9 week old son goes right to sleep .  Simply Wonderful  
 Anthologies are sometimes hard to review because they contain works from varied writers.  But this anthology is inspired.  The poetry inside is of the highest quality.  Certainly the works are varied, no two styles are the same, but this collection provides a great representation of poetic talent.  This book has a lengthy introduction by editor and poetry contributer Sam Hamill in addition to brief biographies of each author represented.  A long book, it will take some time to read and digest the content, but it is well worth it 
 Anthony Trollope turns the tables on the usual "happy ending" in this intriguing novel and has his undaunted and faithful heroine fail miserably in bringing about the attempted reform of her disreputable husband-to-be. Sir Harry Hotspur is a wealthy baronet whose only surviving child, his daughter Emily, falls in love with her cousin George Hotspur. George is a scoundrel, though - a rogue and gambler and alcoholic swindler, all of which he admits to openly. However, Sir Harry's title will pass on to George if he and Emily should marry, as would his estates and property; it is for this continued union of title and estates that Sir Harry, out of his own pride, can't bring himself to forbid the marriage. But when the depth of George's depravity is made known to Sir Harry, he can't any longer give consent to Emily's marrying him. But the incredibly innocent and naïve Emily is convinced not only of her love for George, but of her ability to reform him. In the hands of any number of other novelists of the period that is exactly what would happen, but not in Trollope's. Harry, knowing his man, refuses to budge, and Emily, listening only to her heart, refuses to give up on him. When George finally dumps her and marries someone else, Emily dies.  The novel is simple, straight-forward, and compelling. Trollope is concerned with a couple of issues here, one being the "double standard" of the wretched male rogue being the object of Emily's compassion (no female character could ever survive a tenth of the dastardly behaviors exhibited by George). Another is Sir Harry's aristocratic pride at work in hoping to keep his title and property intact, although Trollope would never go so far as to have Sir Harry let Emily marry the blackguard just for that alone. The story moves along quickly and decidedly, and the downward spiral of events into utter sadness at the end is emotionally draining for the reader. One of Trollope's best short novels. 
 Conan Volume 10 "When Giants Walk the Earth" is the latest collection which reprints the original Conan the Barbarian series from Marvel Comics.  Included in this edition are issues # 72 - 77, 79 -82.  As this book opens, Conan is continuing his adventures with the she-devil Belit and her black corsairs.  In "Vengeance in Asgalun" Belit and Conan must go to the city state of Asgalun, which is also Belit's home' to find a hidden elixir to save the shaman N'Yaga.  While there Belit discovers that her father whom she thought dead may be still alive.  Conan's arch nemesis, the Stygian Wizard Thoth-Amon makes an appearance in "Battle of the Black Walls" as he appears to Conan in a dream and warns him to give up the quest to find Belit's father.  Conan ignores the threats as he, Belit, and a Zingaran slave girl sneak into the Stygian city of Khemi and travel down the river Styx on a merchant ship where they are attacked by the Hawk Riders of Hor-Neb and Belit is carried off by the giant hawks.  Conan attempts to rescue Belit but is thrown into a pit with a massive giant and discovers the secret which made the Hawks and this man grow so large.  The last few issues in the book are an adaptation of a Robert E. Howard story called "The Lost Valley of Iskander".  This was not an actual Conan story but an El-Borak story.  El Borak was the middle Eastern name for Francis Xavier Gordon, a mercenary and adventurer, circa the 20's and 30's who traveled throughout the middle east.  Howard wrote several El-Borak stories and Roy Thomas ties this into Conan chronology by having the ruler of the Khemi send Conan on a diplomatic mission to the lost valley and the city of Attalus.  The adaptation comes off pretty well as most of Howard's heroes were pretty similar in their make.  As usual the wonderful John Buscema handles the penciling chores on most of the issues along with the stellar embellishments of Ernie Chan.  "The Lost Valley of Iskander" was drawn by Howard Chaykin also with inks by Chan.  Whether intentionally or due to Chan's inks, Chaykin's art ends up looking a lot like Buscema's.  Thomas had a great affinity for Belit, obviously as he extended her stay with Conan from an initial short story by Howard into a comics run that lasted a over three years and spanned some 42 issues until her death in the classic Conan #100.  As with the other Conan collections Roy Thomas provides commentary about the various issues in the run including his freely adapted version of "The Lost Valley of Iskander".  Great insight from Roy as always and why not...he was there when these were all being created.  Another strong volume from Dark Horse.  Reviewed by Tim Janson 
 Called the modern master of the short story, Malamud has won two National Book Awards and the Pulitzer Prize (for the Fixer).  The Complete Stories is a collection of short stories  -- bound by a central theme. All are about individuals faced with moral decisions or confronted by societal limitations. You'll find that the stories in this book highlight the mundane and the absurd.  I was touched by the characters in the book because they are so human. I was amused, angered, and felt great pity for these fictional people. I rarely read fiction, so few authors seem to me able to "get it right".  Malamud has it right. The characters react like normal people. They are alive with conflict. Like the rest of us, they sometimes make poor choices and may live unfulfilled lives.  One of my favorite stories is Riding Pants. In "Riding Pants" we meet Herm, who is the sixteen year old son of a butcher. Herm lives alienated by the world around him. Riding is the only joy in his life. Like a small child's security blanket, his riding pants bring him solace. Frustrated by his son's refusal to accept his world, his father takes a drastic step.  If you want fairy tale endings and beautiful people riding into the sunset, this may not be the best book for you. If you want to taste life from the eyes of another, perhaps discovery a truth about yourself. Read The Complete Stories.  This is an excellent book!!! 
 Field of Dreams which is in the top 3 of the greatest baseball films of all time is a great purchase, here you get that movie, and For Love Of The  Game, which is like a free frisbee to throw around with your dog, or  yourself if you are so inclined.. 
 This was an awesome look into French culture and the allure of french women.  I think more American women should follow their lead.  The author also threw in some history and some awesome quotes.  Overall, a great book 
 I love this book!  So glad I bought it. John's humor, vivid decriptions and beautiful pictures make it a keeper 
 I love this book. No doubt about it. I don't get it when kids at my school say it is one of the worst books to read. I think it is absolutely genius. There is no other way to explain how I feel about this book.   Just to add, the Penguin "Great Books of the Century" edition is the best to get. Not only is it a beautiful(shiny) cover with an illustration of Chief Bromden, it is a sturdy and light copy. Plus the text is well spaced (unlike the mass market edition; the text in that edition hurts my eyes, it's so small and cramped). A good edition to keep of a great book. 
 Dear Reader,  Unlike previous books in the series, THE HOSTILE HOSPITAL takes place immediately after THE VILE VILLAGE.  The three Baudelaire children are all alone walking across a large empty space when the reach The Last Chance General Store.  The children had just escaped from V.F.D. the evening before and were now wanted by the police for the murder of Jacques Snicket.  Mixed-up and misrepresentations of the deeds were going to appear in the morning edition of THE DAILY PUNCTILIO.  Hungry and without another chance in the world, the children enter The Last Chance.  It's too terrible to describe what horrors are inflicted upon them there.  Somehow the escape and make their way to the Heimlich Hospital where they join with a group of singing people known as the V.F.D., Volunteers Fighting Disease.  It's not the V.F.D. that their parents were members of, but this V.F.D. inadvertently assist the Baudelaire's in finding new information about their parents.  Oh, my.  But that was before Violet was captured by Count Olaf, before she was supposed to have her head removed, and before a major fire.  Oh, those poor children!  I can't write about them anymore at the moment.  Read about them yourself.  I think I'll go buy a heart-shaped balloon to make me feel better because my stomach feels queasy.  Sincerely, Uncle T 
  As a business coach ,I am always looking for good time management books to recommend.  I have read at least a dozen since I read this the first time eight years ago. The focus on quality of life and distinguishing the difference between what is important and what is not has made a dramatic shift in how I prioritize my day.Even though the "stuff" often gets left undone,I am satisfied because I did the things that give my life value and meaning for me.In addition, I can now catch myself running on adrenaline or attempting to do it all and change my behavior. It just doesn't get any better than that! Alicia Fruin   
 The story of Helen Graham, her marriage to Arthur Huntingdon and her life outside the conventional role of a woman, wife and mother in the 19th century deserves a much broader contemporary readership.  The subject matter is confronting, and many of Anne's beliefs and sense of moral duty may not sit neatly with contemporary readers.   The Tenant of Wildfell Hall explores a number of different themes, a number of which are drawn from Anne's own experience as a governess, as a member of a family impacted by the addictions of a family member and by observations of society outside the parsonage at Haworth. This novel is frequently dissected from the perspective of dealing with sexist double standards and dissolute behaviours.  While this is one way of categorizing the issues dealt with, the danger in doing so is that the voice of hope for a better future can be lost.  Anne Bronte died at the tragically early age of 29.  And for a young woman whose mother died when she was still an infant, who outlived  all but one of her siblings, hope for the future is all the more remarkable.   Anne's characters are not always well developed and her prose sometimes shows more promise than polish.  But underneath all of this  is an underlying sense of duty, a deep vein of passion and of belief.  Those of us who can see her inherent talent in the two published novels that are her legacy can only speculate about what might have been had she lived longer and written more.  Highly recommended.  Jennifer Cameron-Smith 
 At some point in their lives, most women can identify feeling like the protagonist in this novel.  With her great writing style, Weiner introduces Candance and instantly makes her your close friend.  You'll laugh and cry and her until the last page.  I would've given this 5 stars if not for the unrealistic friendship with Maxi.  A woman doesn't need a rich movie star friend to rescuse her while in need 
 This was the second Agatha Christie book I read, and I did like it. I like reading short stories because they were short enough that you didn't have to stop in the middle of one. While the stories were very good, I don't  think they were Christie material- they weren't mysterious enough. Also I  think the stories could get confusing sometimes, but read the book if you  are questioning whether or not to, because I did enjoy it 
 While it is unusual for me to give anything 5 stars, I  have in this case done just that.  I have visited the site of Custer's last stand on 2 occasions and have read a good deal about the events leading up to the battle, as well as various accounts of the battle itself.  What I found most riveting about this book is the insight into the disparate, yet paralell lives of the two men.  It appears to be very well researched and is by far the most comprehensive account of the complex Indian society and way of life that I have read.  The author does not take any side in the ongoing conflict between the Indians and the inevitable developement by white settlers backed by the army and the US Govenment.   Instead he deals as much as possible in facts and relies on personal accounts from surviving members of both the Indian and army sides.  This is a wonderfull window into so much of what was happening in the US at this time, so much so that the Little Bighorn battle is almost a sidelight to the rest of the book 
 An enduring tale for those in the mood for Christmas, or not; it will take you there. The golden tones of Patrick Stewart resound throughout the heartfelt reading. Lets you become a child again 
 It is often hard to recommend books for first-timers. I have no compunction recommending this one to anyone taking their first stept into the complex world of feminism. As an introduction, its most valuable  contribution lies in the intelligent manner almost all major thinkers were  presented. The bibliography is also indispensible 
 I was 7 when I watched these shows.  Great memories.  And Soupy Sales is an added bonus!!  Just amazing how things have changed... Not sure if this set will appeal to the younger crowd, but for us aging baby boomers it's a fun trip 
 This was an outstanding accounting of the race.  I know, because I was there.  The program captured all of the complexity, engineering and courage needed to compete, and the additional CD with the recordings of the bike cameras was fabulous 
 After reading the book, I was so motivated to go and make money. However when I went to trade I discovered that the spread is so thin ! A cent for that matter. Has the rules changed or am I doing something wrong 
 Essential for the 3rd year 
 It's really beautiful.  Duvet cover looks exactly like the picture.  Polished cotton.  Backing is a navy stripe.  Very pleased.  Shams are the same pattern but a different material which is slightly darker, but still nice.  Backing is the same as the cover 
 This CD skips at 2:14 into Knots and 4:54 into The River. It's strange that there are so many problems with the GG remasters. Repertoire goes to the trouble of issuing a nicely packaged version of this, and apparently does not bother to review the final product before release.  Aside from the defects, this is definitely one of GG's best and unfortunately Phil Shulman's last recording with the band. Octopus sounds just as exciting to me now as it did in the early 70's. Since it's not GG's fault for this defective CD, I rated it 5 stars. 
 I really love Wanda.  I'm sure what I'm about to write won't differ too much from other reviews, because unfortunately what I'm about to say and what others have said is the truth.  She isn't as funny on paper as she is on stage or tv.  I love her points of view on all subject matter in the book - dating, football etc, and I can just imagine hearing her say all this 'in person', so for me, that's what's funny about the book.  I give it only four stars instead of five because it needs to be an audio cassette version to make it go from funny to totally hillarious 
 Okay, so the person singing "Now that I'm a Woman" song isn't Mia Farrow. And the whole casing is in German. No big. First of all, I honestly believe that only die-hard fans of the original movie will notice the different female singers. Secondly, all the other songs--at least the lyrical ones--are exactly the same; the ones sung by America anyway. Although, I think they kept the original male singer in "That's all I have to Say"... As for the album being in a language only half of us will truly understand? No worries, the songs are in English, and if you really want to know what the back cover says, it's easy to find the movie and get the production notes, especially with the movie now on DVD. For that matter, the song titles on the back are also in English, whihc is odd given that the rest of the casing is in German.... All in all, I enjoy this CD. I have the original flim, but it was getting difficult to keep fast forwarding and rewinding becuase I didn't want to watch the whole flim, just listen to "Man's Road" or "In the Sea". Now that I have uploaded this on my Ipod--something I needed the CD for, cause you aren't going to find the songs anywhere on Itunes Music Store--I can listen to whatever song I want without fiddling with my VCR. The movie has always and will always be a favorite--and the music plays a large part of why--music I now have. (The other half of why is becuase I'm a unicorn lover.) And that's all I have to say. 
 Go aheead and buy one or two extra packs of game cards for Rush Hour.  You child (or you) will want them quickly 
 This book is a fascinating account of how Boston grew and developed. It stays on the point, is concise, and really improves the understanding of this city. A must read for a Bostonian 
 The American Senator of the title is a stuffy, boring old man who wants to understand English politics and morality but also wants to impose his own morality upon the English.  Sadly, the book could have been far more exciting without this character.  On the other hand, the characters remaining are interesting enough.  This book is mainly about love, or about the pursuit of love or fortune.  The scheming and penniless Arabella Trefoil is engaged to a man who we quickly see is far too good for her, and what he sees in her beyond her remote beauty is a big question that is never quite resolved.  However, wanting a fortune, she maintains her engagement in private while denying it in public, thus finding herself able to pursue the local squire, Lord Rufford, who is also taken with her beauty but on advice of friends, becomes reluctant to truly woo Arabella.  Social interactions between all these parties, including their antecedents, are quite interesting and fill a good portion of the book.  On the other hand, another love affair of lesser merit but far more honesty is that of Mary Masters and Reginald Morton, a romance against the Masters' family wishes who pressure both her and the unfortunate Larry Twentyman to make a match.  Intrigues from minor characters, plots and subplots, though rather too much mention and detail of fox hunting, still this is a fun read 
 Donald Nijboer deserves high marks for the research and presentation in his detailed and in-depth book, "Graphic War: The Secret Aviation Drawings and Illustrations of World War II." His book should appeal both to WW II aviation enthusiasts and to graphic artists (especially those either interested in or plying their skills without computers).   Drawing on a wealth of historical materials from military archives, training manuals, posters, and technical diagrams, he organizes the materials into four large collections of images representing Great Britain, Germany, United States, and Soviet Union. Many drawings are elegant, detailed technical schema created by now unknown draftsmen. Depictions of how to abandon an aircraft by parachute, dinghy, or lifeboat or of strategies emergency landings and safe bombing altitudes underscore the harrowing circumstances these pilots faced. Other illustrations offer tips on using cloud cover and reminders to watch for the "Hun in the Sun."  Bright collections of aircrew clothing would not seem out of place among the hordes of Christmas catalogs that pile up every fall. An occasional dose of levity sneaks into some of the British and American graphics about safety and maintenance ("What prop?"), but the use of humor is always to emphasize the many types of danger air crews faced, including accidents.   The German and Soviet collections, to no surprise, lack any humor but contain meticulous, even overwhelming levels of detail. The progression of the war is mirrored in the technological advances in the various aircraft, as captured by the growing complexity and nuance in the later graphics.  One point to ponder is that the aircrews had to memorize and comprehend the information contained in these graphics. Hence, it was incumbent on the artists to create material that was visually interesting, detailed, accurate, and understandable.    The creative elements may be secondary to the technical intention, but aspiring graphic artists may be amazed at how effective and thorough these renderings prove to be, especially considering the limited tools and training many of these folks had. Thousands of graphic artists and technical illustrators worked feverishly to develop this largely unknown array of training guides, technical manuals, and safety materials. Mr. Nijboer does them a great service by rendering their work in a fresh light, and his interviews with British artist Peter Endsleigh Castle are fascinating and insightful.  Mr. Nijboer notes that his book is not a celebration of the darkness of war. Rather, he notes that "the artwork in this book was created for a very different purpose---to help young men win the battles and, it was hoped, survive the war." 
 John Claypool's honest about his pain after the death of his daughter.  From the pulpit he does his congregation a favor by sharing his anguish with them, not hiding from it or trying to sugar-coat it. With Claypool's freedom to show his honest feelings, others who are forced onto the same parental bereavement path after the death of a child, can learn that "strugglers making tracks," need to be "given permission" to freely grieve.  Congregations everywhere should have this book as required reading.  How much more effective and kind (and Christ-like)we can all be when we understand a parent's broken heart. A friend sent Claypool's book to me shortly after the death of my own son and I have found the writing to be just what I needed 
 This is billed as the definitive sky atlas and delivers on that promise.  The book is large (12" Wide x 18" tall approx) and opens wide with a spiral binder.  The charts are fold out, so each page is approximatley 2' x 18", if you plan to use this in the field, you need quite a lot of space.  The paper is very heavy and the quality of print is good.  The atlas comes equipped with a transparent scale/stencil to overlay on the charts to assist with star identification.  This edition has white pages with black stars,  I would imagine that for field use, this could also be somewhat overwhelming for climatized night vision, unless you use a very dim red light.  Ovarall, I am very happy with this atlas

 In this book, Gibbons includes all important facts about the zoo presenting the information clearly and directly.  The organization of the text is sequential from early morning at the zoo until nightfall.  The purpose of the book is portrayed through the text and illustrations.  The bright, colorful illustrations compliment the text and are clearly labeled using appropriate vocabulary for the intended age level.  The book is very appropriate for young readers and would be a valuable resource for learning about the zoo.  
 I am a 31 year old  college student at Macon State College. I am majoring in education. I read the book White Teacher for my Introduction to Education 2000 class.Paley describes her progress in learning to deal more  openly with her pupils' -and her own- perceptions of race.Vivian Paley  examines a question that concerns teachers on all levels: How do I use my  own behavior as a teacher to help my students learn to deal constructively  with racial and social differences?  I recommend this book to teachers,  parents, and anyone else who wishes to understand him or herself better and  is willing to continue to grow. The book was very inspiring and motivating

 Baby has had less gas and fussiness since we have been using these bottles.  Quick cleanup, quick fill up.  Love the nipple variety too.    Because of the liners, it is easy to keep two of these bottles in use and not clutter up the kitchen with bottle pieces, etc.  Would highly recommend 
 Patricia Highsmith's THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY might be the finest American suspense thriller ever written. A clever young man from a disadvantaged background is sent abroad by an industrialist to bring home the latter's spoiled  and vicious son; befriending the young rotter in Italy, the antihero becomes enamored of his decadent lifestyle and kills him so he can assume his identity. The novel is not only suspenseful but it forms a brilliant disquisition on the nature of identity at mid-century, and its relationship to texts, reputation, and capital. Two very intelligent films have been made from it that capture different parts of it successfully: the latest is Anthony Minghella's 1999 big-budget Hollywood thriller starring Matt Damon, but the first was this beautifully photographed French version directed by Rene Clement starring Alain Delon as Ripley.  Clement's version succeeds best in its evocation of the lovely rarefied atmosphere of the tourist Italy of the American jetset: the cinematography has a crystalline postcard beauty that makes Rome and the Italian coast seem supernatually beautiful. It also has a much better Ripley in Delon than Minghella had in Damon: Delon is much less hesitant and much more desperate and amoral, and he also has the requisite handsomeness (and facial resemblance to the rich wastrel he murders and replaces) that Damon lacks. As the gorgeous, cruel Dickie Greenleaf (here called Phillipe), Maurice Ronet is absolutely first-rate, toying with Ripley in the mistaken belief that he holds all the cards in their friendship. Less successful as Phillipe's emotionally abused girlfriend Marge is Marie Leforet, who doesn't seem to react to Phillipe at all as an American girl would ever conceiveably do. The film is great at conveying an aura of homoerotic decadence, but it loses quite a bit by beginning the story in medias res: by not showing us the circumstances from which Ripley came, we have little sense at what is at stake in his masquerade. But this is this fine adaptation's only major shortcoming 
 Drew Karpyshyn has written an exciting novel that deserves a place alongside the other great Star Wars stories.  In this highly readable and vivid tale, Karpyshyn delves into the beginnings of the Dark Lords of the Sith and their battles with the Jedi Knights.  The main character of the story is Des.  He lives on the planet Apatros, where he makes his living as a cortosis miner.  Suffering as a child from an abusive father, Des is determined to make a better life for himself, far away from Apatros.  He has also noticed that he has heightened senses, but he doesn't understand why.  The only means of relaxation for Des and the other miners is the local pub.  One evening, Des gets into an altercation with another player.  Due to the circumstances, the only way for Des to avoid prosecution is to join the Sith training academy on Korriban.  Realizing he has no other choice, he leaves.  Once there, he quickly adapts to the Sith training, quickly rising through the ranks of trainees, until he has reached the top of his class.  He has mastered the use of the lightsaber as well as Sith mind techniques.  However, he has begun to question the validity of the Brotherhood of Darkness and Kaan, it's leader.  Des has also taken a new Sith name.  He has become Bane.  He believes that much can be learned from the teachings of the early Sith, who have been vanished for over three thousand years.  They believed that individuals possess power, not groups.  This contradicts Kaan's teachings.  Soon, conflict develops between Bane and the Brotherhood, eventually leading to his leaving the temple.  Meanwhile, a new member, Githany, has come to the temple.  A former Jedi, she has turned to the dark side.  An attraction has developed between Bane and Githany, but there is much more to their relationship.  Bane has wandered into the wastes in search of knowledge of the ancient Sith, but he returns without finding what he seeks.  He has now been ostracized and made to look weak.  After suffering a bitter defeat in the challenge arena to his most bitter rival, the other Masters and instructors have chosen not to train Bane any further.  He is now an outcast.  However, with the help of Kas'im, the Sith blademaster, and Githany, Bane has kept up his training in secret.  He has advanced in both skill and ability, once again reaching the top of the Sith ranks.  In the meantime, a huge battle has been raging on the planet Ruusan between the Jedi, led by General Hoth, and the Sith, under command of Kaan.  Kaan believes that his Brotherhood of Darkness will succeed in defeating the Jedi.  But Bane, now known as Darth Bane, believes otherwise.  He is convinced that the Sith will only survive if there are two; one to embody the power, the other to crave it.  Bane has spent considerable time trying to find an acceptable apprentice.  But who will he choose?  Githany, perhaps, or someone else?  Realizing that Kaan has no intention of following the teachings of the ancient Sith, Bane realizes that there's only one thing to do; he must destroy all of the remaining Sith and start the order over fresh, whith himself and his chosen apprentice.  Will he succeed, or will the Brotherhood of Darkness prevail?  And what of the Jedi?  This is an excellent book.  Karpyshyn has done a masterful job of explaining the development of the Sith, from the time of the ancients to the Brotherhood.  The similarities between Bane's rise and the rise of Anakin Skywalker are almost identical, except one was a Jedi and the other a Sith.  The development of Bane's character throughout the book is done in a first-rate manner, and its fascinating to watch his evolution from a simple miner to the most feared member of the Sith.  I recommend this book very highly.  It is very readable and the story is well-conceived.  Star Wars fans will be well-pleased with this great story 
 Even better than I remember it.  Great entertainment for everyone in the house 
 First thing you want to do is download the uninstaller from their website, and remove the TSR program on the drive (this CANNOT be done by just formatting the drive).  Once this is done, the drive works perfectly.  I have both Mac and PC, no difference.  Very fast and durable.  This thing is one tough drive.  I like the retractable slider also.  It's a snap to use 
 I used information from this book as a part of my weekly Piano Theory classes this past summer.  Each week we studied and listened to music from a different pianist/composers.  This added real-life understanding of the composers, as opposed to data and factual information from standard reference sources.  After the summer classes were over, I gave copies of this book to each student as a gift.  The composers came alive for them, and they learned about them in a personal way 
 I think anyone who knows a man would enjoy this book. Annabelle allows you into her marriage and with humor is able to point out & help you navigate around (or barrel through) some of the pitfalls of marriage.  If you're looking for a lot of humorous Southern fluff, this is not the book for you.  If however you want an entertaining read that you don't want to put down, give this book a try.  I don't know which genre this book falls under, if Southern Humor I don't think that says enough for this book. It reads as good or better than many seasoned author's memoirs 
 I saw this film when it was released in 1976 and have not seen it since.  It affected me profoundly as I remembered coming home from school for lunch as a teenager and hearing the HUAC hearings on the radio.  At the time of the release of "The Front", it was my understanding that everyone associated with the film had been blacklisted except for Woody Allen.  A few months ago while visiting friends and discussing the proposed renewal of the Patriot Act, I expressed my disdain at this situation.  My friend replied, "If you don't have anything to hide, why do you care what someone asks or investigates about you?"  I replied that I DID CARE very much and my reasons would take a lengthy explanation but would be best illustrated by a series of films and books starting with "The Front".  I would recommend to anyone with the slightest interest in this subject to start with this film, then read "Naming Names", see "Guilty by Suspicion", "The Way We Were", and "Good Night and Good Luck".  All of these works are powerful, important, informative, and are also entertaining.    
 My husband bought this book at the airport last week to read at the plane, I was the one sticked to the book all the time. I am fully inspired by this book. It's so amazing that the author was able to provide some many convincing real life examples. I had a attitude problem, I admit my weakness and I am going to work on it. Few quotes from the book, "Attitude is a choice, you could choose to be in a good mood or bad mood", "You could concentrate on problems, or focus on solutions", "The word triumph starts with the word try",  "The root of happiness is joy, and joy is from your inner thought, you don't have to reply on outside sources to make you happy.".... etc. Reading this book is one of the biggest treasure I have found. I am still on chapter 3 or 4, cuz there are so so many good phrases in the previous chapters I want to read it over again. It's written in plain English, easy-to-read format, unlike some other boring and over-theoretical books. This book is a must buy, no matter what you are originally shopping for today, I guarantee that you will not regret putting this book in your cart 
 "Leading with the Heart: Coach K`s Successful Strategies for Baseketball, Business, and Life by Mike Krzyzewski (Coach K) and Donald T. Phillips provides provocative, real-life anecdotes that capture the meaning of the spirit of winning for the team.  Coach K shows that through the spirit of playing FOR the team - and not strictly for the win -- and with the spirit of those who can be considered "the HEARTS of the TEAM," possibilities become boundless.  It's not the win that defines success.  It's the spirit first, through which the success follows.  Sometimes the team stumbles and sometimes the team loses.  Every team and every human being goes through these trials and tribulations.  What defines the spirit of success, as taught to me by Kirby Thibeault, author of a book of inspirational poetry titled Wealth, and reflected in the teachings of Coach K, is the ability to overcome psychological obstacles, to see and strive for the most positive possibilities, to never give up, to look outside the "box," to look within, and to discover the true meaning of winning.  Kirby Thibeault, author of Wealth, expresses a similar perspective in his forward titled "Wealth" when he writes "It's realization is like that of the discovery of the divine.  All that was unknown and limiting becomes clear and liberating.  What was once feared becomes friendly.... It's an awakening of the spirit."    Coach K delivers tips that help define the winning attitude in teams, in leadership roles, in success, in defeat, in life, and in considerations of humanity and love."

 This book has instructions for actually constructing books from fabric, which is exactly what I wanted.  I have made quilts and altered books, but have not done any book construction.  This book has the detailed instructions and plenty of inspiration for making personalized fabric art!  I ordered the book from Amazon, got it in two days, and the next day had made a basic little fabric book ready for embellishment!!! Easy enough for a beginner, or a great start for someone familar with fabric! This craft is one that is destined to be customized according to the skills and views of the artist 
 Overall, I really enjoyed this book.  It was a somewhat arduous read, especially for the first quarter of it or so, but after you get to know the characters--in both past and present--it becomes hard to put it down.  It gives a lot of background about the Cathars and the Crusades, which I found very interesting and useful; however, this information is not so dry and overwhelming that it ruins the flavor of romance and mystery that this book has to offer.  It was fulfilling right up to the final pages.  I definitely recommend it for somebody looking for something a little different from the typical Dan Brown-esque novels on the bookshelves currently.  
 I would have liked to have read this book in high school instead of the horrible ones I was encouraged to read and recite in mediocre attempts at the evaluation of my knowledge acquisition. Like any text, I would encourage readers to weigh with certain caution the etiology of Zenn's position. However, I would still use this text if I were to ever teach history in high school- which is likely, never 
 I have read almost everything of patricia cornwells and I must say she is one of the absolute best writers ever, I love her kay scarpetta series the best, I could not put those books down. 
 I found this book to be quite facinating, and very well written.  It should be a must read for anyone interested in the subject of science and weather.  This book covers all sorts of anomalies of weather and nature from 'frogs rains' to tornadoes, thunderstorms and sun spots!  All sorts of interesting bits of information are compiled here, that make it a page-turning read from start to finish.  There is great information about comets and stars and all sorts of oddities of the heavens as well.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The information is conveyed intelligently, but with an undercoat of wit and humor.  You will really enjoy this one 
 A really great book I couldn't put it down when I started it. I loved it,I was glad to read that what I was feeling was 'normal'. I would thoroughly recommend this book for those on the adoption journey 
 I am a REAL Confunkshun fan!!  I think that this group has the real heartbeat of soul(rhythm and blues) music in that they provide the best in ballads and dance music. If a person could only have one CD, this wouldn't be a bad choice! 
 How one child can overcome such a nightmarish childhood to become a productive adult is almost beyond my comprehension. Any one of the trials described throughout this young life would be enough to derail most people.  Yet the author adapted to his situation the best he could in order to survive and kept his sense of humor about it at the same time.  I didn't find the book funny in the least but I got the humor with which the story was told.    This book was a two-night read for me, not because I couldn't put it down but because I felt the need to hurry up and get it over with because it was so disturbing.  I can't believe nothing was done about the living conditions of these kids and I frequently felt sick reading it.  But truth is stranger than fiction and knowing that it actually happened made me stick with it. I'm glad I did.  I was rooting for our hero and he made it out alive, which was no easy feat.      
 April 13, 2003 Sunday City Edition  SECTION: COMMENTARY; Pg. E-5  LENGTH: 854 words  HEADLINE: BETWEEN THE BOOKENDS  BYLINE: Ann Lloyd Merriman, Editor, Commentary/Books  BODY: In the publishing cycle, spring usually brings a surge of books geared to the coming vacation season - lightweight, easy reading that can be used for escape or entertainment. Some call these books brain candy; most can be read without switching intellectual gears from neutral.  But a few titles rise above the flow to demand closer attention. One of them this spring comes from Virginia Holman, a native Virginian who has written a stark memoir about her childhood years with a schizophrenic mother in Rescuing Patty Hearst [Memoirs of a Decade Gone Mad] (Simon & Schuster, $23). Hers is a story familiar to many families with members suffering from intractable mental or physical ailments. In the case of Ms. Holman's mother Molly, the "compassionate" system set up in the 1960s to protect the rights of the mentally ill backfired. Although Molly made her family's life a living hell, caseworkers and other helpists insisted there was nothing they could do as long as she was not a danger to others or to herself. She succeeded in persuading them she was not - but, back with her family, she refused to take her prescribed medicines.   Ms. Holman was 8 when Molly first showed signs of the illness that eventually would institutionalize her. Convinced that she was a member of a secret army, Molly moved Virginia and her sister Emma from their Virginia Beach home to a Kechotan cottage. She turned the cottage into a small fortress. Her delusions and "voices" ruled her life and her family's lives; Virginia's father Nathan struggled to cope while working at a bank to provide for the family. Molly once thought the cottage was a field hospital and then planned to help the "war children." She led Virginia on a secret assignment far into the woods and left her. She took a butcher knife to Nathan and hit Virginia. Virginia picks at her memories to find a happy one, as if trying to coax a shred of meat from a crab claw, but mostly, she concludes, "Those years . . . were some of the blackest and most awful I can imagine a family enduring."  VIRGINIA'S MEMOIR, free of cloying self-pity, often is painful to read. Molly's family was caught in her web, unable to help her and unable to flee. Nathan tried; he always returned. Even after Virginia grew up and left home, her childhood experiences haunted her. She found some solace when she returned, with her husband and child, to the Kechotan cottage and then to Molly, by then permanently institutionalized, to seek understanding and perhaps the ability to forgive.  This is a powerful account of a family possessed, living in fear and dread - yet another testament to the failure of the mental-health system to rescue the afflicted. Molly had her rights, of course - so perhaps the system's defenders would consider her family's suffering merely "collateral damage." A better description comes from Virginia Holman, and it isn't pretty.  
 Short, easy to read.  Full of great examples.  Will make you a better speaker and heighten your appreciation of great literature, as well as showing you the techniques used by playwrights, poets, politicians, lawyers, clergy, and all others who earn their bread with their tongues.  An eye-opener 
 I must admit I cannot do all of the abs moves, but I am happy with the quality of the video, the instructors, and the workout!  It is not for beginners -Ana Caban does not go into a lot of detail- but if you already know the basics, you'll enjoy the fast-paced transitions.   My biggest complaint with other videos is too much talk and not enough exercise - so I love this one 
 This book is different from most other career books I have read. Most others are either about a specific field or about how to write your resume, etc.  These are great if you already have a good idea about what you want to do or if you don't even know which field interests you, or if you want to pursue self-employment, then you will find this book will be a HUGE help.  I know I did, and it has certainly changed my life for the better.  Work From Home is better than your average career book because it not going to send you down any particular career path, but it will get your creative juices flowing in terms of the opportunities available wherever you may be located, using whatever skills you have.  It is more supportive of self-employment than other books I have read, and to me, this is a positive.  If you are looking for a regular, 9-to-5 job, then this probably is not the book for you, but if you are looking for ideas on how to get started on self-employment, then this book is for you.  Throughout Work From Home, Mr. Luna describes how he was able to CREATE job opportunities when other people thought there were none available.  I won't go into the details here, but he has done this many times throughout his life and has successfully been able to make a comfortable living this in remote areas and foreign countries.  This book contains the 40+ years of lessons he has learned.  His experiences have opened my eyes to opportunities that were literally around the corner but I didn't even realize existed.  Granted, some of the ideas in it may seem simplistic or obvious to some people, particularly those who are older or more settled into their careers, but for someone young and who is undecided, like I was, these ideas can be life changing and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is in high school or college aged. 
 I bought this book to give to a dear friend who just lost her mother.  Every page is inspiring as well as a deep comfort. This book can be given to celebrate any woman in your life, but I found it particularly perfect for someone who has lost a dear friend or mother.  
 For centuries, millions of people have enjoyed looking at commercial exhibits of the odd and curious.  Joe Nickell is one of those people.  Growing up in Kentucky, he never missed the carnivals and circuses that had human and animal oddities on display as sideshows.  Nickell is well known for investigating frauds and hoaxes for the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, but it doesn't matter to him that many sideshow acts were bogus or at least grossly exaggerated on the banners outside the shows.  He obviously loves the now-disappearing shows, and in _Secrets of the Sideshows_ (University Press of Kentucky), that affection is made plain.  To be sure, he gives plenty of secrets away here, most of them open secrets, but the book works best as a tribute to the imagination of the performers and organizers of the exhibits which were meant to provoke and satisfy that admirable old human characteristic, curiosity.  The book provokes and satisfies in the same way.  Nickell notes that "sideshow" means an adjunct to the main show.  The "midway" where these shows were located was midway between the entrance and the main attraction.  He briefly recounts early history, and then goes into their heyday starting in the early 1900s.  Sideshows featured magic performances, often with one big trick like sawing the woman in half or the escape from a chained box.  The way these sorts of tricks are done is explained here, but the explanations would not ruin the fun of a good performance.  Fire-eating and sword-swallowing are explained, as is how to eat glass or walk barefoot on it, or how to walk barefoot up a ladder of swords.  The explanations are enough to show how the tricks are done, but few readers are going to be tempted to try them.  There were performers who didn't perform, but just showed themselves.  Dwarves, giants, fatties are all here, all respectively taller, shorter, or lighter than their publicity banners proclaimed.  Giants of such acts, for instance, sometimes had a contract that specified that they would not be measured.  A bearded lady ("The Monkey Girl") and a man with the skin disease ichthyosis ("The Alligator Man") eloped in 1938, and were a sideshow feature as "The World's Strangest Married Couple"; they were happy together for over sixty years.  Not all the displays were real, but as one carny said, "Oh, it's _all_ real.  Some of it's really real, some of it's really fake, but it's all really good.")  Hilariously, these exhibits which used to go under names like "Mother Nature's Mistakes" are sometimes now displayed in a "Horrors of Drug Abuse!" scare show.  Nickell closes with analysis of why the sideshows are fading into the past; it isn't because of any attempt to become politically correct, or any triumph of good taste; it comes down to simple economics, as fairs can make more money with, for instance, rides that take up the same space a midway does.  Because it tells secrets of the sideshows, Nickell's book is a miscellany that is full of good humor and bizarre stories, like that of the bank robber who was killed by a sheriff's posse in 1916, and his mummified body passed from carnival to carnival.  Somehow it became part of the "Laff-in-the-Dark" funhouse in Long Beach about forty years later, but everyone thought it was just a spray-painted mannequin until it broke and showed bones inside.  He finally got laid to rest after a long postmortem career.  There is a description of how to enlist fleas into a flea circus, and how to harness them to their particular tricks.  There is an even more interesting description of the comic flea circus ("The Most Minuscule Show on Earth!") that has no fleas, only the colorful banter of the proprietor over the tiny apparatus ("She's blindfolded herself!... She's walking backward!").  If you want the lowdown on sideshows, step right up, ladies and gentlemen, Joe Nickell presents the best show on the midway.  
 I received this terrific DeLonghi Metropolis EOM1230 toaster oven as a gift, and it is the best of its kind I have owned. This is not the 1st DeLonghi appliance I have used. Their products seem to be uniformly excellent and I highly recommend them. The toaster oven design is elegant and complements any kitchen decor. The oven measures 17 by 13-1/2 by 9 inches, and easily fits on a countertop. There are 3 dials on the front right-hand side: one for broil or bake/toast, one to turn the oven on and set toast color, and the third to select a temperature. The toaster oven is easy to use and easier to clean - a Big plus. The Removable Crumb Tray allows you to easily dispose of crumbs, unwanted food particles and drips and drabs. An adjustable thermostat keeps the oven temperature uniform. The toast color selector, for dark or light, and end-of-cycle signal have ensured perfect toast every time. There is enough room for six slices of bread to be easily toasted at once.  The unit comes with an enamel 9-1/2-by-11-inch bake pan, enamel 9-by-10-inch broil tray, a wire rack, and a crumb tray. I think this appliance is well worth the price, although fortunately I didn't have to buy it! I certainly enjoy it though. What a great gift!! JAN 
 "My sanitized memories"  As Lieutenant Colonel Otto Skorzeny wrote on his own memories, after the war it was a very good idea to announce that you had been a dissident and an opponent against the regime of Adolf Hitler, and that maybe, Alber Speer was forced to write down those passages where he mentioned his plot to gas(!) the bunker of Hitler. Skorzeny expressed his derision and disbelief because he knew Speer and the impression he got, from Speer, was that of a commited man and of one who believed in the Third Reich and who was loyal to Hitler too.  Apart from the the written above this book is an execelent account of the war from the Nazi point of view and I highly recommend it 
 I think some of the previous reviwers with negative opinions are taking this book waaay too seriously. As political thrillers go, this is one of the best of the genre. It's packed with insider information, from power-mad politicians and the amoral king-makers who advise them, to nerves-of-steel assassins avoiding the meticulous pursuit of the FBI. Granted the premise is implausible: a group of former SEALS assassinate a group of congressmen and senators who the SEALS believe have sold the country down the river (or, in the Southern vernacular, because "they needed killin'"). While one can argue whether the SEALS have the high moral ground in this setting, it doesn't detract from the page-turning non-stop action. Like a thrill ride at Disneyland, this book should not be examined too critically. Just get in, hold on, close your eyes, and enjoy the ride 
 This is a well done operating system I use the 64bit version and all but just a few of my software titles work without any problems. All my hardware has 64bit drivers. Overall this is a good product and I would buy it again. Because I went from a 32bit O/S to a 64bit O/S I had to boot from the DVD to install it, but I was able to install it using the key without any problems nor did I have to reinstall it afterwards as some website suggest you have to do 
 There are plenty of stories about contact with aliens, including a plethora dealing with government conspiracies to conceal such contact.  In Little Green Men, Christopher Buckley offers his own take on these stories and has delivered a fun novel.  Little Green Men centers on John Banion, the most powerful man on television.  He is an incisive and often nasty interviewer of political figures, and even the President accommodates him.  Banion lives the good life until he is abducted by aliens and subjected to the standard probes and other tests.  He almost shakes off this event, but then it happens a second time, and he becomes an avid crusader for exposing aliens.  This, of course, makes him appear crazy to many and his reputation slides quickly.  What Banion is unaware of is that this whole thing was a hoax orchestrated by Majestic Twelve, a super-secret government agency that occasionally fakes abductions for its own reasons that dates back to the Cold War.  Nathan Scrubbs, a disgruntled member of Majestic Twelve, in a drunken rage, had targeted Banion for abduction; this was strictly against the rules that prohibit prominent figures from being kidnapped.  Scrubbs's actions put him on the wrong side of his mysterious employer, forcing the lowly bureaucrat to go on the run.  Unfortunately for Majestic Twelve, Banion does not either fade away or get dragged off to an insane asylum.  Instead, he builds a new following of true believers in UFOs, and raises these folks to a much higher level of importance.  Even as he threatens Majestic Twelve, he is himself in danger, all the while remaining oblivious to the truth.  This is a delightfully funny novel that is also well-plotted.  Few people on any side of the UFO debate emerge unscathed in this satire.  This may have been my first Christopher Buckley book, but I have a suspicion it won't be my last.   
 Dark, seductive and brilliantly written, Joseph Moncure March's The Wild Party offers up a cautionary tale in the key of jazz and debauchery. Highly recommended. One of my favorite pieces of literature 
 I was recommended this CD and have really enjoyed it. It is relaxing, yet thought provoking. The accompanying various guitar arrangements are wonderful and the lyrics fresh 
 I love this CD and Nawang's other entitled Quiet Mind. This CD leaves me feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, more spiritually atuned and softened, more peaceful. Yet these words inadequately describe the beautiful sensation that Nawang's music produces. I believe this music is life changing.   When I heard the first note (of this CD) for the first time, I instantly began meditating (without being self-induced). I also began to relax while simultaneously experiencing a sense of spiritual and creative awakening. An interesting sensation to say the least.  This beautiful one-of-a kind music is a blessing, a true godsend. We have much to learn from the Tibetans and their music is breath-taking. I'm so thankful to have this CD (and Quiet Mind too), as they bring me so much joy, awe, and spiritual comfort. Buy it! 
 I love Speed.  It is brainless fun that I can watch over and over.  Having it on Blu-ray and watching it on my Sony 1080p HDTV is pure heaven.  Audio and picture quality are excellent, striking really, since it is such an old movie.  Blu-ray rocks!! 
 What a good C.D if you love a taste of rock 
 I recently ordered this book to use with my students. I am a special education consultant primarily working with students that have Asperger's syndrome or traumatic brain injury in a public school setting. I am always looking for materials that are functional and easy to implement.  This book is great! Very straight-forward; provides quick and useful examples without a lot of lengthy explanation. This book provides tools for both teachers and parents to use quickly and without a lot of training or experience with Asperger children. Very easy to adapt and individualize as well 
 I would rate this one higher than 5 stars if I could.  Sonny Criss felt a soulful depth in his music.  From the opening number "Black Coffee" to the (bonus track) finale "Love For Sale", we are fortunate to have the experience of these sessions on cd.  Sonny's version of "Sunrise, Sunset" is incomparable.  Every song on this cd is sweet!!  If you love 60's sax/accoustic jazz you need to have this one in your collection.    
 I enjoyed this series premier tremendously and am looking forward to watching the rest of the series.  Enterprise started before I had my PVR and was either on at a time I was unable to watch it or I never made time.  I watched one episode of Star Trek the Next Generation yesterday and it peaked my interest in watching some Star Trek episodes again.  Rather than watch episodes I've already seen, Enterprise looks like a great way to enjoy Star Trek episodes.  As far as privacy concerns mentioned in other reviews, if you're paranoid, the internet isn't for you.  Keep your private things private, and not on networked computers.  Hopefully Amazon will remove reviews that do not at all pertain to the show they are attached to 
 I bought Scrubs Season 1 DVD about a year ago. Before that, I never saw the show on TV. That Zach Braff is in it, as one of the main characters, was reassuring. And I read a review somewhere, which was mentioning the show's "quirky sense of humor." With this, I could sort of picture a medical drama with a Garden State-type of humor. A drama that has "real" people as its characters, that finds laughs in mundane details and combines it with a unique pathos, or at times, insights. If the show can meet half the expectation I have, I wouldn't be painfully disappointed, I figured and bought the DVD.   Then I was amazed and really pleased. While basically being a show I expected, Scrubs went far beyond my expectation. I remember my gasping, on the first viewing, at moments that I did not really expect to see from a network TV show. These moments abound from the very first episode. For instance, when JD asks Turk if he can use the "extremely volatile racial slur," that is the "n"-word, when he sings a rap song. Or when he tells Eliot that she should "tease" Turk for his being black. Or Carla's retort when JD compliments Turk for his starting to have sex with her on a regular basis ("My man Turk is now getting it daily, nightly, and ever so rightly"): "why do you automatically assume that he and I are having sex? Do latina women put out more?"   These moments are refreshing and can even be taken as culturally significant because they may signal a certain degree of freedom from the kind of political correctness we are assumed to conform to as to the issue of someone's race. These moments are also endearing because they do *not* appeal to the racial stereotypes or prejudices we may have but invite us to rethink about them. In this regard, at least, I think Scrubs is far superior to Grey's Anatomy, another medical drama where racial issues are not really candidly or thoughtfully dealt with.   If you choose to look at it that way, every show (or movie, or novel, for that matter) is about three things: race, gender, and class. Scrubs' way of dealing with these three issues is amazingly original and mature. While having hard laughs, you find yourself rethinking about the notions you previously held as to these, and beginning to think of what the show is really saying. Of course, Scrubs is not an "issue" show. Far from it. If it makes you think, it does so in a really subtle, charming way.   I actually have used the show as class discussion material in my composition classes. Every (I mean, "every") student responded to the show strongly and found it delightful, pertaining, and very, very funny. In these classes, I could attest the "greatness" of the show. I have now watched the first season scores of times, and am sure that, if you are willing to, you can "do philosophy" with Scrubs, the way a group of philosophers did with The Simpsons ("The Simpsons and Philosophy": another very helpful resource for freshman composition class teachers). 
 This is one of the all time greats of children's literature. It's the book that really got me excited about reading (and science fiction) Everyone should check it out. 
 "Walk On" is a very informative book on the spiritual background of the group. Stockman has followed the group from the beginning and knows what he's talking about. For me, being both a Christian and a U2 fan, I found this book facinating because it answered so many questions, the main question being the spiritual integrety of the group. What I learned from the book was as much a lesson on biblical faith vs. the modern Christian right as it was on U2. Stockman makes clear the presure put on Bono and U2 to become the poster band for Evangelical Christians in the US, when the last thing they wanted to do was become alligned with hypocritical people and televangelists. As a result, U2 changed thier persona and made their albums and tours into an act to show the decadence and emptyness of superstardom. All the while, Stockman contends that U2 (minus Adam) has a deeply rooted faith born in Ireland where being a Christian was about as radical a thing as you could be. Each chapter of the book centers around a different album thoughout the bands career where Stockman digs deeper into the lyrics,  eventually leading to the most recent "Elevation" tour. When I saw the Elevation tour in 2000, it left feeling blessed as if I was in Church at a worship service. Bono states the same thing about the tour and their latest music, which is more of a return to faith. The only knock on this book is that Stockman talks almost entirely about lyrics, and doesn't really cover the musical directions the band has taken over the years. While this was his intent, it was a little frustrating to read, for example, about the lyrical triumph of  "Zooropa" when the music was at it's most experiental state. I suppose this book would be even better if read along side another book that chronicles the bands musical direction from album to album. Overall, this book tought me a lot about U2, the religious community of today, and my own personal faith. I highly recommend it to anyone who really wants to understand the heart behind the greatest rock band today 
 Author Adam Morgan went hunting for the second most successful brands. He sought commonalities among them to develop guidelines for those who are challenging the number one brands in their fields. In other words, if you are coming into the battle in the number two slot, here's your strategy for winning the marketing wars. Morgan is very adept at breaking things down into precise action steps. Witty and engaging, he offers a detailed analysis of the current consumer attitude about brands plus strategies you can use to market your second or third rank brand. We recommend this compilation of competitive ideas to those who want to boost their "Challenger" brands 
 This book is a wonderful guide through the NANDA maze for nursing students and practitioners.  It gives guidance to the appropriate diagnosis, assessments to make, how to steer clear of dependent diagnoses, and using NIC Interventions and NOC outcomes.  I am a professor of nursing, and I have used this for two semesters with my clinical stduents who rave about "the book" and also to help staff nurses develop great outcome based interventions for their patients.  It is very user friendly and is very portable.  At the price...it is the best bang for the buck 
 Enjoyed so much I ordered the rest of the Anita Blake series availabl 
 Galbraith's main point has less to do with any specific policy than with his belief that rigid ideologues advocate for flawed and potentially dangerous political and economic systems. He argues that capitalism is by far the most responsive and effective economic system given our nature and needs, but that pure market capitalism comes up short in many significant respects. He does exhibit his own bias in some chapters when he ignores matters of degree in favor of more dramatic claims, but his proposals are not controversial by most standards?we need a safety net, environmental regulation is necessary, etc. I couldn?t relate to most of the negative reviews/remarks here. Among them: Galbraith, onetime speechwriter for presidents, editor of Fortune magazine, and prolific author, is inarticulate to the point of incoherence; Galbraith, a onetime Harvard economics professor and head of the American Economic Association, lacks any understanding of economics; Galbraith's ideas are silly; etc. This is a book arguing that capitalism must be tempered if it is to serve society well. Someone who believes that environmental regulations, zoning laws, a progressive income tax, and organizations like the SEC are unnecessary impediments to economic growth will have a hard time with Galbraith. Others will likely recognize that the criticisms of capitalism he levels here are, to some debatable extent, legitimate 
 Contrary to what "Reader from California" says, Bandura's native language is not Spanish, though much of his work has been translated into Spanish and other languages. He was born and grew up in northern Manitoba 
 Lost a few nights of sleep on this one. Koontz does it again 
 It's a long review, but serves the context...  There was the revolution led in the late eighties by Ministry & Nine Inch Nails; they dragged industrial rock screaming into the mainstream. Their pioneer melding of punk, heavy metal & electronic music enabled the follow-up successes of Garbage, White Zombie, Rammstein and Marilyn Manson.  Across the sea, the UK was held in thrall by underground raves & the 'love pill', ecstasy. It couldn't last. By the early nineties, the rave scene was being clamped out. The laws were getting harsher, drug lords were taking over the ecstasy distribution and original 'rave' artists like the Chemical Brothers, Prodigy and Orbital were branching out on different styles of music, including Rock.  The common ground both scenes shared soon led to multiple "collaborations" on movie soundtracks, including 'Spawn' (1997), 'The Matrix' (1999) & 'Tomb Raider' (2001).  But that's history. That was electronic rock back then.  Now comes Kasabian, lending a "fresh" spin to the genre. If the nineties was the decade of the future, 2000 is the decade of the past. Kasabian are all about moogs, 'space age' theremins, occasional hip-hop beats (DJ Shadow & Blacklicious are cited as influences) and hypnotic kraut riffing. In more than one way, they are unique and, weirdly enough, more futuristic than anything out there.  Also, you can't compare this with industrial rock. The former is brash, agressive, in-your-face. Kasabian is a far more psychadelic, chilled out and somewhat jagged listening. Their self-titled debut is full of false starts (a la Tricky; hear "Processed Beats" intro), weird sonic details in the song's background ("L. S. F") and drug culture references ("Cut Off").  Recomended 
 The book, "Freezerbag Cooking" is really an eye-opener. After picking up the concept of cooking in a freezer bag, one can start converting other recipes to the same cooking method - using either store bought ingredients, or stuff you can dry at home in a dehydrator.  Sarah's recipes as some folks have suggested may be high in sodium, but one can always substitute ingredients with low-sodium or replace with something else all together. Sodium content is something I need to watch myself. After all, the ingredients list for cooking a meal is somewhat flexible. It seems that almost anything tastes good after a day spent outdoors hiking.  Another concern folks seem to have is pouring boiling water into a plastic bag. You can always use the crock pot bags if you feel strongly about this.  I have never had any problems pouring water into a bag. Other reviewer wrote something similar to this, boil water. Open bag. Pour in water. Wait. Eat. Fold and pack out the bag, does not get simpler than this, it's a no-brainer.  A truly great book to get you started with the concept of freezer-bag cooking. Looking forward to volume 2. 
 Paradise Lost, with its majestic but formidable language, is a masterpiece more often endured than enjoyed. Anton Lesser's superb reading in this Naxos Audiobooks recording brilliantly brings the poetry to life, infusing each character with a unique personality. Most impressive is his reading of Satan's speeches, wonderfully capturing the fallen angel's beauty and degradation. His agony when first beholding the happiness of Adam and Eve, and his humiliation at assuming reptile form, are worth the price of the audiobook. Though the recording is abridged, lovers of poetry will enjoy the bardlike meeting of actor and verse, and students will appreciate its accessibility and use of musical transitions 
 Today, much too many women stuggle with disordered eating due to harbored emotion. This book gives great insight on how to be intouch with your emotions, instead of letting food control them or you. I would DEFINITLEY recomend this book to any woman struggling with her eating. It is a great help. My daughter is currently in a bulimia & annorexia recovery support group and they are all reading this book reccomended by her counselor. It is a must read 
 Roland Deschain and his ka-tet are traveling through the dense forests of Mid-World. Their quest for the Dark Tower is nearing completion, when they arrive at Calla, a village traumatized by the kidnapping of their children by the Wolves of Thunderclap. When the villagers learn that Roland and his friends are visiting, some of them hope that these gunslingers will finally bring salvation. But not everyone is convinced that getting help from foreigners is such a good idea, so Roland has to prepare his best `dance' to try and convince everyone of his good intentions. Indeed, it is important that the people of Calla get help, because that seems to be the only way the secret of Father Callahan will get released. A secret that might help the ka-tet reach their ultimate goal: The Dark Tower.  This long-awaited fifth novel of the Dark Tower saga has turned out to be a massive 714-pages counting episode. Based upon the latest produce of Stephen King, that would normally mean a rather flimsy storyline packed with some page filling nonsense. But I am happy to say that Wolves of Calla is an nice exception to the rule. Wolves is so packed with storylines, that you never get bored. Although many ongoing plotlines get developed further, almost none of them get concluded. This can only mean one thing: Stephen King is preparing for the grand finale! If King can keep up this pace in the next two episodes, I trust that the finale will be unforgettable.  One of the many enjoyable things about this series is the intention of King to make links to his earlier novels. For a King-fan this can only mean more enjoyment. Wolves of Calla has until now been the best example of this. Introducing Father Callahan, the priest that first appeared in Stephen King's Salem's Lot, has been an excellent addition to the series. Callahan does not just perform a cameo, but, without revealing too much, gets a very important role to fulfill. It also sheds another light on the original Salem's Lot story. So be warned: After finishing Wolves you will feel the urge to (re)read Salem's Lot, so make sure you have a copy in your library 
 This is my first year teaching in a New York City Public School. I listened to this book prior to moving to New York and enjoyed it immensely. Hearing the author read his own words, especially in this author's expressive brogue, was outstanding. I highly recommend the CD simply for entertainment purposes.   For anyone considering following in Mr. McCourt's footsteps, beware! The city schools are every bit as challenging as they were in Mr. McCourt's day, but more so in that principals hide the disruptive and violent behavior of students by refusing to take discipline beyond the classroom.  There is a unspoken but strongly encouraged practice by certain LISs that want to hide the real problems in the schools they supervise to make their performance look stronger than it actually is.  Suspensions and SAVE room use count against them and the building principals under the new city guidelines as well as NLRB. The school violence statistics are severely underreported due to these dangerous and hidden practices, to the extent that the UFT has set up their own hot-line for reporting school violence to get a more realistic picture of what is actually happening in the school.    Woe to you if, like me, you are lured to a building with an untenured principal under these false pretences!  I have been told fist fights are a "Classroom management issue" and to "call the parents if you feel you can't handle it." Although there is a security officer in the school, calls for help when children are attacking others, using chairs or other movable objects in the room as weapons, are ignored by the office staff because they require a write up and these write-ups reflect on the administrative staff as well. It took me two phone calls to the office, one to security and over fifteen minutes to get help disarming a knife wielding elementary student who was jumping on the desks shouting, "I'm going to slice people in this room!" recently. The five little girls in the class were cowering and crying while I protected them from his rampage as best I could. I was reprimanded for not having control of my classroom and am now being subjected to harassment about my planning since, according to the principal, incidents like this wouldn't happen if my lessons were written out more completely.    Disruptive behavior is constant and unless a teacher is willing to browbeat or bribe students into enough docility that teaching can take place, 90% of time is spent correcting constant outbursts rather than instruction. Don't listen to this CD thinking, "How wonderful things have changed since then." It's as bad now, but the disruptive behavior Mr. McCourt describes in the challenging High School settings he taught in has moved down into Kindergarten. 
 I am a reader of the 2nd edition of this book, as I have not got the 3rd edition that , sorry, just give you some comment to the 2nd edition. I believe, however, you can glean how good the 2nd edition is. Firstly, it  give some hits of writing a cover, or , what essential information should  be given i your cover letter. For instance, you should tell the potential  employer whet you are available to attend the intervew. Secondly, What  visas/permits would you be necessary to got. Thirdly, after arrival, the  first stuff you have to do is how to fight with " Customs Not only  those information, it also drops the hints down, say, the issue of  accommodation, public transport, insure , etc.. Indeed, I highly recommend  this book to whom want to work in  the UK 
 This is a very comprehensive book with much that needs to be taught to the body of Yahushua/Jesus.  However, personally I cannot give it 5 stars because of the cover.  This author believes, rightly so, that we should not have pagan images in our homes, for example little Buddha figures, icons of saints and so on.  It seems wise to me to also eliminate from our homes ugly satanic images as seen on the cover of this book.  I personally am not sorry I bought it at all, but I did cut off and shred the top flap immediately upon opening the package. Also, some other very good materials on this subject are from Derek Prince and, my personal favorite, Graham Powell who wrote Christian Set Yourself Free.  There are no demonic images on their books or, in Prince's case, tapes either 
 At first I thought Neil H. was trying too hard and coming off insincere. Now after 2 week I am playing it constantly. Holy Moly. This is what music is meant to be. It makes you feel. You feel The Big Picture bathing your cells and then them nodding rhythmically knowingly, like only music can do.  Edit: I experienced them in concert and it was a beautiful experience - Waves of beauty filling the space around me with bliss.

 This workbook was wonderful, with games (like word BINGO), fill in the blanks, flashcards (you had to cut them out) and many, many different types of excercises that made the learning of sight words fun and engaging.  My money was well spent 
 I'm a traditionalist in the sense that I want to preserve the integrity of my old house 1765, and I'm looking at options with regards to bringing some of the old feel within a newer addition.  I actually thought this book had more actual period interiors, but they're a combination of some old with more new construction approximating the look of old with varying degrees of success.  What I feel is successful is retaining period color and contruction to mimic the period.  I'm all for modernization where appropriate  but not at the expense of destroying the fabric of history for modern convenience. To haphazardly mimic a style becomes mere embelishment which is fine in new construction but unconscionable distruction to an actual historic property.  18th century or 17th century structures didn't use bright colors and lighting. Part of the charm in an actual period home is viewing the environment as it was ment to be viewed. Much like the distain people have for colorized films, so goes bright overhead lights in a 18th century colonial keeping room. The warm glow of candlelight or there aproximating that allows the room to feel as it was. (why and where blue, red, green etc. were or were not used and why).  On the otherhand, juxtaposing contemporary modern convieniences within an attached modern structure (relatively speaking) or renovation a disintigrating section, while intergating and leaving the old as art and accent from old can be a wonderful contrast in texture and environment.  This book is more along the lines of renovation, maybe restoration is a stretch but you might get some helpful photos. It's definitly not in the preservation category.  Overall I've gotten some descent ideas for my renovation project.    
 we have had this since my son was in his crib and he loves it.  we have tried others like the aquarium and the rainforest versions but neither have the movie that projects on the ceiling like this one.  he is now 20 months old and still loves it.  it really soothes him to sleep and if he wakes up in the middle of the night, he just pushes the button to turn on the birdies.  i don't know why they don't make more of these soothers with the projector.  the others are not nearly as good because they lack it 
 An American who reads Alan Furst is likely to realize he knows very little about the start of World War Two. This novel is like all of Furst's WWII espionage series in that it gives you the perspective from a "pawn" country - Hungary - and a sense of the intimate, history-based relationships among the European states. This novel is distinguished by the subtlety of the plot. Don't look for lots of bombs and firing squads. Look for betrayals and personal versus patriotic agendas and the consequences of earlier actions. Furst is at his best in setting the atmosphere of pre-war Continental cities and he's on his game in this one 
 In my estimation there is no better artist in all of history. Now that's a pretty bold statement, but anyone who has viewed Sargent's originals would have to agree this man painted with authority and bravado. Yes, he was a showoff. I think that sometimes he would make a brushstroke just to say "see what I can do?" A lot of people don't realize that he painted fantastic watercolors as well as great oil portraits. If you want to see what a brush can do in the hands of a true master, study the work of John Singer Sargent 
 Certainly not for the age group specified.  I preview books for my grandchildren but this scared me!  Very intense and gruesome in places.  Make sure you have plenty of time to read when you start this one - it's hard to put down.  Very entertaining but if you're prone to nightmares you might want to reconsider

 Ever since I moved to the Middle East, I have been very interested in what is going on in the regional politics. I had some previous knowledge about post '53 Iran, but Mr. Pollack's writing showed me a different perspective. I will not discuss the political and historical issues in the book, as my fellow reviewers have already done that.   5 points for the amount of information available, the details and the analysis. But I have to say that so many details and notes to the events become tiring at timest, difficult to remember them all. As a former CIA military analysit, Mr. Pollack did a great job by bringing to light so much information and detail. A well analyzed and reserached book.  1 point for the author's attitude in some parts. Sometimes he emphasizes too much on how important and powerful the United States are, how much they don't need Iran, and what a great country America is. Nothing wrong with being proud of your country, and it might be true that the US do not care about Iran. But when one wants to write an unbiased, objective book on such a hot topic, personal feelings should not be there.   4 1/2 points for the writing style - smooth and coherent, making it a very pleasant reading. I found myself sometimes in the situation where I could not put the book aside.   Overall, The Persian Puzzle is a very good reading for those really interested in what Iran-US relations are like today and why they are they way they are. I recommed this book to those who already know something about this subject. If you want to learn now, this is not the good introduction. You might find it too heavy and difficult to digest so much information.   It is definitely a reference book on the topic, rational, comprehensive, suitable for the average reader, worthwhile buying 
 I think this book is excellent. You have created so many good books over the past few years but this one is going to really help students and docs educate patients. I appreciate your hard work and wish you much success with your writing career 
 On radio, in the 1950s television version of Dragnet, and in its 1960s resurrection, Jack Webb was Sergeant Joe Friday, the straight-shooting, no-nonsense exemplar of the LAPD. In this non-fiction book, Webb tells the real stories of crimes that were too violent to be broadcast on "Dragnet."  Among them are the famous murder of the "Black Dahlia," a woman who was tortured for days before her killer slit her throat, drained her body of blood, bisected it and dumped her in an empty lot.  Another story that made my blood boil was the murder of a 10-year old orphaned boy, whose own mother had just died days before.  His father lost a wife and, senselessly, a son within weeks to a murderer who killed for the thrill of it.    Each chapter of the book is labeled with an LAPD rank, from Policeman, to Sergeant, to Lieutenant, all the way to Commissioner(s).  The stories in the first few chapters are the most absorbing, as they demonstrate actual, hands-on police work.  Yet, it was also interesting to read of problems which confronted, and still confront, Los Angeles and its police force at higher levels.  The book particularly presents a good picture of Chief Parker, who is responsible for cleaning up the vice and corruption that marked the pre-1950 LAPD and setting rules that made officers proud to serve.    A warning to 21st century readers: This book was written in 1958 with the stereotypes -- and the language -- common at the time.  Some sentences might make you gasp: i.e., in describing race relations in Los Angeles, Webb writes that "It is a dozen collisions, the Oriental, the Mexican, the Indian, the Southerner (both Negro and white), the Easterner and the Westerner; intra-racial as well as one skin pitted against another of a different color."  There are a lot of sentences like that, particularly in the later chapters, where Webb was trying to argue that the LAPD of the time was cognizant of ethnic tensions and attempted to ameliorate them.  (As an unabashed LAPD booster, Webb marshals evidence to make his case that the department was addressing racism.) And, from a 21st century viewpoint, the LAPD war against bingo parlors seems terribly penny-ante, although perhaps justified by the "broken windows" theory.    But the heart of this book is the stories of crimes great and small, and the police officers who solved them. A must for those interested in true crime stories, Los Angeles history, and the LAPD 
 I loved this book! As an author, Ray Kurzweil isn't afraid to delve into the difficult task of attempting to foresee the future. Kurzweil receives plenty of criticism by those who find his predictions about the direction of future technological progress hard to fathom. Some complain his visions are scary, depressing, or otherwise miss the mark for some reason. I found The Age of Spiritual Machines to be an optimistic, comforting, entertaining and well researched look at some likely implementations of future technology.  Kurzweil has a very respectable background in the computer hardware and software field and is undoubtedly qualified to throw his visions about the future into the ring. He supports his notions with ample research and evidence. This book isn't proposing to tell you exactly what's going to happen in the next ten years; rather it's following current and past trends and logically extending them into the future. In many respects the future is simply what results from decisions we make today. Kurzweil helps us consider our alternatives and future results based on a look at currently available technology and the trends in future development. 
 The music was deeply soothing, the words beautiful, and it took me to a place of deep healing. I felt that kind of healing that maybe if you seek it like I do you find it once every few years. The odd thing is, I can't determine what it is exactly that works so well. It's as if the intention behind the words and the music are what is healing. I felt the love in this recording, it is amazing that this is something that can be bought. 
 The Society of Mind attempts to explain how the mind works. The author considers the mind to be a society of small mental machines that do simple things by themselves but combine to perform amazingly complex tasks like the walking and talking that we take for granted. As this book was written in the 1980's I am sure that it is somewhat out of date. But the questions he asks are timeless. How does memory work? How do we sense space? How do we process conflicting ideas? How do we know when to replace a memory with a more accurate version? This book will make you think about these questions and more. The Society of Mind is worth reading just for the questions it asks 
 wow this movie blew me away, i saw it with a mind set that i was gonna hate but i didnt it was really good, and it had some comedy in it as well. now there are a few part that are a little cheap but its a fine damn movie. besides what other movie has a giant bunny 
 This is a great book.  I read it to my class and then they wrote their own "Important Books. 
 I just reread this earlier Lindsey Davis/Marcus Didious Falco mystery and it was still completely enjoyable the second time around.  Interesting plot, wonderful historic detail and terrific character development and interaction.  What's not to like.  Lindsey Davis is my girl!  I look forward to her annual Falco offering and happily recommend this series to anyone who hasn't heard of it (how would that be possible?) 
 Ben Kincaid, known as Tulsa, Oklahoma's finest criminal defense attorney, is back! William Bernhardt has had quite a run with Kincaid, whose hapless personal life is incongruous with his highly qualified, if not financially rewarding, law practice. Kincaid's incompetent ability with women in general and with law partner (and erstwhile love interest) Christina McCall in particular is also a mainstay of this series. Both appear to be headed toward resolution in CAPITOL MURDER.  Bernhardt has been removing Kincaid from Tulsa, correctly ascertaining that Tulsa would need a murder rate equal to that of a Rob Zombie movie in order to sustain Kincaid's practice. Accordingly, the site du jour of CAPITOL MURDER is Washington, D.C. At the start of the novel, Kincaid is being retained to represent Todd Glancy, the senior U.S. Senator of Oklahoma. Glancy needs Kincaid badly: a videotape has just been released that shows Glancy apparently forcing Veronica Cooper, one of his Senate interns, into involuntary sexual activity. While no criminal charges are being brought, Glancy is concerned about civil actions and political repercussions.  Kincaid and Company barely arrive at Glancy's Senate offices when Cooper is found dead, the victim of a violent and bizarre murder. Naturally, Glancy is charged with the killing. What follows is a variation on the classic fish-out-of-water syndrome, with Kincaid and his firm apparently way out of their league. When Kincaid is involved, however, you're wise to bet on the fish, no matter how much it gasps or how blue it turns while it's flopping around. Hapless as he is in his personal life, Kincaid is an excellent trial attorney. But even he can be hamstrung, and the duplicitous nature of the Washington atmosphere is such that it appears Kincaid has met his match.  Bernhardt, who is always good at creating reprehensible characters for Kincaid to represent, has truly outdone himself in his latest effort. Glancy is about as unsympathetic a character as one could wish for, and if readers harbor a secret hope that Glancy circles the drain for a while and then disappears before the real murderer is unmasked, they can certainly be forgiven.  CAPITOL MURDER has a couple of things going against it. Bernhardt apparently couldn't resist going overboard with some excessive partisan political pontificating, which distracts the reader and takes the book way off track at times. This is unfortunate, to the extent that he risks alienating potential readers who thought they were buying a book and brought home a soapbox instead. There also is a somewhat outlandish red herring that probably will not fool anyone for more than a few pages.  Ultimately, though, CAPITOL MURDER rises above its flaws to become the type of courtroom thriller that one ultimately expects from Bernhardt. Further, longtime readers of the Kincaid novels will find at least one extended plotline resolved in a way that is both satisfying and quite credibly presented and that ultimately will bring them back again to see how things work out. While CAPITOL MURDER may not bring any new fans to the table, it will keep the veterans firmly anchored in their seats.     --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlau 
 As a matter of fact I bought this CD not as much due to Mr. Newman's original scrore, but since I liked very much the treatment of the beatiful Spanish song "La Violetera" in key moments of the film. Mr. Newman's music is very good, but the Spanish and Argentine music he used was much better. The performances of "The Tango Project" are superb. "La Violetera" is probably the nicest Spanish song, talking of a florist; it is widely known in its original version in Spain and Latin America, and moreover, came to international light thanks to Charles Chaplin's "City Lights" where it was the Leitmotif of the blind florist girl (a very adequate use indeed). The tango "Por una Cabeza" is probably the highlight of the score, because it is the piece danced by Al Pacino; unfortunately the other tango "Caminito", played by the orchestra at the restaurant, does not appear here. It is a petty. As a whole, I like the CD very much, especially the two performances of "The Tango Project", but just because they are more touching to my cultural heritage. Nonetheless, I praise both Mr. Newman's personal compositions as well as his perfect use of other's melodies 
 I totally LOVED this book!  I have such a busy life and it's hard for me to find time to read, I really need something that catches my attention and this did it for me.  Very easy book to put yourself into and really live it as you are reading it 
 This book is absolutely incredible! Thank you so much David Horovitz! I want to read your day-to-day accounts of life in Israel beyond the end of this book.  I have been a religious right-wing supporter of Eretz Israel, anxiously awaiting the time that I am in a financial position to make aliyah. I have strongly supported the anti-disengagement fighters.   Your book has made me think. It has opened my eyes to the Arab side of the story, as well as details of politics on both sides that I was not previously aware of.  This book has filled me with hope of someday living in the holy land and at the same time has made me cry, and evoked terror. Reading the chapter on Yussuf makes me wonder if there is ever any hope for peace - on the political side there is, but on the religious side it seems hopeless, as religious Jews can never voluntarily relinquish the Temple Mount or any of Jerusalem.  There have been times that I have had to put it down and walk away for a while to digest what I have just read (and cry) - and I'm only on page 166!  For a long time I have thought the solution to this problem was for millions of North American religious Jews to make aliyah and change the government in Israel, now I'm not so sure... More to come.. 
   Dr. Schwartz uses his education to accurately investigate, with the scientific method, the possibility we are all interconnected with the universe and the G.O.D. process. The results of his research must have been hard for Dr. Schwartz, a former agnostic, to accept. He manages to gather scientific, metaphysical, and psychological evidence to support his thesis; doing so in a convincing and easy to read manner.    Some of his theological views could be better if they were based on and supported by those of a conservative religous organization. The poor reviews he received here seem to be that of readers whose stubbornness and pride prevent them from believing in truth. That's a problem such readers will have to attempt to live with and unfortunately to die with. 
 Samuel Beckett's, soon to be classic, drama about two men, Vlad and Estro, transcends stage-play drama. Beckett's relatively short story is a pioneering foray into the mixture of a dramatic, literal story.   Most drama should be seen on stage, so that the performers can give their characters shape, bring in an audience, and produce a night of dramatic arts. That is not how this story seems to go; not at all, indeed.  Beckett's story can be seen as a naturalistic look at the life of the poor. Here are two men, both obviously at the end of their ropes, but each keeps this asinine hope that "GODot" will show up. But, he never does. Extra characters, like Pozzo and Lucky, simply add to the intended confusion.  As several previous reviewers have taken note--there is not action. While this idea is spurred by "The Threepenny Opera," Beckett takes postmodernism another step further. The characters' are so disillusioned the question becomes, Godot isn't coming, so did he ever care? Could Godot actually exist he allows these poor fellows to exist in such a state.   A fantastic read, and one of the best dramas ever written. This fairly short play should be read by EVERYONE. 
 Ms. Peters has a several things going for her. She is prolific, she is entertaining and she writes well.  When it is time for a long soak in the tub, I can't think of a better read with which to relax and enjoy. Even if this is your first taste test of Ms. Peters' work, her plot, dialogue and character development are consistent, well thought out, and never offensive.   If you are stuck in the airport book store and don't know what else to grab, Ms. Peters will not ever make you regret picking her work.   This story revolves around greed. And murder. And greed. And a golden statue from ancient Egypt. You visit digs, you learn about Cairo after the great war, and you enjoy the banter, conversation and interaction of well developed and likeable characters. I can't say more without blowing the plot, but as usual, the twists and turns of the story will entertain and amuse. 
 Whether just an article or an entire novel most of us need to edit our work to give it that professional finish.  This book is not a grammar book with all those rules on how to make your work syntactically correct.  Instead it takes a larger view and supplies the basics of writing well.  For example the "ground rules" include checking to make sure the story is organized well and and checking that paragraphs have a topic sentence that the rest of the paragraph relates to.  For each of the ground rules the authors discuss how to check your work to see that it conforms to the rules and how to change it so it does.    The section starting on page 33 is a welcome change from most writing books.  The authors suggest that you should identify areas where you have problems and include them on a check list of editing problems to watch for.  But, how do you know your problem areas if you don't see the problem?  This section gives several examples of sentences with various problems.  Find the ones where you don't see a problem, go to the answers section that explains the problem and you have your short list of items to learn about and watch for in your work.    For the person looking to raise their writing quality to a higher level of professionalism Write It Right is a recommended read 
 When you pick up a Sharon McCone book by Marcia Muller, yuo pretty much know what you are going to get-- a solid detective novel that integrates nicely with Sharon McCone's personal life--and that's okay. In The Dangerous Hour, one of McCone's employees is arrested for credit card fraud and the McCone Detective Agency is the subject of a BBB complaint. Not only that, but they are fighting against allegations leveled against the agency by an Hispanic San Francisco mayoral candidate.  While dealing with all of this, in addition to covering her cases, McCone is also working through the twist that her romance with security operative Hy Ripinski has taken.  One of the things I like about this series is that the McCone character is allowed to grow and become professionally successful. She follows an actual life pathway, as opposed to characters in other series who seem to be frozen in time.  The Dangerous Hour is another solid book in a solid series, with strong, likable characters and believable villains. It's nice to see a mystery author who is able to keep up the quality of her books with the release of the 23rd book in the series. 
 I cannot explain in words how this tastes; it is something to experience. There is regular HP sauce, that I found when I was looking for an alternative to A-1 steak sauce.  Now comes this fruit flavored variant. The mango flavor really comes out 
 Admins for the Windows 2003 environment are faced with a daunting task:  Security in an inherently insecure world.  This book is an excellent resource, with instructions that are clear and easy to follow.  There is a basic knowledge assumed--this is not a book for beginners--but for the professional, this book is a literally a job saver.  Included is information on Group Policy Management Console, Timewarp Client, Security Configuration Wizard and essential protocols.  Well worth the investment 
 This book may not be for those who have a limited medical vocabulary, but it is by far the best book on Autism and Asperger currently in print. I have a deep interest in both as a lay person with a chemistry career background. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in those topics, especially the parents of kids who have been diagnosed (or mis-diagnosed) as autistic. Ask your doctor. 
 I really recommed these shoes, they are very smooth and comfortable, if you buy a pair you'll really appreciate it 
 This C.D. is enough to make you "nut". 15 tracks of non-stop goodness (track 16 drops hard, but is a bit lame). A must have for all you club kids and for everyone out of the scene. With samples from N.W.A.  remixed by "The King of the Beats" himself and some oldies but  goodies like Brown Paper Bag, Jungle Brothers (Aphrodite's True Blue mix),  Man of Steel, and Natural Born Chiller's Funky Beats; you can not go wrong.  From start to almost finish, you just can not stop listening to this. I  must have already listened to it 100,000 times (no kidding) 
 I bought the tin when it came out.  I haven't watched all of the cartoons in its entirety but am happy that I have it because it is essential for collecting purposes.  I'm not referring to the fact that the dvd might increase in monetary value.  I wanted to explain that it is essential because they are classic Disney cartoons and who knows when they'll sell out and never see the light of day again on the dvd shelves.  You never know when you will want to watch a Pluto cartoon.  When that random time comes, I'm happy to know that I have it in my collection 
 I was both shocked and disappointed to see that John Williams had been ditched and replaced with a new composer for the music, and was sad to see that this new guy for the most part rewrote it all.  Despite all this however, I really enjoyed what was done and really enjoyed the remix of the Harry Potter theme. I'm sad it wasn't used more.  All in all, the music was good enough that it made the movie seem much more enjoyable to me, which is saying something since The Goblet of Fire is by far my least favorite of the group 
 It's about time gay men had a book that wasn't women and men focussed.  This book was that book, and truly helped to identify that homosexual relationships are different from heterosexual ones and take a different course.  Its words were very helpful in healing the pain of a lost relationship and building of a new one.  It can certainly be used a reference manual and referred back to from time to time as relationships change, grow, and diminish.  I would highly recommend it for anyone thinking about starting a relationship or already in one, as well as for anyone currently single.  It works on all levels 
 I'm preparing to transfer 4 year college and I didn't have any idea what do I have to ready for portfolio. This book give me a lot of idea to help get ready and find way of out line 
 Works well for dry skin.  Ignore Wendla's review... Dove does not test products on animals.   "2. What is the Dove® policy on animal testing?

 This is a beautiful album, incorporating some of the most famous guitar works, exquisitely performed.  The sound quality is excellent, pairing guitar and string orchestra with fine control.  The Warlock suite is new to most hearers, and its rhythmic rendition of folk dances is fun to play over and over 
 Love the group, every song is great and I enjoy it a lot!  I bought this one to replace another that I lost from years ago.. 
 When Once and Again first began I dismissed it as a show for just women. But after watching just one episode I found myself hooked. This was unlike any show I had seen before. I actually found myself drawn into the lives of these two families. Once and Again is not just a show about two divorced people who find each other and start to fall in love. It goes much deeper than that. Once and Again follows the lives of two divorced people and the lives of their children as well. But then it goes a step further and it follows the lives of their ex spouses as well. With the first season we see how the relationship begins to develop between Lily (Sela Ward) and Rick (Billy Campbell) and how their ex's still play a factor in their love lives and how their blossoming relationship has an effect on their children. Once and Again was one of the finest dramas on television and if given the respect it deserved could still be growing strong today. Even thought it's time on television was short Once and Again showcased the acting talents of Sela Ward and Billy Campbell and launched the careers of Shane West and Evan Rachel Wood. I am just glad that we are able to enjoy this fine show on DVD and that they have finally decided to release Seasons 2 and 3 
 A book which has achieved more notoriety for its sex scenes (shocking in 1930, when the book was written) than for its character studies, Lady Chatterley's Lover focuses on the affair between Constance, the "sturdy" young wife of Clifford Chatterley, and the gamekeeper of the Chatterleys' estate in the remote midlands.  Constance, who married Clifford a month before he left for World War I, has become his caretaker since his return from the war, paralyzed from the waist down and impotent.  A writer who surrounds himself with intellectual friends, Clifford regards Connie as his hostess and caregiver and does not understand her abject yearning for some life of her own.  The distance between Constance and Clifford increases when Mrs. Bolton, a widow from the village, becomes his devoted caretaker, and he becomes increasingly dependent upon her.  In a remarkable scene, Clifford finally tells Connie that he'd like an heir, and he does not care whom she finds to be the father of "his" child.  He believes, in fact, that he could treat her affair as if it were a trip to the dentist.  Connie, yearning for an emotional closeness which she has never experienced before, soon becomes involved with Mellors, the estate's gamekeeper.  Crude and anti-social, Mellors has an honesty and lack of pretension which Connie finds refreshing.    Throughout the novel, Lawrence creates finely drawn characters whose interactions and gradual changes are explored microscopically.  The growth of love between Connie and Mellors is complicated by the increasing self-centeredness of Clifford, whose outrage at rumors of their affair is motivated by Connie's choice of someone so far beneath her.  To Clifford, the separation of the social classes is an integral and inevitable part of life.  Devoted to achieving financial success even at the expense of his workers, the paralyzed Clifford is depicted as a symbol of unfeeling aristocracy and government.  Mellors, by contrast, is vigorous and full of life, a strong man of character who obeys his instincts and stands up for what he believes.  Dealing with themes of love, passion, respect, honor, and the need for understanding, Lady Chatterley's Lover is a complex, character-driven novel which, though dated, celebrates the driving passions which can make life worth living.  The romantic scenes and language here are tame by modern standards, and the extreme behavior and willingness to flout convention by Connie and Mellors may be less realistic, psychologically, than what would make sense to a modern reader.  Firmly rooted in the 1930's, the novel shows an insensitive Clifford adhering to  outdated values, based on outdated economic structures, while Connie and Mellors, freed from these conventions, explore their inner natures and their humanity. n Mary Whipple  
 I am a practicing mental health therapist.  I deal with adults and adolescence that have a history of or are currently dealing with self injury.  This book offered some good insight into self injury and treatment options/tips when dealing with a person who self injurers.  I was somewhat disappointed in the lengthy explanation of all the disorders.  However, I am reading this book from a therapist point of view and not a person who is trying to recover.    Overall; I felt this book had some good insight but would have liked more focus on the treatment and outcome rather than the different types of disorders. 
 Outstanding guide for communicating with the heart, soul and mind of your beloved pet.  Gives deep insight into the workings of an animal's thoughts and feelings. You will never look at your dog or cat the same way again!   Arlene Millman, author of BOOMERANG - A MIRACLE TRILOGY (The tale of a remarkable Boston Terrier) 
 I've been a fan of Midnight Syndicate ever since I first heard a clip of the title song of this CD, "Born of the Night".  I have several of their CDs,  but this one is my favorite.  This is actually the third copy of this CD I've bought.  The first one I gave away when a friend heard it and loved it and I just plain wore out the other one.  I like all the tracks on this CD, but I think the most exceptional song by far is "Shadows" (the ninth track).  I think a more evocative name for the song would be either "The Haunted Music Room" or "The Demented Carol of the Bells".  There is a ticking throughout the song that sounds like a giant metronome and the bells are really eerie.  The combination of the two is incredible.  My other favorites are the title song, "Born of the Night", "Haunted Nursery" (sounds just like the title) and "Vampire's Kiss".  This is a great CD for anyone who like this genre of music and would be perfect to create a creepy atmosphere for any Halloween or ghostly get together 
 Great compilation. Consists of many songs that you won't find on every other compilation. 
 loved this season. always keeps me on the edge of my seat. cant wait for season three to come out onto dvd 
 reccommended for anybody intrested in modern shamanism, consciousness, awareness, spirituality, positive world change.  very good book, very well writte 
 Well what can I say about Candi Staton's new album HIS HANDS?!  It never ceases to amaze me that when I listen to a Candi Staton album, she always has a way of hitting the head of the nail on issues that affect everyday people.    I was thrilled to find out that she was recording an album that would resurrect the sound she made famous when she was with FAME records in the late 60s and early 70s.  When I first listened to this album, immediately I could understand the emotions and heartache that must have inspired Ms. Staton to sing with such conviction!  My favorite song has to be "When Will I?" and it's such an inspiring song.  My favorite line is "I see a lonely sparrow fly, and I wonder, when will I?"......reminiscent of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow."  The title track is shivering with vocals that hits the core of the human condition.  Overall what an awesome album!  It is also nice to note that Candi is receiving rave reviews, which she greatly deserves!  I have been a fan for many years now and I hope that the rest of the world will come to realize what a great singer she is 
 Yes, it is a shock therapy book. It is filled with some of the most cruel and bloody imagery. But this shock therapy is needed, both in Russia and in the West. Because that imagery is not a figment of somebody's imagination nor is it some particularly violent page of the world history book long turned over and forgotten. It's reality. It's happening right now, right at this moment. Even now, 3 years since the book's last interview with Akhmed Zakaev took place. And virtually nobody outside of Chechnya has a good idea what is going on there.   Yes, the author sympathizes with the Chechen CIVILIANS, and the word 'civilians' should always be emphasized. She has nothing good to say about the separatists/terrorists (which do you prefer, by the way?). Except the fact that she - and, upon reading this book, me too, by the way - can understand the ever-increasing number of people who are willing to fight the federal forces 'till the last drop of blood.   Yes, the author is somewhat biased. But, then again, who isn't. And it's hard to be unbiased when you see a 6-year-old boy helping gather the remains of a man who stepped on a landmine into a plastic bag that was bought from those same people who put the landmines there in the first place.  Disregard the (so obviously Russian) naysayers - if someone's brainwashed, it's them. Putin's puppet media does wonders, trust me. Read this book, read something that presents an alternative point of view, and form your own opinion. 
 I would recommend this book to anyone studying "Romeo and Juliet."  I would have never made it through English class without this book 
 As I neared the final chapter of this book I read more and more slowly, not wanting it to end.This final book of the Guenevere trilogy has the most satisfactory ending of any of the dozens of Arthurian stories that I've read before. The others always left me with a feeling of dissatisfaction and a gnawing sense that matters were not quite concluded but Rosalind Miles has hit on the perfect,most logical ending to this whole, magnificent fairy tale and her wonderful writing would satisfy even the toughest critics. I feel sad that this wonderful piece of magic has ended but would recommend the trilogy to anyone who is fortunate enough to have it all ahead of them 
 Keep up the good work Chevelle! Another fine cd for our listening pleasure! One of the best rock cds released so far this year.(close second to Sevendust's Alpha 
 At its core A PASSAGE TO INDIA is a darkly pessimistic view of the future between India and Great Britain. When E. M. Forster published it in 1924, England had but recently begun to divest itself not only of its overseas colonial empire but also the attendant mind set that was proving more difficult to eradicate.  Many English still believed, even if subconsciously, that Indians, in their swarthiness and what to the English seemed like their grubby living conditions in Bombay were utterly incapable of carrying on in any meaningful way without the constant assistance of Britain.  It was against this background that Forster wrote of the bitterness and harsh feelings that he saw as deeply ingrained on both sides.  Ironically, for those who view his book as a raw but honest portrayal of this mutual acrimony, Forster himself is guilty of the same underlying assumptions against which he so eloquently rails.  The dramatic focus begins with Dr. Aziz, an intelligent Moslem physician who sees the English as arrogance personified but is inclined to think that with a growing understanding and compassion, the walls of prejudice may be breached and India and England may co-exist in reasonable harmony. He is aided in this belief by his association with Mrs. Moore, a liberal Englishwoman, and Cyril Fielding, an equally understanding principal of the British Government College.  However, when Aziz attends a bridge party given by various English personnel, he is rudely treated and is humiliated, causing him to rethink his earlier optimism. The climax of the book occurs when Aziz invites Mrs. Moore and her friend Adela Quested to visit the mysterious Malabar Caves, where wind and echoes resound.  During their trip, Adela hears the wind and becomes disoriented. She later claims that Aziz assaulted her, a crime for which he is arrested and tried in court.  This trial becomes a national event, and when Adela recants her accusation, Aziz is freed, but he is terribly embittered, and India itself sees the accusation as yet another example of English condescension.  The novel ends with Aziz breaking all ties with his friend Fielding.  Early in the novel, Forster clearly states his belief that it may not be possible for English and Indians to live in harmony.  He suggests that in the early and friendly relations between Aziz and Fielding such a harmony may be realized, but as the book's events reveal, that this harmony is but an illusion, as wispy as the sounds echoing from Malabar Caves.  The friendship between the two is not strong and is based more on shared philosophical goals than personal affinities.  During the course of the bitter trial, this friendship proves incapable of supporting the strain and is finished.  The other liberal, Mrs. Moore, is conveniently spirited out of the book so she need not testify on Aziz's behalf.  When Forster closes with Aziz defiantly proclaiming that he is now staunchly in the camp of those who oppose social reconciliation, there is a tendency to overlook what undercuts what otherwise might be Forster's surface sadness at his view that matters between England and India are irreparably breached.   Forster is so relentlessly insistent in his belief that this gap is permanent that the reader begins to wonder whether Forster's reasons lie more with subliminal agreement with the "white man's burden" rather than any objective assessment of undeniable fact. Further, when he allows Mrs. Moore to so conveniently avoid helping Aziz during the trial, Forster may simply have found the path of least resistance and thus not have to worry about questioning his own underlying assumptions.  The problems, then, in identifying and confronting the issues that Forster raised in 1924 are as elusive today as were the echoes that resonated so loudly in the Marabar Caves the day Adela Quested opened that can of racial worms.    
 I have been waiting to see this come out on CD, this is one of my favorite old albums, I had it on cassette, you'd need a V-8 engine to play it now though,99 days, shake that fat, babylon, it don't get much better than this, Back in the day, it was Three Dog Night, The Guess Who,Steppenwolf, Grand Funk, Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper, Deep Purple, I've seen em all live and it seems like last week. This music is timeless, it keeps us old guy's young!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Keep on ROCK'N  MJ 
 I know people don't want to admit it (especially guys) but the smell and the appearance of a pretty flower can change your mood.  You can have the worst day of your life, smell a pretty flower, and feel all better before you go to bed that night.  I myself have had fascinations with flowers since I was a young man, and the feeling of loving flowers never went away (and I hope it never does).  There's so many amazing flowers out there, all with their own unique appearance and smell, and it makes life more interesting.  This book is about stories of how flowers have changed peoples lives.  For some people flowers are very important, and this book will allow you to open your mind and help you see flowers in a new light.  
 Lion in the Valley ranks, in my mind, as one of the best in the early Amelia Peabody Emerson novels.  In this one, Amelia and Emerson finally get the chance to dig at the Black Pyramid in Dahshoor -- and you know how Amelia loves those pyramids.  This book brings backs the great characters of old and adds some very interesting new characters.  "Nemo" was an especially interesting character (at least until we find out about his situation) and Ramses is as precocious a troublemaker as ever.  This books ratchets up the tension between the Peabody Emerson and the Master Criminal, or M.C. for the sake of Emerson's bruised ego.  These stories are written with fun and excitement in mind, and if you can accept the tongue-in-cheek nature of the plots, then you'll able to sit back and enjoy a rollicking ride 
 i read this book in one day. it was that much of a page-turner. mannix introduces his reader to freaks of every nature. this book is more of a personal account of their lives, rather than a historical or scientific one (although it touches gently on those aspects). mannix lets his reader look into the lives of percilla the "monkey woman", myrtle corbin the "4-legged woman", emmett the "alligator man", "happy jack eckert", and countless others. this book is a must-read 
 This book goes into great detail regarding Wearings past works, and some of her current 'works in progress.' There are plenty of examples of her photographs, including the 'Signs...' collection and stills of the many  videos that she has produced. The most useful chapter is the interview with  the artist. What I found most interesting was that the interviewer asks  Wearing some good questions about her work, like why she chose to do it and  how she went about asking her subjects to be in the photographs. The only  problem that I found with the book was some of the language used. The  writers are obviously fairly intelligent people and their wide vocabulary  had me reading from a dictionary almost as much as I read the book. Such  language does lead you to gloss over certain areas of the book which leaves  you slightly unsatisfied. However as long as you can get through the book  it offers a deep insight into all of the artists work and her life,  containing plenty of photographic examples of her work, very useful 
 This book is amazing and heartbreaking.  Very raw and honest, and eye-opening to the inequalites apparent in the United States today. The poor African-American people who live in the Ida B. Welles housing projects live a life that is like growing up in open warfare with very little hope for the future and enjoyment of the past.  The narrators, LeAlan Jones and Lloyd Newman, are very bright and perceptive young men who prove that a child born in the ghetto can still make something out of his life.  The revelation I came away with after reading this is that the children in this world are smart; they just don't have the resources and support that are needed for a child to be fulfilled and happy.  Although the principal we meet in the book is doing her best to provide these children with the education they deserve.  These children grow up too fast.  They see things at a young age that no one should see, ever.  Drug deals, shootings, prostitution.  It is so sad.  Conducted in interviews, many memorable characters are come across in this unfortunate housing project.  Slavery may be over.  The Civil Rights movement may have happened.  But, really, what is happening here is a form of racism.  Poor black people are stacked in unfordable housing and basically forgotten about by the white establishment of America.  This book is important for drawing attention to these inequalities and the shameful reality of urban American living.  Particularly heart-breaking is the story of little Eric Morse, a five year old, who was dropped from a four story window by two eleven year olds.  Heartbreaking.  What is truly inspiring is the words of wisdom and hope by narrators LeAlan and Lloyd. 
 The Church Ladies Divine Deserts is an indispensable combination of great recipes and hearty doses of oral history and advice.  There is a long tradition of "church ladies" involvement in every facet of the secular and sacred traditions of their faith based institutions. One of the most important is that of nourishing the palate with the delectable deserts that grace the tables of the church dinners and the  dining room tables in their homes.  Brenda Miller, the wife of a minister, has collected the recipes and the stories behind them from the "church ladies" all over the country.  Every cook should buy it.  Every reader who wants to know more about some of our country's best traditions should also read it 
 Excellent for the every day driver. I got it as a gift, and bought 4 more for my family 
 Steve  from Miami....Pure Gold is  what  Goldie  has  created  with  this  artwork  of  an  album. From  begining to  finish.The  drum  beats  make  love  to your  ear like a  gentle  lover, and  the  timing  is  simply  perfect.This  is not a  hardcore  dnb  album or  "shake your  body" type of sht this is  simply an  artisit  at  his  best  displying  his  definition  of  sounds.If  your a  fanatic  of  Goldie  then  this  is  a  must  have  no  Goldie  collection is  complete  with  out "Timeless".No  Drum n bass  collection  is  complete  with out  "Timeless"  period 
 I bought this for my father for Christmas, and he has enjoyed it very much.  I did the installation myself (GMC Sierra pickup), and it's been years since I've fumbled around with car electronics.  The antenna plug is just small enough that I was able to route it through his 3rd brake light, above the headliner, down the passenger side pillar and under the carpet to where I dash mounted the unit itself.  All in all it took me about an hour to install, and most of that time was spent figuring out how to remove interior panels.  The included remote doesn't get much use since it's easier for him to just hit his preset buttons.  You may also have trouble with the built in FM modulator, or rather the abundance of FM stations which interfere with the unit.  We noticed a great increase in quality by using the included cassette adapter, but those with CD only stereos will obviously have trouble with that.  The blue backlit display is large enough that he's able to read it without his reading glasses, which is another plus in our book.  I will highly recommend this kit to anyone looking to add XM to their vehicle 
 This is the first evenhanded review of the Issraeli-Palesinian conflict. Only Presidenrt Carter has the prestige to pull  it off I was surprised to read how many times Israel had broken agreed upon agreemenrts with the Palestinians. Generally Arafat had been blamed in the American press. Although a democracy, Israel comes across like a Nazi state - minus the Holocost The unconditional US backing of Israel made it obvious why the Islamic world hates the US and Israel. Everyone should read this book. The author points out what needs to be done if peace in the area is to come. 
 I had read about evacuators on a few forums - it works as described.  No complaints other than the amount of time it took do draw 8 quarts. that said, perhaps the first use included a bit of a learning curve.    The fill/drain capability looked appealing, but if you don't need to use this device to fill fluids, I would opt for the drain-only device - less moving parts, fewer things can fail 
 Harold Bloom, Yale University Don, paddles into religious-philosophy waters.  This book starts off soundly enough, but like many Stephen King novels, desintergrates into ravenous particles by the end.  His lip service to Augustine borders on insulting and is almost forgiven by his Gospel of Thomas section 
 This book is the story of the Coast Guard rescue swimmers, and some of the absolutely incredible situations they faced and overcame in their determination to save lives.  Chapter after chapter is one cliff-hanger after another, as these swimmers selflessly risked their own lives to save those of others they had never met.  Martha LaGuardia-Kotite has written a great book that I can highly recommend.  I could hardly put it down.            
 This collection of short stories begins with one about the title character, Lord Emsworth, a constantly befuddled old man who only wants to putter away his time if only his energetic relatives would let him.  Though not my favorite Emsworth saga, this one is excellently written and endlessly hilarious.  All the other stories are similarly well done, but they all begin to meld together somehow.  I would have preferred more variety in the approach.  If you read this (and you should!), I recommend one story at a time, and allow some good space between stories.  Use an episode perhaps as a palate cleanser between each of those long lugubrious novels you insist on reading.  That way you'll get the max out of the book, and every story will remain distinctive 
 Wonderful surprise.  I bought this CD based on one song I heard on the radio, ususally a mistake.  I am thoroughly enjoying the whole CD.  I will definitly buy more 
 The information on which I bought this disc was erroneous, I spent good money and was disappointed - The music is great, it's just I didn't get the version of the song (Moments in Love) that I expected.  Four stars.. 
 As someone who doesn't like to spend hours in the kitchen...and who is also a new Weight Watchers member...I can say that this is of great benefit to me.  The recipes that I've tried have been quick and non-complicated with good flavor.  The ingredients are all easily obtained at your local stores...no hunting for "exotic" spices or anything.  I'm glad I got it 
 Mike was always near and dear to me, back in his Dropkick days and I must say, when he left and Bruisers boy Al Barr took over, I never quite felt the same (though I continue to LOVE the Dropkick's and have everything they put out).  When Street Dogs came along, and I heard what they were laying down...I knew that what I'd been waiting for, for so long, had come around.  Once again, with this release, they do not fail to deliver the goods that never fails to reach right into me and touch me every time.  Let it also be said that I, as a US Marine, picked up a couple of extra copies of these and sent them back to my brothers who are still doing their duty in Iraq.  Lets them know that these boys carry them right in their hearts and souls, and it did the same for me.  I had the luxury of hearing it on US soil however, something that is priceless.  But this is something that Mike's been doing ever since day one, make no mistake about it.  I can't really express enough how much these boys mean to me, and to my brothers.  Just trying to piece together a few bumbling lines here on Amazon, but definitely want to tell you that if you're thinking about getting this, think no more.  Just get it, and you'll be glad you did 
 Another very funny movie with Sandra Bullock! In rehab, Gwennie finds friends, and oddball romance. Favorite part when she gets a diamond 
 This account of the life and times of William Dampier is refreshingly detailed.  The authors successfully described the 17th Century world in all of its gritty reality.  With these hard and unforgiving times as a backdrop, the reader can realize what Dampier was up against and how only an exquisite mind could accomplish what he did, under those circumstances.  I heartily recommend this read for anyone interested in seafaring in the 1600's. 
 For some people, it's the Bible.  For others, a book of philosophy.  For me, it was this.  The book was one of the most amazing, transforming experiences I've ever had.  Dr. King writes with an eloquence and passion that's a rare thing, perhaps once in a generation.  His words have the power to soothe, to inspire, and to challenge.    You read his words and you want to keep fighting.  Even if it seems impossible.  Even if the odds are stacked against you.  Dr. King reminds us of the best humanity has to offer.  That no matter how hard a road, if we believe, we will prevail.  That despite our dark periods we also have periods of amazing grace and peace.  Read this, and see what we can do. 
 THIS IS THE AUTHORS FIRST PUBLISHED WORKS AND IS WHAT BROUGHT HIM  HIS SUCCESS.  IT WAS READ ON NPR AND WAS INSTANTELY  A HIT.  THESE 2 PLAYS ARE HILIARIOUS.  THEY CAPTURE THE QUIRKY AND OUTLANDISH HUMOR THAT DAVID  SEDARIS IS SO WIDELY KNOWN FOR. IT IS A DEFINITE MUST READ.  YOU WILL ROLL  AND TUMBLE ON THE FLOOR WITH GIGGLES AFTER SUBMERGING IN THESE MOST  ENJOYABLE PLAYS 
 I read this book for a book report in 5th grade. I enjoyed as much as I enjoyed Ginger Pye. It was very entertaining. I think this book is mainly for grades 3-7 because its big and has some big words too. Loved this book overal 
 Bad Religion is the only band who cares (along with pennywise) about our world. This album is close to perfection. Obliterate your music collections and stop listening to green day, good charlotte, fall out boy etc and listen to PUNK ROCK AS IT SHOULD BE!  1. Change of ideas (Not really a song as its under a minute but pretty good) 4.5/5  2. Big Bang. Love this f***ing song so much. 5/5  3.No Control. Oh yeah what awesome lyrics. 5/5  4. Sometimes it feels like.States Exactly what i feel like most of the time when standing in line or talking to someone who isnt listening to me. 5/5  5.Automatic Man. Extremely furious and fast just the way we like it. 5/5  6. I want to conquer the world. If you havent heard this song then why are u here. Pick up the album now! 5/5  7.Sanity. This song grew on me. Could of been a single if they wanted to. 5/5  8. Henchman. Sorta sounds like automatic man, well same kinda theme but still 5/5  9.It must look pretty appealing. One of my fav songs on the album. Basically stating that what one person sees as good will be cool for you and so others follow leading to the construction of what we now know as the masses. 5/5  10. You. Probably the best punk rock song ever. 5/5  11. Progress. Great song catchy as well. 5/5  12. I want something more. How about alonger song this ones like 40 seconds but is very complex. 4.5/5  13. Anxiety. not much to say on this one. 4.7/5  14. Billy. Great tune. 5/5  15. The World wont stop. Without you. Love this track. 5/5  Ok so its short about 26 minutes but feels longer than Generator even though it aint but maybe thats because it has more songs. Whatever the case this is a CD that no punk rock fan should be without 
 I got XM with my new Honda  few years back and loved it.  I wanted something portable to take to beach and around...so I didn't miss Opie and Anthony.  This is it XM is great, every type of music you can imagine, sports, news and the best Opie and Anthony.  The sound on this is great and it has been going strong for quite a while  High recommend.  Frannnnnnnnnnnkus to you 
 The Golden retriever wakes up Fredericksburg, Virginia veterinarian Dr. Megan Ross.  She manages to gain some control of the frisky dog and reads the tag on the collar.  The canine's name is Baywatch and she lives at 17 Washington Avenue; her dad says that is the home of Sutter Foley, owner of Software Solutions, second perhaps to Microsoft on usage and profit.  Megan takes Baywatch to Sutter, but he denies having a dog though he recognizes that the mutt belonged to his former employee who he fired for selling things about him to the tabloids.  Sutter wants Megan to leave with Baywatch, but instead she believes he needs a dog to warm up his sterile lifestyle; she leaves Baywatch behind.  As they see one another due to the matchmaking Golden Retriever they fall in love.  However, he has lived as a hermit in spite of the media attention. Can he adapt to having a woman in his life permanently, which also means her father too.  On the other Megan has to adjust to suddenly becoming news worthy.  GUYS & DOGS is a fun contemporary romance starring two likable protagonists and a matchmaking canine.  The support cast including her dog and "his" new pet add humor. An instance is her dad's observation about his modern day hometown in which SF characters have replaced Revolutionary War heroes like GW as the town hero seems upside down.  Though the brilliant Sutter can be a bit thick when it comes to the heart, fans will be pleased with this fine romance between the vet and the internet.  Harriet Klausner  
 Just in time for one of the most divisive presidential elections in recent history, Mertus provides the reader with the thorough research necessary to make an informed decision about the future of our country, and our place in shaping human rights around the world.  As Mertus points out, the United States has long engaged in a double standard of human rights, with what is essentially a "do as I say, not as I do" attitude, and actions that demonstrate this attitude of global superiority.  That Mertus has meticulously researched her topic and conducted extensive interviews is not surprising:  It is the excellent standard that one has come to expect from Mertus.    
 I've been waiting for Oddisee to drop some sort of EP/LP with him being the main attraction, and here it is.  I've known Oddisee for a lil while now, mainly from his production side of things...but, he is an emcee/producer and not the other way around.  His lyrics go deeper than 85% of the emcees in the game today, no lie, no joke. I would also say that these Oddisee beats are so tight and different than anything you've ever heard.  His name wont be kept quiet for too much longer, cause talent like this deserves forefront attention.  Buy this cd if ur tired of the commercialized garbage that runs rap and listen to the other side of things 
 Wow. Awesome story about war. Makes war more real than anything you see on tv or read in the news. A very personal story.  Great psychological drama about the photographer and his conflicts 
 Every illustration in this book is a cartoon, and in many of the illustrations a cat, dog, lion, or some other animal will make some kind of random comment.  This was pretty funny, but not quite as funny as the cartoons in another Lets-Read-and-Find-Out Science book called Digging Up Dinosaurs.  According to this book, the sticky saliva in your mouth catches germs and prevents them from going inside your body to cause further damage.  I didn't know that.  Hope all the information is correct 
 I own 2 of these shirts; and for the price, they're great.  They're the perfect length for me, hitting just at the hip.  The material is thin and stretchy enought that they're easily layered with camisoles, long-sleeved shirts, etc., but it's not so thin that one MUST wear another layer.  They're really easy to wear and seem to be of decent quality 
 Charged with everything from homosexuality to hatred of his subject, Boswell gives us a great gift in this monumental work. What must be the greatest document of a friendship besides being a fine piece of biography and an important resource for social historians, The Life of Johnson should not be missed by any student of eighteenth-century English literature. Other than Johnson's literary opinions, you can learn about his days's thoughts on anxiety and religious doubts. So turn your TV off for a month and read a great book and become acquainted with some truly interesting and intellectual people 
 Quite candidly, Toby Rice Drews has made this book an ongoingly useful tool to keep around.  Each chapter is independent and helps one deal with the situation/crisis at hand, and yet I found it powerful to read the whole book in two days. I have tools now that truly help me regain control of my life with an alcoholic, both when he is drunk and also when he is moody between his drunken episodes.      This author is excellent.  I also wish she'd publish a book written for the alcoholic that addresses the psychological wounds he has inflicted on his family and gives him tools to accept what he has done and to change his actions.  And please I hope someone does a comparison of all volumes by T.R. Drews. I am anxious to reap all her wonderful help 
 From "Cast Your Fate to the Wind" to "Linus and Lucy," Guaraldi had a marvelous sound all his own. A great talent. It's a shame he died so young 
 Early in this book Dr. Wansink says that it is a book about the science of what makes people eat, but that it was not intended to be a new diet book.  Unfortunately his editors know that a new diet book is exactly what will sell.  The final result seems sort of a compromise.    The first part of each section talks about experimental results, of different kinds.  As a person who likes the weird things people do, I found these pretty interesting, and more than a little amusing.  Dr. Wansink clearly knows his stuff, and while a few results are mentioned repeatedly, there is a huge amount of research reviewed here.  The second part of each chapter tries to answer "How can I use this?"  Mentioning ways that people can counter (or exploit) our eating foibles to loose, instead of gain weight.  In a couple places (particularly towards the end of the book) these sections seem a bit duck-taped on.  They seem to reflect more the target demographic, rather than Dr. Wansink's area of specialty.  Occasional choppiness aside, I have to give the book 5 stars.  Why?  Because after dinner tonight we noticed we had twice as much leftover as we usually do.  Clearly something in this book has had an impact!  Maybe after a year of eating off our salad plates we'll have to go buy new "signal clothes" 
 The Garfield Fat Cat Masterpieces 2007 Wall Calendar is a great hit with cat lovers. Mimicking great Masterpieces of art, it is humorous, colorful and fun. I don't have a cat because I am not a cat lover (sorry, no offense to anyone) but I LOVE the Garfield calendar. It is a great gift and a wonderful  spacious calendar. It adds color to my office area and makes me smile when I look at it 
 This book is a MUST HAVE for anyone parenting a child, not only with attachment problems, but any child that has been neglected, abused or been in foster care. One chapter in particular has been a LIFESAVER for my family.  It lists the 7 stages of attachment that healthy kids go through. It give vignettes on kids in that stage. It gives parenting suggestions for parents in this stage, and a checklist to show when a child has mastered this stage and is ready to move on.  Our kids, in six months have made HUGE STRIDES with their attachment issues due ENTIRELY to this book. I used it to help them progress through the first two stages of attachment that were disrupted due to their foster placements. They are doing well and moving into stage 3.   EVERY ADOPTIVE PARENT OR PROSPECTIVE ADOPTIVE PARENT OR FOSTER PARENT MUST READ THIS BOOK!! 
 The electrifying speech that changed the hearts and minds of a bitterly divided nation. When 200,000 civil rights marchers - black and white - gathered at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on August 28, 1963, they expected to hear strong words from their spiritual leader, Martin Luther King. What they did not expect was a speech of such heartfelt passion and poetic eloquence that it echoes still in our memory. Incredibly powerful 
 A comprehensive, entertaining and plainly written introduction to critical thinking.  It should be in every school and public library (preferably next to the biology books that have been stickered with pro-creationist caveats).  My only complaint is the title. Perhaps it should have been called "The Critical Thinkers' Reference" so as not to confuse those poor mites who cannot differentiate between rational thought and Cartesian Skepticism.    Of course, if your world-view is not based on rational thinking and evidence, then the knowledge contained in this book may make you feel uncomfortable.  You may even feel threatened to the point that you negatively review it.  Guys - as Robert Park once said: "Alas, to wear the mantle of Galileo it is not enough that you be persecuted by an unkind establishment, you must also be right."   Please read this book (or even read the FAQ on Carroll's website) and learn how to reason.  
 In A HANDFUL OF DUST, Evelyn Waugh continues to poke at the rotten underside of British upper class immorality with some very sharp barbs, not all of which are satiric. With the publication of this book, Waugh was already well known as a man whose themes could not hide a bitter sense of despair that all was not right with post war Edwardian England. In DECLINE AND FALL and VILE BODIES, Waugh showed himself full of despair that England had lost its moral way, if not its moral compass. But with A HANDFUL OF DUST, he adds to this an anger towards unfaithful wives that is disturbing to read.  The novel begins, as so many of Waugh's other works, with a feckless young man who seems content to drift in life. Here it is John Beaver, who begins a friendship with Tony Last, a man who seems mired in the roots of his Victorian forebears. Last has a mansion that he prizes above all else, even over his lovely, but bored wife, Brenda. When Last invites Beaver to stay for a visit at his house, Brenda sees in Beaver an opportunity to cure her boredom. She quickly seduces Last. For the first half of the book, Waugh is content to play out the seeming harmlessness of the affair. Waugh's wit and satire are strangely muted, only because he uses Last, Beaver, and Brenda as ready targets as symbols for all that he saw as wrong with a jaded and irrelevant British upper class. However, in the second half, with the death of Brenda's young son in a riding accident, Waugh sharpens his bite so that what he writes is less satire than a howl of existential bile both at a cuckold who refuses to see what is right in front of his nose and at a wife and mother who cares less about the fate of her dead son and more about continuing her affair. Such bitterness had been lacking in his earlier novels. By the end of the novel, Waugh returns to his previous level of acrimony with the weird fate of Tony Last who is doomed to recite the novels of Charles Dickens to a madman in a Brazilian jungle.  The reader feels a conflict with the inharmonious flow of satire and irony. Waugh lambasts an entire generation of Bright Young Things, none of whom are as bright as they imagine, but all are doomed to play out their lives in a universe devoid of meaning. A fitting end is the endless repetition of Dickens sounding and resounding in some tiny mudball of a hut for the gratification of a lunatic who may be more sane than most of the novel's other characters. This formless buzzing of noise is what is left after a handful of dust disappears in the breeze 
 In the wake of the 9/11 disaster a plethora of books has been published on the nature and structure of the terrorist threat. Some are quite good, but others are absolute nonsense. Interestingly, some of the best books on both terrorism and counter-terrorism predate 9/11 and were written before counter-terrorism became the cottage industry it is today.   This book by Bruce Hoffman in cooperation with the Rand Corporation was published in 1998 and remains one of the best books available on the nature of terrorism. Hoffman provides a useful and on the whole an accurate explanation of the differences between secular, religious, transnational, and state sponsored terrorism providing useful examples of each. He also provides a good deal of probably accurate information on terrorist motivations and operational procedures. Finally he was prescient enough to recognize that the phenomenon represented by Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda represent an ideological movement rather than a structured organization. After four years of the so-called, `Global War on Terrorism' this fact is slowly sinking into U.S. Government circles. Hoffman only lightly touches on the related issue of the al Qaeda financial structures, but notes the relatively small amounts of money actually required for most terrorist operations.  As indicated Hoffman does not limit this book to Islamic religious terrorism but also delves into motivations and operations techniques of secular terrorism as well. Perhaps most importantly given the July 2006 Near-East crisis, he uses Hezbollah as an example of the dangerous nature of state sponsored terrorism. All in all a sound book that contains markedly better information on terrorism than many more recent books and reflects the fruits of sound scholarship.  
 Clay Walker issues his sixth studio album and seventh overall with "Say No More" and it seems the material is more of a bittersweet nature than that found on his previous effort "Live, Laugh, Love."  "She's Easy to Hold" is the most traditional sounding of the 11 cuts on this album.  Walker's cover of "La Bamba" is excellent.  The title track, "Say No More", is a bittersweet tale of a woman who wants to end a relationship but she doesn't want to hurt the man's feelings.  He knows what she's been pondering so he tells her to "say no more" as he wants to make it easier on both her and himself.  "Cound I Ask You Not to Dance" is sort of along the same lines as the aforementioned track.  The man is heartbroken and seeing his ex having a good time is hard on him so he wants her to hold off her dancing activities until he's left.  "I Love It" is about a man who is in love with a not so conservative woman.  "Real" is the kind of ballad you would expect from Walker and it's probably my favorite song on the album along with the title track.  "You Deliver Me" is another ballad that finds Walker putting all his heart and passion into the vocals.  This is a great album and don't be discouraged by the fact that Byron Gallimore (helped produce the not-so-country Faith Hill album "Breathe") is one of the producers on this record discourage anybody from giving this album a listen because it's excellent 
 It's hard for me to add anything to the previous illustrious reviews of this excellent book.  But the pettifogging comments by a previous reviewer and countered by the author, long after publication, leaves me with one question.  When any creator puts as much research, time, and dedication into an historical novel such as this (as well as this author's previous Jack Frake volume) why not share his labors with us?  He should structure his historical fiction similar to an historical non-fiction treatise.  This would include the following: Table of contents Maps, diagrams, scenery, etc. along with tables to each Footnotes or endnotes Index Bibliography Suggested reading  Cline puts more information and energy in his novels than any four university professors combined plunk into their college textbooks so why not let us marvel at his achievement as well as encourage us to pursue our interest in this time period by documenting the work leading up to its completion?  This is not directed at this author specifically but to the entire genre of great historical novelists.   While I'm not suggesting that the critical reviewer is wrong (or right)-the author could have let his readers decide by providing them, in the novel, with the necessary tools to judge for themselves 
 This book is definitely the "Part 2" of a series that begoins with Didion's "Slouching Towards Bethlehem" and each time that i return to it I feel like I am sitting down with a dear friend that I haven't talked to in a while. Other reviewers seem to have covered the title piece quite well, but I am intrigued that nobody seems to have mentioned my favorite -"Holy Water"- a fascinating look behind the scenes at the California Water Authority. I assign this essay again and again to my environmentalist students, both for the immediate content and for the intriguing window into the seductive nature of technology -one feels that Didion comes to be horrified and walks away enthralled. You will be too 
 The book " Report to the Principal's Office," was in my opinion, a very good book.  It has a mix of humor, mystery, and adventure.  It's about a book named Eddie Mott, a girl named Salem Brownmiller, a new school principal, a total crouch named Sunny, and the famous "Pickles" Johnson.  They all go to the new school Plumsted High.  Plumsted has all the latest technology, such as an air conditioner, surveillance cameras, and a P.A. system.  They have to face bullies, the principal, and a whole school band concert, while trying to find a hamster.  The hamster is the new school mascot. The people that like any books by Louis Sachar or Jerry Spenelli will like this book a lot.  My favorite part of the book was when the hamster came back.  You have to read it to understand why. 
 The Wedding Crashers is one of the modern breed of rom-coms (along with Hitch) that actually appeals to men as well as women. The formula is simple, amuse the guys by showing the male lead as a chauvenistic womaniser, then please the chicks by having him turn into the gushing romantic hero who falls for the female star. It basically means juvenile toilet humour for the first half of the film before the transition into unrealistic gushing soppy romance that never actually happens in real life in the second half. I enjoyed it, but it does get a bit sappy towards the end 
 I found this book an excellent companion to earlier books on the subject (McNeill, Crosby), as it puts diseases in human society in a historic social/cultural and political context. I started out sceptical but then got  caught by the book and its analyis was for me an eye-opener on how  (Western) medicine was a tool often used for ends that had nothing to do  with physical well-being, sickness prevention and care. The end conclusions  on economics and health economics i do not share at all, i think the author  gets carried away a bit and goes way too fast to condemn economists here,  (guess what my profession is). Definitely worth while 
 New England captivity narratives---accounts by those early Americans who had been captured by Indians or French raiders and later ransomed or escaped their captivity---have become recently popular among historians and literary studies scholars for the information they contain about gender. The prevailing image of the captive is that of a young woman. Several of these women remained with their captors despite the payment of ransom and the pressures of their families to return to America because they found in French Catholic Canada empowerment denied them in Puritan America. Despite the stereotype, Bill Foster has found that boys and men constituted more than 80% of those taken from 1675-1763. Bill's discovery and scholarship significantly and importantly opens up the gender discussion for early American history because these Puritan men found themselves working for and taking orders from French and former American Catholic women many of whom were quite young. This condition the men found shameful and degrading and only a handful became assimilated to the French Catholic culture. Those who returned frequently would not name their captor because of the shame of having been bossed by a woman. Bill's research in the archives in Canada and the U.S. sheds new light on these highly prejudiced male captivity narratives. 
 One only needs to take a stroll through the campuses of major universities to sense that something is a bit awry these days:  Football coaches making half a million dollars a year while humanities department budgets are slashed should make any one with an academic conscience grow suspicious that corporate powers are calling the shots.  Soley does a superior job of providing ample evidence of big money influence on the curriculums of universities and how professors are farmed out to testify for tobacco companies, etc. and making hefty sums in the process.  This is a MUST READ for anyone who cares about the future of education and wants to take it out of the hands of the corporate powers.  Jaye Beldo: netnous@aol.co 
 Thich Nhat Hanh is my very favorite author and this is one of his very best books. It really shows you how you can effect everyone around you by your own "Being Peace". If everyone read this book, the world would be a much, much better place. 
 a little to simple and the projects are somewhat uninteresting.  but, it does give a good jumping point for glass fusing and it is very easy to read 
 American pop is one of the best animated movies ever. It tells the story of american music the characters stand out in a real way. The animation is great with the ww1 ww2 and prohibhittion being key parts for every gain something is lost the people change but the goal is the same for each generation. The 60s and 70s are shown to be dark and creepy. Great animation soundtrack and realistic story 
 Ok, I'm first, I lead off with that I love this band, I don't think they can be beat in todays music market, lots of energy, great song writing ability, masters of their insturments and they seem to really like each other, that's important, I loved the selection of songs and the home town crowd had them fired up, the sound?, well the guitars, fiddles and all came through like a champ! but the vocals, now I think Willy Braun is one of the best, I think he could sing just about anything and do a first class job of it, my gripe is, who mixed the vocal mike?, it sounds like it is at half volume, Willie's voice is drowned out by the band most of the time,If I didn't know the words to some songs already it would have been worse, I made changes to my set up and could only improve it a little, how could this error, that sticks out like a sore thumb, get passed over?, very disapointing. The video came through very strong, my hats off the the camera men, good job! I wish I could give this 5 stars, but I can't, this error ruins it. #2, well the recording of "Revolution" is the best I've ever heard!, man, it drives! it cooks!, Willy is at his best!, but David, man, you must have "blisters on your fingers!", your axe is on fire!, Lennon would have loved this!, why?, because it is real rock and roll!, this band is the tightest of any I've heard since the golden age, the 60's and early 70's, keep it up 
 The author begins with plausible thought experiments that build to explain how common motors work. The remainder of the book is a large compendium of common circuits (both old and modern) used to control various motor types. His analysis of some designs were a bit oddly explained (but my background is RF and microwave design, not power electronics). I get something new and revealing every time I open the pages 
 Douglas Stone demonstrates great awareness of the subject matter. He states the principles and then illustrates them with powerful examples. He made me think of my own approach in difficult conversations. The person who buys this book will not regret the purchase 
 In real life (correct me if I am wrong), I thought that drag queens only dress as women to perform. This movie has the "ladies" in face 24/7. Wouldn't that make them more like transexuals? Other than this confusing item, I thought the movie itself was quite good. There were a few cheesy scenes, but overall the writing and funny lines more than made up for any flaws 
 I adore Catherine Breillat's films, and I believe this to be her best work.  Why do I love her so much?  She challenges me, she entralls me, she makes me think, she takes sex seriously.  Her films polarize, her films enrage people, but it's the good kind of polarization.  None of her films are done for shock value.  This is my favorite among her work.  The performances are superb, especially that of Rocco Siffredi, who is a real porn star in Italy.  Breillat cast him because he was unafraid of the part, and she also added that "most French actors aren't very handsome".  He acquits himself quite well, and shows that a porn star can act.  More often than not, porn stars are terrible actors, as porn doesn't require any emotions, just stamina.  Breillat understands the true complexity of relationships, and it unnerves people.  If she wanted me to do a nude scene, I'd do it.  I wouldn't ask her about it.  Full frontal.  She is a great artist, and one of the greatest filmmakers working today.  
 I read, A LOT of books, especially about parenting.  This book is the best one I have read, and every parent needs to read it.  First of all, it is wonderful to read a book that helps you believe in yourself, instead of the author's "method".  Secondly, it shows you how to make room for the Holy Spirit to work in your own individual family, it's not a generic method of legalistic rules.  Thirdly, it brings up the discussion of interupting scripture, which more people need to do for themself, instead of following church tradition.  I was a spanker, (I just thought it was the "Christian" thing to do!) and it was breaking my heart, and my children were becoming distanced from me.  Now my heart and home has more peace and joy, thanks to the wisdom from Mr. Clarkson.  I am planning on giving this book to everyone I know who has a baby, and am recommending it to everyone 
 I will make this review as short and to the point as possible.... The Harrington on Hold'em series: Volumes 1-3 are the best books written on the subject of no limit texas hold'em touraments to date. Plain and simple!   If you want to improve your tourament game, these books will do it. I own most of the books on the subject, from Doyle's SuperSystem to Sklansky's No Limit Hold 'em: Theory and Practice. In my opinion, Harrington on Hold'em alone tops them all...I originaly bought the book because of all the great reviews it recieved on amazon and in the poker community and I figured I would give it a shot.   I was sceptical at first, Harrington is a little tighter then I am used to playing, but after reading this book for only 5 minutes I knew that this was so different then any other hold'em book I have read. I was always pretty good at tourements and I am a firm believer that exeprience is the best practice, but soon after finishing the first 2 books, I have been CONSISTANT in cashing in big live events.   Being Consistant in hold'em is what you want to be. I play in live tourements weekly ranging from 40-400 people at NY underground poker rooms,(which in my opinion is the HARDEST and TOUGHEST FIELD TO DOMINATE, and coincidently where harrington starting his poker carrer) Foxwoods and Atlantic City and out of the last 20 times I played after reading these books I have cashed 16 out of the 20 times. Out of the 16, I came in 1st five times, and came in 2nd three times.... Like I said, I was pretty good before reading these books, but now, APPLYING the knowlege in these books I am so much better then I ever was. Understanding and applying the knowlege in these books is key to winning in touraments 
 Baby Boy is a good movie to me. I think the stars of baby boy was the R&B Singer/Actor Tyrese Gibson,Taraji P. Henson,Omar Gooding,Tamara LaSeon Bass,Candy Ann Brown,A.J. Johnson,Ving Rhames,Snoop Dogg,Angell Conwell,Kareem J. Grimes and Mo'Nique did a very good job on this movie. I think the director/writer John Singleton did a very good job on doing the movie too. The movie is a ghetto and street movie too.        
 I enjoy Nancy Friday's perspective on things but it seems that this book is reflective of a yearning to be externally acknowledged. Better off reading Transcendent Beauty by Crystal Andrus 
 This movie was even better than the first which was so cool and i gave both  5 stars And the 3rd is even bette 
 This pen is really great, once you accustom yourself to writing with it.  My only question is, how on earth do you open it to install the refill 
 Smart, concise, comprehensive, and inexpensive.  Having read dozens of baby and newborn books, I would place this at the top of the list.  -Ric 
 Jon Kabbot Zin has the unbelievable ease of describing how to change your entire self in a reading. If you follow his perfect translation of Zen and Buddhism you can apply immediately to everyday life. I owe him a great thank you for saving my self!! 
 Award-winning author an Professor of Communication Randall Bytwerk presents Bending Spines: The Propagandas Of Nazi Germany And The German Democratic Republic, a scholarly close study that strives to answer a larger question: why do totalitarian propagandas such as those created in Nazi Germany and the former German Democratic Republic succeed so well in the short term, yet fail in the long term? Examining in-depth the litany of persuasive techniques used by the regimes, and ultimately concluding that the government expected more of propaganda than it was able to deliver, Bending Spines leaves no word unturned in its search to comprehend what truth moves and manipulates human hearts and minds. A sober, meticulous dissection of the lessons of history. 
 Larry Diamond, professor at Stanford and friend of Condaleeza Rice, had studied, observed, and assisted democracy-building efforts in 20 countries over two decades prior her asking him to help in Iraq. His book relates subsequent democracy-building efforts (in overly long detail), and a litany of already reported mostly Pentagon blunders that have undermined success.   Retired General Garner was the initial choice to lead post-war efforts. Unfortunately he was hampered by Pentagon vetoing his key choices for assistants that had good Iraq background and skills. General Garner thought the U.S. would be out in six months. While Garner did relate well to the Kurds (had worked with them previously), his knowledge and interest in the rest of Iraq was limited, and he soon was replaced by Paul Bremer.   Soon after arrival, Bremer ended plans for a quick turnover (per White House), angering Iraqis and damaging U.S. credibility. He then disbanded Iraq's army, and removed senior Baathist members (30-50,000) from government. Both caused immediate, serious and lasting anger, and helped "underwrite" strong resistance. Bremer then ignored Ayatollah Sistani's call for an elected body to create Iraq's new constitution - reportedly because concerned that early elections would be dominated by better organized radicals, and would suffer from lacking adequate voter rolls, supervision, etc. Next began squabbling with the U.N. over who had what power vs. elections.   Diamond's efforts soon began communicating information about democracy. Nationwide dialogs, facilitated by 500-600 Iraqis, took place - asking Iraqis what they wanted to accomplish. Translations of Federalist papers, Martin Luther King speeches, etc. were also arranged for. Unfortunately, the effort was hampered by conflicts with Islam over the role of women, and families issues, as well as the underlying jockeying between Shiite, Sunni, and Kurd ethnic groups.   Reading through Diamond's accounts of these democratizing efforts I was struck by the idiocy of it all - attempting such an effort while basic societal requirements for security and utilities were increasingly unmet. Diamond, however, held his similar thoughts until the end of the book. There he unhappily concluded that the widespread and serious post-war problems in Iraq have ironically become justification for neighboring regimes to insist that their culture and politics similarly are not ready for democracy.   Mistakes made including giving post-war control to the Pentagon despite obvious early errors - eg. allowing looting of all government offices EXCEPT the oil ministry (we're after their oil; Rumsfeld's response - "stuff happens"), disbanding the army, not insuring early and adequate payment of police, etc., not enough troops (resulting in leaving the borders open), over-estimating the popularity of returning exiles (eg. Chalabi), failure to protect/destroy weapons caches, early failure to recognize Sistani's importance, initial failure to recognize the need for including Sunni's, unarmored vehicles, indecisiveness in handling Sadr, delaying elections, and using some ludicrously inadequate personnel (very young individuals in way over their heads). Overall, Diamond concluded that our efforts equated to "criminal negligence."   Conclusions: 1)A democratic state cannot be built unless one first provides state security. 2)The long-term outcome in Iraq is uncertain. 3)Diamond probably will not be invited to the White House or back to Iraq. 
 I was a little apprehensive about these Waveceptor watches after reading reviews for them.  Common complaints included scratches on the face, atomic synching problems, and difficulty setting up the watch for the first time.  I received my watch and it was in perfect condition, no scratches, light or otherwise.  It is light but the construction feels solid.  I was wondering what the initial setup was going to be like, since others had claimed it had taken hours(!!!).  It literally took me 15 seconds.  It involves holding a button down for 5 seconds, and pressing the other button a few times.  Once it was set up, the watch immediately synched itself to my local time with no problems at all  (I live in central Florida.)  I've only owned the watch for a day now and I must say I'm impressed with it so far.  I haven't experienced any troubles mentioned in the other reviews, and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  Also, I chose the Super Saver shipping, Amazon told me it'd take 3 weeks to get it to me.  I received it in 4 days 
 And simply magical for people of any age. I saw this movie as a child and it still stands up as the masterpeice it was at that time 
 This bra is exactly like the ones I usually get at the department store in the mall.  The quality is great.  The best part about it, I didn't have to fight for a parking space or through the crowds to get it.  
 After years of dealing with the rap today we need to turn our attention directly to masterpiece albums like this one. In 2003 I just couldn't take anymore and if 03 wasn't enough then 05 and 06 is definitely going to do it for the rest of my generation except for the mindless ones. I went out and bought every album I could and I don't call it Old School I call it Real hip hop. Paid in Full is one of the best albums I have in my collection and I see why Nas loves Rakim. If you ask me it's in the top 5 greatest albums of all time. The production is perfect and it helps present the perfect blend of lyrics and beats that go hand and hand together. Rakim is nothing short of classic and neither is Eric B.. It's an album that anyone that considers themself a true hip hop head must have and anyone that is a collector of essential music should study it. If anyone has a top 5 greatest rappers of all time without Rakim then they can't honestly say they've heard Paid In Full 
 BEP - Just Go For It! Fergie is the super Best with her vocals in 'Shut Up' and this one is ever my fav. An essential Hip Hop numbers to rock you, go romp on the floor. An electrifying, tapping tracks, Elephunk brings in the sitar, flute and an Indian vocalist for the famous 'Bhangra style' in Elephunk theme. Hey Mama has great vocals with background music to soothe the soul. Smells like Funk is a silly song I feel. Let's Get Retarded is uh oh and can warm up for the party. Anxiety is too rock. The principle of BEP seems to be entertainment, whatever the music be and that's why I love BEP - more into music magic of listening and swaying around - Have Fun 
 Fanon really draws you in with this book. One feels involved with Fanon's fight not just against racism and colonization, but also his own self evaluation and struggle within himself to accept himself for who he is.  Among other things, what struck me the most was the way Fanon showed that minorities do not feel inferior because they were thrust in the midst of a majority. Considering that South Africa has minority white population and yet the black population there took on the brunt of racism and that had nothing to do with the minority subjugation.  Another line of thought that Fanon brings about is the domination of the colonized language. In Martinique, the average middle class family would insist children to speak French like the French would and not the commonly spoken Creole. The Martinican returning from France was expected to uphold that standard and speak proper French. If he reverted to his old ways of speaking, it was looked down upon. Fanon shows that the black man of Martinique maintains locked in his own cultural impositions and unless that is shed it would make it difficult for him to rise out of it.  Fanon brings about how the psychological impact of colonization through language, culture and history plays on the black man. Fanon delves into studies done by others and compares or rejects ideas put forth by them either with by presenting his own experiences or a generalistic view of the colonized Martinique land.  Fanon digresses frequently from topics of discussion and jumps around wildly in some of the chapters. But overall the book is well written and makes you think and begs you to put your own experience and thought into it 
 I  AM TRULY ASTOUNDED TO SEE THIS TREASURE FOR SALE FOR SUCH A LOW PRICE.. WHAT IS WRONG? THIS IS SUCH A TALENTED ARTIST, AND IF YOU ARE A NEO-SOUL BUFF, YOU DEFINITELY ARE MISSING OUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE DON-E IN YOUR COLLECTION. IN A TIME WHERE TRUE TALENT AND REAL MUSIC,LET ALONE LYRICS THAT ACTUALLY MEAN SOMETHING,ARE HARD TO FIND I SUGGEST THAT YOU JUMP ON THIS IMMEDIATELY.... YOU WILL BE SO GLAD YOU DID....

 I haven't found a book on eczema like this one!  It answered all my questions (what causes it, how one gets it, what works, what doesn't work, etc).  And it did so in a clear, easy-to-read way.  Even the scientific chapters on skin anatomy and biology were fascinating.  More than educating me about eczema, the book made me better able to get the most out of my visit to the doctor's office, where there just isn't the time to go into all the detail found here.  After reading this book, I knew enough to ask the right questions in the office, and got the help I needed without feeling like I was wasting a visit. I'm telling all my friends about this book, so they can share it with anyone who has eczema 
 How wonderful to read about the emotions of what is sometimes considered to be "deviant" love.  I believe they would each be honored to know that their true relationship is public and, for the most part, that  people are touched by their genuine caring for each other.  I highly  recommend this book, especially for those people who find it hard to  understand relationships between same-sex couples 
 ...I bought this book for my 7-year-old twins, who arehome-schooled.  The book's reading level is appropriate for end offirst grade or beginning of second grade.  They LOVED this book!Their favorite story was the Worm story, which STILL sends them intoconvulsions of laughter whenever they hear it.  The book has also beenthe basis of discussion about intolerance, moving on the the face ofloss, appeasing others to make them feel good, and other topics.  Allin all, the book was absolutely worth the price 
 I like Jane Austen, but this is a very special book, even for her.  When I was widowed a few years ago, I read Persuasion.  Lots or people here love this book, but it holds a special place in my life because it gave me the will to go on. We live in a youth-oriented culture which tries to tell people that only the young, the rich and the beautiful have a right to love and happiness; this book says that all people can have a second chance at happiness. Persuasion taught me that the pain over losing the one you love does not have to end your life.  You can start again, and perhaps be even happier than you were the first time around, when you were young and didn't know what life was about. I know some people prefer the dashing heroes in Austen's other books, but Anne and Captain Wentworth are much closer to who most of us are. We are not flashy or rich; we don't always have supportive families; our beauty might only be seen by the people who love us the most because they've looked in our hearts. Love will not bring us land or access to the powerful, and it won't make our families act more kindly to us.  But what love does is act as a shelter from the storms of life- death, sickness, insensitive people.  While women now have more freedom to love than they did in the early 19th century, they are still hampered by unrealistic ideas regarding how the mind and body ages, the value of maturity, how having 'baggage' can be a sign that one has been places and seen things, and how common sense and human decency may be more important in the long run than beauty or good fashion sense. Most women are still afraid to be alone with themselves or to carve out a satisfying life without a man. Because most women and men don't value these concepts, Persuasion is not ranked as highly as Austen's more exciting earlier novels.  Still, if I could only take one book with me to a desert island, this would probably be the one 
 John Rhoton has taken an otherwise poorly understood set of protocols and explained them simply and sensibly.  This is a great book to start anybody down the road of Internet mail 
 This volume is a useful source for the anthropological study of religion. Glazier includes valuable contributions dealing with a variety of topics of interest to anthropologists. Especially noteworthy is the section on ritual. Highly recommended 
 One of the few authentic and thorough book of instructions in Jin Shin Jyutsu. Line illustrations through out, easy to understand.  Quality of paper book is made of is poor 
 I came here speak no English. I learn English from just this book. I can read and write English. Very good book. I thank author

Morever in my real life ....through this book ... i came to know how to find trust relationships ...in our day to day world. I mean i came to know whom to trust and whom not to .  Special thanks to author for making such a great book.. 
 Just discovered this author with this book.  Held my attention, provided humor, suspense and entertainment.  The author's story is imaginative and the story line is just complicated enough to hold the reader's attention while not befuddling him.  I look forward to reading another in the series 
 I first picked up "The Story of English" when I was in my mid-teens, and its a testament to its quality that I can still vividly recall the glee with which I turned each page of this invaluable tome. It is chock full of information about the origins and evolution of the English language, all the while providing the reader with scads of concurrent historical information about the various cultures which have been touched by this most unusual tongue. The illustrations make the experience as visually pleasing as it is intellectually stimulating, and the prose style is such that one feels entertained even while being informed on a subject that could just as easily be rendered esoteric and boring. Regardless of your normal interests, I cannot imagine that anyone would not be swept away by this book 
  "I Was A Rat" is about a boy who finds a couple to live with and insists he is a rat. But soon he causes tons of  comotion in his home town new york. Hes really not sure who he is and then finds out he really is not a rat and ends up getting a big surprise.   "I Was A Rat" was an awesome book because....It taught me to always believe in my heart. But some times it can cause catastrophies. I really loved everything about this book!It was funny,sad and surprising. I think anybody who reads this book is sure to love it.Well at least I did! If i could give this book a ten I would. Sarah 
 Whatever your interest area is, related to perception, of course, here you can find a very complete guide to visual perception; not very simple, neither too deep, just what you need for becoming almost an expert in a  short time 
 Along with Gioia and Kennedy's "An Introduction to Poetry," "From Totems to Hip Hop" is the best poetry anthology I have encountered.  It features accessible yet beautiful work from a great range of poetic voices--from long canonized voices like TS Eliot and Robert Frost to gifted rappers like 2Pac or the members of Dead Prez--arranged in very useful categories, such as "Nature and Place," "Men & Women," "Family," "Politics," "Heroes ..." and "Manifestos."  Editor Ishmael Reed, whose literary and extra-literary efforts have been devoted to rethinking things such as "the American literary canon" through a multiculturalist lens--the man who once wrote "I've published writers I've had fistfights with.  As long as they can write"--has presented a truly democratic collection of twentieth and twenty-first century poetics.  Reed does not practice hero worship here either.  He places a poem by Joan Self (the rich and rhythmic "Quill Holler Waller"), a former student of his at UC Berkeley, right next to Anne Sexton's "The Truth the Dead Know."  Reed also includes one of my favorite, neglected Langston Hughes poems, "Advertisement for the Waldorf-Astoria," as well as the lyrics for Leiber & Stoller's "Searchin'" and poems by underrepresented "black Beat" poets Ted Joans and Bob Kaufman (interestingly enough, no Allen Ginsberg poems are in this collection).  If this book starts entering high school and college classrooms, as it should, perhaps poetry will leave its throne in the academy and return to the public discourse 
 Bailey White's amusing stories supplied a quick and satisfying read.  The humor and insight into life made me laugh and think.  Some of the more poignant stories still echo in my mind. The voice created by White for  these stories is real and it brings her characters and adventures to life 
 Model-turned-singer Cassie hasn't proved much of her oft-discussed singing abilities on a live stage thus far, but her debut album Cassie holds its own nevertheless.  Sure, on record her voice isn't anything revolutionary and she's hardly going to be charting into diva territory any time soon, but she pulls off the breathy babydoll coo.  Let's admit it, it's not her singing that makes this record as listenable and likable as it is--it's producer Ryan Leslie's great beats and samples.  Like Paris Hilton's surprisingly charming debut, Cassie's contains some of the best production heard in awhile.  The R&B song of the summer "Me & U" is perfection-in-song-form, with its sexy four-note intro and whispered, simpering vocals that just drip sexuality.  Current smash "Long Way 2 Go" is one of the most musically-daring tracks on the album and Cassie shows she can deliver vocally (at least on record) if given the right material.  "Not With You" is lovely and "What Do U Want," "Miss Your Touch" and "About Time" show Ryan Leslie in his element.  Despite the controversy surrounding Cassie's true ability to sing, her debut disc remains one slick piece of R&B with some guilty pleasures 
 I just heard one of the authors on talk radio out here and must say that I was blown away by the amount of money sprawl costs every year.  Just making a list of the items that tap into our tax dollars is staggering: schools, highways, sewers, electricity, water.  And if you watch a new housing development going into the desert, this fact is so obvious---much of the bill must be paid by all the rest of us, how else could they afford all those big costs.  So I know the argument for sprawl is that if we didn't have it, housing prices would go through the roof.  But one sensible point this author made is that with a very limited change in the way we live, would result in a massive savings to our government spending.  So I hope people will listen to this message cause it seems to make sense to me.  Looking forward to reading the book, and I hope government officials will as well. 
 I was looking for a David Bowie CD when I discovered Mm.  the clerk was playing it on the store radio, and I instantly asked him what it was.  It tok me a while to track down the CD, however, since they didn't carry it and the place he bought it online didn't carry it anymore.  However, 'Don't Be Afraid, You Have Just Got Your Eyes Closed' kept running through my mind. As I was cleaning out my wallet I found the note he (the clerk) had written for me, and somehow, amid the reciepts and gum wrappers it was clean and freshly folded.  It seemed like one of those moments when the camera zooms in and the edges blur, (there's a word for that, I know there is) and I plucked it up.  Amazon had it, so I bought it, and every time I listen to it I'm placed in a psudo-mystical mood of remembering.   It doesn't seem real or out of place, but more like a childhood memory of a Saturday morning cartoon you can see in your head but not clearly enough to remember what it is.  It the moment you realize rain is made of thousands of millions of little drops, but at the same time you forget it's water. When my mind is busy and I need to unwind, I play this.  It mellows me in a way only a fat cat purring on your lap can do 
 I really was happy to find these books by Robin Hobb I have really enjoyed all 9 books. 
 Been using the BAR388HGA-BK for about a month, now.  Appears to be very accurate for both temp and humidity.  Really helps in calibrating our whole house humidifier (who's hygrometer is way off).  Automatic atomic clock is cool, too.  Highly recommend 
 How can a book about a girl chess grandmaster be a pot boiling page-turner?  I can only marvel at the completely unique talent Tevis displays in this book.  I have never read anything even remotely like it. I am an avid reader, but I rarely read a book more than once. I read this book three times and may read it several times again. Anyone who has even a passing knowledge of chess (which is all I have) will not be able to stop reading this masterpiece after the first few pages 
 Finally this book is back in print.  I read a friend's hardback copy, thinking the paperback would be out in a year or two.  That was over five years ago. I was introduced to Micky Knight when I picked up a mass market copy of THE INTERSECTION OF LAW AND DESIRE about ten years ago and looked for more books.  Since the first two books were out of print, I waited for the next book in the series. This excellent book about mothers and daughters kept me reading until my eyes wouldn't stay open.  I finished it the following morning.  Micky Knight has been described as "hard-boiled" by some reviewers, but I think that tough-veneered is a better description.  In fact, she is extremely vulnerable.  what I like most about Micky is that she doesn't just tackle ordinary crimes and shoot people and kick butt.  Yes she does shoot a time or two, but it is usually not an easy thing for her and is almost always in self-defense and when she kicks butt, she doesn't bother to take names. Without giving away the plot, let me say this book is about daughters looking for their mothers -- including Micky. Redmann writes complex plots and well-developed characters.  There is a cast of friends beginning with Micky's lover Cordelia, and her ex-lover assistant DA Danielle Clayton (and her life-partner, Elly)  Police Sargent Joanne Ranson and her life-partner Alex, Micky's cousin drag-queen Torbin and his life-mate Andy.  We were introduced to them in the first of four mysteries and we learn a little more about them as the series progresses.  There are some less likeable recurring characters, especially Micky's Aunt Greta and her despised cousin Bayard. Micky Knight is a complex, usually likeable woman who cares deeply about others.  If you haven't already read this book,do so.  And read the three other Micky Knight books.  
 A wonderful story of how even our smallest action can have great consequences that we can't even understand.  A long book with fantastic memorable characters.  My favorite of these characters were the two brothers who were fixated on Serial killers and natural disasters.  This is the only way they know how to cope with the outside world.    Overall-You will certainly get your money's worth.  Enjoy this one.  
 Overall very interesting and nice historical book even though the POV's shift rather awkwardly and seem disjointed at times.  The book also provides a good narration of the competition between the Cuban and American meteorological services.    The only part that annoys me is the parts of narration that are sensationalist.  A storm is not a living breathing entity and does not have a mind of its own.  Yet the storm of 1900 is constantly described as "having Galveston in its sights" and there is even one point where it is described as "hunting children".  Please Mr. Larson if you ever do a book like this again just still to the facts and the first hand accounts.  That's all any of us really want.   
 The first album of Glenn Frey after the break up of the Eagles. Excellent Piece and I've been looking for this on CD for a long time now. Thanks Amazon.com 
 Joseph Campbell knows his subject, mythology and religious stories, so well that you can tell it has become instinctual for him to tie all the world's imagery and symbology together in a way that connects human beings in a truly transcendent way. This book clarifies how similar we all really are, at the core of our beings, despite where we live and in what millenia we are living in. So full of rich, thought-provoking conversation, I would recommend this to everyone, from young to old. It is just an awesome book that makes you fall in love with humans and human nature -- bad and good alike. 
 i loved Try because it encompasses both the world of the heart and libido and the world of work and solitude in ways that feel really authentic to me and that connected me with places and situations totally new to me. Burana writes so convincingly of the desire for another person and desire for our own inspiration and energy for work and the self-focus that demands - those are both totally real to me and she totally makes the dynamic work in Daryl's narration.   And so I totally trusted and was captivated by everything else - the rodeo scenes, straight and gay, the working with horses, the bar scenes, the weather: Try spills over with detail that makes it hum with life.  And here's why to read it and love it - not only beautifully written with authentic characters and vivid situations, but totally and completely hot on the relationship front. Hot, hot, hot 
 One of the best things about this film is found in the details. When Judd Hirsch, as the patriarch of a family constantly on the run from the FBI, throws a couple of vegetables to his son played by River Phoenix, the director, Sidney Lumet, doesn't use that old cut trick--one hand throwing, another hand catching. He actually has River catch the stuff that's thrown to him. When River plays the piano, Lumet doesn't cut away from the keyboard to show the actor's face, then cut again to the sight of hands playing. He shows River playing the piano. It's a real pity River's not here anymore. He had gallons of talent.  This is a film whose emotional base is rock solid because the characters are flesh and blood, with real feelings--warmth, dignity, fear, and hope--that give the story tremendous depth and substance.   One sidenote of interest. The young actor who plays the younger son in the family, Jonas Abry, was coached for this film by my mother who is a children's acting coach. (He does a great job, if I do say so myself!)  Everyone in the cast is fine, but the two standouts are River Phoenix and Christine Lahti. As Judd Hirsch's wife, she is not only perfectly cast, but fits her role like a hand in a kid glove. You can't see anyone else doing this as well. Maybe Sissy Spacek, but this unique combination of toughness and warmth is not quite a Spacek character--nor is it quite a Jodie Foster character either. It's Lahti's role all the way and she's really great.  One of the best things about this DVD is that it's really inexpensive. My advice is to buy it; you can't do much better than this for solid American drama at a great DVD price.  Highly recommended. 
 Arthur For the Very First Time is a book when Arthur's mom is having a baby and constantly arguing with Arthur's dad. So he has to go to his uncle's house , and he doesn't know what he'll discover . Also there are  strange animals at his uncle's house that know another language. In the  very beginning it takes place at Arthur's house, the rest of the time,  it  takes place at his uncle's house. The problem in the story is at the  beginning and end .That is because Arthur's mom and dad argue and Arthur  and a girl get drunk. I would really recommend this book because it is  interesting. I also would recommend this book because they have strange  people and animals like a chicken that understands a language 
 This is a great book on hydrology, the author is very famous in both hydrology and hydraulics area 
 A Sci-Fi cult drama of the beginning of the 70's, "The Omega Man" (98 minutes), was directed by Boris Sagal based on the novel "I Am Legend", of Richard Matheson. Charlton Heston is Robert Neville, a military scientist who developed an experimental vaccine in time to save himself of the devastating and apocalyptic biological war between China and Soviet Union. Living a boring and lonely routine, Neville has been in a bunker for three years in a ruined Los Angeles, and spends his time searching for food and armaments to fight the members of the "Family", some hundreds of survivors of the holocaust that had become albinos mutants and psychotic homicides. The group follows the rules, with a religious fervor, of the leader Matthias (the actor Anthony Zerbe), that before the catastrophe was a popular TV presenter. They now want to destroy Neville at any cost because they consider him pernicious, as a symbol of the science and technology that destroyed the humanity and transformed them into a group of dead-livings creatures. The soundtrack is of Ron Grainer and the film is unforgettable.. 
 All in the Timing is a wonderful collection of some of the funniest plays I've ever read, heard, or performed.  I highly recommend this book if you like to laugh 
 Odd Nerdrum is an extra-ordinary painter. He portrays himself as (and may well be) the prophet of painting. In this book we get a close look at some of his work; good detail plates allow examination of his technique. It's a beautiful book with a well written commentary on Nerdrum's life and thinking. Scattered snapshots of nerdrum at work are very enjoyable 
 It was quite interesting to read about the life Gillespie had outside of what most people knew about, i.e. his daughter Jeanie Bryson. I commend Shipton for having the courage to discuss such a touchy subject. He  attempts to strike a balance between Dizzy's private and professional life.  Two thumbs up! 
 Margaret Coel is one of the more talented mystery writers out there, but what really makes her stand out is her ability to write with sensitivity about life among the Arapaho.  She manages to avoid stereotypes both of  "the drunken Indian" and "the noble Indian".  But she  is also excellent at her descriptions of setting, and gives you a feel for  Wyoming.  When she described the snowy wind-swept winter landscape of  Wyoming, I could see it all clearly in my mind and wanted to turn up the  thermostat.  I was a little disappointed with the ending, and that is the  only reason I wouldn't give this book five stars. But if you like reading  about Native Americans, you will love this book 
 Doris Day shines in this extravaganza, which was to be her last big musical; she is flawless vocally, and the melodic score contains some of Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's most loved songs. Her co-stars are equally strong, with the rambunctious pair of Jimmy Durante (as Doris' father) and Martha Raye (as Durante's ever-patient fiancée), and when either of them are on the screen, it is mega-kilowatt entertainment. Nearly 30 years before this film, Durante had been in cast of the original 1934 Broadway production, and it's also wonderful to hear Martha Raye sing the "Why Can't I ?" duet with Doris, as her great talents as a singer were rarely recognized. Always a favorite of mine, Stephen Boyd is excellent as Doris' love interest. His beautiful speaking voice, mellow with a slight tinge of Irish, does well with the spoken/sung intro to "Sawdust, Spangles, and Dreams", but his two songs (the other being "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World"), are dubbed in by the rich voice of James Joyce.   Many genuine circus acts perform throughout the film, and the stunt work for the stars is seamlessly edited in. Jumbo the elephant of course, is the 5th star of the film, and he gives a "thumbs up" performance. The lavish production has many magical moments, and though most of it is pure fantasy, it captures the feel of "on the road performers" that anyone who has done a lot of touring in any theatrical field will appreciate. Kudos to director Charles Winters, and cinematographer William H. Daniels for their work in this film, which is superb family entertainment. Total running time is 123 minutes. The song list is: 1: "Over and Over Again" ~ Day 2: "The Circus is on Parade" ~ Durante/Raye/Day 3: "Why Can't I ?" ~ Day/Raye 4: "This Can't be Love" ~ Day 5: "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World" ~ Boyd (Joyce) reprise: Durante 6: "My Romance" ~ Day 7: "Little Girl Blue" ~ Day 8: "Sawdust, Spangles, and Dreams" ~ Boyd (Joyce) and cast. 
 The divergence of opinion among the reviewers regarding this film interests me - and reflects the changes the media itself has undergone, inspiring me to add my bit to the dialog here for what its worth.  First, I confess to not having seen the DVD.  I saw Under Capricorn about 20 years ago at the Nuart, a  revival theatre in Los Angeles, where it played as the late night feature on a double-bill with Strangers on a Train to a packed house.  The showing was memorable.  By the middle of the film, the tension had absorbed the audience to the point where you could literally have heard a pin drop in there - as the cliche goes.  The feeling was truly amazing - the energy was that of watching one of the great cinematic masterpieces - and Under Capricorn, great as it is - is hardly one of the greatest film masterpieces.  Yet, many of the reviewers here would be surprised to know that a surprising number of the most respected critics consider this rather musty treasure from the golden age of Technicolor - 1945-55 - one of Hitchcock's greatest achievements!  Part of the problem is that the "action" in this "costume drama" hails from an age when the ne plus ultra in special effects was stuff like Charlton Heston parting the Red Sea in The Ten Commandments (and that was several years after the 1949 release of this film). There really is no viable action to speak of in the film - which, if films had academic subtitles, could be called:  Under Capricorn: Hitch meets Henry James.  Really, it is the Jamesian novel of film, before movies of James' novels came into vogue, although The Heiress, one of the most lauded and popular films of 1949, was Hollywood's first major adaptation of a James novel.  One can see flashes of Under Capricorn in the more droll moments of the French New Wave cinema of the 1960's - many of whose makers were nursed on Hitchcock.  But, calling this rather serious film merely slow-paced would be euphemistic.  The film bombed at the box office back in 1949, and would probably not fare much better, if as well, today. Then what exactly has earned this glorified and rather messy soap plaudits from the some of the most selective critics, an enduring cult following, and standing ovations at revival showings?  Not the storyline, trite even for the melodramatic 1940s.  Not the visuals.  There's not a whole lot to commend Under Capricorn in any technical category. What is great, making the film appear larger than perhaps it is, is a surfeit of that elusive combination of awesome acting and on-screen chemistry (could it be that Hitch really was as great a director of actors as some have claimed?).   These actors don't need script or props - and, in truth, they don't get much of either, and yet - they cast a big-time spell. The other reviewers have concentrated on the performances of the central characters - the beautiful, strained couple - played by Joseph Cotten, and the gorgeous Ingrid Bergman in one of her most fetching screen appearances - if her character, played the hilt, is seemingly somewhat vapid at heart.  These seasoned pros are brilliant,and the subtlety of their portrayals, in which their characters show a truly lifelike, complete unconsciousness of what is going on around them, and their bittersweet devotion to each other, catalyzes the dramatic tension.   But center stage in this film belongs without doubt, to the moral battle as it evolves between protagonist and antagonist of the drama, played respectively by the magnificent Michael Wilding, in what must simply be called a larger than life performance, as "Aunt Clary's boy" who comes to Australia "to make his fortune", and the great British heavy, Margaret Leighton.   And the action here, which does unfold - is moral.  Under Capricorn is, in essence, an old fashioned morality play, as Wilding's character, urbane, polished in the deeper sense, puts on the `shining armor' of altruism and engages in a furious, yet utterly muted combat, with Leighton's.  The latter flawlessly projects in probably less twenty minutes of screen time one of the great evils of the age, a character fueled entirely by envy, a desperate, nasty have-not, of little or no formal education, utterly lost in the fury of her blindly narrow, furtive, conditioned scheming.  The escalation of the this conflict gives the film its noted ballast. As the moral extremes in us are played out against the usual banal, superficial, and prosaic social contexts, the ponderously crafted sets, the costumes are finally retired, and our real faces are revealed for what they are.  As Wilding's character says to Bergman's in his incredible farewell scene: "I suppose I'll be the first man who ever went to Australia, not to return with a fortune", and she never will know how much he loved her, and how much he'd sacrificed.  Sublime.   
 Eugene Ormandy's recording of Handel's MESSIAH, recorded in 1958-59 has been in many American homes now for over 45 years, (including mine), often for those with no knowledge of Classical music or any other Classical recordings. I remember this recording on LP in the 1970s: I bought a copy from our local music store in 1972, saving for months to buy it. So, my first exposure to MESSIAH was through Ormandy's recording, with a lush Philadelphia Orchestra, operatic soloists, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir of 375 voices.  There are some excellent solos here by William Warfield:  "Thus saith the Lord/ but who may abide?", "Why do the nations?" and "The trumpet shall sound."   I am less fond of the other singers, although all have beautiful voices and use them intelligently.  My biggest gripe is that many of Ormandy's tempos are just too slow in the choruses, but I suppose 375 people can't be expected to sing with the precision of say 50, like in Neville Marriner's 1976 recording (Decca).  The large choir then may be the reason for Ormandy's rather plodding tempos in some of the choruses.  Ormandy is quite musical, and if only he had considered a smaller choir and stripped down orchestra with a leaner sound, this would have been better.  I'm sure some readers will disagree with my observations, but I prefer a more "lean" approach to Handel: Marriner 1976 (not one of his other recordings) on a budget 2 CD Decca release, or if you can handle period instruments, Hogwood/Academy of Ancient Music (L'Oiseau-Lyre).  There are others who like Andrew Davis/Toronto (EMI) for modern instruments, but I haven't heard that recording, so cannot recommend it.  But I would get the Marriner, as it's modern instruments, chamber orchestra, yet using some Baroque performance practices: the best of both worlds 
 The art of seeing and the persistent human need for visual stimulation are the subjects of this group of book reviews and essays. Collections of articles are sometimes difficult to read straight through. These, however,  are unified by Hollander's conviction that dance, film and fashion are the  most distinctive art forms of the 20th century. Anyone interested in those  subjects will find this book ideal. Again and again I found myself eager to  explore the books that the author was discussing. As a book about books,  this volume is a great success. A critic who can discuss art, fashion,  film, dance and literature and offer creative comparisons betweem them is a  national treasure in an age when most writers can only cover their own  restricted turf 
 This biography has a flow that pulls you in. I was surprised by some of the revelations, such as the complexity of internal politics he had to deal with. It gives an image of an honest, ambitious, great leader. A leader who himself is unsure of many things (such as the civil war). Recommended 
 This was a great ending to the whole clone wars comic series 
 I read this book because someone gave it to my mother while she was undergoing chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer. It changed my life. It is really not limited to breast cancer, it teaches women's health in general. There are lists of everyday foods in the back of the book as well as receipes that have really helped my physical symptoms. I would recommend it to ALL women 
 I would recommend this book. Interesting scenarios, erotic and entertaining. Can't wait for the next book from this author 
 A historical novel, with some wonderful moments. I began reading a bit tentitively, but found myself deeply involved with the developing characters and the life detailed of a very different time and place.  Dunant brings light to how individuals managed their lives, when they did not fit into the rigid roles of pre/early Renaissance, Florentine culture, (independant women, artists, homosexuals).  Watch for an artful conclusion to a satisfying read... 
 WOW..it has been so long since a book has moved this hardened soul,so for this masterpice i am very grateful.  I really appreciated the fact that Mr Rimpoche did not tone down the book too much to appeal to the new age peacnik liberals who want to find a watered down version of  buddhism. The most important lessson for me was Hell is just as real in Buddhist mythology as The semitic traditions,in fact more so as it is presented in a matter of fact way,not as some abstract reality. Just a cursory glance at what is happening in our lifes and the world around us will show you that hell exist already and just as we are able to easily concieve of a happines that transcends any experince we can have in his world,we should  acknowledge that a a magnified hell is also an equally valid reality.  Another revealing aspect of this book was that the tibetan account  of dying and what happens to the soul after death,the realtionshipo between the living and dying is exactly the same as in the islamic tradition.The karmic recollection after death is no different than the weighing of scales ,the scrolls of right and wrong deeds found in the moniotheistic traditions.As the quran says "whosoever has done an iota of good ,he will see it that day, and whosoever has done an iota of evil he will see it that day" The bardo is called the barzakh in islam the meeting point between two realities,the transitory phase between this life and the next,and the whole experince of what happens in the barzakh and how the dead and living afffect each other is the same exactly..  The book will give an insight on how to live and how to die for a person of any religion and will give clarity to the rituals for the dying in other traditions that perhaps people have lost the significance of, a long time ago.  Most importantly the book will hopefully wake us up to the fact that actions not dogma  will determine what happens in the next life.Our actions ,even the smallest ones are recorded by the universe.you cannot escape from your actions behind some religous formula, for that reason it is as significant to a christian or a muslim as a buddhist 
 So long a letter is an African classic written by a talented Senegalese woman, Mariama Ba. I first stumbled upon this book in high school(Obot Idim) in Nigeria during my final examinations and really liked it. It was a sensation in my dormitory in high school. The novel is a short letter written by Ramatoulaye to her dear friend, Aissatou during the death of her husband. She invokes the memory of their dear friendship which has withstood the test of time, distance and wealth. In a very solemn voice, Ramatoulaye writes to her friend that she has been widowed after her husband dies of a heart attack at the office. During the funeral, the reader gets a glimpse of her co-wife, Binetou and the dignity Ramatoulaye struggles with in her presence. Her dignity is further challenged when the Mirasse or the secrets of her husband had been laid bare in accordance to the tenets of their Islamuc religion.She is shocked to learn of his betrayal, the loans he took out to impress his young bride while abandoning his first wife, then shamefully dying in penury. The following page is a reflection on the betrayal and soon, she delves into the "sequence of reminiscences" on her friendship with Aissatou, the challenges they faced in their respective marital home, Aissatou's divorce and her own abandonment three years later. This letter is written during her 40 day mourning period, and is a reflection on the emotional struggle ranging from bitterness, melancholy, and sadness during that period.   The book succeeds in exposing the double standard in the African culture against women and it is poignantly and beautiful portrayed in this novel. The literary qualities in the book is non pareil. Highly recommended, this book has inspired me to write my own novel and along the line, it has introduced me to other cultures in Africa. Mariama Ba was the best writer from Africa in my opinion. So Long a letter was listed as one of the 12 best African books of the 20th century, what a remarkable achievement!! 
 I cannot say enough about this book. I fell in love with the characters. I'm not sure if it's because my mother is Japanese and being stationed in Japan that I felt a connection.  She made us know the characters on an intimate level. I couldn't put the book down. I cried for their losses, disappointments and like a baby at the end. I would highly recommend it! 
 I purchased two of the 9-foot Oxford Garden Market Umbrellas in desperation; we were having a backyard party at our home and my local stores were all out.  When they arrived a short time later, I was very pleased to see how well made they were.  I especially like the pull cord to open and help close the umbrellas.  Not only are these umbrellas attractive, they are easy to use, study, and detail-oriented.  I'll probably get one more before the end of summer 
 4 women, 4 lives, and about 4 million bottles of gin! Author Meade does an amazing job of bringing the era of 1920-30 vibrantly to life, capturing the unique blend of post-war innocence and decadence that marked that time in history.  It was a wild time when everyone seemed larger than life --- a time when egos, libidos, and liquor ran free and very wild!  No where was this hypnotic chaos more pronounced than in the artistic community.  By tracing and weaving her narrative around and about the lives and social circles of 4 amazing women (Zelda Fitzgerald, Dorothy Parker, Edna Ferber, and Edna St. Vincent Millay) Meade captures the artistic pulse of the era wonderfully.  This is a very entertaining book of authors and the literary set behaving SO badly that it's surprising they still had the energy (much less the time) to write.  You know you are in for some twisted fun when Dorothy Parker seems the sanest person in the crowd!!  Extremely enjoyable!     
 Unlike some other books that says "Always do this" this book says "Consider doing this in such and such cases" and explains why. And instead of "Put in an exception as much description as possible" it says "Put the numbers, the rest is retrievable from the stack trace and the source code". Without any idealism this book gives very practical advices, so that you can get better results in less time. The writing style of this book is very concise and worth every minute of your time reading it. And unlike "Head First Design Patterns" the "Effective Java" does not need any "funny" pictures to be readable - it is fascinating by itself 
 This book is among my favourites. I have read most or many of his books twice and always find them to be entertaining and educational. I keep a copy of Hawaii, Alaska, and Texas near at hand. This is a nice 1000 page historical novel that gives a very detailed picture of the evolution of the great state of Texas, now one of the most dynamic states in the USA.  Michener's books use a common plot formula that starts out by telling a story that in some way reflects and utilizes accurately the actual or known historical developments and time lines and people of a region. In the present case it is about a group of people that came up from Mexico to settle in what is now Texas. It progresses through the development of the region adding in settlers, farmers, outlaws, lawmen, business people, adding in more characters and phasing out as time moves forward up to current times.  When I decided to review this book I was not certain if people were still interested in buying this book but I was pleased to see that there is still interest at Amazon.com in buying and reading this great story but perhaps not quite as popular as some of his other works 
 Emotions distort reality of self and others. Buddhism is a practice and a religion that offers a way out of illusion (Mara). The Dalai Lama brings forth his own wisdom as a world soul teacher immersed in Tibetan Buddhism. A wonderful guide on getting out of your own way 
 I am rating this 5 stars just because the MTM show deserves 5 stars.  Notice that the sales rank of this start up disk is much lower than the complete box set.  Good.  I want Fox to release seasons 2+ in their entirety.  And hopefully this will help.  Just a note to the Fox team who is putting out the MTM dvds.....   Include the entire cast on the box.  The pictures they use now  is making it look like the 'Independent Seventies Woman striking it out on her own' type show which was new at the time but today it's dated.  If they include Ted, Lou, Murray, etc. it will appeal to a much wider audience who know and love these characters. 
 This is my favorite album of 2004 (thank you NPR!). If I *had* to put this album in a genre, I guess I'd say blues, but it is so much more. The song lyrics are beautiful, literate, sad, intense, etc., and the music fits them perfectly. Listen to the samples - yes it's really true, ALL the songs on this album are great 
 I loved Steve Taylor's lucid account of why he thinks the world is in such a bad way, how we got to be in this sorry state and how we can get out of it.  It skillfully blends history, psychology, sociology and spirituality to produce a book that is not only thought provoking and enlightening but also enjoyable to read.  Despite the potentially depressing nature of the issues covered, Steve Taylor manages to remain positive and provide solutions for a way forward to a better world.  This is an uplifting book and recommended to anyone searching for answers to difficult questions 
 A must read for anyone in business. You don't just read this, you keep it around for reference. It also helps if you have read previous books...especially from the mother of all Trout and Reis books on Positioning. To navigate the world of business, marketing and advertising without this body of knowledge is like trying to get around Boston without a map. It can be done...but 
 GREAT PRICE AND FAST SHIP ON THIS NEW CD! A+++! I LOVE AMAZON! MY FAVORITE PLACE TO SHOP! NEVER DISAPPOINTED 
 Though I enjoyed reading the book, my final thoughts on it were that it was too "touchy feely" and perhaps addressed to the non-Christian who is seeking healing of his "wounds" or to a new Christian. During my recent difficult times I had already used what is mentioned in this book to overcome my loneliness and get closer to God on my own with the help of prayer and the Holy Spirit, which is available to all believers.  A lot of us Christians turn to self-help books to find answers to our problems instead of the free resources we already have as I mentioned above. I am thankful to Henri Nouwen for reassuring me that I was on the right track to healing and spirituality 
 I am the parent of an 11-year-old boy with Asperger's Syndrome, or high-functioning autism (diagnosed at 5). We have struggled mightily in recent years, despite reading virtually everything out there on Asperger's (God bless Tony Attwood!), and have been perplexed as to how to address the ADHD symptoms my son displays. I couldn't understand (nor could any doctors) why ADHD treatment failed him, and often seemed to backfire and produce an opposite of the desired result. I found this book very enlightening. I think that the possibility that ADHD and autism spectrum disorders are part of the same continuum is quite feasible. Nowhere does the book say that they are the SAME disorder. I have 3 nephews who are autistic (all brothers), and even thought they fall under the general category of "autism", they have some very differnt behaviors from one another. So to say that ADHD CANNOT be "related" to autism (as some reviewers have claimed) becuse some behaviors are different is fautly reasoning, in my opinion. The term "continuum" implies that there are a wide range of behaviors, different with each child based on their intensity and a child's personality. If I've learned anything about autism over the years, it's that you cannot put autistic children in a "box" in terms of their behaviors; this is one thing that makes the disorder so difficult to understand.  I especially liked the section of this book that covers medication. The author (becuase she is not a doctor) does not attempt to deal with this herself, but has a specialist address meds. After many trials of Ritalin-based meds and Strattera with my son, we always got a more hyper, frazzled child. The book suggested that perhaps because many children with autism have "amplified" senses (my words), a little medication will go a long way. We cut my son's medication down to a quarter of what we'd originally tried, and saw improvement right away. So I guess I tend to lend some credence to the author's ascertations. I'd been lost in the topsy-turvy world of Asperger's vs. ADHD (and whether my son had BOTH, or if they were related)for a very long time, and while this book does not lend any conclusive answers (and doesn't claim to), it certainly gets the debate going, and offers some preliminary proof that they may be realted. Autism is so little understood, that I welcome the kind of research done by Ms. Kennedy. She does not have a degree in neurology, nor psychology, but she is thouroughly well self-taught (as all parents of a child with autism need to be!). I feel that this book has helped to at least direct our path of treatment with my son, and for that I am grateful 
 I actually had this book in 1993 when it was self published the principles in it showed me how to go from being totally broke and $50,000 in debt to now having a net worth of $150,000, this is also after going through a divorce where I lost 50% of my net worth.   This is financial step one:Start the journey.I have also been listening to Dave Ramsey on the radio since he started in Nashville in 1993. His common sense information is why I have a 6 figure 401K, and have had financial peace over the past 13 years. He taught me what my parents should have about personal finance. This is a great beginners book in personal finance,it can show you the way out of debt and into prosperity. Here are some of the rules: 1). Never have a car payment 2). Do not use credit cards 3). Get a mortgage of less than 25% of your monthly net income. 4). Have 3 months of expenses saved 5). Get a career you love not a job 6). Tell yourself and yout family NO to things you can not afford 7). Contribute 15% to your 401K 8). Live on a budget 9). Live on less than you make! 10). Work two jobs until you are out of debt.  It is worth the price you pay short term for the long term peace 
 My baby and I LOVE the captivating rhythms of this music. You can't help but get up and dance along 
 I LOVE THESE COOKBOOKS AND THIS IS A GREAT PRICE.  I PAID MORE FOR MY OWN THESE WERE ACTUALLY GIFTS.  I HATE THAT I BOUGHT MINE AT FULL PRICE 
 Platoon, it records a story in the Vietnam War. Chris Taylor a young American soldier who is the main character of the movie, had arrived South Vietnam with his comrades. In the battlefield, it shows audiences a real battle life. Although the condition in the battlefront was bad, Taylor learned to fit in battle life, and he became an experienced soldier on the battlefront. In the scene when Taylor's leader Elias Grodin was killed by Viet soldiers, Taylor figured out Robert Barnes was the real murderer of Elias, and this scene is the cover of this movie. As the movie moves on, Taylor continued to fight with Viet soldiers and once, Taylor's company was losing because of the huge number of enemies. After bombing on the whole area, most of the soldiers died. Taylor was one of the survivals, and he found Barnes in the jungle. In the anger, he killed Barnes as what Barnes did to Elias. By the way, the newer version of Platoon has a better effect on the movie, even though it's still the same one. This movie is very compelling; it'll bring you to the world of war, a cruel, brutal and apathetic world. Again, welcome to the world of war 
 This is a great book for the techno-savvy non-professional, someone who probably enjoyed a 35mm SLR for years, and is now moving up to a digital SLR after suffering with a digital point-and-shoot for a few years.  If you're the sort of person who actually read the instruction manual that came with your new digital SLR, you'll love this book.    The book is a great refresher on SLR photography, and provides a detailed but not overwhelming technical description on the mechanics of digital photography.  Having read the book, I now feel I have a pretty good grasp on how my new digital SLR works, how it differs from my 35mm SLR and point-and-shoot cameras, and what its strengths and limitations are.  The book will take you to a level far beyond what the camera's instruction manual did.  I also like the fact that the book essentially excluded any discussion of photo-processing software.  It really focussed on all the issues up to and through the actual picture taking process.     
 I have lusted after this edition of the Superman: The Movie soundtrack ever since it originally came out back in 2000. I was heartbroken when I found that it very quickly went out of print and became a rather hard-to-find item in the market, commanding $75-$100 price tags from third-party sellers.  I was ecstatic when it just very recently became available again (no doubt to take advantage of the new Superman Returns movie coming out next month) and just got my hands on it today. I'm listening to it right now as I write this and it is an absolute joy to experience. You'd certainly be hard-pressed to find a grander, more memorable set of music for a comic-book character (or any character, really!) Just aces.  However, I'm more than a little disappointed at how this recent pressing seems to lack the rather extensive liner notes that originally came with this edition in 2000(all it has is a single paper slip with the cover on the front and a B&W photo of Jor-El and Lara on the reverse). I'm a little baffled by this and would like to know if anyone has any info regarding this situation. Are all copies lacking the notes, or is it just that I had the bad luck of getting an incomplete copy and should return it for a replacement? Any help would be appreciated...  Liner notes (or lack thereof) notwithstanding, the music on this CD is quite simply brilliant, both technically and creatively. Plus the chronological listing of tracks and bonus material are an added treat for completists. So, the music gets 5+ stars, but the packaging (with the missing booklet) brings it down a notch. Still, a great buy, especially if you have a soft spot for the Big Guy, like me 
 I have to say...I was a little weary when i decided to see this movie...alot of my friends raved about it, but im so picky, i didnt think id like it. so i watched it and i was blown away. i cried the first few times i saw it. I must've watched it about 10-20 times and i can never get enough.  it is beautifully done. the music is excellent. the casting was clear perfection. i give props to the writer of the original play...what a masterpiece  i could rave forever and ever about it. the storyline is such like todays life...paying rent sucks, and its nearly impossible to get good money around here.   i could rant and rave for hours. all i have to say is, if you havnt seen it, it is a must for anyone over the age of around 15...the topics can get a little mature. but it really is worth it 
 I had recently finished a string of somewhat more serious, heavy books ranging from social fiction to mathematics.  Needless to say, I was in desperate need of something a bit more relaxing and this book fit the bill perfectly.  I picked it up because I had read some of Bryson's previous work (In a Sunburned Country, A Short History of Nearly Everything) and considered him hilarious.  He is the only author that has caused me to actually laugh while reading, at times embarassingly and in public!  This book is a collection of weekly essays he wrote for a period of three years, and the material is all stream-of-conscious style.  So you can read for 5 minutes or 5 hours and still enjoy it, perfect for commuters, both of the subway and the airlines.  Though it's supposed to cover 'American' life, he really just writes about his own and only occasionally plays up the contrast to the British culture, as an American I never felt lost or confused.  All in all, read this book at some point when you've found that your reading material of late has became a tad bit dreary or monotonous 
 When I was eight years old, this version of Alice in Wonderland was aired on T.V.  I thought I had watched the best movie ever at that time, and still, to this day, I have more fond memories of watching that movie than any other time in my life!  The songs were beautiful!  I can still sing the song Alice sang to the deer - "Why do people act as if they're crazy?  Why to they behave the way they do? I have to say, this is one my favorite songs of all time! If you get a chance to purchase and watch this movie, you will witness the beautiful music 
 Mel Tari's account of his personal experiences with God in his native Indonesia is well written and inspiring.  I read Like a Mighty Wind and Chapter 29 by Jean Coleman in the late 1970s, and have never forgotten either book.  Like a Mighty Wind was first published in 1965, and Chapter 29 was first published in 1976.  Both books demonstrate that we receive what we believe, and because there are now so many believers worldwide expecting the miraculous, the latest book is MegaShift, which I heartily recommend also 
 "Psychedelic Confection!" would describe the impression that I had after looking at this album's cover for the first time, and it turned out to be a pretty accurate one.  Although I was a bit fooled by those soft pastel colors; this album really punches and kicks for the most part (not quite as much as most of their earlier work for example, just more than I expected it to).  Colin's bass playing is brought to the forefront here (Moulding could very well be the greatest rock bassist of his era) and many of these songs have some of the hardest grooves that I've ever heard from the group ("Poor Skeleton Steps Out", "Scarecrow People").  This is a pretty interesting album, both sonically and thematically, and most of these songs are extremely busy, with so many little sonic details that you'll likely notice something new with each repeated listen for quite a while (something that it has in common with "Chips from the Chocolate Fireball" although I would have to say that "Chips..." is even busier).  As you probably know, the band has used different drummers for most of their releases since Terry Chambers left after "English Settlement", and the drummer this time around is Pat Mastelotto, who was from the group "Mr. Mister"-don't hold that against him though, he contributes some fine work throughout this album :-).  Andy Partridge, in his usual incisively sharp and humorously clever style, describes his contributions here as being "aggressively optimistic...like jolly sandpaper!"  The album is apparently named after an old English nursery rhyme, and nursery rhymes are said to be the main inspiration for his songs.  Partridge (personally my favorite lyricist ever) says that his songs are mainly either entertainment or messages for his kids (the brilliantly arranged "Chalkhills and Children" is basically about his relationship with his kids and his grounded lifestyle which they greatly contribute to).  The only song that I see that seems to be strictly entertainment for his kids is "Poor skeleton steps out", all the others seem to have some clever theme underneath.  This is why there are several "Wizard of Oz" references throughout the album-it happened to be his kids' favorite movie while it was being made.  His songs are still abundantly witty, thoughtful, and clever though (his kids must be pretty sophisticated with great taste in music :-).  The only low point is "Hold Me My Daddy" which makes a great point about love between fathers and sons, and fraternity amongst men in general, but as sharp as Andy is he could have easily found a more clever way to say it.  "Scarecrow People", which is typically brilliant Partridge in top form takes a sardonic stab at human beings by describing another species' pursuit to be just like them.  "The Garden of Earthly Delights" and "Across This Antheap" (which has the most brilliant orchestral string coda at the end) are also quite brilliant both lyrically and conceptually.  The darkest and most biting songs come from the usually bouyant Moulding this time around.  I've heard very few modern social critiques that are any where near as honest and insightful as "King for a Day".  This song is extremely effective as a clever summary of certain values that are largely embraced by the masses: ruthless greed and cutthroat competition, which people accept with the expectation that "THEY" will be one of the ones that make it to the top.  Colin surely didn't seem to be writing songs with small children in mind here, all of his songs are dark and incisive with pretty complex concepts ("Cynical Days" could be one of my personal theme songs).  The fast pace and almost claustrophobic nature of much of the material can make this album seem a bit daunting at first, but it's unbelievably rich with ideas, and proves to be monumentally rewarding over time. This is a solid and highly energetic piece of smart pop/rock that you likely won't be sorry that you added to your collection. 
 As an amateur cook with roots in the Midwest, I've always relied on good ol' salt and pepper -- and maybe a little Italian mixed herbs on spaghetti night. But this book has opened my eyes to a whole new landscape of delightful tastes and attitudes!...but I'm a sucker for their Cellophane Noodle Salad With Shrimp 
 Great introduction to the concept. Gives remarkable ideas to transform a room, home, space or help recognized potential of items found in flea market and garage sales, into wonderful pieces for your home.   Remember the local "Target Store" helps a lot. 
 An intoxicating blend of literary and genre fiction from Roald Dahl.  I'll be buying volume 2 on the strength of volume one.  I read "Man From The South" nearly twenty years ago and have never forgotten it.  Imagine a master storyteller relating a hair raising tale in very calm and matter of fact tones and you get a good idea of Dahl's "voice".  The most fantastic premise seems plausible when Dahl is relating the details.  "Georgy Porgy" is phenomenal, as is "The Sound Machine".  "William and Mary" is another eye opener (read it, then excuse my pun).  If you think Dahl is a "children's author", think again.  Highly recommended 
 This is one of my very favorite cds. By far the best by Edwin McCain, and among the best albums I've ever heard. Buy it. Get an extra copy for a friend 
 Carolyn Gimian has done a wonderful job of sculpting a body of work that speaks to the essence of Shambhala Training and warriorship.  She has painted a genuine portrait of Chogyam Trungpa through his training  methodologies, poems, talks, and personal history.  The book contains  reference information for those readers who may want to pursue Shambhala  Training, in their own quest to embrace life through direct participation.   I would recommend this book to all students of Shambhala, present and  future 
 I bought this DVD because it was cheap, and I figured I could not go wrong with an old Hitchcock classic.  The first two minutes of the film gave me some doubts, as the sound quality on the opening music was poor (I thought the sound was fine after that and the picture quality very good).  Then the story got going, and I was amazed.    This film really needs to be appreciated on two levels.  First, it is a wonderfully pleasant thriller.  It has a script from the days when they cared about writing good dialogue.  It is quite witty, and pleasantly sexy, the latter in a family-friendly way that is nonetheless more engaging than so much of the modern, explicit material.  But the second level is what makes this film so astonishing.  It was made in 1938 in England.  At the time, appeasement was the official policy of the British government and most of the British press.  In fact, the film censorship board would not even allow the words "German" or "Nazi" to be used in connection with bad guys.  The film nonetheless manages to suggest the utter evil of Nazism and show the utter bankruptcy of appeasement.  What's most intriguing, the film cleverly shows a variety of people who just don't want to get involved in any nastiness, for one reason or another, but who have true British hearts of gold and come through wonderfully once a fight proves unavoidable.  My pleasure at this wonderful film is mixed on a few counts.  The first, of course, is the sadness that the film proved to be so amazingly prophetic about the tragedy of the years that followed.  The second is that this film is so little known, when it should by rights be part of the history curriculum every student learns by high school.  The third is that this film is just as meaningful for us today as it was when it was made.  Alas, it just may be that we are living in 1938 all over again. 
 Just as I finished reading this book, today, Oil Minister, Pierre Gemayel (a Christian) was shot to death in Lebanon. Robert Spencer's well documented and clear explanation of the Koran tells you where justification for an act like this can be found in that Holy Book. On the right page you will find that it is not a crime to kill "pigs" (Jews and Christians).  
 This book, while several years old now, is still as funny as the day it was first printed.  The writing is a hoot and a guaranteed laugh maker.  It looks at some the the most ridiculous, outlandish and just plain "what were they thinking" movies ever made.  Wish the authors would come up with a more recent book with movies that have come out since this was printed.  
 I ordered this book to get me started in teaching my 10 year old trail horse the basics in dressage. I could not put it down!! I am still finding myself going back and reviewing the different methods of the basics for not only training my horse, but to better myself as a rider. This book is excellent for anyone wanting to teach their horse the basics in riding any type of discipline. Don't let the word dressage fool you. You need to teach your horse the basics of dressage to get off to the right start in any type of riding that you do. I highly reccommend this book 
 This camcorder is pretty good. It's perfectly priced, although Amazon has it for a higher price.  Good things: 1. Low price 2. Camcorder/Camera/Voice recorder/MP3 player 3. Very small 4. Easy to use 5. Perfect for kids who don't have that much money! Bad things: 1. You need to be in at least a medium-lit enviroment to get good footage on camcorder mode. 2. Can only go up to a 512 MB memory card. 3. The Ulead video editing software that comes with it doesn't let you do many cool things, but the picture editing one is great. You should get this camera if you don't have all that much money to spend! 
 One of the biggest quandaries amongst Nationalists, Communists and 'The Left' is the lack of understanding on how this country really operates - this lack thereof is predominantly from latter rather than the formers. The author's exposition is one of the most lucid I've ever come across. Arguably the strongest point of this work is his stratification of the Elite and his analysis - psycho and sociological - of each layer's interface and interplay. Very few books are as penetrating as this in terms of the psychological make-up of the Elite. We cannot dismantle this system unless we understand how it functions and this book is one that can bring us comprehensively closer - if it isn't too late already 
 The Killers Hot Fuss is a great and fun album. With three extra tracks included, this 14 song collection is worth the money. My fave track is Smile like you mean it, has a fabulous melody and lyrics:"And someone is playing a game in the house that i grew-up in, and someone will drive her around down the same streets that i did..." On Top is a perfect love song, Andy you're a star, Mr. Brightside,Somebody Told Me, The Ballad of Michael Valentine, Jenny was a friend of mine, Change your mind, and All these things that I've done are wonderful as well. Hot Fuss is the best album I have heard and the best new band I have listened to in the past 5 years. Hope their next creation is as great as this 
 My son and I are about half done with the 6-week program, and we both notice a definite improvement in how we feel.  It's the first time that he has been so enthused about walking, or exercise of any kind.  I recommend without reservations!  We've also bought a couple of her DVDs to walk with, which helps 
 This movie has the best opening scene ever!  It's amazing how great they made this movie considering the first one was only eh...  Highly recommended 
 I use this all the time at my son's soccer games and get great shots. It's a little on the bigger side, but isn't too heavy and image stabilization really helps out 
 If you're acquainted with Greg Iles' work, you know that he's a different author. His books are very different one from another. He changes subjects, pace, types of characters. He's able to write a legal thriller with the same easiness he writes a very fast kidnapping story. With "Dead sleep", Iles continues to prove - at least to me - that he's one of the most talented thriller authors of the last ten years, along with Michael Connelly.   In "Dead sleep", the main character this time is a woman. I think most male writers have this dream of writing at least a book where the main character is a woman, but few dare to try, because creating a decent character of the opposite sex is not an easy task. I think Iles did a good job with Jordan Glass, the award-winning war-zone photographer in "Dead sleep". He did a good job, not a great one, but that's good enough. Jordan came up a little too similar to a man, but even so she has interesting feminine features, and she's believable for most of the novel. Her background life is very interesting. She's a strong character, living - and doing well - in a male environment.  While visiting Hong Kong, Jordan faces a series of paintings portraying sleeping women, but one of those women has her very face - or the face of her twin sister, who's been missing (kidnapped) for the past year and half. Jordan teams up with agent John Kaiser and his FBI squad, in the search of eleven kidnapped women and the madman - or madwoman - that's killing to create his artistic masterpieces.   As usual, Iles throws a lots of balls in the air, and during the entire novel he keeps them off the ground. I didn't like the ending, though. It is not much believable, and a little too convenient. But it didn't spoil the fun of reading this great thriller. The series of interviews with the suspects has great dialogues, and a very good character development - the level of which is hard to come across these days.  Grade 8.8/10 
 I take a lot of road trips so I decided to get this handheld TV. All I have to say is wow; I was up in New Hampshire over the weekend and this TV picked up more channels, while in the car, than the TV we had in our place that had rabbit ears. The only problems I encountered were that I was watching a football game and I couldn't see the score because the screen was too small. Also the battery life is no more than just over 2 hours, but I bought rechargeable batteries and a charger which gets rid of that problem. Anyway I would definetly recommend this TV to anyone who wants to watch a TV when they aren't close to one 
 Very fast service...very good product and I love having it delivered to me 
 What a fantastic way to learn about John Adams! What a great way to be introduced to excellent historical biographical writing!  McCullough is a brilliant and exciting writer. He truly makes Adams come alive, and when Adams inevitably dies at the end it is a very sad thing!  Adams is truly a hero of the Republic. A great friend, then a great rival, then a great friend again of Thomas Jefferson, Adams is undeservedly overlooked by many students of American History.  Adams the republican vs Jefferson the populist was the great debate in American history and still continues today. Adams saw the horror of the French Revolution for what it was and predicted that it would end in depravity and violence and likely cause a savage reaction which would bring about the end of the French Republic itself. He was right, Bonaparte quickly followed the French Revolution and war across europe was the result. Jefferson on the other hand embraced the French Revolution as an expression of the people's desire for liberty. How wrong he was!  Adams was a brilliant Statesman, and student of history. A wonderful family man and superb husband Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail is a classic in American literature.  As a youth I spent many hours on the grounds of the Adams Mansion soaking up all the history there as much as is possible. McCullough does so well what so many biographers do so poorly and that is he captures the times of the subject and places the person in his rightful context. He brought me back to the grounds of "Peacefield" through his beautiful evocations of it as it hosted great people and great events.  History is best studied by understanding how historical figures lived and understood their own lives and times, as they lived them. Hindsight is an overrated tool in historiography.  Bringing the past to life in writing is a special gift and McCullough has it. Enjoy his talents and get to know the foundations of the American nation a story that is not fully known by so many. Adams' story deserves to be told. What a brilliant man, and McCullough does him superb justice in this highly readable biography.  So much can be said here about Adams, but it's not necessary as McCullough has written the definitive John Adams biography and says it better than I. Get to know John Adams through this superb book, you will be glad that you did. And your opinions on Jefferson will likely change, too! 10 STARS! 
 I loved this book!!  River Jordan writes with the descriptive qualities of Truman Capote.  She makes you feel you are envolved as all of the events as they unfold.  This is a "can't put down" read, so make sure you have a quiet nook and time to read about all the good people in Shibboleth!  Rivers style is very easy to read and you find yourself engrossed in the characters.  I was left hanging on the edge of my seat in total anticipation of events swirling around in this wonderful story.  It is a story of good and evil and how each character had a part in bringing a positive outcome.    Please please read this book!!  It is the feel-good book of the year. It made me feel there was hope in this world 
 I'm a musician an have an ear for the finer points of sound.  This brings me back to the days when analog recording was standard, and mid range wasn't lost in digital inadequacy, this is real music with that real feel and sound.  Still on CD but does seem to have more of the warmth of analog masters.  It's just good solid simple real rock, and a must have for any metal head guitar player 
 There is more and more information coming to light on the topic of health risks and damage associated with vaccines - the mercury/autism issue is only one of many.   It can be a frightening road for concerned parents to navigate when trying to decide for themselves if there is indeed risks associated with vaccines, and if those risks exceed the benefits or not. Traditional healthcare practitioners, having never researched the topic themselves and believing what they've been told during their training and by the drug reps, often take a hostile view towards those parents who would "dare to question" vaccines.   This book is a great resource with a wealth of knowledge for those progressive parents who want to decide for themselves about vaccines and whether or not they want their kids to receive them. It is well thought out, easy to read, and has strong references to back up the various claims.   Unfortunately, much of the "accepted" research that physicians, nurses, and the media often cite has been performed by individuals with a conflict of interest and/or funded by companies/organizations who profit from vaccines. The following statement by the author is quite pointed:  "Governments have a moral responsibility to ensure that vaccines are properly tested for side effects before they foist them on their subjects, but all governments fail dismally in this duty. They prefer to take the easy option of just believing what the manufacturers say..."  I have pretty much every book written on this topic, "The vaccine guide", "Vaccinations a thoughtful parents guide", Vaccines - are they really safe and effective", "Vaccination roulette", "What your Dr. may not tell you about childrens vaccines", etc. They are all great & even having read them all there was still new information in this book that enabled me to learn even more on the topic. 
 Great race, great story and very well told. I liked the way that the story cut between the race and the personal story. Much of the race story must be conjecture but it is intelegently presented and completly believable.  Hard to imaging you could take one 26 mile race and make it into an enthralling story.  Can be enjoyed by the athletics trainspotters as well as the casual runne 
 I choose this book and thought that I would just read one chapter but it is cool how they used spanish dialog. I read the book and now i am reading "Faith and the Rocket Cat. 
 Fairly sturdy, metal 52mm thread alternative to the Canon lens adapter 
 Best Shots is from Pat Benatar and containts her greatest hits.  This is really a great set of awesome rock and roll from one of the all time greats. 
 It's a very good book, but instead of Autism maybe they can use a different word 'cause talks about different diagnoses 
 You really can't go wrong with this book. It is invaluable and the information is original and entertaining.  My only negative is I would have liked the option of buying a more epxensive book with full color photos and more scenery shots of each river 
 This album is so amazingly unique and charming..its a shame they had to go on making albums so completely different from this one. But any credible band or artist doesnt want to make the same album twice, so I take this album for what it is...pure fun. The voice of Nina is what sugar would sound like in musical form...coupled with the brilliant arrangment of catchy, upbeat and smooth music of Peter along with the back-up of the talented band, this is music for a sunny day...or to shed some light on a rainy day. This music came out in the mid-90's when it seemed people had a sense of humor about music, and the only thing being played on the radio and MTV wasnt just cry-baby whiney booty call gangsta un-imaginative "rock"...oh I long for the days of innocent music, but for now..I pop in LIFE and am transported to the days when music had more variety and wasnt so serious, or even to a mid-60's lounge if I play the right track....great album, great band.  
 Desmond Morris, currently seventy-six, has accomplished many things throughout his life, but The Naked Ape has to be one of his best works. In The Naked Ape, Desmond Morris takes a look at Homo sapiens thru a zoologists view. He talks about how we started, what lead us to be the way we are, our tendencies, and how things really haven't changed that much. This book was very interesting for me, and gives us a different view on our fellow man.    Though the book is filled with facts, it feels as if Morris is having a conversation with you. The book is quite easy to understand and does not drag on and on. Though he does refer to us as animals, he also describes us as marvelous.     I truly enjoyed how this book changes its view on humans to the third person. It is like standing in front of a mirror and not looking at yourself they way you normally do, but as is another stood before you.        There are eight sections in the book: Origins, Sex, Rearing, Exploration, Fighting, Feeding, Comfort, and Animals. I could not help but notice that Sex was the longest section; that is saying something about our peoples.     In the first section, Morris talks about how we became bipedal, lost our fur, and are so social. When he talked of how we went thru a shift from being traveling primates to bipedal carnivores, I felt somewhat empowered. There where also a few explanations to how we lost our fur, including a parasite problem, overheating, and first going thru an aquatic stage before going bipedal. I found the aquatic theory to be quite convincing.   The rest of the book following the first section discusses our tendencies. It is hard to notice that things we do everyday, from smiling to how we eat. How most mothers hold child with the child's head to the left of their chest. How we move in a heart beat motion when anxious, or the source of our aggression. Morris points out some of the reasons we do the things we do, and why it is part of our being. I also thought that how humans can be curious at older ages while most animals simply live with what they know after reaching adult hood. It amazes me how so much of what the book says is true.     This book also shows how humans are very animal like. The male is looked at as the one to provide and control, and how woman is to be caring and motherly. It goes deeper than that; take a moment and notice the things you do and what others are doing and compare it to pre-historic man and nature today.     The Naked Ape, simply put, is an amazing book. I will not soon forget what I have learned from this book and the ideas it presents. This book's interesting perspective will also give us something to think about.  
 Maryann MacDonald's story of sibling rivalry, revolving around a Halloween costume, is quietly funny and uplifting. Every child who loves Halloween and wants to have the best costume will relate to this gem of a story. Parents, too, will find the text and illustrations endearing and enduring 
 This book is an excellent companion to taking the Krav Maga Self Defense Training.  I take it with me everywhere I go.  David is a master instructor and I feel privileged to be studying under him.  His book is easy to follow and understand.    The illustrations in the book make for clearer instructions and the book points out key points that the student should remember. It's not just a straight 123 instructions book, it makes you think about potential dangers and your reactions to them.  I highly recommend reading this book.  It is an essential building block for honing and mastering your martial arts skills.  ----  Chris D.                         
 A charter is going from Hong Kong to Denver. Suddenly there is a problem, the plane dives and passengers are discomforted. TPA 545 makes an emergency landing in Los Angeles for medical care. Many foreign charter carriers did not match the rigorous safety standards of domestic scheduled carriers. The FAA investigates these "incidents".  Casey Singleton, a single mom, works in Quality Assurance for Norton Aircraft. QA dealt in problems in customer support. Casey has a new assistant who has to be educated and gently handled. Casey explains the very high standards needed for aircraft ("Bldg 64 6:45 am"). The "War Room 7:01 am" chapter shows how problems are investigated. There is a big order that will save the company, but only if this problem can be explained by next week! The problem appears to be "severe pitch oscillations" which could be caused by "uncommanded slats deployment". The expert says it could not be pilot error because that pilot was superb; it had to be a mechanical problem ("Bldg 202/FSIM 7:59 am"). [Is this a clue?] Inspection reveals a non-standard part that could have caused the malfunction ("Hangar 5 9:40 am"). Is the rumor about the wing offset just a projection of fears? Why do the media censor information about "Cheapskate Airlines", a stock scam similar to the then current "high-tech" stocks? Do reporters write with a presumption of guilt to make their subjects look silly or foolish? Has deregulation resulted in using aircraft beyond their expected life ("Proof Test 10:19 am")? It takes regulations to provide safety, not a "free market". Every part on an aircraft has a paper history for documentation. Casey finds the repair record ("Norton QA 12:30 pm"), and the seemingly correct paper.  The "Newsline/New York 1:54 pm" chapter explains the working of television news stories. More counterfeit parts are found (which don't meet the high standards required). The "Outside Norton 11:10 am" chapter explains how news stories are created for sensationalism. Note the funding source for the "Institute for Aviation Research". See the reporter asking questions to cause an emotional reaction. The video camera recorded a sound like the slats deploying. Television news is not required to present the other side of an issue. The "Norton QA 11:50 am" chapter explains the trick used in interviews to get a reaction. The hidden agenda comes out ("Bldg 64 3:01 pm"). How difficult is it to film a test flight ("War Room 4:20 pm")? On Saturday morning the plane is taken up for a test flight, with two passengers. The flight recreates the incident successfully to rule out any "design flaw". Then the mystery is solved. The Aircraft Incident Report is written in language that means little to the general public. The last chapter contains the news reports that end this story. These items conceal more than they reveal. The phrase "deep integrity" suggests a well-hidden quality. This novel is educational in telling about the tricks played by any award-winning news program.  Michael Crichton has placed this fast-paced story in a manufacturing factory and created an interesting and entertaining story that informs the general public about events behind the news. The High-Tech stock scams have crashed to earth, outsourcing of jobs continues, oppressive taxes on wage earners has resulted in a zero savings rate. Could it get worse? Only with a pandemic. 
 I consider that this book is really useful for a person like me.. who have the principles about Dashboards but don't hnow how present the numbers in the best way.. 
 I have a love-hate relationship with PDF files. They are incredibly useful tools that solve lots of problems. They are unmatched for when you need to get your document turned into paper at the local print shop; you no longer have to figure out what file formats they handle at the shop, or worry about Windows to Mac conversions. As a webmaster, I also know they are the fastest way to have a version of your web pages that you know can be printed out with no problems. And of course they excel at what they were first designed to be -- a platform-independent electronic document that can be easily shared and viewed by anybody with a computer.  As a webmaster, I also see how PDFs are misused -- as a way of whacking together a website on the cheap, taking some documents that weren't necessarily designed to be viewed online and quickly and cheaply stick them up, whether that makes for a good user experience or not.  PDF Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools by Sid Steward illustrates both sides. These hacks include a number of highly useful ones that I immediately started to use daily. On the other hand, some of them also go to great lengths to get a PDF to do something that is probably better done in some other format -- such as HTML.  Let's concentrate first on how this book can help you. Like the other books in O'Reilly's Hacks series, it's divided up into sections. Here they are "Consuming PDF", "Managing a Collection", "Authoring and Self-Publishing: Hacking Outside the PDF", "Creating PDF and Other Editions", "Manipulating PDF Files", "Dynamic PDF", and "Scripting and Programming Acrobat". To get full value from this book, you have to be more than just a consumer of PDFs, using the Acrobat Reader or browser plug-ins. You'll need to be a producer too, most likely with the full Adobe Acrobat package (either Standard or Professional.)  Almost right away, I learned something in the Consuming PDF section that helped. Hacks 4 and 5 talk about Adobe plug-ins, where you find them, and how you can manage them to speed up Acrobat's start up process. Hack #5, on how to manage profiles, was the first of many hacks that relied on a script or add-in of some sort. In this case it was a batch file that you would use to call Acrobat.  If you create PDFs, you'll want to check out Hack 24, which explains the difference between smart, dumb, and clever documents. (This isn't some red state/blue state thing -- a document is smart if it uses tags to help define its content.). Hack 29 talks about how you can create either print-on-demand or e-books using Acrobat, if you want to get into the self-publishing business. And Hack 41 is a good explanation of the compatibility and incompatibility problems you get from moving between different versions of Acrobat. As a webmaster, I'm always looking for ways to save bandwidth, and Hack 60 shows how you can optimize, or refry, Acrobat files to make them smaller.  The final section of the book covers some fairly advanced topics, things that really do deserve to be called hacks. These include integrating tools like Perl, PHP or Java with Acrobat, controlling Acrobat with scripts, or using the Acrobat Software Development Kit.  On the other hand, there were a number of sections that made me think of the "If you are a hammer, every problem looks like a nail" saying. While you can create HTML front ends for PDFs, or use PDF forms for data collection, there's probably other solutions that may work better -- such as HTML front ends for HTML pages, or HTML forms. But the section at least shows the breadth of Acrobat's usefulness.  Even if you are someone, like me, that thinks Acrobat PDFs have a clearly defined but limited role, you will still find lots of tips in this book. If you are looking to maximize your investment in Adobe Acrobat, you'll find even more.   [... 
 I work in the mental health field and therefore see depression all too frequently.  This book is a fabulous resource that I lend to my patients, but have also enjoyed it on a more personal level.  Everyone goes through ups and downs in life, and Huber does a good job of normalizing depression, while communicating that sometimes it's *okay* to be in a rut.  Rather than looking for a fast and temporary solution (i.e., medication), she directs people toward developing insight into why they feel the way that they do and allowing themselves to feel it.  A fantastic book that I highly recommend 
   This is a good book both children and adults. Couldn't wait to read the next chapter 
 I have extremely wavy, thick dark hair that frizzes very easily (read: hard-to-manage and annoying).  I was so fed up with my hair style that when I went to the salon a few months ago, my stylist recommended this flat iron to me.  I had tried in the past to straighten my hair at home with various other flat irons (with harsh metal plates) and round-brush-hairdryer combinations, but to no avail.  I'm happy to say that the Vidal Sassoon Professional High-Heat Hair Straightener has lived up to its reputation by straightening my hair, changing my style, making my hair more managable, and continuing to demonstrate high quality in its design.  The highlight of this straightener is its 2 1/4-inch ceramic plates coated in gold.  The plates heat my hair from the inside to the out, creating smooth hair void of frizzies.  The straightener also boasts a 60-second heat up feature and has 25 heat settings to accomodate any hair type.  All you simply do is plug the unit in, turn the switch to on, set the heat level, and that's it!  The 170 watts pack enough punch to cut down on styling time, as well.  The unit's cord is short enough that it doesn't wrap up in a gigantic knot, but is long enough to move around my bathroom while I work on my hair.  The flat iron is also extremely compact: when finished, and after it has cooled off, I simply wrap the cord around it and store in a bathroom drawer.  It also fits easily into my suitcase when traveling.  Finally, maintenance of this flat iron is very easy.  Whenever the plates or outside handles become sticky with gel or hairspray, I simply wipe it off with a wet cloth.  Overall, I am very pleased with this straightener.  I have not had any problems with the gold coating flaking off or the unit burning up.  I like how the flat iron doesn't dry out my hair and that my style stays straight throughout the day and into the evening (rarely any frizzies).  In all honesty, the iron works so well that it only takes me about 20 minutes to style my hair in the morning.  I highly recommend this flat iron: it's the secret to straight, stylish hair 
 I positively loved this book!  A great story all the way through.  There is just nothing bad to say about this writer.  I liked it so well that I bought all that he had out which was 4 at this time.  I'm anxiously waiting the next one!  I generally get my books from the library but this one is one to share with all my friends and relatives and then keep 
 Although Cassandra Wilson has been doin' her thing for decades, somehow she still never seemed to get the popularity as other great female jazz vocalists have gotten. Still, Cassandra came back and made her latest album Thunderbird a disc of mostly covers. And she did it very well.  Like another legendary soulful songstress, Etta James, did on her latest (cover) album Let's Roll, Cassandra also chose not to necessarily do all soul songs, but rock songs with soul updates. This is especially shown on Jakob Dylan's "Closer to You". But Ms. Wilson also does well on traditional pieces, like "Red River Valley" and "Easy Rider". Original songs like "Tarot" and "Poet" further impress.  There isn't anything bad to say about this album, except that maybe people will probably wish there was more, considering it's a mere ten tracks in length. Then again, it's short and sweet, which makes it all the more entertaining. Cop it.  Anthony Ruper 
 My three year old grandsons, who are twins, just love this book. Everytime they come to visit, the first thing they look for is The Very Hungry Caterpillar board book. The boys sit and know every word in the book and sometimes read the story along with the The Very Hungry Caterpillar DVD. I had to order another copy of the book so each had their own to follow.  The story is easy to understand for their age and the illustrations are beautiful and very colorful 
 It says in big print on the back cover "Food = Happiness" and it sure does, if it's tasty, that is, and if you don't overdo it. I was a big girl in school, not big boned, fat, because I over did it. Now I'm thin, because I watch my weight, but I still love to eat, so instead of stuffing myself, I eat in moderation, but I don't moderate the taste. For me, food does equal happiness. It is possible to eat, love it, be happy about it and be thin.  Okay, that said, this isn't a diet cookbook. I don't really like diet cookbooks. I like good food, but as I said above, you don't have to overdo it. Though there are some recipes here that will challenge any girl's will power, like "The Simultaneous Orgasm" on page 82. This is a chocolate souffle recipe that will melt your lips to your lover's (the author recommends you and he simultaneously eat it, thus the title of the recipe) plus knock your socks off.  There is food for every mood, for every occasion, for dinner and dessert, in this sorta, kinda chick lit cookbook and strangely enough, I use it a lot. Of the zillion and one cookbooks I own, this is absolutely one of my favorites. Oh, yes, my favorite recipe in the book is "Smart Blonde Profiterole." Emmm, Good.

 Since most of you are probably required to buy this for class like me, this review may not be the most useful. But anyone thinking of buying this should know that it has every possible bit of information about Ancient Greek--and every tidbit, every little comment, is numbered. This means the student ends up reading a chapter, say, on verb stems, and reading numbers 1024 to 1112. Since the data is so organized, you'd think it's an easy reference, but no. If you're looking for something specific, it'll take some wading through numbers and symbols. Whatever you want is definitely in there--it just might take some time to find it 
 Being a Civil War buff for 40 years I found the book very interesting, although I would have liked more depth and detail. The articles are very dry and extensively footnoted, as they are historical papers. However, I bought it because I thought that it was more of Shaara's historical fiction. WHICH IT IS NOT! He only writes a boring, gratuitous preface (to get his name on the book?) I think it is false advertising. So, be aware what you are getting 
 A must read for anyone chasing their Native Heritage and regular readers as well.Vine Deloria is a renowned author and this book is his best 
 A real delight to go through this book by myself or with others and a cup of coffee.  The size allows one to view and exclaim over his techniques, composition, color and artistic gifts.  A must have for Art History lovers 
 Historically, a book had to be published in hardcover to be taken seriously by the media.

 I began getting sucked into the swashbuckling adventures of "celebrity couple" Percy and Margeruite after reading the first Pimpernel novel and when i heard about the musical i just couldn't resist!This cd is damn good!All the songs are terrific!I hadn't seen Douglas Sills before listening to the cd but boy, did he sound really charming and handsome.after checking out the website I was very very pleased that he looks like Percy the way i imagined him to be(foppish but adorable!)!Anyway, the only "flaw"(in my opinion)in this musical is Chauvelin's accent(it lacks the frenchie 'r's) but since he has a good voice, this "flaw" is forgivable.Percy and Margeruite's songs are just so full of heart and they are performed superbly!Kudos to Sills and Andreas!All in all the Pimpernel is tops and it truly captures the feeling of the book ("They Seek Him Here" even uses the actual rhyme from the book!I guarantee, you'll be listening to this cd religiously and feverishly for one week (or even longer) and you'll be in a constant state of LSS (Last Song Syndrome)! You'd be "demmed" if you didn't get this cd!      
 A key to Toynbee, fascinating in itself.  This is marvelous not only for its view of World History, but as an interesting example of writing style and expository method

 	The catalogue contains fine reproductions and interesting commentary. Of particular interest is Eric M. Zafran's essay William Bouguereau in America , wherein Zafran follows the rise and fall of Bouguereau among American collectors and critics. He includes many direct quotes from contemporary writers which piece together the "roller-coaster" of public opinion about Bouguereau's paintings. After reading the essay, one can understand how Bouguereau fell into disfavor in the 20th century among the cognoscenti, but has never really fallen out of favor with the masses. It would seem that Bouguereau's skill and finesse were such that he became a watershed in the late 19th century, resulting in the reemergence of the tired argument about the vacuity of academic art. Also of interest and delving into more detailed matters about training is Damien Bartoli's essay, "William Bouguereau the Teacher." Bartoli weaves together Bouguereau's warm and generous nature with his goals and ideas about the training of artists. If there is a lacuna in the catalogue, it is that there is little about Bouguereau's actual working method, or those of his students. As is often the case among writers on art, the bulk of information is biographical, which tells an incomplete story. There are also some careless uses of terminology, such as the definition of academies given on page 13, where such works are characterized as sketches. These drawings, as one can see in the four examples included in the exhibition, were careful and meticulous studies. Another term used in the catalogue is style, often in discussions about what Bouguereau's students may have derived from him. Given the mastery of craft demonstrated by Bouguereau, as well as the breadth and number of his works, style seems like a trivial term to characterize what made Bouguereau unique. The exhibition successfully accomplished the goal of showing the wide-reaching influence of Bouguereau in the works of American artists, which are diverse and often non-academic. Though Bouguereau had much less influence on American art than Gérôme, the featured works demonstrate that he trained painters in such a way that, with the exception of Gardner , they pursued their unique artistic visions. One is left, however, with the lingering sense of awe at the master's command and production, which greatly overshadows that of his students. 	Congratulations are due both Mr. Peck and The Philbrook Museum of Art for understanding the relevance of this master today and for a superior job in the presentation of the subject. This book will no doubt be a common feature on the shelves of artists, art historians, and collectors.  Steve Arme 
 This is a very well written "Wicca 102" level book that I would highly recommend to anyone who is serious about gaining a better level of understanding of themselves, how ritual really works and how to enhance the level of power in your rituals. 
 I think that I like this movie more than the original, but the original is still great. What is really good about this movie that makes it better than the first movie is the obvious return of characters we know from the video game series. It is great to see Carlos, Jill and the coolest of all, Nemesis in this movie.   There are many times in this film that make references to the games. It was fun watching and saying, "Oh that was on Code Veronica!" for example. The acting was once again really good, but the action and special effects really make this a fun movie to watch. IF you love the first movie, then you should like this one. Especially if you know the series and know the game references that are made. 
 This chronicle does two things, and it does them well.  First, it brings Tolkien's three closest friends (G. B. Smith, R. Q. Gilson, and Christopher Wiseman) into clearer focus than previous accounts have done.  Second, it provides the most full account in print of Tolkien's World War I service.  In that war, Smith and Gilson were killed.  Garth dispels the idea that Tolkien worked on early versions of his Middle-earth fantasy while in the trenches.  "You couldn't write," Tolkien said.  "You'd be crouching down among flies and filth."  It was, he said, "animal horror."  Garth shows that Tolkien grieved for the loss of his friends and needed months to recuperate from the "trench fever" that got him sent home from France, but did not become spiteful and embittered by the brutality of the war, unlike Robert Graves, author of Good-bye To All That.  Although Garth is exceptionally careful, for a modern biographer, about suggesting transferences or transmutations of his subject's experiences into his subject's writing, he guesses that, if not for Tolkien?s wartime experiences, Tolkien might have become known for the writing of relatively insubstantial fantasy in the vein of William Morris 
 It's easy to make (recommended measures are available online, and you can go a little more milk or powder if you want) and the package makes ALOT.  I like not having a 45 minute drive to get my favorite drink 
 Anyone interested in the future would find "Contemporary Futurist Thought" a notable resource that thoroughly reviews the various theories and paradigms, along with the modern thinkers and writers who made significant contributions to futures thinking.   Dr. Lombardo meritoriously examines the creative influences that emerge from science fiction, the systematic approaches taken in the future studies field, and the prodigious array of contemporary thought.  All the pertinent people and materials are recognized throughout, which makes this book a relevant foundation for both, students of futures studies and professional futurists.     His explanations regarding futurists' roles, purposes for futures thinking and his delineation of the disagreements within the field alleviates the confusion often felt by students and professional futurists attempting to decipher the field of futures studies or to establish a consensus of future foresight, which Lombardo acknowledges as a field that has "no unified community."  I highly recommend this book as a reference source for academia and as a refresher for professionals to enrich their perspectives on the direction futures thinking is headed. 
 Infamy is about artists going for fame. Pure and uncut through the decades it's all there. All the phat beats and mad stlyes are there but in the end thats it. The movie displays illegal crime activity and what happens next. Some flashbacks in the movie are pretty macabre. This is really though hardcore bombing in different cities. This is the essence of graffiti and it's a cry for props in a world of none 
 For 50-ishes, it's a great movie. Black & white take you back to memory lane. The story may not be as great. Gunga Din appeared almost mid-way of the story but his smile will melt you away 
 This is the standard work in the field, give or take some stuff Keynes wrote on risk and capital 
 When I got my first apartment, I bought The Joy Of Cooking, thinking I could make as much of a mess in the kitchen as I wanted without worrying about a roommate seeing it.  All I wanted to do at first was make a good beef stew (my own trials were OK, but nothing I'd share with anyone).  Well, in The Joy Of Cooking, the task was comparable to building a nuclear power plant from scratch.  Fortunately, I got this book for Christmas that year (2 months later) and have since made all sorts of dishes I wouldn't dare to try with the recipes from that "other" book.  Beef strognoff - fewer than 10 ingredients.  Mac and cheese - 6 ingredients.  Cheesecake - 4 ingredients.  And they all taste great!  I'd give this book 10 stars if it were possible 
 Great book.  This is a must read fro people who wants to understand the bigger picture about our life and existence 
 Ths work written in 1914 is not one of Wells'  great works, but is of interest because it is  reputedly the first use of the words "atomic  bomb", and recognises the dangers of warfare with a weapon of enormous destructive power delivered from the air. It is remarkably prescient  in the light of the date of writing 
 This is a great Beanie, nice and short so it just covers your ears, but not too short. Also, great quality and great price too!!! I would buy more if I needed more, but this is already my 4th Beanie, and so that's enough for now.  Sam Kochel  p.s. if you see me on the street and I am wearing my Beanie, just say "Hi" and I'll know what your thinking..."nice Beanie 
 I was expecting a more intense courtroom drama and mystery. While that was there to some degree, it is more a story of a small Mississippi town, and a crime and punishment that plays out over many years. I was not, however, disappointed. The lead character was ingriguing and he changed realistically with the passage of time. There is a good newspaper story and a friendship that grows between two very different people. Interesting and well-developed characters 
 This is a great book. In keeping with the high standard set by his book on the SR 71, author Crickmore offers many great photos and personal accounts of pilots and people involved. In both books he seems to have an extraordinary access and insight into the people and machines of the "black world". In addition to anecdotes, this book contains many technical insights and explanations, to really involve you in the plane and it's story. For any military or aviation nut like myself, this book is a particular treat. I was extremely happy with this book, and wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone. Also try his excellent book on the SR 71 
 A good account of the battle of Stalingrad. The first hundred or so pages are a very good summary of the war on the Eastern Front. The men who suffered in the trenches are the real heroes of the story. Toward the end the book became overly tactical. For instance I still do not understand what happened to cause the Germans to be closed into a pocket,thus bringing about the collapse of the Axis forces around Stalingrad. But then, why and how did the German counter-attack fail? Those troops caught in "Fortress Stalingrad" (as the Nazi regime propaganda called it) were not adequately supplied by the Luftwaffe and when ran out of ammo, food and supplies had to surrender. Only less than 10% returned home after the end of the war. When you read stories like this and imagine the fate of any brave and unfortunate soldier, who grows up in Nazi Germany, does his duty for his country and volunteers to go to war only to be consumed in the cauldron and the "black hole" of war, you can't help but stare in awe and fear at the collective and cosmic pattern woven by the political, social and historical forces at play. The individual's will and resolve, desires, hopes and aspirations are made null and dissolved into this abyss. Fate is not the right word. But how shall we describe the HUGE and beyond any human understanding horizon into which millions of men walked to their death?  
 I always need tissues when I read this book!  It has helped so much!  I teach preschool and one of my students lost his dog.  I gave him this book and Dog Heaven.  His parents said how much both books helped.  It is just so hard for children to understand death.  I think this book goes a long way in validating a child's feelings.  So often children don't know what to feel, they know grief, but there is so much more than that.  It truly helps when children know it's ok to be confused, hurt, and just upset.  I HIGHLY recommend this book 
 I love this book!  This is a powerful and thought-provoking book....it's helped me tremendously in my walk of faith 
 This is a great little receiver.  At the price I paid it's untouchable.  I wasn't even planning on buying a receiver but for the price I paid plus a $20 gift card, I couldn't resist.  Besides, it wouldn't hurt to upgrade the older Sony I was using that was relying on my DVD player's DD and DTS decoding.  I was reluctant because I had not done any research but I figured dirt cheap entry level cira 2006 had to be better than dirt cheap circa 2000.    After having tried it out, I'd have to agree with the few professional reviews I could fine.  One reviewer said if you didn't need all the bells and whistles of this reciever's older sibling the VSX-816, this one was sonically just as good minus 10 extra watts per channel.  CNet said the 816 was a much better value, but they weren't taking into account how much I had paid.  They said the 816 was an excellent value.  And The Perfect Vision named the 816 as part of their budget system of the year.  They said, "This receiver sounds good and works well, meaning it's nothing like typically wimpy-sounding budget AVR's."  So if what the reviewers were hearing was anything like what I'm getting from my 516, I think I made a sound investment.  As for the sound, it is noticably clearer than my old receiver.  It certainly has much more updated features than my older receiver including Componenet switching and 7.1 surround.  It does not, however, have s-video switching, but I was using an outboard switcher for lack of switching on my old receiver anyway.    If I were paying full price, I would definitely pay the extra $100 and go for the 816.  But then actually, I wouldn't have bought anything because, as I said, it wasn't actually in the plans.  I'm glad I got the deal though.  I'm very pleased with my purchase 
 I really liked this book!  I enjoy reading about and researching the Tudors (by researching, I mean reading existing research).  I have a book "All the Queen's Men: Elizabeth and her Courtiers" by Neville Williams.  I loved the reproductions of paintings in that book, and so tracked down "Gloriana" to see and compare as many pictures of Elizabeth as I could.  I must say the pictures are great, and plentiful.  The text is well written too.  It describes the art and explains the purpose of and evolution of the stylised portraits of Elizabeth.  It's not the book's fault, but it was missing some things I hoped to find, as follows:  few pictures of those close to Elizabeth (I shouldn't probably have expected this, but I like to look for family resemblances, and the looks of her suitors!); little text description of Elizabeth (based on the author's reseach, I hoped he'd tell us whether her eyes were blue or brown, how tall she was etc.  Hard to tell from the art - the colors and proportions vary); and finally, some portraits that are described in the text are not illustrated.  Not many, but I wanted to see more.  That being said, you can't go wrong with this book if you want to study the portraits. I am very pleased to have this as part of my little Tudor library!  (My copy is paperback, I have not seen the hardback. 
 this was john lennon's last good album.even 2 of the yoko ono songs are good (sister oh sister and born in a prison)attica state and ny city are great rock n roll songs.the best song is the luck of the irish.i've found the british to be very self-righteous towards america while forgetting about their own faults most notably their treatment and attitudes towards the irish.much better in lyric and melody than mc cartney's give ireland back to the irish lennon gives us song to be played on st patrick's day and every other day until england grants independence to its last colony.sadly after this album lennon never produced a noteworthy album;only old dirt road matches the quality of his first 3 post-beatle albums.  
 By far the best series of Go books for beginning to intermediate players. So much of success at Go, at least of the recreational player who does not have a huge amount of time to devote the game, hinges on mastering some basic ways of thinking about problems and "stances" that help to identify opportunities avoid pitfalls or common mistakes. This book continues the focus on these elements initiated in Volume I by concentrating on a small number of principles and skills that are the key to doing well at beginning and intermediate Go. This book, like the subsequent volumes in the series is written with the beginner in mind, but should by no means be ignored by even the advanced intermediate player--any player at any level who can truly master and consistently apply the concepts presented in this book will be a stronger 
 In this 17th chronicle of the detective monk, Brother Cadfael is asked to help to identify the body of a woman who was discovered when the monks of the Abbey of St.Peter and St.Paul began to till a field which had just been donated to them. The field was previously occupied by Ruald, a local potter who abandoned his wife of many years to become a monk, claiming that he had a divine calling from God, and the fact that he was leaving his wife neither free nor widowed, was immaterial. Local rumour has it that Ruald's wife, Generys, ran off with a lover and, as she was a very  beautiful woman who certainly did not appreciate being dumped, even for God, this rumour was generally accepted. It's the year 1143 and the civil war between King Stephen and the Empress Maud is still raging, with the armies of both sides doing great damage to the countryside and the people. When an Abbey in the fens was seized by renegade soldiers under Geoffrey de Mandeville, the monks were forced to flee to safety and one of them, a young man who was still a novice, comes to Shrewsbury. Sulien Blount is the younger son of a local noble family and begs admission to the Abbey to continue his novitiate. Sulien has a ring belonging to Generys and claims that he obtained it recently from a silversmith near the besieged Abby, which proves that she is still alive and so the body which was found cannot be hers. When the Sheriff, Hugh Beringar is commanded by the king to take a troop of soldiers to the fens to flush out the marauders, he takes the opportunity to visit the silversmith to find out the truth about Generys ring. Between them, Cadfael and Hugh discover the truth behind the body which was buried in unconsecrated ground...an unbelievably shocking thing in those times 
 I listen to books on tape constantly and when you get a reader and a story that can take you away, it is a find!  Nothing annoys me more than a poor or monotoned reader or one who places inflections in inappropriate places, like news readers.  I loved the sound effects coupled with an excellent reader and the two added to the experience of listening to this book.  I also liked that the story was partly done in first person.  The main character initially doesn't seem to have much to offer the world.....  Anyway, there are others who have diagramed the story, I just wanted to say, I enjoyed it and the way it was presented in audio version. 
 It's hard to believe this music is more than a quarter century old now. I think it would recieve the same kind of accolades if had come out yesterday. But it didn't. It came out in the summer of 1979. It was the summer before my sophomore year in college, my first summer away from home. For at least a week, anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable, I'd select side 1 of "Rust Never Sleeps." It took me at least that long to flip the darn thing over. And then, when I did, for the next week, anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable, I'd select Side 2 of "Rust Never Sleeps." My flatmates never complained.  Oddly, the songs I see getting the most grief in the reviews here are my faves. You don't really want to do without the swooping lead guitar, contagious handclaps, and hysterically funny yet politically cutting chorus of "Welfare Mothers," now, do you really? As for "Sedan Delivery," I have only the vaguest clue of what it's about, but it's sure a scorcher (and it's still hard to find a job). Allright, maybe we don't need two versions of "Hey Hey, My My," but which one would you delete?   As far as I'm concerned, there's only one song here that hasn't withstood the test of time: "Sail Away," which is innocuously pretty, but lacks the bark and bite of even the other acoustic stuff. "Trasher" and "Pocahontas" are both beautiful and mean in just the right amounts and places. Poor Marlon, poor CSN.  Do I wax nostalgiac? Perhaps, but not overly so. This remains essential Neil, which is to say as essential as rock 'n roll gets. It still sounds fresh and relevant. And fun. Did I mention fun? In fact, I'm gonna go plunk it on right now, maybe take a breather between "Sail Away" and "Powderfinger" to relive the LP experience. You should too.     
 This first-person account of a recent tragedy on Mt. Everest will keep you spellbound from the very first page.  The amazing descriptions will put you right on the mountain's peak with the climbers 
 It is hard to tell anyone working in innovation that the products or services they are developing today will fail. The future is uncertain, but on balance we believe it will be good. The past, though, is a different story, and 'They Made America' tells the remarkable tale of INNOVATION in the land of opportunity.  I use capitals for good reason. All too often, we mistake invention for innovation. It is one thing to be a creative genius, it is entirely another to build a multinational company as a result.  History is compelling. Someone had to invent the first automated plant (Oliver Evans in the late 1770s). Someone had the guts to aim for a 50X productivity improvement in cotton production (Eli Whitney's cotton gin). Mass marketing barely existed until a desperate Samuel Colt tried to push his now-famous revolver (he invented celebrity endorsements too).  I found this book an amazing validation for the new work that has been conducted by firms such as Imaginatik to expand our definition of innovation. Today's over-focus on R&D and cost reduction has blinded companies to the fact that the greatest achievements have come outside of known core business activities. Edison may be the father of electricity, but his protégé Samuel Insull made it cheaper and invented new business models (a chance glance at a shop window sparked the tiered pricing model based on time-of-day).  I cannot say enough good things about this book. My only complaint is that the book is physically too large for me to carry with me on my trips. It is a coffee table book of the finest order - I just wish I could read it on the plane 
 Joe Delesandro is great in this Andy Warhol movie. I watch it over and over. Not your ordinary theater movie 
 this was even BETTA than take the lead and that was off the chain! dude this music was amazing! the dancing was AWESOME!!! i just saw the movie today n OMG CHANNING TATUM...my boy...looooooked sooooooooo fine! but neway i dun even have the soundtrack but i MUST get it!!! dana *x<3x 
 I've tried a lot of different blotting sheets and these are the best. These definitely blot the oil off your face and leave just a little bit of powder so you look fresh. I've tried the Body Shop's and the powder free ones don't work as well, and the powder ones leave too much powder on your face. I love these things 
 I am in love with this musical!! The music is spectacular, the soundtrack is amazing and the movie is cute and spunky with the fabulous Julie Andrews. I was very excited when I found out that the sheet music to Thoroughly Modern Millie was available and I just had to get it!! If you like musicals or 1920's jazz, you will defiantely love this musical 
 I bought this game for my daughter's 4th birthday because she keeps beating me at regular Memory games.  She is challenged and loves this game!  I only put 10-15 objects at a time in the bowl for her and will keep adding to challenge her and keep her interested.  I also use this in my work as an Occupational Therapist for a variety of uses: sensory, pinch and grasp of small objects, as a memory game to teach people how to create categories of objects to help them remember a list of objects for just a few examples.  I have used it with all age groups and have gotten positive feedback from all.  My sister and I play (without the kids) and have laughed a lot as we watch each other struggle...the window that other players can watch through is ingenious.  This is an excellent game that can be adapted so many ways.  
 When I read the description of the book I thought that this book would actually provide information about everyday life in the 1800's; instead, it is merely a dictionary.  There are no passages that describe fashion, etiquette, industry, clothing, or anything else useful to a historian.  Instead, the book merely provides one sentence descriptions of objects you probabaly can already identify.  This book may be useful if you come across the name of an item in a primary text and you are not sure what it is.  However, it provides very little useful general information 
 This useful guide of book club favorites was given to me by a good friend,  and has really served me well. I loved the author's sense of intimacy with  both her readers and the books.You can see that this is a person who really  loves books as the imaginative creations that they are, and loves to share  them with others. It empowered me at the bookstore recently when I was able  to find new three books that I have since loved and shared, instead of  spending hours looking for something of interest. With 200 reviews, I look  forward to using this guide for quite a while. The author's book club group  in northern California sounds like so much fun that I hope that one day  maybe I could get an invitation .. 
 The basis for the Ray Milland film of the same name, and its 80s remake with Kevin Costner NO WAY OUT, Kenneth Fearing's THE BIG CLOCK is one of the most famous and most ingenious noir thrillers of the 30s and 40s. A magazine publisher much like Henry Luce has murdered his mistress in a rage; his top aide convinces him to pin it on the last man to see the woman alive (whose face and name the publisher does not know). They enlist the help of the editor of the publishing house's crime magazine to lead the manhunt--a man who happens to be the very one for whom they're searching. The existential implications of engaging in a manhunt for yourself do not seem to escape Fearing, but his feat with this work is to expand even beyond that. The publication house which forms the novel's central locale brings out magazines that cover almost every aspect of modern mass culture, from news to business to Hollywood to true crime. And, stepping even beyond that, because the novel's key figure also collects the art of an obscure painter (which becomes crucial to the central mystery), THE BIG CLOCK also interrogates the ways in which high art is itself dependent upon mass culture. Sometimes Fearing's book is too ambitious for its own good (the multiple narrator trick is not handled as deftly as you'd like), but on the whole its not only a tight little thriller but it also manages to engage intelligently with some of the most important social and cultural premises of its day. This is a book that greatly deserved to be rediscovered by NYRB 
 My six year old son loves to play the ICPS games and has shown a marked improvement in conflict resoution with peers.  He now knows the meaning of  the word "frustrated" and how to avoid frustration (and how to  avoid temper tantrums) by thinking of and evaluating his own alternatives  in many cases.  Instead of yelling or pushing to get his way, he offers to  trade or works out a deal for sharing.  It is a pleasure to watch his  self-confidence grow and his self-esteem rise.  As he grows older, he will  be able to think for himself and avoid being controlled by others or  becoming controlling himself.  This book has been helpful for the whole  family.  This Mom now has some training in how to model good problem  solving skills for the rest of the family, as well.  Communication skills  in our home have improved greatly at all levels due to Shure's book.  It is  one of the best parenting/communication books that I have ever read 
 The Story of the Heart is very moving.  The art is beautiful and the story is wonderful.  I've given this as an early Valentine's Day present to my wife, daughter, and mother, and they all love it.  So do I 
 Preacher is, without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest comic book series ever created (with Sandman, Hellboy,Moore's SwampThing and Hellblazer close behind). While the firts volume is fantastic, this second paperback is arguably the best and is what will show you what all the fuss is about. Once you read the story of Jesse Custer, you will have a newfound respect for comics, and you Will agree with Kevin Smith in his quote: ¨More fun than going to the movies¨ 
 Donleavy's humor insists there is something to laugh about in this world, but then you realise that what you are laughing out-loud at is, at best, something disgusting, or rude, or utterly insane...  chicken soup for the  soul 
 Best Scheherazade I ever heard. The performace was exciting and touching. The SACD provides so much details and dynamics of the recording that it makes me really feel that I was there.  
 This was an incredibly well-written book, but of course I mean 'well-written' in the David Foster Wallace sense.  Many of these stories take a more serious turn, and prove that even without his expansive sense of humor, Mr. Wallace is a cut-deep writer.  I like the fact that he seems to be kicking post-modernism/minimalism in the minimalistic pants.  I find Mason, Ellis, Raymond Carver, and that crew pretty tiresome.  In their world, nothing has meaning except meaninglessness  (which is usually a meaningless pose).  Mr. Wallace does take the self-conscious narrator route that John Barth used, but instead of ending up meaninglessly looking into a warped mirror, Mr. Wallace pulls his fiction out of self-reflexiveness by parodying that pose and pushing it out into ultimate meaning.  Spiritual, emotional union among human beings is in my opinion the crux of his stories, even if that union is best portrayed by its absence that crushes people's souls 
 This is the first Grant Green album I ever bought. This album is so subtle from start to finish. Superficially, it appears as a cool jazz album, but the bluesy melodic lines of Grant Green give all the tracks so much weight. This is definately the type of album that some people would find too mellow or laid back. But it turns out that repeating listening only makes you realize that the music is ironically engaging and complex. I normally don't even like vibes, but somehow Bobby Hutcherson can make vibes have balls which I once thought was impossible. After purchasing this album, Grant Green became somewhat of my obsession, as now I try to incorporate some of his ideas into my guitar playing. Lazy Afternoon is my favorite track on this album, with it's unique meter and incredibly introspective playing between Grant Green and the excellent Elvin Jones. Grant Green is often misunderstood as a overly simple blues guitarist in a jazz context. That's because he plays guitar more like a sax or drum as oppossed to the majority who sound more like pianists. The beauty is all in the way he plays with the rhythm and stretches his modal blues vocabulary. I've never heard anything quite like him 
 I loved this book.   Great characters and a compelling story.  I only wish I could read The Doctor's Daughter for the first time again.  
 Ever wonder what life would be like on a 60 billion gravity Neutron Star?  Right, probably not.  Well, this guy did.  And, he wrote a really good story about it.    Dragon's Egg tells a wildly imaginative story of the Cheela, a species of creature that lives on a neutron star.  As a consequence of living on a neutron star, molecular chemistry and life itself advances at a rate millions of times faster than us humans are used to.  The book tells their story from the Cheela's absolute beginnings when life began on the star all the way to their achievement of becoming sentient beings.  In this way, the author makes many interesting and funny parallels to how humans may have evolved from primordial slime to what we are now.    The story focuses on the Cheela, but also includes the side-story of a group of space-exploring humans who happen to be in orbit around the Cheela's home star taking studies.  What the humans don't realize is that their presence in the night sky has caused great influence on the Cheela; most notably their ever changing religious beliefs.  When the Cheela finally make contact with their supposed human-Gods, they have more to teach them than the humans have to teach the Cheela.  A really fun, imagination-expanding read 
 We in the Sixties cheered this film heartily.  Now it would be as popular as the Dixie Chix.  Such is the collapse of peace and our world cutlure and consciousness.  In the Sixties we understood war to be insane and immoral.  Now we are taught from our first film to kill the Other.  Watch this film from a "kinder, gentler" age and remember your own inner humanity, and how to love in peace.  Why are we here? Where are we? Where are we going? Are we having fun yet?  This film through theatre of the absurd responds to the universal and essential questions. General Geranium has such a finer grasp of questions of war than our Rumsfeld.  Watch this film as an antidote to our current elevated urgent war-mongering for fun and profit.  You may even once again dare to love the French people.  Peace, baby. Peace will win in the end because war does not create.  Private Pumpernickel convinced us the only way to drop out of an insane and violent society is to join the marginalized and rejected from society. Many of us managed to harm ourselves deeply in an effort to drop out. Seek life first, and peace.  And Love.  Such is to be human, and to live.  This is the best movie from that era and essential viewing for children and other living humans.  This movie frees us from that fear which sells wars.  It is a religious film. 
 When I heard that Sting was coming out with a new collection of music, I tried to stop my giddy grin, and went on and preordered it. When I opened it up, I was hit with a bit of surprise. For one, it was released on the Deusche Grammophon label, which usually devote themselves to classical works. Looking closer I saw that it was not an array of pop songs, but rather a review of the works of John Dowland.  Oh boy, am I in for an adventure! I thought and eager ripped off the packaging and into the cd player it goes.  I was enchanted right from the start. The singing is wonderful, there was only one really bad track, and even Sting reading from one of Dowland's letters to an influential courtier at James I's court was interesting. There's a haunting quality to the songs, music written by a man who was an outsider in the land of his birth (Dowland was a catholic in a fiercely protestant England), and from what the letter tell us, a man who was living on the edge between being comfortable and poverty.  Not all of the songs are great, and there are several real clunkers in this -- for me, I detested listening to Can she excuse my wrongs? but several others are haunting in their beauty and touch of melancholy. Slipped in between the musical selections is Sting reading from a letter of Dowland's, written in 1595, to an influential courtier in Queen Elizabeth's court, and Dowland is hoping that he can gain the patronage of Lord Robert so that he can gain employment and return to England. While at first, it feels odd to have the readings in there, but eventually you get a cohesiveness that makes Dowland's story all the more poignant.  The liner notes contain the text of the letter, song lyrics, an extensive essay from Sting talking about how he came to the music of Dowland and his study of the lute, and its bigger brother, the archlute. Several photographs are included as well, and the design is very beautiful throughout.  No, it's not a perfect album. Very few are, and there are always several clunkers it seems, and this one is no different. However, for sheer exhurberance, I give this one a solid five stars -- it's bold, it's something new, and I do have to applaud Sting for getting out there and stepping out of his role as a pop icon and trying something new.  No, not everyone is going to like it. Quite a few will hate this one, but if you want to hear music of the Renaissance performed by a masterclass musician, go on and give this one a try. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. 
 I admit to a total bias where McCullough's work is concerned.  This account made be feel it, hear it, smell it.  And it scared the bejesus out of me.  More topical now with the gulf coat problems and the reliance on our government officials to do the right thing 
 This trike has all the things I want in a tricycle. Yes, it is liable to tipping over, but I have been keeping my toddler on a straight path while she pedals on it. Its colors are so cute, and she loves the bucket in back. I attached a loud honking horn, so she can HONK like a real rider. All the children love this trike that play with her. I wouldn't recommend it if your child will play on the driveway or in an open space because, yes, it will tip over and you'll be disappointed 
 ...it is listening to her audio cassettes!  Dr. Weekes is such a great speaker, and she speaks very firmly, yet remains very comforting... it's like getting an audio tape from your mother (if your mother is a world-renouned doctor! lol).  Hope and Help for Your Nerves is also a great book to read, by Dr. Weekes, but I would almost recommend the tapes over the book for starters, just because you can put it in and feel like she is right there with you, helping you through your anxiety.  A must-hear 
 This is a book for the devoted O'Brian reader. It would seem really odd to a newcomer. For those of us who read and re-read the adventures of Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin it is an incomplete coda, but promised a deeper insight into their characters. I am just one in the legion who will always mourn that there will be no more adventures for Surprise 
 The authors, Dr. Freidman and wife Rose, marvelled that the free market price system marries buyers and sellers without central direction. This is done by transmitting only the important information consumers must know without the burden of government interference or excessive record-keeping. In the USA, the major productive resource is personal productive capacity which is human capacity. This human capital takes the form of compensation to employees in the form of wages, salaries and supplements.   The authors believe that common ownership will not provide the requisite incentives to maintain and improve property on an ongoing basis. For this reason,many structures in the old Soviet Union require extensive repair within a year or so of being built.  The book points to Hong Kong as the modern exemplar of the free market devoid of excessive government control. Accordingly, free trade (by the authors) should be offered everywhere. The book discusses the advent of growing underemployment and unemployment in the welfare states. In education, the authors prefer a voucher system to preserve freedom of choice in the inner city schools. The current mayor of NYC is attempting to provide free choice by opening a series of competitive "small schools" with admission by formal examination or prior scholastic excellence.   At the Agency level, the authors have called for deregulation to simplify business operations and recordkeeping. The remaining question involves the mechanism for doing this without losing total control. Too much free market has created some problems with Enron and other corporate entities. Clearly, exclusive self-monitoring does not operate to make every corporation do the right thing by the stockholders and the general public. The current challenge is how to have less Agency oversight without endangering the public's need for consumer protection on an ongoing basis. In addition, some readers seem to be looking for a perfect economic system or philosophy. In implementation, such a business utopia does not exist. There will be imperfections in every system due to the nature of human beings and behavior.  The work draws heavily upon Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations which combined the best of political freedoms with the individual right to pursue the extensive collaboration necessary to exchange food, clothing, services and housing voluntarily. Even in the old Soviet Union-Gosplan , voluntary cooperation was needed to resolve intractable central planning problems and rigidities, according to the authors.   In the People's Republic of China, the neighborhood work leagues have slowly absorbed some of the free-market organizational superstructures.  When H. Ross Perot visited China, he noted brand new factories and facilities on a 30-mile industrial highway . The challenge for the People's Republic is to incorporate the western management organizational designs and theories without losing the rigid governmental superstructure. These two goals are at considerable odds. Ultimately, Chinese consumers will come to demand greater freedoms, as more information becomes available from the World-Wide-Web and cultural exchanges with Western universities, global professional organizations, customers and consulting think-tanks.  Overall, the work is a classic. The contents are tempered by the consumer's need for protection against corporate greed and the stockholders' interest in enforcing accountability from management and the Board of Directors. In addition, consumers need the environmental protection against the excesses of industrial pollution. The authors provide a service in calling for the abolition of unnecessary regulations which interfere with the operational throughput of business transactions. No-one is saying that all regulation should be abolished.   Some reviewers have criticized Dr. Friedman's call for a freer market in the implementation of business systems. These criticisms should be placed in a practical context. The author is not calling for a total abolition of the quasi-governmental structures of the Federal Reserve and other governmental agencies. He is calling for a more meaningful regulation. Clearly, the reviewers' criticisms must be counterbalanced against the excesses of Goshplan and the large unemployment or underemployment in some socialist systems.  On the other hand, capitalism needs rigorous oversight by the private and public sector to forestall the conditions which brought about the Great Depression, sweat shops, child labor exploitation and fiduciary malfeasance in the investment community. The private sector cannot monitor itself exclusively due to client opinion-shopping and the non-cooperation of some managements with internal auditing. There is still a need for an independent Board of Directors with a powerful and independent audit oversight function. The existence of government agencies will complement this effort by the private sector. Recently, the Securities Exchange Commission has strengthened controls in favor of protecting investors.  The Quasi-Reorganization in Bankruptcy provides an independent mechanism for a company to start over . In this situation, the retained earnings is dated- usually for a period of a decade. In addition, there is a fair financial disclosure of the events which precipitated the bankrupt condition. During the period of a re-start, the company can examine both profitable and unprofitable operations. This dispassionate self-analysis should lead to the company emphasizing strength areas and shedding the less profitable ventures.  The volume should be read by a wide constituency of business people and academic researchers-everywhere. Clearly, Dr.Friedman has produced a considerable scholarship even after winning the Nobel Prize in Economics. A strength of the presentation is that it is understandable to the average American consumer. The overall gist of the book is that the free market is color-blind in the conduct of economic transactions across the USA and the world. Since the free market is color-blind, it is a good forum for conducting business transactions 
 An excellent text that shows the interrelationships of the rooms in the House of Quality.  I require all my consultants to read it 
 This book marked a departure from Sedaris' previous works in that it was mostly a memoir and there was very little fiction in it.  David Sedaris' adventure (and misadventures) in college, hitch hiking, plus candid moments in his family history and as an apple picker/processor is both entertaining and piognant.  Many think of Sedaris as a humorist, but there a many keen observations about life in his writing.  I especially liked his account of his visit to a straight nudist camp 
 this book was so grafic it got me hot all ove 
 The book by Michael R.young on financial fraud and accounting irregularities is a commendable work. In the corporate world and financial management, some lessions are required to be learnt from this book.The book gives sophisticated advise on checking financial frauds. some of the learnt lessions can be applied to check related frauds in India 
 This is my favorite blues CD ( I have more than 400 !  ). Furry's voice and guitar at the best. This record always moves me a lot. This is a solo recording, but sometimes you may swear that there are two guys playing  guitar. All tracks are good but John Henry; When My Baby Left Me; Judge  Boushay; Casey Jones; Frank and Johnnie and I'll Turn Your Money Green  deserve a thousand *stars* 
 This book is potentially the most important book for beginner and intermediate computer users to purchase.  As I read the horror stories I felt like the authors had peered into my life and the lives of many of my closest friends.  It taught me so many things without making me feel like a complete idiot.  It also settled my mind to know that I am not the only person making some stupid mistakes with all this technology.  Thank you Jesse Torres and Peter Sideris for writing this book 
 I have to say, when I bought this book, I was skeptical. I love GRRM's series, 'A Song of Ice and Fire', and being his latest work, in contrast to 'Dying of the Light' which is over two decades older, I had very high expectations.  However, my expectations were most definately fulfilled. I was left with a permanent engraving of Worlorn and it's people, and I have fleeting memories, as if I'd spent time where myself.  As always, GRRM's ability to draw in his readers is well shown, and my permanent attachment to Dirk, and "Jenny" will last long long after I turned that last page.  Thank you again George 
 Tempe Brennan starts out her second adventure exhuming a grave at a small church.  Tasked with identifying the bones of a nun, she's just getting adjusted to the Montreal weather.  In the middle of the night, she's called onto the scene of a terrible fire that turns out to be rife with murder.  As Tempe works on her two cases, she also returns to her Stateside home and continues being drawn into a macabre web featuring a cult.  At the same time, her sister is exhibiting strange behavior after her latest divorce.  Kathy Reichs is a practicing forensic anthropologist who has somehow found the time to write bestselling fiction.  Lately, her life has also led to a television series called BONES.  Although the Tempe Brennan of the television show is little like the Tempe Brennan of Reichs's novels, they're both worth reading and/or watching.  Max Allan Collins has written a novel based on the television show.  I really enjoyed the forensic aspects of the novel, but there were several instances where I almost felt bowled over by everything that was going on.  Tempe's relationship with her sister, Hari, is dead-on and accurate, feeling very real and very troubled.  However, DEATH DU JOUR also felt hurried and too relaxed at the same time.  There was a lot going on, but it took a while for everything to come together.  Kathy Reichs is still turning out one of the best forensic series out there, and I'm a fan of the television show.  DEATH DU JOUR is a fun, educational read that mystery and crime scene fans will enjoy 
 " For the Roses" is probably Joni Mitchell's least recognized work that merits rapt attention. Other CDs are fabulous, close to perfection, but "Roses" delivers in a way that positions it as among the best of Mitchell's recordings.   "Blue" was amazing, no denying that. How could an artist top it? Mitchell imposed an exile on herself after the tremendous response to "Blue" for reflection, study, a time to get out of the race. The result was a musical jump that carried a maturity that wasn't exactly missing in previous releases, but discernable growth is obvious.   " Banquet", the opening track, is such a panoramic view of the way people were dealing with a complex society. Again, fairly simple terms, but loaded meaning. " Cold Blue Steel..." chronicled the crushing lament of addiction; mired in the squalor while unable to resist.   "Lessons in Survival" seamlessly flows into " Let the Wind Carry Me", a suite that says to lover and family " I love you, please accept my essence."   " For the Roses" provides the first glimpse into Mitchell's disenchantment with the music industry... it's also an open letter to help her friends in the business cope with the fickle nature of entertainment. "Judgment of the Moon and Stars ( Ludwigs Tune) " is a thoughtful ode to Beethoven, talking of him being "condemned to wires and hammers"... or, in laymen's terms, the cold comfort of his piano.   Intense, isolated  study served to increase Mitchell's doubt about absolute truth, but it also formed the basis for an overlooked masterpiece. Incidentally, her first top forty single came from this CD; " You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio" is a campy attempt at appeasing the DJs who control the fate of the much needed "hit". It works, though, in the context of light moment among serious depth. 
 I enjoy picking this book up everyday and reading a passage or too.  It is very inspirational and motivating.  It gives you something to reflect on and think about throughout the day.  Something positive 
 Just loved this CD!!!!  You'll be singing or humming this to yourself for hours after you hear it.  If you are 35 years old or older you'll LOVE it.  The memories will come flooding back to you.  Enjoy it!! 
 If you love the 80's then you'll love this movie.  I first saw this movie when I was about 13, right then and there I fell in love with it.  It's about a guy trying to do anything he can to hang out with this girl on his college team.  He's so wound up in her that he himself gets kicked off the mens team and ends up posing as a woman just to be next to her.  This movie has comedy, drama, sports, and love.  That's everything you could ask for in a movie.  This is definitely one to buy if you like tennis and you like cheesy movies.  It's my favorite movie ever, I can quote it line for line 
 this is an awsome book my mom had to help me with a few basics but it realy deserves 5 stars!!! if i can do it am adult can do it!!!trust me it is an awsome book 
 This book should be present in every home or worker. It's simple excellent 
 This is the first book by Debbie McComber that I've read. The Shop on Blossom Street books tells the story of Lydia Hoffman, who  has overcome cancer and now realizes her dream by opening a shop in Seattle called A Good Yarn. Her father, who was her rock during her cancer battle, has died, so she is scared but determined to succeed in this venture. She knows her father would have encouraged and cheered her on. Her first three customers couldn't be more different, they have come to the classes for reasons of their own which don't necessarily include learning how to knit. As these three women learn how to knit and watch their first project, their baby blankets take shape, they find themselves easing into friendships. They soon begin to help each other with their projects as well as with the different issues that affect their lives. Lydia too, grows and matures; she becomes a stronger person as she gradually learns the business, overcomes a second cancer scare, and  attempts a reconciliation with her older sister. She also begins a tentative romance with the handsome parcel delivery man. By the end of the book we find the 4 women forming lasting friendships and we hope that we will see them again in a new book.     . 
 it is a very good product. fits and feels great. but cannot be used in conjunction with the gloves for a heavy bag. 
  The third and last of her novels set in North Carolina, this coming-of-age story centers around the shy 17-year-old Evie Decker. Everyone around her basically ignores her, but she sets her eyes on rock-and-roll guitarist Drum Casey and begins doing things to attract his attention. One thing she does is carve his name into her forehead with scissors one night at the bar where Drum plays.   Their relationship rollercoasters for a while until Drum proposes marriage and they elope. Things really start going bad for Drum, and Evie tries to help him out, to no avail - until she comes up with a brainstorm: Evie decides she will concoct a kidnapping of Drum by his fans, which ends up being a disaster (from bad to worse, as the book's title implies). Evie's father dies of a heart attack shortly after and then she discovers she's pregnant (even more slipping-down). She wants Drum to move into her father's house with her, but he refuses, and she dumps him.  Although some of the scenes seem a bit far-fetched and unbelievable, Tyler's portrait of Evie is sincere and assertive. The most interesting theme for me involved the symbolic use of a mirror: when Evie carves her forehead near the beginning of the book, she steps through the mirror she is standing before - like Alice in Wonderland, stepping into a different life. At the end, when she tells Drum that it was other people who forcibly cut her forehead, she looks into a mirror again and steps back through it into "reality" again. The novel still has an apprentice feel to it, though Tyler by this stage is showing growth and maturity in her work 
 This book is filled with the unpublished teachings of Dr. Ernest Holmes, author of the Science of Mind and Founder of the Religious Science movement.  As you read this book you feel a sense of sitting in the classroom with Dr. Holmes.  His inspiration, enthusiasm and dedication to Truth is infectious!  This is a brilliantly edited masterpiece.  This book truly illustrates why the Science of Mind is the Philosophy for the New Millennium.  No one has given us the Truth of Being as clearly and easily understood as Dr. Holmes since Jesus.  Thank you and bless you, Marilyn Leo!! 
 I used this cd to help me plan which songs I wanted to use for each part of the wedding.  This cd helps you suggest the placement for the prelude, processional, ceremony and recessional.  The cd mainly has classical songs, but it does have a few of "today's" songs.  There could have been a few more songs they could have added.  But overall, its a good cd 
 I have been Dj'ing for over 20 years now. I have listened to a heck of a lot of Hip-Hop music over the years. I have the wax on this as well as the tape(and now the CD!) There are 10 tracks on this album and 7 out of them are simple classics. Of course, some of the tracks are not top notch but the lyrics overshaddow the track on most if not all Eric B and Rakim songs anyway. How this MC is not reguarded as the best of all time by everyone is beyond me. There are not many tracks of others that to this day you can go back and say 'damn, he said that!' This is a must have to anyone who gives a &$%# about hip-hop 
 Not quite the quality of the centennial from years past, but still, over-all better than other brands we have tried. Be prepared for shedding the first two or three loads, then it gets better. Very absorbant and nice texture 
 Just in time for Halloween comes Mr. Masek's exhaustive tome on celebrity resting places.  His crisp style brought ME back to life, and it's clear to see that the topic holds more than a passing interest to him.  I learned much more than I expected in plowing through the near-500 pages, and I can only hope to see the author on TV soon.  I don't know what he plans to do for an encore, but I'll be buying it 
 It was Great. All Korn fans will love it 
 A good book, with a really interesting mathematical treatement to different simulation techniques, but a little bit complicated in some aspects 
 I first stumbled across this book when I was trying to learn to make a pie crust.  I had tried everything from the little sticks to the frozen crusts, and nothing came out the way I wanted it.  I found this cookbook on a shelf in the used book store, and liked the way the instructions were written.  I tried the pie crust instructions inside the book cover and was delighted with the results.  Try anything in this book, from the maple pecan pie to the chocolate tea bread to the snickerdoodle cookies, and I think you will find the instructions simple, straightforward and easy to follow, resulting in a  pastry you can be proud to serve to anyone 
 I bought theese knifves to start out my first kitchen, I can't belive how amazing they are. Usally i struggled with my parents old knives just to cut things like tomatoes. With theese knives I am able to slice tomatoes effortlessly. Dicing things like garlic and onions is a task I usued to leave for the food processor, but belive me you feel like a professional chef they way you can run these knifes through foods. WARNING: They will make you want to cook more than you do now! 
 This is one of the most expensive electronic purchases I have ever made but it was worth it!!!  I don't know why so many people are having problems.  I did receive a software update last summer that repaired a weird glitch with the remote controlling my TIVO/DIRECTV receiver, but that's it.  Bose is very helpful over the phone.  This system beats any 5-6 speaker system I have ever owned but I don't recommend it for a large room because you do have to depend on the speakers bouncing off the walls since there are no rears.  I don't know why so many people say it won't play their discs.  Mine plays everyting from DVDs to CDRs and even bootleg DVDs!!!  Maybe they should call Bose and get the free software upgrade.  Here's a bit of advice before purchasing anything this expensive:  go to a Bose Outlet Store, Best Buy or Sears and listen to it before you buy it!  I bought mine in November of 2004 for about 1700.00 from Best Buy when it was still new, and now it's dropped almost half in price in almost 2 years. Shame on you Bose 
 While Jeff Beck was pioneering hard-edge guitar so was Eric Clapton.    This album unveils perfection of what would become his quintessential style.  "What'd I'd say" and "Key To Love" are standouts.  An Amazon ranking consistently around 1000 testifies to the timeless importance of this album 
 This collection of essays are the author's descriptions and reflections on aspects of life in rural Alaska.  It's not a story of pioneering or stone age lifestyles, as the title "living among the eskimos" might suggest.  Rather, Jans gives a vivid picture of how the lives of rural Alaskans are like a collision of the old and new worlds.  It is a world of snowmachines, TV, and basketball, and caribou hunting.  Nick Jans lived in the villages of northwest Alaska for decades.  The reader benefits from his sense of the most striking or moving experiences he has collected and his perfect, crystal clear prose.  I came away with the sense that Jans loves Alaska and when you read the book you can feel it yourself.   I also highly..HIGHLY recommend his more recent book that incorporates stunning photography with essays 
 Seriously, this is the funniest frigging show I've seen come out in the last couple of years. Can't WAIT to get this DVD. The concept is totally original--it alternates between seeing these couples in their everyday lives, and seeing them in the therapist's office--except you the viewer are in the therapist's seat, because the couples are talking right into the camera. The improv is relentlessly brilliant--if you're a Gen-Xer or thereabouts, they nail the humor. For points of reference, I'm a huge fan of SNL and Family Guy 
 This book is the best because it explains everything very well with little information... if you are a student definetly by this book.. 
 String theory has been criticized since it was first invented but not to the degree that it has now, this criticism mostly focusing on its failure to connect with observation. The criticism has increased dramatically in recent years however, and some of this has been too vituperative to be useful to those curious about string theory as a viable physical theory. But criticism, however harsh, can be healthy, since it motivates the proponents of a theory to more carefully elucidate its foundations and content. This is usually not the case when a theory is popular, as researchers are in a competitive spirit and are hesitant to share the knowledge to possible competitors. At this stage in the game however, string theorists it seems are now on the defensive, and have thus taken the time to discuss in-depth what this reviewer still believes is the most complex and beautiful theory ever constructed in mathematical physics. String theory still has a long way to go before it gains status as being a physical theory, but hopefully by the end of the next few decades one will see the appearance of charts, graphs, and numerical calculations in books on string theory, much like one finds in the most successful of all physical theories to date: relativistic quantum field theory.  Some highlights in the book that are particularly insightful include: 1. The observation that Dirichlet boundary conditions (for the open string) break Poincare invariance, but that this leads to the introduction of Dp-branes as positions of the endpoints of the open string. Poincare invariance is recovered as long as Dp-brane is space filling, i.e. has a dimension one less than the background spacetime.   2. The view that the BRST quantization of the path integral is really a conformal field theory. This is interesting in that BRST analysis is typically thought of as a procedure for quantizing constrained systems (gauge theories being predominant examples).  3. The `Myers effect'. Sometimes referred to as the `D-brane dielectric effect', it is part of an attempt to understand the physics of non-Abelian D-branes for strong fields. One of the challenges in this understanding involves the validity of the Dirac-Born-Infeld action in these kinds of circumstances, which as the authors remark is designed for situations where the background fields and world-volume gauge fields do not vary appreciably over the distances on the order of the string scale.  4. The origin of the (classical) Virasoro algebra as the freedom of choice of gauge in the reparametrization symmetry. And along these same lines, the quantization of the Virasoro algebra is defined to the normal ordering of the Virasoro generators, and their commutators give an expression consisting of the ordinary classical term plus a "quantum" correction, the famous central extension. Thus the quantum Virasoro algebra can be viewed as a "quantum deformation" of the classical Virasoro algebra, with the central parameter as being the deformation parameter. This philosophy of deformation has found generalization in what are now called `quantum groups' (even though strictly speaking they are much more complicated objects than ordinary groups).  5. The connection of the dilaton to the Euler characteristic.  6. The role of the GSO projection in insuring consistency in the state spectrum.  7. The use of (vector bundle) K-theory to classify D-brane charges. This use arises when it is realized that the conserved R-R charges cannot be identified with cohomology classes of gauge field configurations. Instead, the D-branes are classified by K-theory classes.  8. The discussion on `primitive cohomology' and its relation to de Rham cohomology and Hodge theory.  9. The role of the Born-Infeld structure in ensuring Lorentz invariance of the T-dual description. The Born-Infeld action was once viewed as a mere historical curiosity, namely as a nonlinear generalization of the Maxwell theory, with no experimental backing. That it finds such a natural place in string theory is very interesting (but still of course lacking in experimental support).  10. The derivation of a lower bound for Newton's constant from heterotic M-theory, which is close to the observed value.  11. The argument, beautifully elucidated in this book, that type IIA supergravity may be obtained from 11-dimensional supergravity by dimensional reduction.  12. The discussion on warped space-times and the gauge hierarchy. The authors cleverly motivate this subject by asking why Newtonian gravity follows an inverse-square law rather than an inverse-cube law.  13. An entire chapter is devoted to "stringy" geometry, which is a fascinating subject given that it touches so many areas of modern mathematics.  14. The discussion of the `hidden sector' and its conjectured relation to dark matter and supersymmetry breaking.  15. The author's treatment of the AdS/CFT conjecture is superb and is by far the most interesting part of the book. The dualities shown to exists between gauge theory and string theory are a possible route to a full understanding of nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics, which to this date has defied resolution.   Some major omissions or discussions that need more elaboration include: 1. The difficulties that are actually involved in quantizing the Nambu-Goto action. The authors remark that this is due to the presence of the square root, but it would have been interesting if they would have indicated just where the trouble rises explicitly when a quantization procedure is attempted with the Nambu-Goto action. In ordinary quantum field theory, the presence of the square root is interpreted as a "nonlocal" problem, but even there this issue is not usually dealt with in a manner that is very transparent.  2. A more detailed treatment of string field theory for those readers who want to compare it to what is done in second quantization in ordinary quantum field theory.  3. The role of the Beltrami differentials in the attaining of a measure for moduli space that is invariant under reparametrizations of the moduli space.  4. No in-depth discussion of characteristic classes over and above the algebra involved in their manipulation (i.e. the wedge products). An understanding of characteristic classes is crucial to understanding superstring and brane theory, but the pages of this book mislead the unsuspecting reader that there is nothing to characteristic classes except algebraic manipulation of the differential forms. But characteristic classes have a deep geometrical meaning, and obtaining insight into this meaning has been proven to be difficult for students of string theory. This book does not provide any of this insight, nor do any of the other books currently in print on string theory.  5. Is supersymmetry absolutely necessary for the incorporation of fermions into string theory? The authors seem to argue that it is, but an explicit proof is lacking.  6. The proof that `threshold bound states' are stable is omitted, disappointing the more mathematically sophisticated reader. As the authors remark, the proof involves a special type of index theory involving non-Fredholm operators, and where one must deal with a continuous spectrum. The usual index theory breaks down since one is only dealing with elliptic operators, and contributions to the index from bosons and fermions do not necessarily have to be integers.  7. The authors should have included more discussion on mirror symmetry, beautiful subject that it is.  8. Dp-branes are asserted to be useful in incorporating non-Abelian gauge symmetries in string theory, in that they appear "naturally" as confined to world volumes of multiply-coincident Dp-branes. But is this the best way to introduce these symmetries? Is there a method, other than this one and `compactification', that is just as "natural" and does not have the contrived element that the introduction of Dp-branes sometimes has?  9. The authors need to elaborate in more detail on the definition of "stable" and "unstable" D-brane.  10. The omitting of the proof that string theories are ultraviolet finite theories of quantum gravity. This is by far the most serious omission in the book. This reviewer does not know of a reference that proves this assertion, and many in the physics community have pointed to this omission as being a sign that the string theory research community has been misled by false assertions of proof. 
 I was looking for a complete podcast solution and this is really the one.  Instead of worrying about what mics to buy and what interface to use, this is really podcast equipment for someone who wants to plug and play.  Instead of worrying about cables, interfaces, mics, etc, it's all here.    Yes, it comes with Audacity that you can get for free, but let's face it, if you're not hooked in, searching for it on the web might not be your thing.  It has podifer and Live Lite 4, and while you don't really need them, they're helpful.  One of the values of this package was that I got started podcasting the same day.  The ease of set up was a bonus here.  One recommendation though.  There's not much in terms of user guides, but you can get at the full user's guide for Audacity on the web.  I haven't played enough with the other software yet to make recommendations there 
 This book was very helpful and excellent in obtaining an understanding of this very complex disease. It describes why the patient exhibits behavior out of social norms. It also helps the caregiver to better help and understand the patient or family member. I can definately relate having taken on the care of a loved one with this disease for more than five years. I've read many books on the subject but found this one very easy to understand and could relate to it the best from past experience 
 I have used this book in a course I teach in a Web Development Curriculum at a Community College. The material is directly on target with many examples and case studies. Some of the end of chapter projects indicate sites that are no longer operational and the book's web site does not list that in its errata section but should. The inclusion of lots of statistical material on electronic commerce is excellent 
 I read this book after reading the Foxfire book on blacksmithing in my quest to learn more. Bealer goes into great detail about techniques and tools of the trade. I would recomend this book to anybody interested in taking up blacksmithing as a hobby. A word of caution is in order here though; no book can teach you all of this skill. I would recomend, in addition to reading this book, locating a smith or a college with a blacksmithing course near you and talking to them to really learn the trade. That being said, this book is a great and accurate introduction to the art. This book is economical enough that even if you don't pursue blacksmithing as a hobby, you won't be out too much and will still have all of that wonderful knowledge 
 This book has that unique ability to make you feel as though you are learning something while, at the same time, make you feel like you knew nothing until you opened the book. Schaeffer is a good writer and has good observations 
 Bought this book when we learned we were expecting because it was "the thing to do".  It contains good information, but after reading the first few chapters, it seems to offer little new information as you progress through the months.  I wish it had more detail on a week-to-week basis, but overall it is a good resource 
 It wasn't the most entertaining of books, but heck I didn't read it to be entertained.  I wanted a girl and this was my last chance.  We tracked for 4 months and we not only got pregnant immediately, but we have verified that we are expecting a girl in May.  I have friends who tried the method, but not with the level of committment that it takes.  They were unsuccessful and admitted to not following it precisely.    So if you really want to choose the gender of your baby then it is worth the read and try.   You never know 
 If it's one of Sabrina Jeffries's scoundrels, I'd seduce him any day! :-) I loved every page of seductresses and big, strapping soldiers. Amelia and Lucas were a well-matched pair of adventurers. As always in Sabrina's novels, the plot was riveting, and I really felt attached to the characters by the end. Great, fun read and I can't wait for the Scottish Scourge 
 This album is great.    I would just like to add the previous reviewer Donald mentioned another live album that is just one of my all time favorite live albums.  It is called "The Fightin' Side of Me".  It is a little tough to find though because it is on a double CD.  If you search for "Just Between the Two of Us" you will see "The Fightin'Side of Me" which has "Harold's Super Service", "Medley: Devil Woman, I'm Movin On, Folsom Prison Blues, Jackson, Orange Blossom Special, Love's Gonna Live Here" "T.B.Blues" etc...It is truely an incredible album 
 This book is divided into two sections.  The first one is an introduction to the techniques and materials used for bookbinding.  The technique are illustrated with clear drawings to show you what to do.  I don't know anything about bookbinding so I can't tell if this part of the book describes best practices, traditional techniques, or modern adaptations.  I can say, however, that it was perfectly understandable and clear.  The materials are all common and easy to find...though I would have liked to see more brand names mentioned, just so that I was EXTRA sure I was getting the right stuff at the store.  The second part of the book contains instructions for a series of projects.  Unless you are a pretty good artist, there's no way you will be able to reproduce these incredible miniature books since many of them include original artwork.  But WOW, are they cool to look at!  And of course you can design your own pages using stickers, clipart, cutouts, rubber stamps, or anything else.    Keep in mind that when the authors say "miniature," they mean it!   The projects are all very small.  (The techniques section in front will help you learn how to make books of any size, though. 
 Bertie Wooster's bachelorhood is under threat and this forces an unwelcome return to Totliegh Towers. A great Wodehouse cocktail follows.. But this one might not reach up to the high standards set by Wodehouse himself 
 The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) is more than just standardized testing.  In this book, the Wrightslaw team leads a clear path through NCLB, explaining important aspects such as requirements for qualified staff, the ability for children to transfer from dangerous schools, and more.  Although I started out skeptical of NCLB (and still have issues with standardized testing), reading this book showed me the positive sides of the act and how it can be a powerful tool for parents 
 What a beautiful, strange new opera! This is a hall opera since it was commissioned not by an opera house but by a hall. So in addition to the stage, the orchestra also plays a visible role in the opera. Even the pages of the score are part of the music making.  In addition on stage three women play water and paper, as well as a chorus who plays paper and stone. Tea is a love story about a Japanese prince who loves a Chinese princess. It is a strange plot revolving around the book of Tea. In seeking this book the princess dies and the prince retreats to a monastery. In spite of the oriental deistance Tea is quite accessible. It is sung in English by an international cast and conducted by the composer. Anyone interested in modern opera should check out this totally unique work. Its beauty will haunt you long afterwards 
 one of the boldest of the bold.  kudos to mr. iles for having the guts to take on the sexual apologists.  nambla has been put on notice.  this is work of pure satisfaction, from the death of every pedophile to the resurrection of our hero, cat.  another worthy pile of words from mr. iles, despite his ignorance regarding black people.  the dialog is downright embarrassing, but keep trying mr. iles.  if you hang out with african-americans rather than watch them on tv, perhaps you'll get 5 stars next time 
 Joseph Sax does an eloquent job of retracing the history of national parks with an emphasis on the differences between what was intended and what has been implemented. He writes not only of how our reserved lands are viewed, but also about how different sectors of the population believe these lands should be used (or not). What is particularly effective are his discourses on the different populations and the feedback effect We have on shaping policy for reserve lands. This is a very interesting book that anyone who considers themselves to be an "advocate" of wilderness or of the idea of the outdoors, would do well to read 
 This is a great book for anyone interested in collecting books, or who likes books, or even anyone just interested in what makes a book collectable.  Different people adopt very different approaches and strategies to book collecting and Basbanes documents a number of them.  The eccentric madness of it all is what makes it entertaining and I found that this quickly became a hard book to put down.  After reading this I suspect that I will never look at books the same way again.  The fundamentals of book collection are not unlike other forms of collection, so people who are self confessed "collectors" (You know who you are!) are likely to find this an exciting read.  In among all the entertaining yarns is a pretty good starters guide to book collection, and this book contains a number of practical pointers to web sites and book sellers to get the novice started.  Overall it was really enjoyable to read and very much a page turner 
 If you want to reduce your livestock health costs by doing your own fecal exams for parasites, this book is full of information and photos that you cannot do without!  Thanks to the spiral binding, it lies flat beside my microscope for easy reference and accurate identifications.  I use mine monthly 
 Tokyo is a big place (a banal, but accurate comment) and Kennedy has selected a wide variety of fascinating out-of-the way places to visit.  When I used this guide, I endlessly beguiled by some of the "little adventures," although others were less than enticing.  With 39 to choose from, however, there's a suggestion for people with wildly different tastes.  One note: this is not a comprehensive guidebook, and the maps (especially for "A perfect cup of coffee") are a bit sketchy.  If you have trouble reading maps and get lost easily, it's a good idea to cross-reference Kennedy's suggestions with other maps 
 Bunyip Bluegum the Koala leaves home because he can't stand the sight of his uncle's whiskers in the soup any more.  He meets Barnacle Bill the sailor and Sam Sawnoff the penguin, who own a remarkable pudding.  Every time you cut a slice from the pudding, another one grows in its place, you can eat as much as you like, the pudding lasts forever.  What's more, you can change the pudding to any kind you like, it can be steak and kidney or plum duff or jam roly poly.  The pudding is apt to get discontented and starts complaining if it isn't eaten enough.  Such a desirable pudding is naturally at constant risk from pudding thieves, and the three friends have their work cut out   trying to outwit the sneaky Possum and Wombat who are always trying to steal it.  This is a very funny story with lots of action and a great many fights, it should appeal to anyone who likes humorous fantasy 
     The book, The Catcher in the Rye, written by J.D. Salinger, tells of a series of events over four days of the protagonist's life. Holden Caulfield has numerous flashbacks as he narrates his story to a psychiatrist. The reader sees the main conflict between Holden and his inner self, as he is unable to handle the pressure of being a teenager and the rejection of society. The story is told in first person as Holden talks directly to the reader. This is an important literary device as the character begins to lose his mind as the story goes on. This way the reader knows what Holden is thinking and can see that his thoughts are troubled.      The story takes place in numerous settings beginning with a boarding school in Pennsylvania and ends with Holden wandering New York City. The story starts out in a comical mood as Holden makes various impressions of people he knows and he likes to get laughs from people. Yet, he is a rebel who does not want to conform to what everyone else does, and therefore is left out and isolated from the rest of society. One of the main causes of his depression is the death of his younger brother, Allie.     I would definitely recommend this book if you are looking for great read. The book relates to kids in high school and is a funny, yet emotional book with a likable main character. The only weakness in the story is in-between the climaxes when there is a decline of action as Holden roams the city. The book includes profane language, sex, and violence and therefore is not appropriate for children under the junior high level.  
 This book was very descriptive. It had a theme, and stuck to it. It is historically  correct, but I don't think it's appropriate for younger kids. This book talks about dieases, and losing one's home and family. It's good for those kids in Kindergarden, but even then, that's pushing it. Overall, it's an okay book 
 Khan was the most popular singers in the Indian subcontinent. He predominantly sang qawwali, the music of devotional Sufism in a unique style that appealed to followers of sufism and music lovers all over the world. Not many people know that he had announced plans to record an experimental album with Luciano Pavarotti. Besides, he was also invited to perform with Madonna, but health problems waylaid all plans.   This collection of recordings from 1978-1982 is one of his best work. I have always enjoyed his original recordings more than his remixed music and  therefore to me its an ultimate pleasure to have this set in my collection. This is the original music Nusrat always enojoyed singing more than any of his remixed or westernized versions. It is the music coming from the soul of the person during the time he was still unknown to the most of the world.   It is a relentless endless joy peaking into tears, resting into calmness; a simmering beauty.If you let yourself listen with the whole of yourself, you will have the pure feeling of flight while firmly rooted to the ground. You dont need to understand Urdu and can still hook into the story that he weaves with  this wordless voice. This is the sensational character of Qawwali,the music of Sufis and voice from heaven 
 I thought this book would have Ashley and Bright Magic in the book much more often than they were, because they were on the cover and on the back they were mentioned in it, it was mainly about a horse named Boxer and his owner, Hank who has Alzheimer's. 
 Frank Abagnale Jr. stands as one of the greatest con artists of all time. The story is inflated at times (in the introduction he claims to turn on the autopilot of a commercial jet liner, a task that in fact requires the actual ability to fly the plane to begin with). Still, the Catch Me If You Can is engaging, and Abignale's scams combine inventiveness and good humor. Enjoy 
 This DVD is very easy to follow along with.  You can feel how hard your core is working with the first moves-and you feel it hours later.  The whole body is involed in the-not just your core. I purchased this and Pilates for Dummies.  I feel like I work much harder and got better results with Leslie Sansone.  The Dummies video didn't work the whole body as well as this.  I wish Leslie would expand this to a series and make more.  I would definetly buy them 
 This is a classic to me, Tech havent released a album in 4 years.. and than he drops this, the expectations were high within his fans and just hiphop fans in general.. he always makes that musik that stands out.. it dont sound like no other musik in the world.. Tech N9ne - Everready is 100% the best album of 2006...!! if you havent bought this already.. you should.. 
 "Did you know that long, long ago people made clothes from animal skins? It's true! Did you know that long, long ago people made tools from animal horns? It's true!" This question is asked about different aspects of Native American life eight times, and the last one says: "Did you know that some people still do these things today? It's true!" Different tribes are featured performing the tasks, without being named. This is a basic introduction to Native American life for early readers. The illustrations by Andy Newsom are soft and warm and emphasize family. 
 I once saw the play Clouseau's character has been inspired with... This is when Clouseau's explaining Hercule the circumstances of each murder, on the blackboard, anyway it's all I can remember of it now but the most obvious common point are the amazing inscriptions on the blackboard, like you can find  in some Road Runner cartoons, too... Michel Roux made the French success of Tony Curtis and the Persuaders TV series, and did the exact same for Peter Sellers in the Clouseau movies. Frankly, I don't see how this film could ever be funnier than in its French version, and anyone can't watch it that way is missing something... 
 I found it better than the 1954 version. I liked the "leviathan" better than the squid, and the rest was just BETTER 
 The first thing to keep in mind about this wonderfully macabre Halloween horror flick is that the plot has very little to do with Washington Irving's original story, in which Ichabod Crane was a schoolmaster, not a New York City detective sent upstate to solve a series of murders. Having said that, though, Tim Burton's film is a beautifully scary piece of work. (He has said he deliberately included a lot of the feel of Disney's 1949 animated version.) I love Johnny Depp's slightly histrionic, over-the-top performance as the neurotic Constable Crane -- and the wild-eyed Christopher Walken is perfect as the Hessian swordsman with teeth filed to points. I don't think Christina Ricci is all that attractive so I don't find her a convincing love interest, but whatever. Among the excellent supporting cast, Ian McDiarmid ("Senator Palpatine") and Miranda Richardson are especially good, and Christopher Lee even has a small part. The cinematography is dark and stormy, the trees are gnarled, and Danny Elfman's score is quintessentially spooky 
 Being British myself I am proud of this, however living in  region 1 area, I am appauled. Why is it that they are now playing season 11 or 12, can't remember which one, but we can only buy up to Season 3. Also why is it that a TV show which is made in, set in, and first shown in the US can't get on DVD before the UK. Amazon.co.uk are already selling Season 4, which was released to them in MAY!!!!. Another prime example is Friends. When I was trying to buy season 4 from amazon.com, the UK were already starting to sell the 1st half of season 10 (the second half was only just being shown for the first time - yes they had season 10 before it had even finished airing)I am aware that this is to no fault of Amazon but to the networks themselves. It is so frustrating, because by the time they actually get on and produce them, half of us will be in our 40's/50s and won't be bothered with it anymore and there go the sales. Yes I love ER and think it is a great show, but who know what better shows may come along before long and take the ER fans away 
 Like true R&B, it seems Zhane (like their male sonic contemporaries, Tony Toni Tone) have gone by the wayside. With apologies to Floetry, Kindred the Family Soul and Jaheim, et.al. fans alike (of which I am also), these ladies embodied a pure essence of Soul, which has been unmatched by today's so-called "Neo-Soul" artists. This CD, which still remarkably sounds as fresh now as when it first appeared on the scene over ten years ago, is as musically satisfying as ever.  Tastefully produced by hip-hop producer Kay Gee, it should be noted as amongst the best ever in the post New Jack Swing era.   In these times where how an artist looks seem more important than how they sound, we have seen the death of true R&B. However, we can enjoy this release and wonder what might have been if they were still releasing albums today 
 This was the soundtrack album to the Monkees movie "Head".  Unfortunately the Monkees popularity was dwindling, and both the movie and the album bombed.  I think it's a shame, because there is some of their best work on this album, and certainly their most psychedelic.  The album is a collection of songs and sound bites from the movie.  I will do a review of the songs:    "The Porpoise Song" - One of the Monkees most psychedelic songs, and definitely one of my favorites.  Everything about this song is great, and it really should have been a hit.  I think perhaps this music was a little too advanced for the Monkees audience (which were mostly younger children) and that's why it didn't do so well.  10/10  "Circle Sky" - This version of "Circle Sky" is the studio version.  I'm not really sure why this was included over the live version from the movie, but it's certainly nowhere near as good.  You can barely hear Mike's vocals, and it just sounds poorly produced.  I usually program the live version from the bonus tracks in place of this.  5/10  "Can You Dig It" - This is one of the two songs written by Peter for this album.  This version features Micky singing, and is yet another very psycedelic song.  9/10  "As We Go Along" - The flipside of "The Porpoise Song", and a very relaxing, enjoyable song.  Another underated song...I seriously think that if some of this stuff had been released maybe a year earlier it would have been a lot more popular.  10/10  "Daddy's Song" - Has that older almost 20's feel to it.  It's a pretty cool song, with a catchy beat.  Davy's vocals aren't the greatest though.  6/10  "Long Title: Do I Have To Do This All Over Again" - Peter's second offering for the album, and another great song.  This one has some nice guitar work, and is once again very psychedelic.  10/10  Those are the only songs from the actual album, the rest are cool sound bites from the movie.  There are some good bonus tracks on this cd...the best, in my opinion, being the live version of "Circle Sky", which is from the movie.  There is also a version of Peter singing "Can You Dig It", and Mike singing "Daddy's Song".    All in all, a great offering by the Monkees, and I think it often gets overlooked as some of their best.    
    This is a great movie but the references are getting a little old. They are like from the 80s. Otherwise watching turtles running around with swords is very interesting 
 I played Natalie's live CD at the ice rink during a general skating session as an experiment in music choices.  The kids and adults loved it!! I now get 4 or 5 requests every Sunday to put the CD on. A couple of the figure skaters even are going to use parts of her music in their skating programs.  It is definitely music to skate to! 
 I love Steve's idea to record these wonderful Disney Tunes - Who knew I would love them all over again - and discover a few I had forgotten completely about.  Just like the Sinatra CD - I have given this one away to my son who loves Steve's other CDs and who is a big  Disney Fan as well as being a musician himself, I had to share with him how wonderful these recordings were.  Thanks to Steve - this has become one of my all time favorite CD's. I hope he does another CD real soon 
 The authors give a detailed treatment of various aspects of nanocomposites. They describe numerous fabrication methods, like a thermal spray approach, or mechanical alloying. Plus, unsurprisingly, how to use carbon nanotubes as a basis for composites. Another large group of methods revolves around using polymers. Where carbon nanotubes can also be used.   Though the most interesting section to me was on using biological ideas as a template for nanocomposite construction. Intriguing, though still preliminary work.   The sheer diversity of approaches is a good sign of a promising new field. While the tone of the text is basically that of research, you may be able to design industrial productions from some of these ideas 
 This CD is a terrific blend of popular songs and songs that I didn't even know existed but have come to love!  If you like pop hit radio, this CD is for you 
 This is a collection of plays written by suffragists of the time to be performed before small groups.  This is intriguing--it shows issues very prominent in their time that are unthought of now--unadulterated milk, for instance.  This is an unusual and delightful resource for those interested in the women's suffrage movement 
  Aaron neville with an impossible voice tell us about our time: catastrophic invasion of water in Louisiana. It comes again. They want to wash us again. Eric Laurent, from France spoke about this artistic gem. And I say it is like  beauty for Keats a joy forever. Manoel Motta from Rio de Janeir 
 I ordered 6 of these from J & R Music/Computers (went directly to them because I could only order 1 or 2 from the Amazon website at the time) to save on shipping because my last nail brush w/a single row for nails was purchased from Avon 32 years before.  I found that if you use the same brush over and over the single row of bristles seems to splay (spread out) and not able to get under the nails as when new.  Since we have them placed in the kitchen and 2 bathrooms I found that the less used ones seem to stay in better shape.  I ended up purchasing 6 more when Amazon.com had them for sale recently (with free shipping this time) and hope that alternating use of more than one will cause a better lifespan 
 This was a wise purchase made after several books were reviewed from the library. We wanted to have a resource handy and this made sense since it covers the first five years and not just one. We like that it is objective and not full of opinions like some books. Sometimes things are hard to find in a pinch (hence only 4 stars) but overall there is a great deal of useful information and the book is organized well. I'd have given 4.5 stars if I could 
 I bought this book few months ago and it was interesting to go through it step by step. As a leader the first thing one must learn is how to deal with subordinates. After going through the 8 laws mentioned in Chapter 3: Leading Subordinates, one can imagine how less we focus on the people who are our main assets. A leader's success depends upon the success of his subordinates and these 8 laws are the basis for that success. One need to read each law multiple times so that it gets engrossed in one's heart. The "Performance contract" is a must for everyone to set  clear expectations.   The examples provided in the books are mostly based on author's experience and I found Feiner very sincere in putting them straight. Overall a must for anyone who wants to build lasting relationship with their people 
 There is a 2006 3rd edition available from Amazon which does not get linked here for some reason.  I am buying that to replace the first edition which we have used for many years.  Hikes are sorted by area, well described and rated for difficulty 
 What a remarkable book!  There really aren't that many stories of WWI aviation that I haven't read, so I was delighted to find this one on Amazon.  It's written with marvelous attention to detail and with a great sense of authenticity.  Often I had to pause to look up a word that has fallen out of usage these days.  As other reviewers have mentioned, there are no "knights of the air" in this story, just young men doing a job the best they can.  In fact, the story's protagonist often finds himself mourning the deaths of the German airmen that fall to the British Vickers machine guns.  My only complaint (a minor one) is the cover:  It shows an SE5a in a dogfight.  Tom and his squadron fly the now-famous Sopwith Camel.  Altogether, a great read and a book that I will re-visit from time to time 
 For those of you who have read the book you will understand what my title means. The wonderful laugh that is ready to send terror through the heart of the agent of the French Revolution, and chills of excitement and happiness through yours. And a song bearing despair and hope.  This is a wonderful book! I started and finished it within a day. The first chapter is a little gruesome but not overly so, seeing that it is set in the  French Revolution. If you keep reading though, you are caught within two chapters. The entire book is an emotional roller coaster. So if you don't like books that will keep you up till all hours of the night reading, this book is not for you. The Scarlet Pimpernel is one of the most wonderful men that ever didn't live. And so let us all break out and ask, "Is he in Heaven? Is he in Hell?" "That demmed elusive Pimpernel."  - 
 I feel that this book is actually stronger than Alice Miller's last two efforts ("Breaking Down The Wall of Silence" and "The Truth Will Set you Free.")  I have read all of her books thus far, and was very delighted to page through this new encounter.  I have never seen the concept that our emotions, and the 'scars' left by abuse don't simply exist in a little part of our brains; but are found in all the cells of our body, and that in this inextricable link, illnesses can occur when things go wrong.  I need only to look back to the way my own body has reacted to deception and cruelty to see how true this is.    In her chapter titled 'Carousel,' she revisits, in a way, the fascinating passage in 'Banished Knowledge' where she discussed coming across the poisonous story of little children and the accusative santa clause.  This is, in my feeling, one of the best assets of her prose; the ability to make links based on a single experience.  The case histories of authors she provides are not the in-depth ones of her earlier books; and indeed, that is exactly what she intended; to spark the readers interest in these biographies and how the writers experienced their abuse which led to the destruction of their bodies.    The chapter she wrote on anorexia was actually very enlightening;    she really said something important in those pages, and I think her 'fictional diary' was really effective.  The relationship to food and emotional nourishment seems quite valid.  After reading her book, I really do agree with the premises that "the body never lies," and "deception kills love." I can see more clearly that sacrificing oneself towards the 'benefit' of one's parents is really a destructive, black hole that people who fall in can never truly meet with any form of life or vitality unless they escape it.  
 For anyone who enjoys mechanics or robots, physics, or simply loves the art of Lego building, the latest series from Syngress is sure to please the most devote fans, and newcomers. Excellent 
 I find this book to be a wonderful read.  Whether truth or fiction.  It is left up to interpretation.  All history is distorted in one way or another.  OK-- to say Black Africa made no contribution to  Iberia is crazy!!!  HELLO!! Will someone get out a map of the world.  Miscegenation has been going on since the beginning of time.  AND  Arabs are not WHITE, they are people of color, dispite complexion.  DNA means everything, color means nothing.  They are white b/c they are more tolerated than darker skinned blacks.  What about really dark Italians, Greeks, Turks, etc... do they have Arab ancestry or African?  I bet most would choose Arab b/c being African/Black has negative stigmas associated with them.  Africa is a beautiful country and was always black until other neighboring countries invaded the coastline and mixed with the locals to create exotic looking offspring who then conitinued to mixed with non Africans.  Africa has contributed more than slaves to the rest of the world!!  I am so tired of ignorance and STUPIDITY!!  Use common sense 
 First, note that this book is a true sequel. Make sure you read The Golden Compass first, as this one is really a continuation.   The narration in The Golden Compass essentially always followed Lyra, the main character. Lyra is joined in this story by fellow protagonist Will Parry (who is from what seems to be our world), and the narrative alternates between what is happening to Lyra, to Will, and sometimes to Lee Scoresby (the Texan balloonist) and to Serafina Pekkala (the good witch). Because this novel is balancing several intertwining plotlines, it doesn't manage to keep the same pace as The Golden Compass; but it's still exciting, and the plot very much thickens.  After Lyra leaves her world (in the end of the last book), we start to learn a little bit more about the force that powers the alethiometer. I've always been cautious of the alethiometer, especially because it doesn't merely answer positive questions (Is Will's father alive?) about also normative questions (What should Lyra do next?). Remember Arthur Weasley's counsel from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: "Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can't see where it keeps its brain."  All of the intersecting plot lines show that a major revolution is afoot, one that affects not just Lyra's world and not just Will's world, but all the worlds. Lyra and Will both seem to have great roles, and Pullman concludes this book with a significant cliffhanger: be ready to leap into The Amber Spyglass.  As with The Golden Compass, the unabridged audiobook (narrated by the author plus a full cast) is excellent, in a league with Jim Dale's readings of the Harry Potter books 
 There is no doubt that James Page is one of Canada's top landscape and wildlife photographers. For this book he set out on a year-long journey across Canada and the United States, photographing prairies through the four seasons. The result is a magnificent document, illustrated with exceptional photographs, some of which will take your breath away. This is a threatened landscape, treated with love and passion. Page's written commentary provides a highly readable accompaniment to the photographs. As Candace Savage writes in the Forward: "There is a fierceness in his work that I admire, and a fearlessness.  He has to be some kind of fool, perhaps a holy one, to be out there with his camera in the half-light of dawn, in the glare of lightning, in the bloodless glow of winter.  The wild prairie matters in these images." As a photographer myself, albeit an enthusiastic amateur, there are few photography books that I have been this impressed by, and I recommend it very highly. 
 I spent 8 months writing my own handbook to include in my puppy packets, and then comes Jill Swedlow's beautiful book answering even MORE questions than I did! This easy reader touches every aspect of the dane including one  of the most important topics: How to find a REPUTABLE breeder with quality  dogs, complete with interview tips for the novice. Both author and  contributor clearly have an in-depth knowledge and lifelong commitment to  the breed.  Excellent work Jill!...and also to Lyn Richards for her section  on obedience...an underlooked sport in Danes 
 If the family you grew up in had no boundaries- you need this book. It explains and gives practical advice on situations in which boundaries are needed and how to set them. Ms. Katherine even gives examples of what to say. This book was very helpful to me.    
 I just got done writing a fairly long review, so I'll be brief with this one. I highly recommend this book, as I recommend all of P.D. James' books. If you want an author who keeps things fresh and entertaining, then you will definitely enjoy this book. Maybe this isn't James' strongest book, but that doesn't matter. She's a master, and she deserves well above four stars. For these people below me to knock it down makes me wonder if they really know what a dearth of great authors are out there. But I can see their point, since James has set the bar so high with all her books before this one 
 I FIRST READ THE MAGIC YEARS IN 1968 AS A SOCIAL WORK STUDENT; LATER THAT YEAR MS. FRAIBERG VISITED OUR AGENCY FOR CASE DISCUSSIONS.  I REREAD THIS BOOK SEVERAL TIMES DURING MY OWN CHILDRENS' PRESCHOOL YEARS TO BRING ME CLOSER TO THEIR REALITY. PARENTS ARE IN SUCH A STRATEGIC PLACE IN A CHILD'S LIFE DURING THOSE YEARS PROTECTING, GUIDING AND DIRECTING EMOTIONAL WELL BEING.  THE MAGIC YEARS FOCUSES ON THAT PERIOD OF DEVELOPMENT THAT SETS THE STAGE FOR EMOTIONAL WELLBEING THROUGHOUT THE REST OF LIFE.  MS. FRAIBERG LOOKS AT THE NORMAL STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT RATHER THAN THE DEVIANT AND PATHOLOGIC.  
 This is simply the best account of the Black Death ever written.  It manages to be simultaneously scholarly and readable, while enscapulating a rather amorphous subject and constantly amusing and engaging the reader 
 As always, Anne Coulter proves why liberals are so afraid of her. Not only is she refreshingly blunt, she's also 100% accurate. Liberals hate her because she isn't fooled by their camouflage...she see's right through it. Another great book to check out is Liberals Are Killing America by Stephen H. Easley...get as much info as possible...the liberals must be stopped 
 All of the ingredients were present to make Dragon Bones the perfect novel: the characters were so developed and complex they practically jumped off the page; the plot was multi-layered with interesting twists and turns; Lisa See's engaging writing style and pace made for an enjoyable read; and the depth of information about Chinese culture and way of life rounded out the storyline.   I would recommend this for anyone looking for a five star engrossing read that you just won't be able to put down.    I read one other book by the author, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, which I also loved, and was impressed by how different this novel was, and yet how much I enjoyed it. Clearly, Ms. See is an extremely talented writer capable of tackling very different types of novels. I can't wait to read another of her books! 
 This is  great movie for fans of Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. It's also a great movie if you are a lover of classic movies.  It's a good comedy, and Hepburn and Tracy are terrific in this movie genre. Some people will find it interesting what technology was like about fifty years ago and the effect it had on people at that time.  It's the kind of comedy that will keep you laughing without getting raunchy or unpleasant.  Baby boomers will enjoy this, and so will younger people.  
 As a child who lived through the 1950s polio epidemic and a pediatrician who trained at the end of the iron lung era, I thought I knew this history. The story is much more complex than I imagined and yet written in a very readable way for any history buff or interested layman. This is a story that is not only fascinating history, but examines the roots of many of our our current institutions and practices, i.e. medical research, the NIH, politicization an popularization of scientific issues, the media, fund raising, changing medical ethics, our current hygienic standards, etc. It's a story that should be read by today's college students not only to give an appreciation of the very human scientists who conquered polio, but also to stimulate skepticism and critical thinking about the scientific issues in today's newspapers. David Oshinsky's Pulitzer Prize for this remarkable book is well deserved 
 I don't know if there is a better way to attest to how good the book is than to say: I have made things in this book for special occasions without testing it first.  I know her recipes are that good!  I don't make any desserts that the recipe didn't come out of this or the cookie book.  I just wish she'd write a third!  Everyone loves my baking, and I owe it to Rosie.  
 If you like traditional and bluegrass music with tight harmonies and innovative use of instruments, you'll love this album.  This is not simply roots music, but roots music at its finest, showing theinfluence of layers of cultures and music styles, but well-incorporated with the Anglo-American musical tradition that forms the substrate from which these songs and pieces derive.  The greatest gems here are "Foreign Lander," a duet of voice and bass with amazing, heart-rending and shivery harmonies; "A Few More Years," a violin-voice solo with all of the above characteristics; and the title cut, Fiddler's Green," a modern ballad written in the traditional style, with musical borrowings from sea chanteys and gospel.  Nice versions of several traditional ballads, e.g. "Fair Flowers of the Valley" (Child's "Babylon") and "Pretty Fair Maid" (Child's "John Riley").  I bought this CD several months ago and it's still in my top-5 playlist 
 This book is a fascinating and unique book on jazz, gender, and race.   Thoroughly researched and beautifully written, Swing Shift documents the  central position black and white women musicians played in the Swing Era  and World War II.  Sherrie Tucker combines oral histories with archival  research, producing a stunning record of what history books can be and what  jazz women are.  Most amazing is the author's analysis of race and racism  as structuring aspects of the music industry, jazz history, and  contemporary accounts of the 1940s.  Swing Shift is the most accomplished  book on women, music, and race that I have ever read; it is a gift as  remarkable, talented, honest, funny, and captivating as the women musicians  Dr. Tucker researched and loves 
 I love this book! It is cheerful and has a great message. The advice the author shares is common-sense advice that we all know we should be following, but often we get off-track and too negative. Each chapter is short and to-the-point, with lots of cartoon illustrations. I have underlined almost the entire book, because each page offers more great advice. For instance, the first page I flipped to says this: "A person embarking on a day's march would be foolish to carry enough provisions for a lifetime. Is it not strange, then, that many people carry around all their worries for the next 20 years and wonder why life is so difficult?" The author has several other books out there, but this is his best 
 Whether it's the "Iliad," exploring the nature of the warrior, or the "Mahabarata"," explaining politics, the great stories are always with us and provide illumination to our seemingly modern lives.  With "The Great Indian Novel," Shashi Tharoor shows us that "everything old is new again."  "The Great Indian Novel," is a re-interpretation of the Mahabarata framed in India's struggle for independence, and the political aftermath of colonization.  The famous make their appearances under altered names, and Mr. Tharoor manages to make the Mahabarata current while making modern Indian politics somewhat understandable.  The book is also very funny.  I don't know if this is a book for the casual reader, but if you're interested in India I think you'll find it quite fascinating 
 This is a very interesting prediction of what health care may hold for us this decade.    I enjoyed reading forecasts of what the population will be like and their lifestyles, as well as buying habits.   Health careers that will be booming were discussed as well as what medical advances will flourish.   I found it interesting that this publication does not really predict a nursing shortage as everyone else is predicting.   The discussion of insurance plan growth and changes was less interesting to this reader but necessary 
 It is rare to find a nonfiction book that, if read, will render the reading of other books on the topic almost superfluous.  Yet that is the case with "Pursuit of Oblivion."  Richard Davenport-Hines has set himself the very ambitious task of chronicling, as the subtitle states, "A Global History of Narcotics", and he does it well.  Nearly 500 pages of salient prose are presented, assiduously researched and encompassing all corners of the globe and all illicit substances of note, from early experimentations with opiates (the first known narcotic) right through to designer drugs and the explosion of the club scene at the end of the past millennium.    Great pains are taken to explain not only the origins, but the proliferation and subsequent legislative backlash against each drug as well.  Liberal use of quote and anecdotal evidence are inserted to keep the text flowing throughout.  The body of research undertaken by Davenport-Hines is commendably daunting.  The ongoing Drugs Wars wages unsuccessfully by every modern nation are exposed in all their folly.  A various times, prohibitionists have attempted to promote the idea of drug user as moral deviant, criminal, hedonist, pedophile, rapist, psychotic, and unapologetic vagrant, none to great success.  As Davenport-Hines navigates the history of drugs, a recurring theme emerges, one which the author states directly in the Prologue: "It is not the supply of a drug that turns a user into a criminal, but the illicitness of that supply."  Simply put, making drugs a crime creates a world full of criminals.  And, in a world increasingly dominated by the "destructive idealism" of American uber-moral drug policy, this book proves a welcome elixir to the scourge of narcotic fear-mongering that has spread throughout much of the modern world.  Lamentably, (as the book shows) this is a debate that has been raging in contemporary society for hundreds of years, and one in which both sides of the dispute have precious little interest in hearing the views of the other, as both have long been self-assured of the validity of their claims.  It should not be lost on the reader that those who would most benefit from studying a book such as this will be those who would least seek to give it credence.  Nowhere will you find such a number of cogent, concise arguments against the ineffectiveness of anti-drug legislation, and such a formidable body of evidence against the reigning cabal of would-be substance eradicators who govern over most of the world's nations today.  But alas, this book, like countless others which preach an ethic of sense and sensibility regarding drug production and use, will be condemned to the fire by moral imperialists who inveigh against the turpitude of even giving such issues public discourse.  An invaluable reference for scholars seeking to prepare work on the topic, but equally suitable for the curious and open-minded, full of wonderful anecdotal ammunition for the next time you find yourself asked to defend more liberal drug laws, "The Pursuit of Oblivion" very adequately fulfills the task it sets out to achieve.  If there is one complaint, it's that perhaps this book is too comprehensive - in an effort to explain it all, there are parts where the anecdote is overwhelming, and the evidence almost seems excessive.  But if too much of a good thing is the worse offense a scholarly work can be accused of committing, it makes the efforts of the author no less laudable. 
 My husband and I are considering adopting an older child, but several books were recommended for reading, this one included.  I can't say it's helpful when it comes to adopting a child over 4, but I can see it being very helpful for adoptive parents  with young ones discovering what adoption means 
  . . . and that would be "All Day Long." The track absolutely soars. Getting my vote for New Order's most musical song, it features tuneful guitars and lush orchestral treatments. Bernard Sumner's subdued delivery avoids exposing his vocal limitations.  The tracks I also like a lot: "Paradise" (laid-back rocker, twisty and sexy), "Weirdo" (rocking, cool, even though Sumner's voice is overextended), "Bizarre Love Triangle" (one of their best melodies, great lyrics) and "Angel Dust" (kinda frantic tune with some strange Middle Eastern-style undercurrent). All of them are dance-worthy except "Weirdo," "Bizarre Love Triangle" being the big hit (deservedly so). "Broken Promise" is pretty good/OK. My copy of BROTHERHOOD also has "State of the Nation," not their strongest song but pretty trippy and upbeat. To me, it has sort of an "international espionage" vibe to it. I personally have no use for the rest of the songs, all of which are acoustic. Nothing against acoustic songs, but these particular ones suck (IMHO).  I've always been strangely attracted to New Order, even though I don't always appreciate their "disco" tendencies or dance music in general. Their music often seems cold (in a good way). It's not the most melodious, but it's got cool atmosphere and their rhythms often suck me in. I also like parts of LOW-LIFE, but BROTHERHOOD sounds a little less stuck in the 80s.  One additional note: I actually love good lyrics and I especially love it when the music compliments or enhances them in some way. But I generally don't listen to New Order for the lyrics; sometimes they're good but New Order can get kinda lazy in this department, admittedly (their latest SIREN'S CALL has some particularly cringe-worthy examples). So I don't even care what "All Day Long" is about and I don't hear any words that bother me anyway. Bernard Sumner's singing is usually the last thing I pay attention to. Peace! 
 I have liked using this book with my 7th grade part-time home-schooled son.  It's much more interesting than the school science text on related subjects.  The pictures are especially great; probably much prettier than looking at the real thing through a microscope.  I would prefer to use a microscope; but since we don't own one, this has been a good visual and informaitonal resource 
 Simply the best.  I first bought "Faces" on 8-track to listen to in my Datsun B-210 hatchback. Back in the day, Jefferson-Pilot TV Sports liked EWF, and used their songs several times as bumper music for ACC basketball games, including the opening bars of "And Love Goes On." EWF's peppy songs set a high energy mood, and at the other end of the scale there's no substitute for one of Philip Bailey's smooth ballads.  It's the only EWF album (that I can see) that's not available at iTunes. That's so wrong.  The timing of this LP was terrible. In 1980, disco was a dirty word. And because EWF had so successfully mastered the form, critics (and Columbia) made up their minds they weren't going to push this one; it was bound to be just more disco. I don't think some of the critics even listened to it.  "Faces" is a song cycle, and it all works. . . you groove, you chill, you boogie and then head into the quiet storm. You're in the hands of the masters the whole time and it's a sweet ride.  Needs to be on iTunes! No EWF collection is complete without it 
 Bombproof Your Horse by Rick Pelicano is an easy-to-read, clear and concise book.  I have used Mr. Pelicano's de-spooking methods on my horse and they do work 
 Everyone wrote great reviews, the only thing I can add is to agree it's a great DVD that you can customize with hours of practice to choose from, she's very serene with a spiritual side & not boring. She doesn't give enough verbal clues to keep up & she goes pretty fast, almost power yoga speed. After over 4 years of using yoga dvds, I still had trouble keeping up with her pace & hve given up, though do hope to one day be able to do it. Reading the reviews, people have complained of being unable to keep up or injuries.   You can see a the introduction of her dvd at store soundstrue com Also, you can see trailers from her lunar flow, solar flow & sun salutations which this dvd has content from 
 SUMMARY: Savannah police detective Elise Sandburg has enough to deal with: a house that's falling apart, a difficult teenage daughter, and an annoying yet mysterious new partner. Suddenly, young male prostitutes start turning up dead....or somewhat dead.  The tradition of voodoo in the Deep South get a new slant as freshly buried serial victims claw their way out of their final resting places.  To catch the killer, Elise will have to delve deep into a past she relinquished a lifetime ago.  WHY YOU'LL LIKE IT: Frasier has a gift for immediately involving you in a story.  She writes top-notch suspense that is engrossing and addictive.  Characterizations are complete; truly surprising plot twists abound.  Frasier is a must-have addition to any mystery/suspense lover's personal library.  WHY YOU WON'T: If prostitution and/or voodoo turn you off, get over it and read this anyway.  BOTTOM LINE: Best of genre.  Frasier just keeps getting better. 
 Barbara Lewis had a couple of unforgettable hits that no oldies station can do without: "Hello Stranger" and "Baby, I'm Yours." She is noteworthy just for those two songs, but she recorded a number of other pop/soul gems, and has become a legend in Beach Music circles. This collection is more extensive (and therefore, better) than the "Golden Classics" edition that is also available. Barbara's "Think A Little Sugar" is probably the most heralded B-side in the Carolinas. It was helped along by having "Hello Stranger" as its A-side, but stands as a unique performance in its own right. Barbara has an amazing ability to convey teen-age angst and innocence, and yet still seem womanly... even sultry! Her voice has a particular timbre that I haven't encountered anywhere else. Her diction and phrasing are superb. She also wrote many of these classics, and was certainly not afraid to inject "adult" themes into her songs! She actually got away with saying, "Please don't tease me like you did before!" (on Hello Stranger) and she makes it very clear on "Think A Little Sugar" that she's interested in renewing a more-than-friendly relationship! Not just any female singer from the sixties could have pulled that off! Barbara came along at a time when Black female singers were making the transition from the "girl group" sound to soul. So the early numbers on this collection ("My Heart Went Do Dat Da" "Puppy Love") have a decidedly different flavor from later numbers like "Sho Nuff" and "Make Me Belong To You." Barbara Lewis has often been confused with other female singers of the sixties. In addition to the songs above, she also recorded, "I'll Make Him Love Me" and "Make Me Your Baby." But she didn't record "Make Me Yours" (That was Bettye Swann). And she is not the one who recorded "Yes, I'm Ready." (That was Barbara Mason, who even toured with Barbara Lewis to celebrate their being confused with one another!) After these Atlantic recordings, Barbara and her producer (Ollie McLaughlin) landed at Stax Records. If you like Barbara Lewis, pick up "The Many Grooves Of Barbara Lewis" to hear her in a different and even more mature light. But if you want to know some of the reasons, why so many people had fun at their summer/winter homes in the Carolinas, listen and dance to this collection of Barbara Lewis at her best. And pay special attention to the words 
 I wish that I had this book to read before I started my freshwater tank. It is amazing how difficult it is to find good and reliable source of information. This book covers just about everything. Detail is great - it is very comprehensive about the diseases and treatments, and what's even more important - Causes. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in keeping their fish healthy and stress-free 
 Excellent Book.  I read their other book "How to get a date worth keeping" first.  That totally did a paradigm shift for me on dating. This book really goes into explaing why dating relationships go bad and how to identify the warning signs and how and when to confront a dating partner and what issues are central to a healthy dating relationship.  A super good book.  You will understand what it means to have a healthy dating relationship.  These concepts can be used in a marriage also.  If you want a healthy real dating relationship, this book is the one to get.  I've had a number of my friends read both books and we love them both!! 
 One day, while Amelia Bedelia, the housekeeper who literally takes everything literally, was cleaning, the phone rang. It was Mrs. Rogers, calling from the airport. She was supposed to meet the new teacher, but the plane was late. To further complicate matters the phone was out at the school. Mrs. Rogers wants Amelia to go by the school and tell them the teacher will not be there today. Amelia attempts to do just that, but the principal mistakes her for the new teacher and that's when all the fun starts. Amelia Bedelia teaching a classroom full of children, imagine that. Well, my almost three-year-old son Devon and I imagine it all the time.  Devon already knows his letters, upper and lower case. He knows they make words and he loves to sit while I read Amelia Bedelia stories to him. We've been doing it for over a year now. At first I made up the story line as his didn't have the attention span or the ability to understand. Now I've started reading, pointing to the words as I go along. Ms. Parish has written an excellent series for children and in this one, Lynn Sweat's illustrations set off Amelia's tales to a tee. If you want your toddler to read early, and I do, then this is a series for you.  Jack Priest, Dad in Trainin 
 For all intents and purposes, this is THE silent film to own, if one can own just one.  It has everything.  Drama, special effects, comedy, allegory, myth, good vs evil.  Murnau is a director par excellence and displays his visionary propensities to splendid effect in this classic Goethe tale.  The inimitable Emil Jannings plays a hearty, red-blooded Mephisto. Jannings as a silent screen actor invokes in one look, or a singular movement, what some contemporary actors could not hope to capture within a fete of endless dialogue.  Camilla Horn plays a heartbreaking Gretchen, and the scene in which she wanders the snow with her dying baby is as evocative as it gets.  Grab a hankie and do not feel shamed to find yourself swept along for the ride, of which there is a most splendid one included in this film, where Faust and Mephisto glide above a world in miniature.  Amazing, exhilarating, absorbing.  You shan't be disappointed 
 I began using Guidelines (the first edition) in 1995 when it was essentially prescribed by an EFL colleague using it to teach another section of composition.  I found it to be one of the best texts I've ever used for a comp class. The readings are genuinely engaging and students really felt motivated to reply in writing and with in-class discussion.  Many years later, I'm no longer teaching composition, but keep this book on my shelf anyway since I never know when I will want to refer to one of the readings.

 Great movie for the entire family.  Lots of good moral and character lessons on this flick.  It's not about race.  It's about doing the right thing and standing up for the truth. 
 If you are familiar with the movie and all the of new wave you heard, this is a soundtrack to have. The Plimsouls really made it hard not to like one of the main songs "A Million Miles Away." This is a great CD to have in the car for trips or just for everyday driving to and from work. Having a bad day? Listen to this and you will either laugh or just go back to those times when you were dancing to this music 
 This book is chock full of beautiful pictures and offers a brief discussion on:  What are pirates?, On the High Seas, A Pirate Ship, Life aboard a ship, Tools of the Trade, Barbary Pirates, The Spanish Main, Piracy in the Caribbean, African Coasts, The Orient, Pirate Women, Buried Treasure, Rules of the Game and Pirates of Today.  The book also includes a short glossary of some of the terms used in the book.    While the book itself is short (32 pages) it is well written and could certainly hold the attention of any person (young or old) with an interest in pirates.  This particular book seems to be aimed at the 9-12 age group, but the pictures and text would keep them coming back to it again and again 
 I haven't gotten through the whole book but so far I'm loving it!!! so far I have found a lot of useful stuff!! 
 I have had this CD for several years now, and also all of the CDs from which these arias are drawn.  What a great album; I would not be without it.  Ms. Hunt (now Hunt Lieberson) has the voice, phrasing, discipline...the inner understanding of this music.  She's "connected" on almost every piece here. 'Angels Bright and Fair' is a particular standout in my view; but almost certainly, if you are a lover of Handel's music, you will find something special here. Her soprano to mezzo soprano on this CD was a subtle and extraordinary voice for performing these pieces. 
 This is a well-written book, which provides a solid approach to dealing with cross-cultural issues with many excellent examples and statistics. The central purpose of this work is to dispel the idea that there is one correct management model. In addition to initiating the reader into the world of cultural diversity as seen in a business setting, the authors also analyse concrete steps for reconciling cultural dilemmas. Highly recommended for international managers especially those involved in the process of internationalisation 
 This is one special collection for return on the 80's years. Optimal to listen in the car 
 Do you know someone graduating from college....Don't know what to give them?  I highly recommend this book for any female graduate!!  I bought this for myself during my first year at a Fortune 500 retailer.  It really helped ease my worries and organize my work-life balance (I also happened to be a single mom at the time).  Maria's advice is very grounded and practical.  Many may feel that she has been handed opportunity on a silver platter (and surely she has)...so what can I possilbly learn from her??  You may be surprised.. 
 The Johnstown Flood is a powerful work of historical writing that brings us to a time and place far removed from our present world.  Johnstown was an isolated city, built and populated by working class people.  Some got rich from local steel mills, but most remained solid working class.  The population came from many places - especially Europe.  However, all people seemed to work together for the betterment of their own lives.  Then a major flood occurs that defies all boundaries between people, leaving both the rich and the poor devastated.  Outsiders were blamed for the destruction, yet rebuilding started immediately thanks to donations from average people both in the United States and in Europe.  Wait a minute - this sounds eerily familiar.  Can we say World Trade Center?  Can we say New Orleans (Katrina)?  Can we say Miami (Andrew)?  Can we say...  This is the power of this book.  It describes a disaster that was tied to time and place and yet it is very relevant to the way that we still deal with disasters today.  The more things change the more they stay the same.  The Johnstown Flood is very well written.  David McCullough's books are always very engaging, and this one is no exception.  It is a real page turner and well worth reading. 
 I love Whitney's voice and I love this CD. She is one of the greatest singers in the world. I hope she can recover from her addictions and start singing again.  She's such a great talent; it's a shame to see her throw it all away on drugs. This is a beautiful Xmas album 
 A few comments concerning the material and Dr. Roth. I had the pleasure of using the book while it was still being 'student tested' prior to publication back in the 1970s, and found the course so interesting that I proctored it the following semester. My background prior to taking what was at the time a senior level EE course included no EE whatsoever. The material was well-organized and presented in a consistent pedagogical manner that I find rare in technical textbooks.  I had the pleasure of taking courses with Dr. Roth, and wish to emphasize that he has a very strong interest in effective teaching, and in learning how to make learning more efficient. I found that, as a result, I was both challenged and inspired by one of the best university level instructors I have ever had.   I will also state that I have self-studied topics on numerous occasions, and I have found that 'programmed learning' is one of the most effective teaching methods yet devised.  I have not seen the current edition of 'Fundamentals', but based on my experience with the book since its infancy and my personal knowledge of Dr. Roth's abilities and interest in teaching this material, I would expect the book to be an excellent learning tool.   
 I only wish I had the writing talent to come up with a review that would do this story justice.  We've opted not to get a DVD player to entertain the kids in the car.  Instead, we listen to audio books that we pick up from the local library.  "Bud, Not Buddy," was by far the most wholesome book we've chosen.  In this Audio book, actor, James Avery, reads in a lyrical, better-than-James Earl Jones, voice.   You'll fall in love with Christopher Paul Curtis's clever, funny and, ever-so optimistic orphan, Bud Caldwell, as you follow Bud on a journey through the Michigan of the Great Depression.  The writing is witty and colorful.  Curtis's lovely story will stay with you and leave you feeling hmm hmm goooooooood!  We chose the audio book only as a way to entertain the kids on those long boring drives, but since we are home schooling, this book has become a launching pad for lessons in creative writing, the history of the Great Depression, and, of course, that Great American Institution--Jazz.  
 I received 10 shawls of various colors which were selected by the dealer.  This resulted in several duplicate colors.  The shawls are good quality for the price 
 Before reading this book I'd never even heard of Richard Laymon. I picked this up at a book closeout store for $1 and figured for a buck it'd be an ok read. My expectations were far exceeded. It's been a LONG time since I've read something that captured my attention and had me so engrossed for hours. I didn't put the book down at all once I started reading! I've never found anyone besides Dean Koontz who gave me such an exciting read! I am running out tomorrow to look for more Richard Laymon books! 
 Usually movie novelizations leave me cold, but I loved this one. I only picked it up because I'm a fan of Scott Ciencin's DINOVERSE books and thought he'd be the perfect choice to write a Jurassic Park story. I was right. Reading this book made me feel like I was in the movie, trapped on Isla Sorna and running from that nasty Spinosaurus! The pictures were cool, and the book even had warnings in the opening pages about how dangerous the park is. The whole package really brought me back to that prehistoric world. I also read Scott Ciencin's SURVIVOR, which is sort of a prequel to Jurassic Park III. That is excellent too. All that's left is the movie. I can't wait to see it 
 Boise really explains Calvinistic views well in this book.  He draws off of scripture and not just philosophy.  My main problem with the book is that Boise tries to go beyond what needs to be covered.  If he would just stick with verses that are plane spoken he'd do good. But he takes a lot of verses that are kind of gray, and tries to force them into his Calvinistic views.  This is not good exegesis.  It really weakens a Calvinists argument when you try to fit verses into your theology.  Boise would be better again, by just sticking with the verses that clearly point to the doctrines of grace.  Overall this book is adequate, but if you come at it from a mind seeking truth you will see where he does force his meaning onto verses.  If you come at this book as a Calvinist, you'll cheer as he uses all verses to support his argument.  If you come to it as a Arminian, you'll be swayed when he shows the clear cut verses that show how God elects, but you'll be repulsed when he forces his belief on the not so clear verses 
 I'm the kind of person whose eyes start to glaze over if I try to absorb more than a few pages of social science/self help type writing.  I was steered to this book when I was helping my mother as she died.  I had so  little experience with death that I worried about doing the wrong thing.   As I read the stories I was drawn in, absorbing each small  "message" with each story. One, about a man whose final gift to  his family was to allow them to help him as he died, touched me so deeply I  read it to my mother in her last days.  I wish I'd read this book earlier  but I don't think it could ever be too late 
 The Big Band week of Pop Idol was my favourite. I love jazz music and all the songs were perfrmed brilliantly by all the contestants. This is a great album with fantastic interpretations of old classics. My favourites are Will's songs (obviously!) and The Ole Devil Called Love. It was a shame that Will's version of 'We are in Love' wasn't included but never mind 
 After reading Peter Levine's book I found a practioner of "Somatic Experiencing" from his web site in my city. From the first day I saw her I have been releasing trauma in the gentlest way I have ever experienced. This method has helped me release trauma that no other method has ever done and releases from the deepest layers I thought I would just have to live with forever. I have very  complex PTSD from years of severe and sadistic child abuse from several perpretrators. Talk therapy, journaling, art therapy were helpful but just couldn't clear the fear, grief, hopelessness, that I carried. Emotional Freedom technique was also helpful and some other body therapies but this is my favorite.   There is a LOT more to the healing techniques of Somatic Experiencing than in this book. I look forward to learning more techniques to clear the trauma from my body/mind. Somatic Experiencing is giving me the life I struggled so hard for  in many years of previous therapy to attain. And it is so much easier, with less tears, hard work and pain! I have never experienced the levels of inner peace and calm that I have now. All my relationships are improving as well.   For someone like myself, this will take more than 6 sessions as one person mentioned. I have a highly skilled therapist who is trained by Dr. Peter Levine in Somatic Experiencing. I know it will take many months to complete my healing but I have accomplished more in 15 sessions with her than being in therapy off and on for 16 years, reading books, and doing all kinds of things to get my life back.   My life is just easier in every way. Thank you, Dr. Peter Levine, for helping me heal so I have a life worth living and making a difference in my son's life as well 
 The information in this book is priceless to someone who is seeking an extra boost in their hunger to seek and save the lost. You will find how-to information mixed in with inspirational stories. This is a great book for groups to study, disscuss and apply together. It's been around for awhile, but most GOOD books have. 
 With its smart script, expert direction from Joe Dante, a good cast and 21 year old Rob Bottin's imaginative effects (for 1981), THE HOWLING is one of the best werewolf movies.  Filled with a lot of inside jokes, dark humor and spooky scenes, it set a standard for future films like AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON.  Dee Wallace plays Karen White, a tv news reporter who is targeted by a strange serial killer as his personal contact.  After she leads the police to the crazed Eddie Quist, she is almost killed and suffers from post-traumatic amnesia.  Kindly doctor/author Patrick Macnee (THE AVENGERS) recommends she and her husband (Dee's future real life hubby CHRISTOPHER STONE) take a vacation at his self-help spa called The Colony.  Once there, Dee finds that life isn't all that peaceful in the country. The movie is filled with some really eerie moments and the supporting cast is great: Dennis Dugan, Belinda Balaski, Kevin McCarthy, Elisabeth Brooks, John Carradine and Slim Pickens.  Surely a classic of modern horror films, captured in a special DVD package with commentary 
 As a student of Creation vs Evolution, I have read many books, documents,  etc., about this subject. The Remarkable Birth Of The Planet Earth by Henry  Morris demolishes Darwinism and proves it to be mathmatically and  scientifically IMPOSSIBLE!! Get this little book before it's too late. Read  it, read it again. You'll be glad you did.  Signed  Dean Flower 
 This movie pictured a sizable segment of the U.S. population that has not gotten much attention in the movies - the high involvement Mediterranean family. Many Italians I know  said that it could have been their family. The movie works so well because the author and star really lived and knew the life she depicted. I enjoyed the wry humor.   At the beginning I was prepared to hate her father. He was so sexist and bullying and anti-intellectual. And the women of the family were so cynically manipulative. It did not occur to me until late into the movie that the father was really afraid. He had only the best in mind for his family, and that included his daughters, and that he too felt out of his element in a different mix of cultures that is the United States.  One other detail pleased me; the role of the community college in helping people break free from a confining life to move up in the world. Not only do they learn academic things, they meet wonderful people from other cultures there, fall in love, and marry them.  The photography was wonderful and the acting was superb, especially since  the movie was made on a tight budget.   This is one of the best films I have seen in the past ten years.   
  Low production value but excellent information on how to expand pleasure. The woman is "au natural" and shows a very simple way to touch herself which I first looks like it is too simple. But once we experimented with it, it sure gives great results.  It is quite different from anything else that I have seen. The precision of what she is doing is surprising but undeniable once I saw the signs in her body.   If you are looking for a slick production like the one from the big companies, or something equivalent to how pleasure is presented from a man's perspective in a porn movie, this is not for you and you will be disappointed.  But if you are willing to look past that and use the example of a real woman (not a model that fits everyone criteria of perfect beauty with large breast, shaved genitalia etc. and I shall say I myself would enjoy seeing more women like her that look more like most of us presented as role models) and if you are willing to look at the information offered about a woman's pleasure you may very well be pleasantly surprised. I definitively was.  
 I bought these during an amazon one day sale for $35, me and my girlfriend are soon looking to get our own place and wanted to buy something that is decent but not two expensive. I'll try to give good descriptions of everything to give the buyer a good idea of what to expect. When amazon says 35lbs they are not kidding, it is a VERY heavy box. Towle silversmiths are the actual company that makes the set. They are made in China. According to the box IT IS dishwasher safe, but IS NOT microwave safe. That would be due to the metal band around the edges of the plates.  This review is for the platinum set, amazon didn't have it listed on the website when i was going to review them so this is close enough. All the items appear very nice the bands are all uniform and matching. It looks like tableware you would expect to find in a NICE new england bed and breakfast. Very timeless, and classic, but modern in a sense as well.  The plates, bowl's, and coffee cups are nice and heavy and look quite elegant. They are of good weight and don't feel flimsy at all. They come with decorative plates for underneath the main plate however i wouldn't ever consider using them, the only they they are useful for is target shooting or playing frisbee.  The flatware is ok, they are on the light side and somewhat bland. The forks and spoons flex but also appear as if they would bend under normal use, the knifes feel ok but again all the flatware is on the flimsy side, I would recommend getting an additional set somewhere else. They are not so thin that they would bend right away like the usual 'college' first set that most people would buy at either Linens and Things or Bed Bath and Beyond or Target. But i've had better.  The wine glasses are the same way, they are a medium thickness glass, they are by no means high quality but they are not the cheapo ones you would expect to find at target or the cheap ones at LNT or BBB. One of mine had an air bubble in it, im gonna request a new one from amazon. They are ok tall stems and good base, they feel very sure footed on the table and accompany the dishes nicely in design. They are a large bowl Red Wine glass design.  If you need the dishes buy it, they are well worth what i paid for it for the dishes alone, i plan on buying new flatware. The glasses I'll use till they break. Overall for $35 i am very pleased and wish i had bought a second set for the plates alone 
 I bought this book because of its connection with horses.  I enjoyed it thoroughly. The book itself is well written.  The insights into a very famous man are unexpected, and reveal facets of the man that were a big surprise to me. I think this book would be interesting to almost everyone.  
 It's hard to believe, but for a short time in the mid-1990's, there was a prime-time TV show about two cartoon lab mice trying to take over the world.  I expect to have a hard time convincing my future grandchildren that I really lived through such an incredible, magical time, but it's true.  That being said, I'm not sure how much the quality of the show benefited from the prime-time slot.  For one thing, the Brain's sarcastic put-downs of Pinky got a little more mean-spirited in nature - possibly because the writers thought that they needed the extra "edge" in order to "make it" in prime-time. (They were wrong, as it turned out, because the show was eventually taken out of prime time and put back in the weekend kids' lineup).  I also thought that the addition of the Snowball character hurt the show.    One of the things I like best about Warner Brothers cartoons is the complete absence of the clear-cut, black-and-white morality that is so characteristic of Disney cartoons.  For example, Wily E. Coyote doesn't try to eat the Roadrunner because he's bad or evil - he just does it because he's a coyote, and as a coyote, it's his nature to try to eat roadrunners.  Similarly, the Brain doesn't try to take over the world because he's evil - it's just his nature to try to take over the world.  Snowball kind of wrecked that formula, because Snowball actually WAS unremittingly evil.  Fortunately, Snowball was only in a handful of episodes.  Overall, though, Pinky and the Brain was a pretty amazingly awesome show. I mean, where else could you watch two lab mice comment on history, human nature, and popular culture while trying to take over the world? And for those of us fortunate enough to have been alive for that brief period in the mid-1990's when it appeared that Pinky and the Brain just might take over the world, this is an incredible reminder of those historic days.  NARF! 
 First and foremost, The Deep Dark is a really enjoyable read.   If you've ever worked or lived around men who work hard for a living, whether it's in mines, steel mills, logging or commercial fishing, you'll recognize the men in this book.  They range from hard-drinking live-for-the-moment types to family men who garden, work on their cars or collect stamps. It never felt like I was reading an important history of events that helped transorm an industry - but I was.  For many of us who grew up in the 60s and 70s, network news was how we learned about what was going on in the world.  History books in school ended around WWII, but classes rarely made it past the Civil War.  Gregg Olsen has done lots of research and covers the human aspects of this event that would never make it into  books or onto the news though.  I am really grateful to have the opportunity to get enough information, in such an entertaining way, that I feel like I have a little bit of real understanding of the events of that week in 1972.  The pace kept me up late at night and and the intensity of the story filled my eyes with tears more than once.  
 I have used MBTI at work and found it to be useful.  I came across this book when I was looking for something to add to the basic knowledge that I had.  Don't worry though, the first two chapters go over the basics.  If you are not familiar with MBTI, this will get you started.  If you are familiar with it, it serves as a good review.  Then the heart of the book takes you through three tools for identifying peoples preferences:  type preference as a whole, temperament, and extraverted/introverted feeling.  After putting all of these together, the authors present you with some case studies where you use the various techniques to try to identify the types of the people involved.  They are simple but useful.  The book closes with some detailed advice for interacting with the four different temperaments in general and then specifically the four individual type preferences within a given temperaments.  The final chapter is titled "How Will I Ever Look at People the Same Way Again?"  Truthfully, you won't.  You will notice things about people, and hopefully these things will help you improve your interactions with the people you come in contact with 
 On the Southern Ute Reservation in Colorado, tribal Ute shaman Daisy Perika is concerned with what this nightmare has shown her as she feels she has seen a vision of the future, but cannot tie her dream to a date and time and the place is vague.  Still she is worried about the young female waif whose hands are dripping blood while a man lies dying nearby.  She informs her nephew, tribal investigator and rancher Charlie Moon, on his weekly visit what she envisioned.  Charlie knows how accurate his beloved Aunt Daisy is, but does not have enough information to do anything.  Raymond Oates introduces himself to Sarah Frank as a half brother of a friend before giving her a book as a present.  Not long afterward Sheriff Popper sees Sarah holding a Louisville Slugger with blood on her hands as psychic Ben Silver lies nearby dying.  Before Popper can act, someone else hits him with a bat.  Charlie and FBI Special Agent Lila Mae McTeague investigate, but Sarah has vanished with someone else besides the cops trying to find her for the book she carries is a valuable heirloom.  The intriguing investigation in the latest Charlie Moon mystery starts a bit later than usual as James D. Doss sets in motion the key players and the significant (to this tale) Ute mysticism before Ben is killed.  At that venture, the story line switches into more of a rescue Sarah saga than a murder investigation though the two scenarios are linked and converge in a delightful climax.  Though lacking the humor of SHADOW MAN, fans of the series will enjoy Charlie's' current caper as Aunt Daisy avoids I told you so, but makes it clear he is to rescue Sarah or face her wrath.

 I just finished reading Digital Fortress tonight. I must say that I liked it. This is the first book I've read by Brown. I found his writing style to be very readable.  After reading this book, I scanned some of the reviews that had been posted to see what others thought. Some of the reviewers made comments that lead me to believe the writers read the book with skim-for-speed tactics, as their comments did not quite seem to follow all the storyline and character development. I am a read-every-word-don't-want-to-miss-anything reader, and therefore I read slowly.  The only things that stuck out in the book as being very, VERY, odd (to me) were the choice to make the assassin a deaf man and the fact that he used a very expensive silencer on his revolver. I hope everyone knows that silencers don't work on revolvers. Perhaps the assassin did not know that because he was deaf. That about does it for what I consider to be flaws in the book. When I was reading it, some characters did things that seemed inconsistent with the way they had been developed. Nonetheless, Brown brought closure to each character's motivations for their actions - and he did it well.  I have read one of Clancy's NetForce books and I truly enjoyed Digital Fortress more. I have also read several of William Gibson's books and I must say that while very different, Brown's work in Digital Fortress was as enjoyable to me.  Digital Fortress is a good story. It is smooth reading. Give it a try 
 We watched this DVD last night, and I think it may have surpassed everything else we've watched and is now at the top of my list. WOW. Amazing! I love when a band sounds just as good as they did when they first hit the music scene.  A wonderful plus to this concert is that Frey, Henley and Walsh also sing their own songs so it's like getting a bonus concert. Joe Walsh is quite entertaining!  Definitely a must see - I'm already looking forward to watching it again 
 Many books purport to offer marketing advice. However, most of them, especially those that are case study-oriented, are somewhat superficial and simply reiterate some basic truths that most practitioners already know.  In contrast, Warner's book digs in deep to provide the nitty gritty "so what" details that readers need in order to actually apply the lessons to their own work.  You are not left hanging as to what the company under discussion actually did, or what results were achieved. As a marketer with a leading technology company, I was particularly interested in the chapter on Kodak's success with the EasyShare camera and software. There are some great lessons on how to get beyond the "early adopter" crowd to succeed with the mainstream consumer.  I have passed this book on to others in my organization, who report that they too have  found it both insightful and useful. 
 This book gives you a lot of respect for the genius of the founding fathers and how it was not just that as a group they were even more brilliant than individually, but that each faction won their way when in hindsight, they were the ones with the best approach. It gives a lot of credence to the saying "God looks over fools and the United States of America".  I think this is simply the best book for a wide view of how the United States became a country (and almost didn't many many times) and how it's structure was set then to become what it is today.  For the best second book about this period, the new Alexander Hamilton biography

 It's great when one of your best friends just happens to own a book shop. I found this trilogy of Nora's in the book shop and got a great deal on it. I think my favorite was Finding The Dream, with Laura Templeton & Michael Fury, probably because he's the handsome, dangerous type of guy that every woman wants to fall in love with.  And he struggled to be good enough for where he  finally ended up. And she was so level-headed in so many ways, except the creep of a husband she was married to. Laura struggles with her two daughters after she divorces their father, with the oldest blaming Laura for his departure. Kids can be so cruel when they don't understand. The story just took me to tears at times. Then too, I really enjoyed Daring to Dream with Margo and Josh Templeton. She finds out about her mother's one and only love, Margo's father, and Margo regains a relationship with her mother that she'd felt was lost. Margo is the beautiful, well-built woman that every man dreams about, but she's a wild child that Josh Templeton has long been waiting for to return home. The dialogue is great, both witty and warm at the same time. Margo is nearly bankrupt when she returns to Templeton House, but finds her roots again, not only with starting a new business, but also with her mother. Josh was my second favorite of the men in this trilogy. He's so cool. And then there's Holding The Dream with Kate and Byron. This story was okay, but not nearly the page-turner that the other two were. But Kate is an altogether different type of woman than Laura and Margo. It's the bond that holds them together as sisters, even though they aren't, that I really found endearing. This trilogy was great. I'm glad I found it 
 Steven Jenkins has written 'a passionate guide to cheese'. He may well be, as the cover copy claims 'America's most opinionated authority'. What makes this book the most important volume on the subject right now is that the man has  tasted most of the world's cheeses and has or- ganized his careful tasting notes in a way that makes them easy to access.  His geographical sections are sprinkled with sidebars that are often interesting or useful and his writing style is bubbly and fun.  It's true that this book is in no way a primer. It's not about first principles, and some of what it has to say is just plain wrong. Fat doesn't  float because it's heavier than water, (p.15)  for instance and the best wine to serve with a cheese is only occasionally one from the  same region (many of the best dairy lands aren't in wine country).  Of course, any book that calls itself opinionated is going to have opinions that provoke disagreement. There are also going to be holes in the en- cyclopedic fabric. (Steve, how could you have missed Austria's Voralberger Bergkäse?)   Quibbles aside, this is an author who cares about one of the good things in life and has devoted his time, taste and intelligence to sharing that thing with the rest of us. The result is a book that will bring a lot of pleasure and be used as a reference  for many years. For less than the cost of a pound of Reggiano, this is a great buy.  Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE  and the forthcoming novel bang-BANG from Kunati Press. (ISBN 1601640005 
 Wow! this book takes me back! The Emersons are so much younger in this book. I almost forgot that I even read this. I loved Ramses when he was a child! I miss his long winded speeches.  I love how Amelia just goes looking for trouble. Some things never change. I hope we all can enjoy the Amelia series for years to come 
 I started this book knowing very little about the main characters. I never heard of Michael Milken or Ivan Boesky until I read this. It was interesting and entertaining to understand what they achieved and what they threw away. This is greed at its best. Some of the most intelligent and successful people in wall street who couldn't handle the success they already attained. I also enjoyed how the author made some of these people look like complete fools. The ones who couldn't succeed on their own so they had to cheat the system to look powerful. Then the ones who could succeed on their own but let their self-indulgence get the best of them. Once you finish this book you will realize these people were the biggest players in the market throughout the 80's. 
 Top notch. As a marketing consultant to independent professionals and small service busineses, I found this book to be outstanding. For example, the book describes how a new trend for professionals and consultants who want to woo and win new clients is to offer teleclasses, also known as telephone seminars or teleseminars. The book explains that having heard you speak, people feel they know you personally, and are more confident about hiring you. The advantages are abundant. You don't have to be personally present to give a talk that reaches your target market, says Van Yoder. Online chats and teleconferences, using your own or others' telephone lines, can help you reach a lot of people eager to hear your message. The book is filled with great advice like this. 
 An awesome new business book I read was Why we Buy  - The Science of Shopping by Paco Underhill.  This one is a business book primarily of interest to retailers (although I see similarities in retail and online habits).  Paco (and his researchers) followed and recorded the behavior of tens of thousands of shoppers.  From this he is able to run a consulting business that makes recommendations to retailers on minor changes they can make to increase their sales.  Examples include - Provide a spot for people to sit, especially the person who brought the shopper.  Leave parking spots for people at fast food places since 10% of the customers buy then go eat in their car.   Children and old ladies are the primary buyers of doggie treats - put them where they can seen and reached.    He gives many examples of simple changes that can be made to increase sales.  As with all brilliance, many of his observations are obvious.    This book is a must read for any retailer. 
 NOW I CAN DIE IN PEACE: HOW ESPN'S SPORTS GUY FOUND SALVATION, WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM NOMAR, PEDRO, SHAWSHANK AND THE 2004 RED SOX looks back on Bill Simmons' 'Sports Guy' columns for the last five years to consider the evolution of the Sox and their miracle of finally winning the World Series. It's a fun history of the Sox, The Sports Guy, baseball history, and American sports in general, providing a lively set of insights and blow-by-blow seasonal memories. A wonderful pick for avid fans of the Sox, in particular.  Diane C. Donovan California Bookwatch 
 what I want to say is this is a valuable reference  for EE engineers and researchers 
 Under Armour is the greatest brand of workout gear I have seen in my day.  I work out for hours and hours at a time, and these tee shirts (i own four) keep me cool and dry, ready to keep on playing.  These shirts get my highest rating; buy one today 
 Every time I see this movie have the same feeling: if the Devil will reign, it will be this way! Opera lovers knows that one of the worst things ever is the fact that Maria Callas never recorded a full version of Verdi's Macbeth; luckyly, the olympic talent of Laurence Olivier created this jewel. For me, it goes ahead even before Olivier's Hamlet: this very personal approach of the Duke of Gloucester goes surrealistic enough to be modern. I saw it first when I was a child and I will never forget the impression that Olivier's eyes caused. Cast, with Gielgud, Richardson, Bloom and Hardwicke among others, supports Olivier's experiment transforming the text of Shakespeare almost in a modern thriller about the corruption of a soul obsessed with power beyond all limits. It was necessary the maturity of another great stage and cinema actor (Al Pacino) to almost reach Olivier, but this one is still a landmark 
 This is the Discworld novel wherein Captain Sam Vimes of  Ankh-Morpork's Night Watch retires and gets married, the Night Watch itself becomes an equal species organization, and Gaspode the Talking Dog falls in love with new recruit, Angua, the werewolf.  She has just joined the Night Watch under the Equal Species Act, along with Detritus the Troll and Cuddy the Dwarf.  No wonder Sam, who is a bit of a male chauvinist speciesist is going to retire.    Not since Stephen King's "It" have clowns gotten such bad press as in "Men at Arms."  They seem to be the saddest creatures on Discworld.  One of them, Beano is murdered and ends up playing 'Knock Knock - Who's There?' with Death, who is trying to develop a sense of humor.  Humor will never be the strong suite of a hooded, seven-foot skeleton with glowing blue eyes, but Death does get in one inadvertently funny line.  He tells Beano to think of his newly deceased state as being 'DIMENSIONALLY DISADVANTAGED.'    Meanwhile back in the world of the living and undead, Captain Sam Vimes and his command investigate the circumstances of Beano's death.  Sam is also under orders from his wife-to-be to find a missing swamp dragon, which is likely to explode if it comes under stress.  When a large hole is blown in the headquarters of the Assassin's Guild, Sam has a pretty good notion of what caused the explosion.  What he really wants to know is whether this latest calamity has something to do the Beano's death.  After all, the Assassins are right next door to the Guild of  Fools and Clowns.  What he does not yet know is that mad genius, Leonard of Quirm's deadliest invention has fallen into the hands of a rabid monarchist who will do everything in his power to restore Ankh-Morpork's rightful king---and that king is a member of his own Night Watch.  "Men at Arms" (1993) is another great slapstick-with-a-message adventure in the Sam Vimes/Night Watch Discworld novels.  If you'd like to read them in order of publication, they are: "Guards! Guards!" (1989); "Men at Arms" (1993); "Feet of Clay" (1996); "Jingo" (1997); "The Fifth Elephant" (1999); "Night Watch" (2002); and "Thud!" (2005).   
 I've bought Mel's maintenance book following the suggestions from previous customers. Their reviews pointed me to this book. It's now natural that I wish to contribute to the plethora of enthusiastic readers. If you are considering buying an mtb maintenance book don't go any further: Mel has it all you need to keep in your own garage workshop. Oh yes, this is not the book you'll see collecting dust in a bookshelf. This is the kind of reading that you'll devour in one shot, and keep it at hands for years. Mine has already a few stains, even though I treated it with highest respect. No matter how good you are in mtb maintenance, Mel has the right hint for you to dramatically improve your skill, all dressed with an impressive selection of pictures that will take you step by step to the solution of your problem. Other maintenance books may have pictures as well, other maintenance books may guide you through a problem-solving tree, but Mel has a unique ingredient: LOVE. Yes, Mel loves his bike, and you'll feel it throughout the entire book. I love my bike as well..... AND YOU 
 "Save Me" is an awesome song. In fact, its my favorite on this CD. Maxeen is a great band whom I think have immense talent. You should definitely check out there CD! It's awesome. [...] I think the people who decided to put Maxeen on the Sounds of Superman are very smart. They are a powerfully talented band like Superman! 
 This work sheds light on our Founding Fathers by discussing early historical events in more detail. For instance, Benjamin Franklin tried to force Congress to confront slavery- head on. Our early lawmakers were at a loss to figure out how slaves would be integrated into the economy and the broader society once freed. Alexander Hamilton foresaw a scenario; wherein, the federal government would triumph over the states.Alternatively, the Union itself could dissolve into fractious parties- each with a parochial self interest to uphold.  The 1790 census counted 3.1MM whites and a total of 3.9MM people. President George Washington pre-announced his retirement on 9-19-1796 in the American Daily Advertiser. In his Farewell, President Washington believed that individual interests should be subordinated to further a much greater common cause.   Essentially, President Washington's support for the Jay Treaty made him unelectable in 1796. Jefferson was critized for failing to prepare for the War of 1812. This book has a wealth of knowledge on our early history and civics. It will be an important enhancement to American History texts everywhere 
 I teach Reading to 6th graders.  Received two copies of this book from a friend and thought I would read the first few chapters to my students on Halloween.  The were so interested in it that the next day they begged me to read more!! How could I say no??  Several went online that night and bought their own copies and pre-ordered Greenberg's second book in this series. Meanwhile, I have a waiting list of students wanting to check out one of the two classroom copies to see what becomes of Wally and Cheyenne.  They just can't get enough.  I love their enthusiasm, and like them, can't wait for Book Two 
 I am truly ecstatic after having this wonderful spiritual light absent from the music scene for so long to have him back! I didn't even know he was recording until a friend gave me An Other Cup just yesterday. Upon first listen it was as if I was washed clean, spiritually strengthened and musically inspired all at once. This is spiritually as lifting as any pop music will ever get. It is all about the simple and most important things in life. God, Friends, family and Love. Never more than now has Yusuf's music been more needed. It's not too often that music flows from such a self actualized spiritual force and the results will blow you away. Every song is a true delight. Heaven, The Beloved, In the End are just icing on top of bliss. Thank you Yusuf for coming back to what you were destined to do. I am stronger today having listened to your new music 
 Clever story, clearly told with pictures alone.  Great for young children to enjoy with adults or by themselves 
 This is a great coming of age novel about Sonny, Duane, and Jacy growing up in the 1950's. Some parts are sad but it is a very moving and well written novel. I really enjoyed the story. I really liked this book a lot 
 Workingmansdead shows Jerry Garcia at his best. Hightime and Dyerwolf are two fine country songs. UncleJohnsband is an alltime clasic Garcia had a great voice.Cumberlandblues is a great song with banjo and electric guitar. BlackPeter is one of Garcias best vocals. Easywind is good it rocks and has the drummers on it Caseyjones is good and helped the dead get popular but i like most of the other songs better. Woringmansdead is the Greatfuldead cd to have 
 I've had "Out of the Cool" in my life for 30+ years.  When CD's came into availability, this was one of the first of my LP's to be duplicated in CD.  One of the finest ever

Camilla Morton gives you all the advice to all kind of situations, and her tips can get you out of any kind of embarrasment!!It also includes advice from important personalities such as Stella McCartney or Manolo Blahnik which I find quite helpful since they know what style is about. I highly recommend it to everyone with style 
 Wonderful!  A must have for any fan of Ray Charles... Also a great gift for someone that hasn't followed his music 
 Rarely does a movie have as much historic accuracy, political insight, character development, and dramatic action as does this film.  The film covers 6 highly chaotic and transitional years in Ireland, from the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin to the 1922 assassination of Michael Collins in Cork County.  Many Americans, even if they are of Irish ancestry, know little of Irish history, particularly the relationship between Ireland and England. Since the reigns of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I there has been domination of the Irish people by the English government. After almost 400 years of domination, the rise of the Irish Republic was an amazing accomplishment. Much of that accomplishment must be attributed to Michael Collins, the founder of the Irish Republic Army, and the master strategist in the first 6 years of the rebellion. The film takes us through the final hours of the Easter Rising where the English military suppresses one of the first uprisings and challenges to their authority. The film shows the firing squad executions, one by one, of the leaders of the uprising. The film takes us to the guerilla tactics of Michael Collins, with an emphasis on killing the English leadership in Ireland. As the English send more and more ruthless enforcers of England's power, the IRA carefully kills them and creates chaos in their administration. Michael becomes a national hero but his first diplomatic mission is in some ways a set up. This leads to the political intrigue within the film.  The character of Eamon De Valera, the man who was repeatedly elected President of Ireland, is indeed complex as the film demonstrates. De Valera sends Collins to negotiate with the British under the explanation that Collins has earned this priviledge andthat the English wish to know who is so they can negotiate face to face. Michael is not able to negotiate for the independence of all of Ireland, primarily because the English wished to hold Northern Ireland where the majority of English protestant settlers had lived for generations after generations. However, De Valera refuses to accept a partial victory, undermining Collins' leadership and popularity with many of the Irish people. Very crafty thinking and manipulating were involved in this sequence of events. Was De Valera actually that Machiavellian?  The film would indicate so.  The acting is superb, with Lian Neeson, Alan Rickman, Stephen Rea, Ian Hart, Aiden Quinn, and Jonathan Rhys Meyer offering first class performances. Julia Roberts takes an understated back seat which serves the film well. Neeson is indeed highly powerful as the robust manly decisive Collins, a man who goes from being a street fighting terrorist to a hero and statesman. Rickman is super as De Valera. He plays De Valera as calculating, never revealing his whole hand, and extremely strategic. Especially strategic was De Valera's trip to the USA to gain funds and support from Irish Americans. Ian Hart plays Collins' right hand assistant through thick and thin. Hart is superb here. Aiden Quinn plays Harry Boland, a friend of Collins' who competes with him for Julia Robert's affection and then turns on him during the Irish Civil War. A young brash handsome Jonathan Rhys Meyer plays the young assassing who kills Collins as he comes to Cork to negotiate with De Valera. There is so much history to relate that the director and writers wisely de-emphasized the romantic in favor of the historic.  The scenes of Ireland are superb, the cinematography of urban Ireland was exceptional. A very fine film.  
 I bought these accessories for my wife for Christmas and it has proven to be very handy. I recommend highly 
 When i was reading this book, I was thinkng about "our town", where the narrator gives us a glimpse into several interesting lives.  i have never lived or spent much time in bombay.  that being said, i am not quite sure that bombay deserve star billing in the title or connectiveness to these stories.  each story (except the first) has compelling charachters that you feel interested in and want to know more about.  by the way, in the last story is subramaniam shiv 
 The crux of this book, in a nutshell is that we need to look closely at the way we think about doing battle, about how we do battle. Mr Hammes brings that point to the forefront and I commend him highly for doing so. Our military, our country has been manipulated by well meaning, but mis guided folks that seem to think that everyone in the world will attempt to stand toe to toe with us and embrace the ensuing slaughter. We could reduce the bloated defense budget with a little common sense, and focus on what would allow us to kindly defeat our adversaries. Failure to embrace new techniques of warfare are one of the reasons that we are a free country today. They stood up and and we hid behind trees, they lost the colonies, we became a soveriegn nation. Now our adversaries are throwing the entire toolshed at us, along with the kitchen sink, and all that we seem to be able to do is try and determine why they do not drop to thier knees and relent.  We need to look at the culture of warfare, the culture of military personnel and take a radical approach at correcting it before we become insignificant.  You can't hit what you can't see, brings new meaning to modern warfare. More of us with the capability to change the military need to read this and take some of the change on board, at least personally, and professionally. 
 Ted Dekker is at it again, creating a masterpiece that BLOWS MINDS. This is one incredible book, packing in a heaping dose of physcological candy, and a whole lot of emotion, Ted Dekkers book is very engaging. What makes this book EVEN BETTER, is it's distinct Christian message. The message of Christ IS the number one most important thing in any novel, and this, while not evangilistic, is a great read for the Christian suspense fan.  Definately pick this up, along with every single on of Dekker's other novels... You won't be sorry. 
 An excellent read for those interested in architecture or construction techniques. It is also a valuable resource for those interested in understanding historical technologies 
 Recently, I tried to save money by buying off-brand ink tanks. Never again! One leaked and the other ran out in record time. I've learned that paying a little more for the printer manufacturer's ink is cheaper in the long run. After all, they design the printer to work best with their ink, so why take chances 
 Robin Williams is at his best as a "DJ". If you like oldies, you will like this CD. Fairly good mixture of songs 
 i don't have much time to get back into really great shape, i have my 20 year high school reunion coming up, and so this workout was perfect for me, short and sweet and effective moves that i felt right away. leisa hart was tremenedous in her buns of steel videos in the 90's and i love her fitmama dvds, this is great to do to then advance into other videos...i lost some weight, got encourage, and felt ready to do her sexy series videos(which are the bomb, i love them soooo much). this is a great dvd to have to do after having your baby and then aadvancing to other videos, you'll love that you did this before wasting time doing too advanced of workouts(i made that mistake with my first two babies). this is a great dvd!! 
 Sam Weller effectively tells the story of Ray Bradbury, the sensitive child-man behind all the wonderful stories; the man who wrote about space travellers, but who wouldn't get on a jet plane until he was many decades into his own life; the man who worked with directors and writers who didn't understand him or who took advantage of him; the man who worked with so many--some famous, some not so--who appreciated Bradbury's tremendous gifts, who became his friends and business partners, and who gave as much as they got. Weller isn't quite star struck--he presents Bradbury warts and all--his affairs, his bouts of drinking, his depressions, his want, at times, to be more of a child than a husband. But so much the better for all of his fans to know the true story. This is a well-written, honest book, and a must have for Bradbury fans. 
 I'm giving it 4 stars because, though not perfect, it does a good job for the money.  By re-arranging the rocks you can vary the amount of splashy sounds.  The downside is that because of the ark-shaped bottom there will be a corresponding amount of outside splashing.  So you'll want to use a tray and/or absorbent mat.  Also, there is a slight motor hum but the sounds of the water pretty much override it.  Ultimately, it does help me to relax 
 This book has been an extremely valuable reference for me and my coworkers on any subject related to forensics that we have encountered in our investigations. This is the only book I've found that covers the laws of forensics as well as technical details of analysis.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone that is involved in computer forensics 
 Not much can be added to what's already been said... fine action, engaging characters & storyline, intricate technical detail, not to mention witty and entertaining. Some of the passages on Hiro's academic research can become tedious, but that's really the only fault I could find with this novel, and it's a minor one. Read and enjoy 
 When I first started making jewelry 7 years ago, this was one of the first books I bought.  Intended as a textbook, it's a good, basic, easy to understand book for the novice jewele 
 As a fan of Barbara Kingsolver's nonfiction I recommend the book's Foreword, in particular, for a personal and incisive statement of the agrarian ethic and its relevance for this time.  Editor Norman Wirzba's counsel that we cannot live well if we do not attend to the human and non-human "bonds of relationship" is also of deep import in an age of mindless surfeit masquerading as self-realization 
 I particularly liked "relax; you're home."  it's so helpful to tend the transition between work and home and to consciously infuse my home life with peaceful choices.  These simple, yet powerful practices invite stepping out of the forward rush of activity and thought. letting go, and appreciating the innate richness of the moment 
 I have read dozens of leadership books over the years including many from both business and military perspectives. This is bar-none the best. I currently have four managers, about thirty staff and multiple projects I am responsible for and this is the book that I repeately reach for because it is a "how to" book. I reach for it to solve problems and I reach for it to teach my staff and managers "how to".  This is the best book on the nuts and bolts of practical leadership. It provides and excellent model and goes on to tell you how to do it. Mr. Malone apporaches the subject like a mechanic; his book explains how the machinery of direct leadership works, then provides you with a set of tools and finally tells you how to use those tools.   I have applied or implemented a number of the authors ideas and my staff and managers love it. Yet I will still be learning from this book for many years to come.   None of this is rocket science. Like the title says, its common sense, but the magic is in the authors clarity of communication combined with your ACTUALLY DOING IT.   I recommend you read it through twice before beginning implementation because parts will be much clearer on the second reading.   If you want to be a leader and you want people to see you as a leader, at any level of an organization, this is the book.    
 Reading a Spurgeon devotional is like having the perfect dessert after a perfect dinner. Morning by Morning is just such a treat. Spurgeon's eloquence reaches a spiritual level that challenges the reader yet clarifies great truths of the Bible like few others. Like C.S. Lewis, he illuminates without expanding beyond the source. This little volume would make a great gift for any Christian 
 Anyone with a taste for blues/jazz done with some real creative approaches will love this first solo effort of Robben Ford! I've been carting around an old beat up cassette for years of this and now I have the CD! This early diversion by Robben into the jazz/fusion side of things is a treat made all the sweater by the Yellowjackets beginings. For my money, Robben Ford is one of the most inspiartional guitarists, singers, writers, I 've heard in a long time and this CD is amost for your collection.  I love that groove on "North Carolina " !!! 
 As a former accountant, I prefer hard numbers to mere opinions.  This was exactly the book I needed to read when I was debating whether to continue working or start staying at home with my children.  I suggest it to my friends, family, even strangers because the information is so well presented.  Some of us may not be able to replace the years we had our children in day-care, but we can move forward with the valuable information provided in this book.  Sure, it requires some sacrifices when you depend on one income to raise a family, but isn't the outcome of your children more important than the size of your apartment/home, etc 
 I got this videotape when I was preparing for a 5-week RV trip to  Alaska with my 13- and 16-year-old Granddaughters.  It was a bit older, of course, than the contemporary movies they are used to, but for  the purpose they very much enjoyed it.  I almost never got them to stop  serenading me with Johnny Horton's song of the same title. 
 I bought this tunnel for my 2 grandchildren - -age 2 1/2 and 10 months.  They absolutely LOVE it!  They spend lots of time crawling thru - -chasing each other - and playing peek a boo.  It folds up very easily and travels with us too.  It's great for a rainy day and we have even used it on the beach.  Highly recommend it 
 Yes, the kit is easy to use, but if you don't bleed freely, get a few extra lancets before you start. Most pharmacists will give you one or two lancets for free. The kit only comes with two (which can be used only one time). It took me 6 jabs to get enough blood for the test; I had to run out to the corner pharmacy to get more lancets (because I'm too much of a whimp to find a household bloodletting tool). Other than that - no complaints. The lab got the results back to me faster than expected 
 The life of Mussolini was one that was filled with tragedy for the state of Italy.  Mussolini is not lionized by Dennis Mack Smith but instead taken apart for the inadequacies in his rule during the World War 2 era.  Mussolini never really had control of the situation in Italy and was most of the time a confused dictator. He believe his strength to be far greater than it was and considered Italy a great power in the world. He was quickly becoming a pawn of Hitler and his indecisiveness led Italy down a path of destruction.  There is little to be proud of given the evidence posted in this book and it brings to light a perspective that should be analyzed. The book is very well written and is not bogged down in heavy detail. It highlights the salient points and provides a context for life in Italy under Mussolini. While Mussolini's thugs did terrorize the populace form time to time the country really ran as it did in the pre-fascist days.  The security forces were police state at times but nominally Mussolini, especially as the war went on, quickly fell out of favor with the people. He lost his touch with reality and while no one wanted to challenge his perceptions it did not matter as Italy was driven back again and again over the course of the war.  This is a must read for those who want to understand how Italy fit into world war 2 beyond simply a military context.  
 Gorgeous. I've not tired of this CD and I don't suspect I will.  Almost a whisper voice, like he's telling me secrets...  Fabulous 
 Jon has returned to England. His return brings an end to the peace of mind of Fleur and Michael. Jon may have moved on and fallen in love again with Ann, but Fleur has never loved everyone but Jon.  Swan Song has many of the usual Forsyte book tropes-- commentary on modern life offered through the observations of old men; June introducing us to the latest artistic schools; Forsyte paralysis when faced with the unblinking desire to do the wrong thing. As with the five books preceding this, it is all wonderfully well written. Michael and Fleur encountering people doing the Charleston is a particularly charming moment.   Swan Song is so powerful partly because of the mixed emotions it has about Fleur. While Galsworthy gamely soldiers on to complete the cycle of doom begun by Soames and Irene, it is evident that he has a great deal of sympathy for Fleur. This installment shows her at her best as well as showing her at her worst. She is the swan of the book, singing her loveliest song.  A worthy ending to the second Forsyte trilogy and a very readable instalment in this underappreciated series 
 This unforgettable story illustrates the crazy, life-changing adventure of a seventeen-year-old boy who struggles to let go of his fading childhood and accept the phoniness of the adult world. Holden Caulfield's loneliness and lack of motivation combined with a traumatic childhood cause him to leave behind his youthful days at Pencey Prep to venture into the dynamic adult world of New York City. Holden tries to hide his youthful innocence as he mirrors the habits of other adults, going to bars, drinking, and purchasing prostitutes. However, his bickering and sarcastic attitude suggest a hidden desire to stay young, a desire he stubbornly buries beneath his new, mature lifestyle. Holden, like many others, longs to live in a place that is simple and motionless, a place where one needn't worry about the past or the future. Holden also hopes to preserve the innocence in others, such as his sister, so they don't turn out like him, depressed and regretful. Through Salinger's vibrant attitude towards Holden's experience in New York, we readers learn to stop running from our past to prevent losing our youth altogether. The Catcher in the Rye has survived generations as one of the world's best bildungsromans, not because it illustrates the fading youth and growing maturity of a memorable character, but because it demonstrates the confusion of a character as he fights desperately to protect what remains of his childhood 
 I loved this cd of theirs.  This has some damn beautiful songs on it.  Their first cd was great but they got so much better with this.  Four Seasons of Lonliness and Doin Just Fine are such amazing songs.  One song that always makes me cry and I can only guess it's because it's so good, is A Song For Mama.  I keep going back to this cd often.  It is a favourite of mine in general.  The guys harmonies are terrific and the soul here is superb.  Get this if you don't already have it, because it's such a smooth and chilled cd, you'll love it too.  
 I'm a student of a culinary school and this book helps me a lot.  You can find everything about cooking techniques, sauces, tools, measures, you name it!!  It is very simple and accurate. If you love food, you must have this book 
 Listening to my father's stories about going to hear Muddy Waters live in Chicago in the 70's, I can understand why he dislikes most of the music out today.  In an age where most music is as packaged and plastic as a Barbie doll, how many artists can make their audience jump up and SHOUT!  Muddy Waters personified the Deep South; a mixture of spirituality and soul with a secular sexy slide guitar.  You can hear his joy through the recording; he completely gives himself to the audience, and their response, in kind, is electric.  "Mannish Boy", the first cut has been reworked many a time, but this is by far the best recorded version.  "19 Years Old" is one of the sexiest guitar workings EVER.  PLEASE buy this album and see why this man was considered a guitar GOD by pretty much every classic rock artist from Eric Clapton to Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones.  The only regret I have about owning this fabulous live CD is that I wasn't there 
 I brought this item for my son as a gift for his second birthday and he absolutely loves it! The crayons dont stain your tub or walls and its very easy to clean. Wonderful item for bath time fun 
 This valuable resource guide not only offers pricing information, but 'closer look' background and history on many, many items. I was able to use this book to take stock of items I currently have and become more knowledgeable about designers and collections I had not yet discovered.  The information is concise and readable; the visuals are beautifully done.  A big bonus at the end includes a directory of auctioneers, clubs and societies, and, my particular favorite --Internet resources.  I've learned a lot from this book and refer to it often.  All in all, a very accesible, enjoyable book 
 This book, along with its companion translations of the Dhammapada and Bhagavad Gita, also by Eknath Easwaran, should be required for any serious student of Eastern Wisdom. If you can't afford Swami Nikhilanandas multi-volume set of complete translations of every Upanishad, and even if you can, you should also have this volume on your shelf 
 I've rated this sermon according to its apparent value as a historical artifact.  I don't think it would be fair for me to rate it as a sermon per se.  But that doesn't prevent my having an opinion.  I am curious about the community which reacted so strongly to the approach taken in this sermon. Was it representative of the populace in general, or was there some unique characteristic or circumstance that could explain the extreme response?  The intro as I recall states that the community was considered a "hard case" unlikely to respond favorably to invocations to godliness, so I think something must have occurred to create a (temporary?) vulnerability to the fear-based call to spiritual revival that this sermon represents.  I wonder what it was?    On a more personal note, the tone of the sermon reminds me of the type of rant that struck terror into my youthful heart as an involuntary member of a southern fundamentalist church decades ago.  At that period in American history, we were as likely to be threatened by immanent violent invasion of our homes by cadres of godless communists who would drag us into our yards and torture us into renouncing God, as by hellfire after our miserable lives were over.    My impression is that the popularity of this genre of sermon continues, with more contemporary nightmares from the socio-political demonic pantheon substituted for the now largely irrelevant godless communists of my childhood.  People have been so immersed in video over-stimulation that hellfire imagery isn't quite enough to stir the baser passions now.  But, when fear-conditioning has been so effective in manipulating the multitudes, the pitch is too good to give up.  Emotional manipulation rules in every age, and with a little modification in technical details the rant lives on.  Don't think that I doubt the good intentions of many of those who take the rant approach.  I am sure that most are convinced that freaking the heck out of honest hardworking folks who have taken time out of their busy care-wracked lives to listen courteously to them, is somehow going bring them up short and make them live more righteous lives and therefore do them good and get them into heaven.    And, can I be sure that it does not really help in some cases?  For one thing, as I recall there's a kind of psychological catharsis after extreme fear that emotionally refreshes, makes one feel cleansed and new.  Surely that's better than a descent into addiction and despair?  Also, it may be that some of us are dependent on a regular dose of threat / fear for sufficient motivation to live in a decent, non-predatory way.  If this is the case, I cannot say there is no social benefit from the occassional rant.  But I do not think there is spiritual benefit from it, neither for rant-er (who develops a bullying, dictatorial tendency) nor for rant-ee (who becomes inwardly servile and dependent).  Neither bullying nor servility provide fertile soil for spiritual development.  Indulgence of either tendency interferes with the experience of humility, stunting both heart and mind.  This is a highly personal conviction, rooted in recollection of the terror I felt at the flood of vicious images invoked in the "sermons" I endured as a child.  As I grew older I found such rants increasingly repulsive and inconsistent with core Christian teachings.  Fear was strong but ultimately impotent; years before I left home for college it could no longer suppress conscious acknowledgement of my fundamental doubt that god existed.    This sad history has a happy resolution:  My doubt was overcome through years of consideration, contemplation, and prayer.  I am confident that God does exist, and equally confident that God is NOT pleased with those who use the noble teaching of Christ as a stick to beat people down.  I have noticed that great Christian teachers whose legacies have endured for centuries tend to emphasize love more than fear.  Billy Graham is a familiar example of the success of this approach.  Though he may be forgotten entirely in a generation or less, there's no doubting his contemporary influence.  He is much more widely known and respected than any member of the rant crowd.  It is easy to understand why!  Life breaks our hearts sometimes.  When our faith is at its lowest ebb, naturally, instinctively, we seek hope and encouragement, a glimpse of divine light.  Ranters simply cannot deliver 
 This book is a must-read for anyone who's ever been angry with their  kids...in other words, every parent!  In the second of her three incredible  books, Ms. Samalin shows us that it is normal to sometimes feel intense  anger toward our children.  Using real-life examples from her parenting  workshops, she describes the most common triggers for parental anger, and  provides specific techniques for dealing with it in a way that we can be  proud of later.  In addition to helping me feel better about my own  behavior, I know that responding in the ways Samalin suggests has helped me  to provide a much better model of anger management for my kids.  After all,  this is not a skill that comes naturally; it is learned, for better or  worse, at home.  I am so grateful to have had this book to turn to when my  children were still impressionable preschoolers 
 This Radio Dramatization is excellant.  It keeps the original spirit of Star Wars (A New Hope) while telling the story in a different way.  The scenes and diologue that were not in the movie give a different perspective to the story that does nothing short of enrich it 
 This is the most scary thing I ever seen and I would recommend this DVD for everyone 
 This is trenchant, demanding, totally depressing. I found myself defeated by this book early on. It was like an avalanche. Nor do I find the view that Nazism=a religion very enlightening, short of being an obvious comparison. I guess I just don't have the heart to go through this book, right now 
 My wife loves this box set.  I find friends to be a good show as well 
 It is so nice to visit lovable, if flawed Cork O'coonor again. The changes in his character add realism to him. This book captures the qualities of a small town and the people who live there. Cork, again, strives to stay true to his ideals, although not always in the most conventional ways. Krueger haas done it again 
 For a manager who might be considering a GIS implementation for the first time, this book can be useful. Tomlinson offers an overview of the main issues that you may have to deal with. These include designing the database and, very importantly, limiting the scope of the project. You should be careful not to attempt too much in a first GIS project. Rather, attention should be paid to devising explicitly the remit of the project, and what it will not attempt to do.  The examples in the book can be very useful in helping you do the above. Treat them as case studies that illustrate the manifold ways to intensively use geographic information.  The book also shows how GIS has invigorated geography. For decades, it was a relatively sleepy field. But the availability of massive amounts of geographic information and cheap computing has turned this field into an exciting place for the new century 
 I highly recommend this book. I read it in nearly one sitting. The structure of the book is Platonic dialogue/'My Dinner with Andre.' The conversations of five friends are the entirety of the book. It deals with complex philosophical ideas on economies and natural systems in a highly readable way. The book centers on the idea of biomimicry, in which natural phenomena are imitated (engineered) in such a way that using natural principles creates efficiency. Essentially it is the notion that there are basic principles to which all systems naturally adhere, and understanding those systems can help us frame economics more rationally and sustainably. Jacobs discusses notions of positive-feedback loops, negative-feedback stops, dynamic stability. All this within the idea that evolutionary processes, interdependencies, and natural tensions and tendencies are the basis of economic interaction 
 What a wonderful reading experience this small but powerful book was. All of Thich Nhat Hanh's works are worth reading.  
 My son loves anything to do with Disney's Little Einsteins!  As my first child, he amazes me every day with the things he learns and remembers from that show.  He loves the Rocket attached to the book 
 now i know i might be a little wacky to say an illustrated novel is my favorite reading of all time. but that's exactly what it is. craig thompson creates such a unique atmosphere with this book that it makes it incredibly hard to put down. the drawings are superb, the plot is outstanding. he tells the tale of his growing up in wisconsin and his struggles in becoming the man he wants to be in this beautifully told story. this book will have you laughing, thinking, and crying. perfection. read this book with an open mind and you'll leave with changed perspective 
 This is a love story about Ruby and Jack, two simple people who appreciate the kindness that the other has to offer. There is no great passion between Ruby and Jack, and their lives are quite ordinary and middle (if not "lower middle") class. Ruby is a heavy smoker, a habit that she picked up from her abusive first husband. Jack is a quiet and uneducated man who likes Ruby's bad cooking. When Ruby is diagnosed with lung cancer, Jack's whole world falls apart. Perhaps a psychologist would label the two as "co-dependent." In fact, Ruby and Jack have discovered the key ingredient that makes every good marriage work: Ruby takes care of Jack's needs, and Jack takes care of Ruby's needs. They give eachother comfort and strength, and it is a heartbreak when Ruby dies and leaves her aging husband to fend for himself. The alternating first person perspective works quite well, and the book is enjoyable. Why 4 stars and not 5? Like one reader, I must admit that there was a certain spark missing from this book.    
 This would have been 5 stars but I don't like the english phonetic translation of the Korean characters.  It is better to learn the Korean alphabet and use it to learn words. The book is great, simple to follow.  It may be designed for kids, with all the Korean word games etc... but it helped me retain what I had learned and I strongly reccommend this as a starting point for studying Korean.   It comes with cards you cut out and can carry around and use to help study when you have a spare minute. It is good value for money.    
 Story book style of delivery made this book enjoyable for the entire family. This book was packed full of information yet the manner in which it is written made it enjoyable to read as well as retain. Very informative and interesting as well as fun. 
 I work with sex offenders and persons who suffer trauma.  We have used this film extensively to address their perpetrators understanding of the effects of their abuse.  It also helps to understand the answer to question, "Why would a woman put up with this abuse; why didn't she/why doesn't she JUST leave?" This film helps them to understand the answers to these questions as well as to increase victim empathy -- a large part of the programs in which I've worked.  It is a very difficult film to watch but ultimately leads to insights about abused women and children.  Travis Merrell, M.A. Registered Drama Therapis 
 DAMN!!! THATS THE ONLY WAY I COULD DISCRIBE THIS BOOK. THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING. THE WAY THAT THE AUTHOR WENT INTO GREAT DETAIL WITH HIS DISCRIPTION OF THE DEATHS AND THE AUTOPSIES AND HIS IN DEPTH RESEARCH THAT HE DID OF HOW PEOPLE WOULD HAVE REACTED IF THIS REALLY HAPPENED. I HAVE READ A LOT OF BOOKS IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT THIS BOOK TAKES THE CAKE. 
 A well known publisher/editor once said, "the purpose of a newspaper is to make money."  In the case of the "Union-Register," the newspaper has been acquired by a large corporation that treats its chain of newspapers like it treats its chain of fast food restaurants.  The newspaper is now being managed by corporate suits whose attention is on the bottom line rather than the local news.  Jack Tagger, a staff writer on the paper, finds himself demoted to writing obits after irritating the corporation's chief executive.  Writing an obituary gives new direction to Tagger's career after the deceased, James Bradley Stomarti, is indentified as the musician Jimmy Stoma, well known by Tagger's generation.  Digging into Stoma's death raises questions.  Stoma's widow, Cleo Rio, does not seem unhappy about his sudden demise, and is using the death as PR for her own career.  Tagger links up with Stoma's sister and others to carry out his own investigation.  Things can be deadly as other people are attacked and/or killed, and homes are ransacked.  Someone is looking for something.  Cleo Rio claims Stoma was producing her new CD, but there is some mystery about just what Stoma was producing.  There is unpublished music involved, and a question about who owns what.  People are maneuvering for control if they can find the music.  Meanwhile, back at the newspaper, there is a separate power struggle.  Foreign corporations are trying to take control.  The newspaper's previous owner has a large block of corporate stock which is key to the issue.  Tagger finds himself in the middle of both power struggles and, in the meantime, is obsessed with finding out what happened to his own father.  This is one of those novels that the reader gets involved in, and it will keep you up late to get to the end.  Just when it looks like a black hat will walk away whole, there is a surprising twist in the tale 
 Philip Roth is fast becoming one of my favorite living writers, and Operation Shylock was a major reason why.  Having read American Pastoral, Portnoy's Complaint, and the Human Stain previously, for me Operation Shylock was the most haunting of his novels. It does seem unfortunate that readers have failed to grasp the crux of the novel, which is identity dislocation, and instead read the novel baldly and I am tempted to address some of the criticism found here directly, but will instead speak directly to my thoughts on the novel.  If met on its own terms, this novel is both powerful and complex. Philip Roth is often accused of disloyalty. He has been called a self-hating Jew, an anti-liberal, amongst other accusations, usually by groups or people who believe he is the voice of their cause.  This historical context underlies the psychological conundrum of Operation Shylock in which Roth plays fast and loose with his own public persona as a writer, thinker, and Jew. He beginsthe story with an account of psychological severance that leads into a cat and mouse, noir-ish chase through Israel after his other "self".  Far from self-promotion, he uses the gravitas of his writerly image as another example of disclocation- showing that the "real" him is as far from the other "self" as from his "public" self. He dives into the murky waters of Racial identity (his-jewish), present-past continuity of self, and the ideological (does and idea define a person?).   The versimilitude of the novel allows Roth the ability to dissect his own identity very publicly. Though he sometimes lampoons and satrizes his critics (even Dante did that!), in reality, the book delves much deeper and gives a much more probing exploration to these issues than are typically covered in the NYTimes bestseller/oprah book club style books.  This is real literature that will outlast and transcend most other contemporary fiction.    So read and enjoy.  You're in for a challenging, entertaining, and thought-provoking ride 
 When I bought my Cork Pops Corkpopper, I should have bought these at the same time.  Somy suggestion is to do what I did not.  Especially if given as a gift.  Of course I spent through mine because I used it to tease my Bird, she would do a cute whistle when she heard that burst of air

 Being a so-called 'Child of Apollo.' I read this book expecting few new insights to the space program's formulative period. Gee, was I ever wrong! This book is filled with nuggests of historic information that provides the reader with greater context and historic analysis than any other book on the topic I have yet to read. Any student of history, political science, or space advocate should read this book carefully to be well-grounded in the Apollo Era. McDougall did an outstanding job in relating to the reader details of the context of the American and Soviet space programs throughout the 50's and 60's. Knowledge of the space age would be totally incomplete without having read this book! I highly recommend it. It is no wonder that this book won McDougall the 1986 Pulitzer Prize. 
 I ran into this book while studying for my Black Belt in Six Sigma.  As a professional engineer, in the field of Energy - this kind of book peaks my interest.  I learned much about the long history of Risk, and the now better understand the use of risk in today's business world.  Much of the book includes narrative detail, however, I believe much of this material will fade in my memory over time.  I found it an interesting read, but not exactly what I was hoping for.  In fairness - the author did an excellent job with a difficult subject 
 As a non-profit executive director, I have found the book study format to be a great way to engage my Board of Directors in issues that we work on.  Dr. Miller-Adams' book is set up very well for this activity, is well written for understanding issues, and provides positive, replicable examples of organizations helping low income Americans build their assets.  Written in a readable style, it is not intimidating for the non social worker.  The book is politically neutral and can easily be used by many mainstream organizations to move forward on an issue that is truly important for America 
 Heinlein's views of society are reflected in this (and many of his other)book even more than the basic story line. Especially insightful was his treatment of the term juvenile delinquent 
 Not a very realistic movie, but very enjoyable.  Whoopi almost at her best.   Doesn't pluck the heart strings like "Color Purple", not as moving as "Clara's Heart", but certainly showcases her comedic talents.  Loved the "silver box" and "tropical fish" comments.  Some very funny parts that did require real acting talent.  A thoroughly enjoyable film best enjoyed with someone to watch it with you. 
 I hadn't had one of these in a decade, but it is even better than I remembered.  All the facts, just the facts, and I agree with him most of the time.  Even found my oddball and other classics there.  Thanks for a great tool to use with my kids.  
 Another romantic novel by Danielle Steele... this time the setting is Europe. Isabelle Forrester is stuck in a miserable marriage with a wealthy and obnoxious French man who treats her really bad. Bill Robinson is stuck in a life-less marriage to a wife who does not care about him. The two come together and over time fall madly in love. One night in England, together in a limousine, they give each other a breath-taking and long-lasting kiss. The kiss turns out to be a life-changing event for both of them...   A moving story with a happy ending 
 It arrived today and fits perfectly!  (My boyfriend likes it, too! 
 An Unquiet mind by Kay Redfield Jamison beautiful done on a difficult topic. Depression is a very intense mental illness one that is hard to understand, but Kay Redfield Jamison in her descriptions really makes the disease come alive. "... terrible struggle, a recurring night-mare or violent and dreadful moods spelled only now and again by weeks, sometimes months of great fun, passion, high enthusiasms" (p42). Jamison wants you to understand both parts about depression because most people just associate it with the lows but the highs play a huge role especially in why people as smart as Jamison is don't take their medicine. Jamison tells all in this book, holds nothing back about a disease that people can be very judgmental about hoping that people will come to understand just that she has what depression truly is.  Jamison goes in a chronological order showing life as happy and how it suddenly changed when her dad became depressed. " ...my fathers moods were further blackening" (p34). I liked that the story progressed as her illness progressed, one step at a time, one high after a low it is much more effective that way. Jamison reflects often in this book about how that has affected her in the present. She is talking about then with the wisdom of the now. " When I look back on it, my denial and ignorance seem virtually incomprehensible" (p59) Jamison does a fantastic job bringing you into the mind of someone with severe depression. I highly recommend it 
 I have to say that when I first heard "I Alone" on MTV back in 95 I believe, I really didn't like the song at all. I was 25, and really into metal bands like Sepultura, Metallica, Megadeth and so forth. Yet by the grace of God a girl friend of one of my friends had the "cassette" if you believe that, and I was bored one day so I thought I'd check it out for the hell of it. First listen I immediately noticed the song Iris. Hell yeah this song rocks! And this coming from a metalhead no less. So thankfully for that one song, I gave the rest of the album a chance. Fast forward 11 years. Here I am, owning all of their albums and am a devoted fan. Go figure. lol. One other thing I have to mention, this is my favortie cd to listen to while driving around on a pleasant sunny day. I have not yet found a cd comparable to this one in that respect. 
 Please note:  This book is approximately 75% paraphrased from Eco's "The Search for the Perfect Language," which contains a more thorough treatment of the material that the two books share.  The material that is new in this book is interesting, making the read worthwhile for the dedicated reader who has already enjoyed "The Search..".  For the casual reader, "Serendipities" is much shorter and more accessible than "The Search for the Perfect Language", making it a suitable alternative or possibly an introduction to the longer text.  However, if you take offense at paying to read the same information twice, simply do not purchase both books.  Enjoy 
 This is the ultimate clinical reference manual. The medical information is surprisingly easy to understand. A must have around the house 
 This is a very small 1/3 quart pot. Its holds one cup of water to the brim. It is used for sauces or melting butter, etc. Mostly it looks pretty. Very costly for such a limited use 
 Thinking about how one thing affects another either comes naturally to you or it doesn't. For most people it is the latter. For these people, The Fifth Discipline is a wonderful gift. Our emotions tell us to do one thing, and that one thing is usually not in our own best interest. I had heard clients of mine talk about the beer game, and I was delighted to see it described in this book. For the average reader, this book will make you expert enough in systems thinking to be much more successful with your decisions. If you feel that you would like more help in this area, please read The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook. It is a very helpful companion book that will give you practical advice for implementing what you learn in this book. If you have colleagues or friends who often make decisions that do not turn out well, it may be because they do not understand how to think about business as a system. Give them this book, and you will have done the person a great favor. Follow-up by discussing what they have learned, and help them with an exercise or two from the Fieldbook. You'll be glad you did 
 By the time "Millennium" rolled into its second season the series creator, Chris Carter, was forced out of his usual head production duties due to the simple fact that his other series "The X-Files" demanded his attention more (in part because by then it was already a cultural stamp), not to mention production on "The X-Files" movie was starting to roll and so Carter found himself having to work on a feature film in addition to his TV duties. Brought in to babysit were Glen Morgan and James Wong, the writing team behind such classic "X-Files" episodes like "Tooms" and "Little Green Men." It can be said that Wong and Morgan tried to bring some of what made "The X-Files" popular to "Millennium," most notably the idea of shadow conspiracies and worldwide plots centered on truths the heroes don't really know and go through hell trying to find. Here the series takes a much different turn from what Season 1 was, which was more of an exploration of evil in the modern world and Frank Black's attempts to find peace at home with his family while catching some of the worst predators society has to offer. But Morgan and Wong don't completely turn the series around, all the apocalyptic poetry is still here as well as some gruesomely twisted serial killers and psychos. What Morgan and Wong really do add is a more epic sense of things, the episodes in season two really explore the darker sides of religion, faith and the sense that there will be an armageddon and it will happen sooner than we think. "The Beginning And The End" opens the season with great wit and style, Morgan and Wong brilliantly incorporate the passing comet of the time into the story, taking advantage of the superstitious lore that comes with such celestial events (which was not too far from the truth. The year in which the episode premiered, 1997, saw the mass suicide of the Heaven's Gate cult). "Millennium" is one of the great thrillers ever to be produced on network TV, like no other show before it it perfectly mingled Biblical lore with true crime and questions and ideas we always have as a society. True, with Carter the show was grittier, darker and more violent, but Morgan and Wong brought a nice epic scope to the show, touching in spiritual themes many dramas today shy away from. Eventhough Carter was abscent, he left the show in good hands 
 Sphere by Michael Crichton is an excellant novel. This was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the Crichton novels that I have read.   The story revolves around a man named Norman Johnson. Johnson is a phycologist. He travels with 4 other civilans to a remote location in the Pacific Ocean to help the Navy in a top secret misssion. They quickly learn that under the ocean is a half mile long spaceship. The civilans travel to a center 1000 feet under the ocean to live while researching the spacecraft. They are joined by 5 Navy personel to help them run operations. However on the surface a typhoon comes and the support ships on the surface must leave. The team of ten is stuck 1000 feet under the surface of the ocean. After a day under the sea they find out that the spacecraft is actually an American ship that has explored black holes and has brought back some strange things back to earth.  This novel does not have the research that some of the other Crichton novels have, but it still has a lot of information on random things from the lawes of partial pressure to behavior analysis.  I would strongly recommend this book 
 I admit to being a glutton for the story of "A Christmas Carol", by Charles Dickens and both Hollywood and England have used this wonderful story in countless film realizations. While 2003's "A Carol Christmas", would never be up on the pedestal with the likes of the versions starring Alistair Sim and Geoerge C. Scott I found it a delightful modern turn on the story with some surprisingly effective performances and moments. Tori Spelling may at first glance seem an unlikely choice for the scrooge like lead character who thanks to visits by three spirits on Christmas Eve learns the error of her ways, however she did a good job in the role. Her change of heart towards her fellow man at the conclusion which always seems to be the hardest part of the Scrooge character for actors to make believable was also handled properly by Ms. Spelling. The real joy of this movie for me however was the welcome return of Gary Coleman as the Ghost of Christmas Past in a rather wistful performance that was in many ways quite autobiographical. He brings some much valued humour and indeed a little sadness into the story making his part of the story the most interesting.  Almost everyone is familiar with the age old story of "A Christmas Carol", and how the old miser Scrooge is visited by three spirits over the course of one Christmas Eve who proceed to teach him the error of his ways. In this modern version Tori Spelling plays meaner than mean Carol Cartman the host of a talk show that is mainly geared towards exploiting its guests in th ename of higher ratings than it is in trying to make the world a better place. Carol is tight fisted and domineering and strikes terror into the hearts of all her production crew, in particular her much put upon personal assistant Roberta (Nina Siemaszko) and her production manager Jimmy (Michael Landes). Carol has so little regard for her production team that she begrudges even buying them Christmas gifts, a job she delegates to Roberta to do in her own time even though she herself is busy with her young child. Taking a nap just prior to the start of her Christmas Eve telecast Carol is visited by the disturbing spirit of her aunt Marla (Dinah Manoff), who in life was the mean and hard as nails main driving influence in Carol's life and made her sacrifice much in her climb to the top as a talk show host. Marla warns Carol that she will end up like she has become if she does not reform her ways and informs Carol that she will be visited by three spirits who will take her on a journey that she will never forget. The visits of the three spirits take Carol back over her life as she sees her literal adaption by Aunt Marla who takes over her life and drives her reluctantly on to success hardening the young girl along the way. Carol gets to see how Marla destroyed her chance at happiness with good spirited boyfriend John (Jason Brooks), and how she has got to where she now is treating her staff not as responsible human beings but as her slaves. The visit of the Ghost of Christmas future in particular brings Carol into reality when it is revealed just what everyone actually thinks of her after her death and how few people really care what happens to her. Awakened from her sleep Carol is jolted into action to avoid this terrible fate that could be hers if she doesn't change her ways and during her Christmas Eve telecast she turns over a new leaf in her relations with her co workers,her viewing audience, former boyfriend John, and her long estranged family who she then spends Christmas Eve with at a happy conclusion.   "A Carol Christmas", benefits most from both a beautiful look and the featured veteran television stars who appear as the spirits. William Shatner in the dual roles of television personality Dr. Bob, and the Ghost of Christmas has alot of fun with his role in a comic performance and he teams especially well with Tori Spelling however I enjoyed the rare reappearance by Gary Coleman the most. His character while also driven with comic lines has serious undertones and an often sad demeanour to him playing a "washed up child performer from television", who is now the Ghost of Christmas Past. Long after his great stardom on the television series "Different Strokes", Gary Coleman laces his dialogue with many wry comments about the effects of stardom and what to do when the limelight has gone which made me hope that this talented performer is given more to do in the future as an adult. Dinah Manoff in the old Jacob Marley role redone here as carol's aunt is also effective as the real villian of the piece and she is positively hateful in the flash back sequences where she is depicted manipulating the young Carol into becoming what she was not capable of achieving herself. I really enjoyed the romantic element between Nina Siemaszko as Carol's harrassed assistant Roberta in the revamped Bob Crachit role, and handsome Michael Landes as the producer of Carol's chat show. Their scenes together really had a warm feeling about them in particular with Roberta's daughter in the Christmas decorating scene. Overall the look of "A Carol Christmas", had the trademark glossy appearance associated with Hallmark productions and that fine Christmasy look and feel makes it a worthy although not classic addition to any Christmas movie collection.     Many would say "why yet another version of "A Christmas Carol"?", and certainly I asked it myself just that before viewing this DVD however I feel there is room for one more modern variation on this immortal story. The colourful visiting ghosts and Gary Coleman in particular give "A Carol Christmas", its own distinct look and feel and the timeless message of the Charles Dickens story is still as relevant and worthy of thought no matter what form the story assumes. Hallmark have a unique way of creating pleasing Christmas movies and this well produced and glossy looking Christmas story is well worth revisiting each Christmas. Enjoy!   
 This is the rarest of books on Amazon. It seems to have attracted universal praise and unanimous 5 star reviews. Well, I'm only gonna give it 4 stars.   I liked the author.  He seems charming, friendly, and the kind of guy whose company would be enjoyable over a brew or two.  The book was pleasantly concise at 200 pages. The author is a name dropper of rare style, but manages not to offend with pomposity or pretension.         My only problem with this book is that I didn't understand a word.  To be accurate, I understood some words -- "is" for example -- and I think I sort of understood his main point: the "universe" consists of an infinite number of universes.  In other words, somewhere in a universe far away and long ago I grew up to play center field for the Yankees. What I didn't understand is how he got to that point with concepts such as the anthropic principle and false vacuums.  As an example of incomprehensibiity on page 203 in one sentence he talks about "an eternally inflating universe.  In the next sentence he talks about the end of inflation and "postinflationary islands" that "are rapidly expanding."  How can inflation be eternal, if there is an end to inflation?  How can there be "postinflationary islands" that are expanding? Isn't that a contradiction?  Then, there is the statement on page 204 that each island in the universe is a "self-contained infinite universe"  How can a universe be infinite if is only an island in space?       Well, I'm interested in the author's conclusions and I admire his prose, but I don't find his arguments simple.  There's something about cosmology these days that smacks of theology. Faith-based science.  Interesting.  Smallchief            
 Me and my son love all the books Ms Berger writes, This is a re-telling of the first christmass, but with a very soft tone to it, my son asked me to read this book several times the day it arrive, read it, it's a must.   also read other books by Ms Berger,  1. Grandfather twilight  2.When the sun Rose  3. Gwinna  4.Angels on a pin  5.All the way to Lasa  &  6. A lot of Otters 
 Udine Spragg = Becky Sharp (and a damn sight nastier too). 
 This is my favorite book, but its not for everyone. Pynchon's style is dense and you'll find yourself reading sentences two or three times before you can make out the grammar.    The story reads like a mystery, but this plot is only a cover for the philosophy Pynchon is proposing. Once you find the philosophy, though, a second and third read will reveal that the story of Oedipa and even the structure of the book are examples of that philosophy. Oh yeah, and its funny as hell too.  If you can deal with Pynchon's style and stave off the idea that he is simply toying with his readers, then The Crying of Lot 49 is one of the most rewarding little books you'll find 
 Kamani's book of short stories addresses the sexuality of women, and often of young girls in the context of either being in or from India.  It includes all kinds of sexuality and heirarchies of power that both arise  and fall away when girls explore this aspect of their lives.  Very  powerful, sometimes shocking, but always rings with truth.... I reccommend  this book highly, but be aware that the truth is not always a comfortable  thing to look at 
 Back in prehistoric times, John Shaft was the role model if you was a nice guy, Priest from Superfly was the man if you was dreaming of livin' the life. Shaft's Big Score the followup to the Cool Black crimefighter series, is a slickened up version of the much more grittier original. Still, the bad ... gets off. The climatic chase has been "rescene" in dozens of later films from Hollywood and around the world and Mr. Parks still doesn't get the proper props for bringing to the screen a cultural icon that despite time and Singleton's "nephew" is still the Man.  The late Reverend O.C. Smith is too countrified for singing a Big City theme but the powers the be didn't want to pay Isaac"Black Moses-Voice of ... Reason Chef from South Park" Hayes asking price. But there is a tease of what it might of been in the club  scene where somebodys' girlfriend swirls to the early '70s funk. Never mind the usher pass the joint and hand me the gin Shaft Big Score is smokin' Jim 
 Delightful working-class Irish romp that packs a punch in quite a few ways.  Funny, insightful, mordant and eminently readable.  I'll be reading more Sheridan 
 This is a well done book, thoroughly researched on a subject who shyed away from publicity, honesty, record-keeping and diaries. It is, unfortunately, possibly the worst example of sloppy editing I have seen. In many cases it seems that someone entered corrrections on the galley and then both the correction and the original item remained in the final version. Other cases are simply missed errors or spellchecker errors ("their" for "there," that sort of thing). If you can wade through the many, many typos it is an engaging work. Of especial, and unique, interest is his recounting of the ultimate fates of many of the book's protagonists. Some died in prison, some were gunned down years after having informed on the gangs, others died of heart attacks in their neighborhood bar, while yet others continued a life of crime at a lesser pace than in their youth.  Enjoy the book; just hold your nose for all the errors. It's a pity, really. I'm sure the author is as mortified by what happened to his manuscript as any reader, and probably more so 
 I'm glad I purchased these locks 3+ years ago.  I have used them on 5 trips and they have remained intact.  I have a strong feeling that at some point, TSA did unlock my luggage and then locked it back up because a few of the locks have scratches near the keyhole.  Additionally, since I have red locks, I can identify my luggage quickly at baggage claim 
 Yundi Li's Vienna Golden Hall recital is really a piece of gold. In this CD, he played pieces from Scarlatti, Mozart, Schumann to Liszt. I like his playing for Scarlatti's Sonata in E major K380 tremendously. To me, it definitely can compare with Horowitz's Moscow recital. Yundi Li came to New York last year and I went to his concert. I had heard all the other programs on this CD at the concert.  But I think he played much better on this CD. I agree that some people considered his interpretation more in line with the composers. Comparing his live concert, I think his playing of Mozart's piano sonata in C major K330 is much more matured in this CD.  The sound is great and musicality is superb.  Again, Mozart's K330 was played by Horowitz in his Moscow recital as well. So, for those of you who have Horowitz's Moscow recital CD, Yundi Li's is certainly an additional collection to show what a young pianist can do.  I highly recommend this CD for piano music lovers.      
 This product was exactly what I expected... I would definately order from them again 
 This album is a li'l "deeper" than music out there for these fools who are giving this album a 1 star to understand. This album's an excellent piece of work. BUYY ITT 
 A New Encyclopedia Of Freemasonry may just be the best pure resource work on the subject today. This is not your typical Freemasonic expose where someone sells-out the fraternity. Come here looking for handshakes, passwords, rituals and secrets, hoping to catch Freemasons at play, and you'll be bitterly disappointed. This is not the cheap seats, so don't expect any home-run balls to come soaring in.   Besides, this is no easy read by no means. This work is clearly written for scholars and  veterans of the craft, with a charitable appeal to beginning Freemasons truly aspiring to learn as much as they can, so it is, therefore, an invaluable resource tool for both constituencies; but I nevertheless recommend it too, for sincerely curious outsiders. There is something here of interest for everyone's level, even though the book is not for everyone.   This is Freemasonry from A to Z, and everything allegedly associated with it directly or indirectly--from A to Z.  It is an extremely comprehensive layout of Freemasonry, Secret societies, and Religious doctrine. And whether or not all three of these subjects should be grouped in this one tome or any tome, for that matter, I cannot say (and surely wouldn't if I could). But then, when you speak of Freemasonry, and you know what you're talking about....oh so many subjects come to mind--depending on who you're talking to 
 Alfred Hitchcock's first color movie, "Rope," explores a rare but disturbing motivation for murder: mere thought. As history - twentieth century history in particular - demonstrates, monstrous acts sometimes originate from ideas. A mere synaptic spark within the wrong psychological framework may translate into a skull fractured by a bullet, a deep wound occupied by a knife, or a genocidal extermination by a governing body. Human neural pathways, as varied as snowflakes, manifest these dangerous ideas in innumerable ways. Most fizzle within the guilty brains that formed them, impotent as wet matchbooks. Others, unfortunately, manage to find a conduit into the eye-for-an-eye realm of action. In such cases, concepts seem to murder. Imagination becomes brutal reality. "Rope" examines, via its morally diverse cast, both sides of this thorny fence.  A thriller in reverse, the movie begins with a murder. Following the opening street scene, across which Hitchcock struts, the camera hones in on a curtain-clad window. Then a scream. Inside, David Kently's body goes limp. Brandown Shaw and Phillip Morgan check for signs of life before uncoiling the thick rope around David's neck. After a brief period of shock Brandon resounds with pride, as if he had just reached the summit of Everest or bagged his dream job. Phillip remains distant, querulous, and shaky. Placing the murder minutes after the opening titles compels the viewer to focus on motivation. The act of killing gets de-emphasized. Something subtler tugs at this narrative thread.  More shocking than the strangulation is the party Brandon has planned. People will arrive at the scene of the crime, a beautiful apartment that breathtakingly overlooks downtown New York, soon. Brandon begins to rhapsodize about superiority. Weeding out of the weak, the responsibility of superior beings, etc. He rattles off a litany of social Darwinism derived from misunderstandings of Nietzsche. These ideas, the basis of David's killing, become prime suspects. And David, now hidden in the large chest that will soon provide the party's centerpiece, gets condemned as one of the "weaklings." The unknowing housemaid sets the food on top of the chest that contains the corpse. Brandon sees this as the icing on the cake. Phillip broods like a guilty child.  As the party picks up the question "where's David" occurs with increasing frequency. No one seems to know. David's fiancee arrives. So does her ex-boyfriend. Neither are pleased. Frustration builds. Finally, Brandon and Philip's inspiration, Rupert Cadell, played by a mesmerizing Jimmy Stewart in his first Hitchcock role, shows up. He comes across as intimidating and brash. Someone tells him, "it's good to see you again." He responds coldly, "why?" Brandon brings up "the perfect murder" and his beliefs about superiority. Rupert agrees with everything. He even adds in some bone-chilling nuances of his own. David's father, also an invitee, protests and demands that they stop their macabre conversation. He doesn't even want to hear the theories that Brandon finds so engaging. As if speech somehow bestows validity on ideas. As if ideas could somehow kill. Rupert becomes suspicious, which boils over when, upon his exit, the housemaid accidentally gives him a hat embossed with "DK" inside. David's hat. Rupert confronts the now nervous, and dangerous, duo.  The last ten minutes of the film contain indescribable tension. A gun appears. Ultimate control of the situation depends on its possessor. It changes hands a few times. Rupert sees and hears the consequences of the ideas he once fed Brandon. Reeling, he decides that morality depends on more than concepts. Something mysterious and ineffable bubbles under reprehensible acts. He tells Brandon "There's something deep down inside of you that would allow you to do this, just as there's something deep down inside of me that wouldn't allow it." And then Rupert's clincher, the movie's superquote: "Did you think you were God, Brandon?" Rupert's utterance, which probably had a different resonance for a 1948 audience, restores moral homeostasis. The line slashes Brandon's pretentions like a cutlass through yogurt. By juxtaposing Brandon's action with Rupert's inaction, the movie seems to say that belief in monstrous ideas does not imply a carrying out of reprehensible deeds. Instead, monstrous people, rife with amoral "stuff," that "something" Rupert alluded to, remain the problem. Ideas are off the hook. The film thus reveals a sticky, unanswerable question about human nature. If ideas produce different reactions in different people, then how do amoral acts arise?  In the final scene of this underrated Hitchcock masterpiece, a gun fires out a window. People stir. Sirens bellow. "You're going to die!" someone shouts. But no one in this film will die for mere ideas. Police can't arrest thoughts, and they can't apprehend concepts. "Rope" invites a deep reflection on the dichotomy between those that merely think of ideas and those arrestable folks who, unfortunately, decide to act on them 
 This book was great! It contains classic poems from well-known authors, poets from all over the world, and contemporary poets as well.  This book is highly recommended to anyone whether you have studied history for a long time or if you simply read it for leisure 
 From the moment I picked up this book until I laid it down I was convulsed with laughter.  Someday I intend reading it 
 This collection of poems is a fun variety of rhythm, imagery and humour. I found this collection a great daily read.  The first set of poems, "Cameos" are wonderful snapshots of the African American community. Dove does something that is very difficult and takes on the voice of different generations and genders in the same family to let us see inside the group. July 1925 had a great story. "Night" had a great rhythm and "Lake Erie" had wonderful unusual imagery.  As the collection progresses we move to more stand alone poems but they are all there to create new voices. She does what a good poet wants and takes a common theme and makes it new. A perfect example is "Parlor." We are dealing with death but with a bit of humour in the background.   The later poems are from a series on civil rights and Rosa Parks and are just as intriguing as the earlier voices, the views of a culture different from my own.  I took away from this collection that it was not a book about civil rights as so many thought from the title. But that it is a book about "Riding the Bus with Rosa Parks" in the sense that the African American community, especially the female sector, want to join that tradition and to honor what it means to be a part of the sector of the community.  If you want to read a very talented poet then I strongly suggest this collection. As noted, it isn't a collection soley focusing on civil rights. It is an anthology of unique voices. 
 I enjoyed and benefited from reading this book.  In it, Stoljar defends the thesis that the problem of phenomenal conscious experience in contemporary philosophy of mind is rooted in our ignorance of a type of "experience-relevant non-experiential truth".  In defending his thesis, Stoljar does a great job reviewing and summarizing many of the debates of the last couple of decades.  He invariably takes complicated arguments and simplifies their language and structure as he moves his discussion along.  The book is valuable for this aspect alone.  In terms of his position, it's a fairly modest idea - we're ignorant about something relevant but of course he can't say what it is!  It does, however, certainly appear a reasonable position to hold.  He argues that this epistemic view of the problem is successful in undermining the conceivability and knowledge arguments which conclude that experiential truths are not all entailed by the non-experiential truths.  Importantly, though, he is also arguing that none of the various philosophical/conceptual refutations of these arguments work.  According to Stoljar the problem of consciousness is not one where the debate can be won "from the armchair" within the confines of philosophy of mind at the present time.  I'm sympathetic to this since I also think we need to triangulate on the problem using other considerations.  At the same time, given the imperfect terms of the debate, I don't think Stoljar is entitled to the conclusion that our ignorance is specifically of non-experiential truths.  It is equally plausible, for instance, that the new truths would not be considered "non-experiential", but as truths upon which both experiential and non-experiential truths (as we currently conceive of them) supervene.  He considers a view very much like this (due to Russell), but concludes (wrongly in my humble opinion) that it is best thought of as an instance of his epistemic view.  I'll finish by reiterating my admiration for the book:  it's very well written and is recommended for those who follow these debates. 
 Years ago I read The Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit.  I was delighted to find the Jordan series to be even better and longer.  I just completed the last book and have started reading the first again.  On  rereading, it reveals more depth than I had seen the first time through.   If you want to lose yourself in an exciting world that never was, read  these books.  My only regret is that there aren't more of them 
 This makes a nice companion piece to the movie Zulu.  Released after Zulu, this movie is never the less a prequel.  Both movies are stand alone, so it is not imperative to see one or the other before viewing either.  A first rate cast and African scenery makes this a winner.  Though there seems to be a bit of an anti-British undercurrent, the movie has only a few historical inaccuracies.  The British did make a mistake, and sadly for the men involved, it resulted in the greatest defeat of a modern army by a tribal force.  Incredible battle scenes make this a must 
 This is a great book! The author shares her personal experiences, including mistakes, so we can learn from them. She also includes detailed information & instructions, along with drawings & photographs. I am so glad to find this book & can't wait to start my own little guinea flock to eat bugs, scorpions & fire ants! 
 Two very smart boys who like to study the solar system,Chuck and David,invite a man who likes everything for himself over to give a lecture to their space society.The man's name was Horatio.At the lecture Horatio  over-hears David,Chuck,and Theo,a Mushroom man from the Mushroom Planet,  talking about the space ship and when they are taking off.Horatio asks to  stay the night so he can see what they were planning to do.He sneaks aboard  the ship without anyone noticing him.Theo,David and Chuck find Horatio in  the back of the space ship when they were half way to The Mushroom  Planet,Basidium. When they reach,they begin to speak in Basidiumite  language. They didnt remember how to speak english.Horatio takes notes  about Basidium so he can prove his dicovery on earth. Horatio steals jewels  from the Basidiumites to bring back proof.He did this so he can be famous  on earth.Because the Basidiumites didn't want there land to be exposed the  king,Ta gave Horatio The Drink Of Forgetfulness.Horatio goes back to earth  and doesnt remember basidiumite language so his notes were useless 
 This autobiography of Zora Neale Hurston was very fascinating. She talks about her childhood on to her others works. I found this very humorous. I recommend this book for anyone wanting a interseting read 
 First off, I disagree with the negative reviews.  The photos are just fine and I'm 54 years old and a bit eyesight challenged.  The scale of many of the home plans is easy to calculate from her textual descriptions.  Many, if not most, of what she explains can be done on the cheap and I've done some of them.  For those studying architecture, either as a professional architect or interior designer, or one of us perenial students of everything, this is the best intro to residential architecture I've found.  It lays out the various principles in wonderful detail but in short enough chapters to keep our attention.  Theory and practice are merged in a concise and clear manner.  If you like "A Pattern Lauguage" and other Christopher Alexander books or were thinking of reading them then I would recommend this book for further study.  This book sits next to my work area as I design interiors in 3D computer graphics.  It is now one of my most important references.  With this information I can understand the problems and "fix" those awful house plans that are pervasive in plan books and on the Web.  - ji 
 BUY IT!!!! This is a great DVD.  It is heavy on the stuff from Brave New World, but that's because they were on the BNW tour when they recorded this.  Overall great show, the crowd was really into it, although this is more evident on the cd's IMO.  I only have two minor objections: 1- MORE BASS!!! kinda quiet. 2- Editing, looks like a toddler on caffine edited it.  Overall Great 
 I've always had a love/hate relationship with my sandals.  Love them when I first set eyes on the "must have" shoe, hate them when my feet are suffering from breaking them in.  I bought these sandals for a vacation that had a lot of walking involved.  From the first day I wore them they conformed perfectly to my feet.  I did an amazing amount of walking in them the first day and not one blister!  These sandals formed around my feet as if they were already broken in.  So basically i did not have to do it!  I highly recommend these sandals as a must have for any women's closet.  
 I had bought this item just for fun but it turns out that this really does work! I love this and don't bother buying the larger version of this, I am almost 100 percent sure that nobody who cares about their fitness and personal health wont fit into this size :]  It gives support to your back which is nice when working  out. I had went out to play some basketball with my friend today and after i removed the belt I had sweat so much in my abdominal area! This really does work :D! If you have back rpoblems/want to tone/lose weight then this is for you! I am turning 14 but please do not dismiss this review as if someone that lacks knowledge wrote it ^^ feel free to check my wishlist X 
  "Black Cross" takes us to the darkest hours of the Nazi regime. It is an action/adventure novel, but very detailed and realistic. The story builds up and the last 100 pages are a rollercoaster.   I don't want to give details of the plot, just to say that if you like action, adventure and II World War era stories, "Black Cross" stands out as one of the best.   
 Zakin is the Tom Wolfe of the environmental movement, which, contrary to popular opinion, is NOT boring.  Zakin shows that the history of the conservation is analogous to America's changing image of itself, a  combination of Alexis deTocqueville and The Right Stuff with hiking boots.  Funny, vivid, up-close-and-personal portraits of the New West hipsters and  the Inside-the-Beltway politicos who use very different methods to do the  same thing: fight a beautiful, losing battle to keep fragments of the  natural landscape in functioning order. Coyotes gives neophyte and veteran  alike a fun ride through the environmental movement's greatest hits, with a  terrific biographical section on Edward Abbey, telescoped coverage of  everyone from Aldo Leopold to Dave Brower, plus a compelling narrative  thread based on the life of the surprisingly intellectual neo-redneck Dave  Foreman, a quintessential American.  Required reading -- not just for  Birkenstock-wearers 
 This is exactly what it says - 11 tests like the SATs with answers and some explanation for each question but no strategy part, and no instruction in the material.  If you need a review book or a strategy book, look elswhere.  (the following is only for the math part of the book)  The SAT math section only requires geometry and intro algebra.  They are tricky but primarily in unraveling the convoluted wording.   I got this for my son (a bit late I find - some of his class mates started in 7th grade).  He is a good student and I was expecting he would zip through the math parts without a problem and we would focus on the verbal part.  He started out doing terribly in math sections.  There is no math in these questions he hasn't seen so the problem is understanding what the multi-step questions are really asking.  Even I get confused by the wording sometimes - so practice, practice, practice because it doesn't matter how good you are at math if you get stumped by the wording.  If these are close to the actual test questions (and I gather they are) there is a lot of work to do to get used to the style of the questions.  The explanations for each answer in the book are mostly adequate for self study but I needed to explain a few of them (maybe 1 in 10) so a few questions need some help from a competent adult.  As a HS math teacher I think the real problem in the math problems he got wrong (almost 1/2 of them) is to decipher the convoluted question involved.  (If I gave these questions on a test every student would holler "trick question".)  Their idea seems to be that you have to solve the problem through multiple steps each of which requires that you understand all the features of, for example, triangles or circles.  So even though it is multiple choice you aren't going to be able to easily eliminate two or three answers and make a good guess.  They are good questions but they take some getting used to.  I teach this stuff and am fairly good at it, even compared to other teachers, but I took the maximum time to get through most math sections (I got all of them right but you would expect that).  So - I highly recommend this book.  Like playing piano or anything else the more you practice the better you'll get 
 _Romantic Atheism_ points out the ways in which writers of the Romantic era flirted with and sometimes encouraged different kinds of lack of belief that tended (and still tend) to be lumped together under the term Atheism. Priestman is masterful in untangling all the shades of dissent from orthodox Christian belief in Romantic-period Britain, and shows how the even accusation of atheism entwined with politics. His mastery of the subject and the periodical literature of the era is complete. 
 Collaboratively compiled and written by Linden Phelps and Beryl Hiatt (co-owners of Tricoter, a popular Seattle yarn shop), Knitted Throws And More For The Simply Beautiful Home is an appealing, full-color book of practical instructions for crafting a variety of colorful, practical, and warm knitted throw coverings. The vivid photographs clearly portray finished works of handcrafted art. The various knitting project instructions are precise and enhanced with helpful tips, and are especially recommended for those who have had prior experience knitting and are already familiar with knitting terminology and basic stitches 
 I bought this massager for my husband who has back and leg pain.  He had a Panasonic massager for 21 years that finally gave up the ghost, so we knew the brand was excellent.  The programs included in the massager are especially helpful for neck and back which give him relief from the pain.  The only drawback is the sound it makes--reminds him of the sounds in an MRI.  Would definitely recommend it! 
 This work speaks for itshelf. Richard Rodriguez no question re-invented English prose in the twentieth century. The book must be read at least twice to understand its deep artistic accomplishment that may not be immediately visible to those who have not been socialized to modern literature 
 This is one of my all time top 10 cds, along with 'I am the Movie'. Motion City Soundtrack is one of the best bands out there, and i think everyone should at least give them a fair chance.  "Attractive Today"- 8/10- Great first song; fast, catchy, and quick. It is short and sweet, giving th listener a taste of MCS, but leaving them wanting more.  "Everything Is Alright"- 7/10- One of the hit singles. Very catchy, cool lyrics, good music. This isnt my favorite on the cd, but it is still very good.  "When You're Around"- 10/10- Still possibly my favorite, this song holds a special place in my heart, seeing as it was the first song by MCS i heard. Without this song, I might not have ever heard anymore MCS. This song is catchy and melodic, yet it still retains it's edge.  "Resolution"- 9/10- This song is a little bit slower, and sets a slightly tone than many MCS songs, but noetheless still great. Somewhat Death Cab For Cutie-esque.  "Feel Like Rain"- 8/10- This song is another good one. A semi-downer sound is still present, but it remains fun and catchy still.  "Make Out Kids"- 10/10- Fast, Catchy, and Fun, this song gets into your head and doesnt leave. The lyrics, like most MCS, arent that deep, but still sound amazing in the song. I saw this live, and have gained a whole new respect for it. One of my favs on the cd.  "Time Turned Fragile"- 9/10- For some reason, this song just reminds me of going through the halls in between class. And not in a bad way. I dont know why but this song makes me feel better about the repetitious daily cycle.   "L.G. Fuad"- 9/10- This song is great, it is slow and steady, with good lyrics, a nice changeup for the cd.  "Better Open the Door"- 10/10- Catchy, great chorus, equally good verse, overall just a great song.   "Together We'll Ring in the New Year"- 9/10- Great.  Softest, slowest song on the cd, but still one of my favs. This is such a good song, and Justin's vocals are the real treasure in this song. Great acoustic song.  "Hangman"- 9/10- This song picks up the pace a little bit after the former track. Catchy and well executed, this fits perfectly towards the end of the album. Despite one minor out of place spot, Justin's vocals are well done on this song.  "Hold Me Down"- 8/10- A well done closer, this song seems to totally encompass the style of this album as a whole. In my oppinion, this is a good choice for a closer; not the best song on the cd, and not the catchiest, but the one that seems to tie the record together, leaving listeners with the satisfied feeling that only a good record can leave.  And as a side note, MCS is the best live band I have ever seen in terms of performance. The singer actually sounds even better live, adding in more personal style and flare, and nothing is lost in the music. Plus, their energy level is incredibly high, without losing any of their talent in favor of showmanship, unlike so many other bands out their.   -peac 
         Voice performer Deanna Hurst delivers a controlled, finely nuanced reading of Rochelle Krich's fourth episode in the adventures and misadventures of writer Molly Blume.  As many know, Blume's Orthodox Jewish faith is very much a part of her life - Krich describes this beautifully and Hurst reads these passages with dignity and respect.  Further, it's a bit of a dual performance for Hurst as the story revolves around a missing girl, Hadassah, and Hurst imbues this character's lines with guilelessness and gullibility.  	Finding the missing Hadassah is not a job Blume sought, but she feels she owes a friend a favor.  Seems the girl may have run off with someone she met on an Internet chat room, but the plot becomes murky with murder when the man in question  is found dead.  Surely the ingenuous Hadassah couldn't have committed such a crime....or could she?	 	 	Takes an expert voice performer to inhabit the voices of two rather disparate characters convincingly, but Hurst carries it off.  	Listen and enjoy!          - Gail Cooke    
 This is ideal for wearing layers of clothing or if you're dressed in a short sleeve over this one.  However, I personally prefer the long sleeved version by the same company.  
 If you're a war-movie buff like me, you've seen just about all of them: Saving Private Ryan, Hart's War, Windtalkers, Men of Honor, A Few Good Men, We Were Soldiers, U-571--for time and interest' sake, I'll stop there, even though I could rattle titles off for pages and pages to come.   Enemy at the Gates has joined the ranks of these unforgettable war films, which set themselves apart from other films in the genre because men in spit-polished shoes at shoot-'em-ups is not all that is required. A compelling story has to be the very foundation of the film, there has to be at least a meager amount of activity going on outside of the battle, to serve as a distraction from the chaotic and war-torn events. Enemy at the Gates has the upper-hand to begin with, boasting a powerful concoction of your better actors--Jude Law (The Aviator), Ed Harris (A History of Violence), Joseph Fiennes (The Great Raid), Rachel Weisz (The Constant Gardener) and Bob Hoskins (Mrs. Henderson Presents). Its nail biting twists and turns will arrest your attention throughout this solidly-written script by Jean-Jacques Annaud (Seven Years in Tibet) and Alain Godard (Two Brothers), with more than a few unexpected surprises. To keep the ladies immersed until the end of the 131-minute movie, it even has a little romantic sub-plot, which potentially turns out to be the bewitching undoing of the lead character.  The battle takes place during World War II in Stalingrad, Russia, with sharpshooter Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) almost single-handedly bagging the bodies as promptly as they arrive, though things start to look grim for the Russian troops when the Germans move inward, and Commander Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) devise a "brilliant" plan to boost the hope of the civilians with propaganda-laden newspapers. Let the publicity began!  Day after day, the underground newspaper reports on the finest soldiers and their number of kills, with the poster-boy Vassili's mug shot on the front page. But it wasn't all work and no play for Vassili. He drudged on like any soldier at war, and even had a little time for a sweet romance with a neighboring soldier, Tania (Rachel Weisz)--though the citizens of the Iron Curtain weren't the only ones reading the tabloid. The German army had been following the heroic efforts of the Russians and had a hero of their own to trumpet, courtesy of Major Koenig (Ed Harris), a highly-focused soldier who obviously worked his way to the top by being the best at what he did as a marksman. He was sent in to counter the efforts of Russia's finest, whatever the cost, and pulled every trick out of his arsenal to ensure Vassili's defeat, which quickly turns into a game of cat-and-mouse.  The performances in this motion picture were stunning to watch. Jude Law's character starts to develop early on in the film and continues until the curtain comes down and the lights go up, it'll linger with you. And veteran Ed Harris as Major Koenig dazzles with mystique, and an almost expressionless face that speaks loudly (not to mention how charming he looks in a uniform). The location wasn't too shabby either; the scenic mood feeling raw with muted colors, taking you back half a century with the help of Cinematographer Robert Fraisse (Hotel Rwanda).   Enemy at the Gates is no enemy of mine. It'll shake you loose of the slop-stitch handiwork that you have become accustomed to, and raise the bar for craftsmanship in quality movie-making. -- Sabrina Harte 
 From All Sides: Vince Guaraldi (greatest jazz pianist ever), and Bola Sete, brazilian jazz and samba guitartist: Even better than I was expecting. Vince and Bola manage to avoid the harmonic overload that normally occurs when guitarists and pianists get together, simply by staying out of each other's way. Vince makes this album with his (dare I say it) perfect piano playing, and his compositions and covers are always innovative and interesting, from covers of Beethoven, to "Manino Pequeno da Bateria", the little drummer boy, of "Charlie Brown's Christmas Special" fame. So yeah, it's just another Vince Guaraldi level latin jazz album, which happens to also have a great guitarist along with his usual terrific rythm section. This is an absolutely amazing album for any fan of Vince, as well as for the lover of jazz 
 I recently took a course on the history of modern China in university, which covered the era spanning from the late Qing to 21st century. Initially I was rather daunted by the size and thickness of this book, but I ended up reading this book 3 times by the end of the course because it was so readable. Immanuel Hsu's analysis is clear and obviously up to par. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is taking a similar course. If you're keen to understand China particularly in the light of current affairs, you need to know about its recent history as well. There is no better place to start than with "The Rise of China" by Immanuel Hsu 
 I enjoyed it. I think you will too. The writting technique is perfect, the atmosphere is adequete, and the story is very enjoyable. A good King book. I have not seenthe movie yet, but I hear it is good so I will check it out 
 I am a Filipino-Canadian, and I'm grateful for this book because it gave me valuable insights into Filipino culture (and myself):   - hiya = shame. Much of what Filipinos do and don't do is motivated by the avoidance of hiya.   - amor proprio = face. Filipinos try very hard to avoid making other people lose face in the slightest.   - utang na loob = debt to another after receiving a gift. Receiving a gift is bittersweet for Filipinos because the giver has some control over you now 
 I saw the movie in a theater when it first came out. I was a teenager and, although I believed it to be primarily a girl's movie, I did enjoy it. I've seen it several times since then, and it still has not lost its charm. When I finally did read the book, I was disappointed that the movie didn't follow it more closely. To me, these are two different stories. The Holly in the movie is likeable; the novella's Holly is a harpie who cares for no one or nothing else. (When my wife saw the movie, she remarked that Holly was, "an idiot.") However, the book's storyline is more interesting...more haunting, and the book's ending is more intriguing. The movie ends as a love story. The book is much more. And, oh yes, whatever you may think of Capote as an individual, the guy was a damn good writer 
 Knowing next to nothing about the history of the Middle East, I was quite satisfied with Shlaim's explanation. War and Peace in the Middle East is short, to the point, and fairly unbiased (in regards to the Isreal/Palestine issue). I only wish that the edition was more updated 
 Several reviews below are informative, correct but a bit long. Here's a quick overview. The Hoover Dam saves lives & prevents flooding. Environmentalists (Eco-Freaks) would like it blown up. There is no evidence DDT kills or even harms hardly anything. It can and has saved millions of lives. Eco-Freaks support it's ban. Asbestos is a fire prevention wonder and it's few negatives can easily be controlled. Eco-Freaks are against asbestos use. Trees put way more hydrocarbons in the atmosphere than cars. Eco-Freaks love trees and hate cars. The Netherlands has a wonder life-saving system of water & flood control. Eco-Freaks pursue lawsuits rather than allow a system like that to save lives in New Orleans. The book points out many other examples. Environmentalists are amazing in their consistent ability to be wrong on everything.  Being stubbornly wrong in the face of mountains of contrary evidence propels them to honorary status with the liberal left.  The brainlock that will not budge in the face of logic is the hallmark of the liberal left. The author presents the scientific backup that Eco-Freaks have chosen to ignore for decades. Here's hoping a few finally see the logic 
 This is the first travel book I've read that didn't put me into a coma.  Each page I laughed.  Each page I learned.  This book supplied the answers to the questions unasked.  Woodies, Wallys, (...) checks for toilet paper, floating members (hell, I've had one all my life and didn't realize it floats), etiquette, all inclusive tipping and much more.  I realize how little I knew when I first vacationed "all inclusive".  This book isn't just for those interested in Hedo Resorts, Jamaica, or any all inclusive vacation; This book can stand alone for "a good read".  I must return to Jamaica to put my new found knowledge to work.... They need me 
 Bejan's AET book offers a unique, clear and straightforward exposure to classical thermodynamics. The book neatly dissects the most fundamental concepts of thermodynamics, while covering total flow exergy, restricted dead state and unconstrained equilibrium state, heat transfer, fluid flow and chemical irreversibilities, thermodynamic optimization, irreversibility distribution ratio, lost exergy, EGM, etc, from a fundamental and applied stand point (e.g., power generation, solar power, low temperature refrigeration). Chapter 13 also brings the latest developments in Constructal Theory. I strongly recommend this book to grad and undergrad students interested in advanced, yet accessible, thermodynamics 
 This is a great collection of Bela Lugosi movies for any fan.  Of course, he is THE Dracula and all the others mere imposters,  but this collection shows his depth of character when portraying sinister characters in many movies.  Karloff's performance in The Raven is also superb! 
 Graphic novels are a growing part of bookstores and even college courses, but until now no history of their origins and growth has been presented. Stephen Weiner, a comics historian and specialist in children's literature, provides this first history, detailing the appearance of classics in the field, including sample black and white illustrations from these classics, and filling in many gaps in the genre's history. Any fan of the graphic novel format will find The Rise Of The Graphic Novel  revealing 
 A remarkable book which left a deep impression on me.  At once literary in style and harrowing in its descriptions of life as cannon fodder, albeit thinking, passionate, feeling cannon fodder.    Willy Peter Reese was no hero.  I am not even sure he was brave.  However, as a good German boy he did his duty to the fatherland.  First he trained to put on the "mask" of the soldier.  Then he went of to war in Russia, mask in place.    He passed through a land where atrocities were the reality. He pillaged food from the starving.  During the German Army's massive, fighting retreat Reese's unit was always among the last to get the order to fall back.  His young eyes took in the full terror of the Nazi's scorched earth terror tactics. And he was part of it.   Along with his comrades, he routinely drank himself into some other world.  When there was no other way to move it, he and his fellow soldiers relentlessly dragged the unit's artillery piece. Day after day.  Month after month.  Year after year.   All the while, his young mind processed what he witnessed.  Temperatures so cold he could only cry.  A body infested with parasites.  Legs and feet with open oozing wounds.  Taking shelter in hand dug hovels.  Corpses hanging from trees, lying in ditches, everywhere.  In between the bouts of horror and killing, however, were sights of beauty and moments of mental and spiritual clarity.  His writing only stopped when his life ended.   Yes, Reese was trying to write like a writer.  His loves were Rilke and others of that ilk.  His book though, must be taken as a whole.  To dissect it, to say this part is too wordy or that part is too introspective, is to miss the point.  No, Willy Peter Reese was not a hero.  He did his duty as he saw it.  He tried to stay alive.  He was not brave.  Surely, then, he was the typical German male of the day who was thrust into a situation over which he had no control.  He did not rage against his lot nor did he relish it.  He simply existed through it as best he could 
 We have been listening to this album for over a year and it never gets old. My kids are 1 and 3 and they love it, and so do I!!  The cookie monster at the disco is a great dance song!  I highly recommend it 
 Golf junkies will love this quest for Q-school and the hilarity the author finds in day-to-day situations.  You'll find a new respect for professional golfers 
 Ideal for anyone who harbours a casual interest in forks, pins, paper clips and zippers. Not recommended for people who hate forks, pins, paper clips and zippers, or people who are obsessed with forks, pins, paper clips and zippers and already know how they came to be as they are 
 This is well done film on so many levels. And works in many different styles of films. It's chilling and dramatic. It's wickedly funny and in the broadest sence a love story. Beast finds his beauty, but what if the beast's sins are too much to overlook for beauty. The movie plays out like an opera which is fitting for the character of Hannibal Lecter also. Each act of the film served with perfect timing like a chef serves his meals. Yes, pun intended. But it's just a beautiful movie. Beautiful to look at, and beautiful to let it soak in to your mind and simmer. Well, there I go again, but it's a must own for fans of the books and character. Or just fans of Hoppkins who really sinks his teeth into the role 
 An extremely readable and entertaining book for all those who want the inside scoop and understanding of the Tour de France.  Bob Roll is both articulate and amusing.  It has enough general information that it is worth keeping, even after the tour is finished, although some of the information is specific to this year's tour and Lance Armstrong.  I have followed the tour for more than 40 years, and consider myself knowledgable, but still learned some interesting detail 
 The Film itself is one of the weirdest I have ever seen, a very interesting idea but you are never quite sure what is going on until about an hour into it. But weird in all in all good ways of this word.   I was really expecting smth more worse from this movie, but was very surprised and amazed with this movie.   Nowadays we have real video editors, but what if then can edit video from every second of your life? The most sacramental and intiem moments of your life? What it they will edit smth, that is so preieus for you? That you would like to keep for yourself? How would you react?  Are you ready for own death, so everybody could see the "final cut" of your life?  
 Ralph Masiello is a fascinating illustrator because his pictures are creative.  Did you know that there is a big secret in the Icky Bug Counting Book?  That is why Ralph is a fascinating illustrator 
 This book was surprisingly easy to read and understand. Very interesting material for anyone curious about the factors that influence the economy and what measures to watch to understand where we are heading. Concentrates on the major indicators and tells you where the data comes from. Illustrated with lots of charts and tables to help you understand the relationships over time. Organized so that the information builds up to the more complex relationships. Though written by an economist, this book is surprisingly easy to read and the material was interesting (even for someone that slept through econ 101, like me). The most useful economics book I have run across.  Highly recommended 
 Realy the core of alpinism. No bla,bla bussiness. Expirienced in person and transfered into the readers bloodstreem 
 We discovered Iz while in Hawaii this past January. We have purchased all 6 of his CD's and all three of his DVD's. He has a beautiful voice, sense of humor, and love of his heritage and Hawaii. I just wish he was still with us to share himself. He is singing to God now and what a beautiful sound that must be. Thanks Iz for giving us your love and appreciation of Hawaii and what it means to the Hawaiian people.  Jack & Bobbie Adams Conover, N 
 Having grown up during the civil rights era, I find this book has great teaching potential for the non-violent movement.  Today so many children see the violence on TV and in real life and this book depicts the historical highlights of the era.  James Ransome's illustrations are a complement to the clever rhymed verse and his collage technique on the front and back covers and the inside covers tells the story in pictures.  I think the sequence of the book portrays the main events of the era that ultimately changed the way of our nation. This is a book for everyone.  The rhymes convey the message in a concise manner which the youngest reader can understand.  I think this book should be in every school library 
 Very well written, and easy for a child to read and understand. Also quite inspirational 
 Product came promptly, in nicely wrapped packaged box, but manual and installation CD's were missing. Fortunately all necessary drivers were available from manufacture web-site. Installation went smoothly. Configuration was easy, overall setup in less than 5 min, including driver download. Definitely out performs all other wireless cards in my possession: Intel, Linksys and Belkin. Almost twice their range and speed 
 I really liked this album, I never knew that Tom Morello could sing.  I wish you could hear Maynard on the U2 cover or the duet he did with Cornell but they are still good covers.  This is worth buying as long as you do not expect a meavy metal album.  The theme is peace and that is hard to expresse when playing heavy metal 
 This is one of those occassions when the sequel was better than the first. There are way more effects, and the critters this time around have seemed to take on more of a "gremlin like playful quality" to them. The giant critter ball, the jumping in the bunny suit, and the whole scene of them at the Hungery Heafer is just classic. Too bad this would not carry over to the next two installments 
 Handy, Handy, Handy, you have to get this guide.  Full color, great images, good info.  Get it with the book Blackberry made Simple for full keyboards  You will not regret it  
 One of the values of this book is that it looks back on the 1960s without glossing over the problems, some of the misdirected idealism, etc.  It does serve as a testament to social action as a high calling, and in that regard, attempts to encourage activism in today's culture.  I thoroughly enjoyed it because I was a teenager in the 1960s, but I also recently sent the book to my 28-year-old son because it presents thoughtful arguments without getting into trite analysis.  I totally disagreed with the review by Publishers Weekly.  It's well worth reading 
 This book resonates. By painting intimate portraits of several insiders we are allowed an unprecedented proximity to this closed world. The author is careful never to judge his subjects thus confirming his own credibility. It  is one of the most noteable books I have ever read and it has left it's  indelible mark on me even 2 years after reading it. Bravo 
 The Starving Crocodiles  Almodovar's latest movie is undoubtedly his best, and a very inventive film-noir that absorbs and electrifies you from the very beginning. Alberto Iglesias' score serves "as a cradle where the movie rests" as the auteur himself said.  La Mala Educacion (Bad Education) is one of -if not- the best soundtrack composed this year, and its style is absolutely magnificent. Following the film-noir trend, Iglesias' score is a mixture of tunes a la Herrman ("Juan y el Sr. Berenguer", "Por mi grandisima culpa", "Escena Familiar"), poignant waltzes ("Foulard en seda", "La Carta", "Valsetto"), and vocalized cues that reflect the theme of the movie, and illustrate it fittingly ("Kyrie", "La piscina", "El cine como espejo"). "Cine Olympo", an exquisite theme for the movie-within-the-movie manifests itself disguisedly many times, in variations, as Iglesias' has done in previous scores where a parallel story is narrated - The Flower of my Secret, Live Flesh, Talk to Her, and All About my Mother- however the best track in the score is the "Overture". Other superb tracks are "Carta del mas alla", "Plato", and "Adagietto"... melodies that crave lust, but "Puerta Final" -the MAIN theme- is absolutely grand;  probably the best potpourri of songs written in the last decade, that will grab you by the horns from the moment it opens to the last saxophone refrain, in an orgasm of eight minutes that you will want to experience over and over again.   The soundtrack also consists of key songs that in one way or another relate to the main characters and the story: "Maniqui Parisien", "Cuore Matto", "Moon River" (a very avant-garde arrangement), and "Jardinero".   Alberto Iglesias has composed a score so dark, rich, hunting, powerful, and mysterious... that proves to be irresistible.   Experience the Bad Education!!! 
 I fell in love with The Wedding Date! When I heard it was based on a book, I went out and bought it right away!   I loved this book just as much as the movie!  It wasn't anything like the movie except for the hiring-an-escort-to-take-to-your-sister's-wedding part. Their were other great characters and a lot of funny moments.  When you are a busy mom like me with a stressful job, its nice to escape into a light-hearted story like this one 
 I caught "Time for Me to Come Down" just as I got into the parking lot at work.  Fortunately, I was little late already and had nothing to lose.  I had to wait one more song to hear the DJ tell me it was Amy Rigby's.  I laughed at the lyrics, and this song rocks very well.  It amazes me that songs this good can be so hard to find.  The rest of the album has it's charms but please, wizards out there, tell me why "Time for Me to Come Down" came and went with barely a ripple 
 As an nanny, I continuously hear all types of moms discuss the issues they face raising their children today.  These issues have been depicted in The Balanced Mom, but more importantly the author offers useful and realistic ways to address those issues and work toward a healthy balance between yourself/mom/partner.  Moms in Atlanta are already buying this book and raving.  I have even benefited from this book (no children yet) and am working on  a greater "balance" in my personal life. I will definitely read it again when I have children.  You will not be disappointed. 
 This is The Who's rock opera about a boy who accidently witnesses his stepfather killing his regular father. His mother (played by the spectacular Ann-Margret, who was nominated for an acadamy award for her performance in Tommy) and step-father plead with him, "you didnt see anything, you didnt hear anything, dont say anything". Young Tommy takes it to the extremes and loses his ability to see, speak and hear. He suffers abuse from family members as his mother desparately tries to heal him by taking him from everything to a crazy dismembering doctor to a marylin monroe shrine. Tommy eventually takes refuge in pinball and becoms a religious icon. Then everybody dies except for him. It's very confusing and very weird, but Ann-Margret did a great job 
 Anselm was a very important author for Medieval Christianity.  He contributed the Ontological argument for the existence (or should I say subsitence) of God, as well as formulating verbally the substitutionary  atonement of Christ. This book provides these as well as a host of other  rich classical Christian thoughts.  It is difficult reading, but excellent  in that it makes one think, believer or non-believer, in the metaphysical  realities of life.  I would have to say a must for anyone interested in the  development of Christian thinking, as well as Philosophical development 
 The Internet contains more than 40 million blogs (some estimates say 60 million) with more than 200 million readers. With numbers like that, businesses must learn how this powerful new form of word-of-mouth works, because bloggers talk about many companies - perhaps even yours. Author Jeremy Wright takes a quick look at blogging basics and then delves deeply into the impact that blogs have on businesses. He explains how blogging can boost your brand, your customer relationships or your internal communications. If you want to learn how to tap into this richly flowing information stream, we recommend Wright's easy-to-read explanation. Although he provides valuable start-up information for novices, even experienced bloggers and people who are familiar with the blog world will find ideas to help build their strategies. 
 I first had to read this book for my Latin language class in college. Well, I was looking for something to read recently and remembered this book. I always love a good mystery. This book definitely fits the bill. In addition to just plain good writing (hers not mine!), the book is intelligent and historical. I had forgotten all of the history crammed into the book. It is rare that a writer can turn out a thoroughly enjoyable read combined fiction, history, and intelligence. Bravo! I am now searching for her other books to enjoy 
 This book takes you step by step down the path to higher awareness and focusses on the methods and theory behind the craft. Classes and lessons are straightforward and easy to follow throughout the entire volume. I totally enjoyed every page 
 this is a must read, study and apply text for the independent investor...most excellent book. sw 
 The authors have written a series of Eat Smart books that no traveler to foreign countries should be without. Each book covers a separate country--Eat Smart in Turkey, Eat Smart in Brazil, Eat Smart in Indonesia  and Eat Smart in Mexico--and is chock full of information that you won't  find elsewhere within the covers of one easy-to-carry paperback. Individual  chapters cover such topics as the history of the country's cuisine,  regional foods, how to shop in the local markets, mail-order sources for  suppliers of ingredients, and a collection of recipes for typical dishes  found in that country. Especially useful is each book's extensive menu  guide, listing menu terms alphabetically in the language of the foreign  country, with a description of the dish in English. That section is  followed by a chapter titled "Foods & Flavors"--listing the  foreign terms for foods, spices, kitchen utensils and cooking techniques,  with an English translation/description. These books are well researched,  accurate and very informative. Highly recommended. --Sharon Hudgins,  editor, Chile Pepper magazin 
 I loved this book.  The cautionary instructions of how to handle celebrities are hilarious (never mention yourself or say what a huge fan you are). Her notes of interviewing famous people are so entertaining, it made me want to go find old issues of Rolling Stone read more about them.  My favorites were the stories of meeting Dolly Parton, Stevie Nicks and Barry White, buy the book for those if nothing else.  But there's so much more in this book than that.  The observations about growing up in the late 70's and '80s ring very true (the JC Penney catalog!).  I also loved her take on living and working in New York, which she clearly loves.  So many authors devote a lot of real estate to Bridget Jones sytle whining about how New York is expensive, dirty, noisy, competitive, etc.  Well it is all of the above, but she appreciates and articulately describes the energy and the people and opportunities. On top of all of that, it is a funny and touching story about family, friends and relationships.  I was not half way through it and couldn't wait to give it to my sister to read too 
 To say this is a book about a group of sisters who kill themselves is like saying Herman Melville's "Moby Dick" is about a whale. Yes, in a sense.  But Melville's book really concerns human obsession: the whale is just a maguffin.  You don't get to see a diary of  Moby's day ("rose from the deep, had a few thousand kelp, pondered the meaning of life", etc.) because it isn't about him.  It's about Captain Ahab, his desire for vengeance, and the dubious ability of human beings to chase unattainable things to a ruinous degree.  Similarly, The Virgin Suicides takes an extreme case, that of the suicides of five sisters from the same family.  But there is no description of what the girls thought when they decided to take their own lives, no smug psychology that gives a pat final answer: "so it was their religious parents", or "fluoride in the water that was to blame".  Instead it insinuates a corollary of detail from an unidentified and distanced observer to the drama.  This brings the monotony of small-town life into the narrative; the noseyness of neighbours; the attention of the media; the desires of adolescent boys... everything except the impetous(es) that led the girls to do what they did.  The suicides, like the various narratives in Kurosawa's "Rashomon", are a maguffin for what we could coldly call the real themes: the inevitability of conjecture over a single incident, the obfuscation of a single god-like point of view, or rather, and much more importantly, this point of view's refusal to even claim to have an easy explanation.    Like the whale in Moby Dick (or, say, the mysterious, murderous truck driver in Spielberg's debut film "Duel") the white whale of The Virgin Suicides remains a mystery.  Perhaps this is because the book is not really about the suicides at all.  Perhaps Melville chose the whale precisely because if cannot speak.  It has no voice so as not to give explanations: that is the glory of nature.  The girls have no voice because they need none: it is not about them.  It is merely that in the most extreme cases one finds the most mundane aspects of human experience: the domesticated desires of humans to watch, touch and participate within a community. Eugenides triumph is that he gives us the motivations of people without offering us the sideshow of what they so eagerly desired to see.  The Virgin Suicides are in other words the empty spectacle of a society which claims to understand causes but only feeds into its own chain of obsessions.                
 While other swing bands may have had a lot more hits Count Basie's band had IMHO had the best players. I consider myself very fortunate in having seen Basie & his band several years berfore he died. It was a night I'll never forget they were certified group of solid swing cats, they weren't just tight, but born at the hip. This is probably the best 1 disc CD of Basie's music out there & THE best disc in the Ken Burns series. Enjoy 
 There is little doubt left that the word in which we live is undergoing vast changes. The question is how we are to understand and respond to these changes. In The Church on the Other Side, Brian McLaren suggests that a new world requires a new church. McLaren provides thirteen strategies to guide church leaders through the transition from a modern to a postmodern world.  Especially helpful are chapters 12a, 12b, and 12c where McLaren equips readers to enter the postmodern world through understanding and engaging the postmodern world while leaving behind the problems of modernity.  This book is vital for any leader struggling to lead their church through changes in these times. Whether you agree or disagree with McLaren, his voice is one we must listen to. 
 This is a great cable for your HD TV while playing you Sony Playstation 2. It give very crisp and clear images, much better than the cable that comes with the playstation. 
 KEEP ME UP READING IN ONE NIGHT & I HATE WHEN I DO THAT BECAUSE THEN IT IS OVER.  NEGGERS HAS A WAY OF KEEPING YOU ENTRALLED TO THE END... MY  FAVORITE BOOK IS STILL "FINDING YOU" BUT THIS IS A CLOSE SECOND! 
 I've never before read a book that contains such a wide variety of experiences, writing styles and outlooks.  This anthology does not shy from confronting the horrors of abusive families, as is evident from the first line in the book: "healing is my own anticolonial war."  But it's also incredibly inspiring for the ways that all of these children have survived to tell such wrenching stories in complex, jarring ways.  As a parent, it was difficult to get through many of the essays, but always I found an incredible burst of hope when I least expected it.  As a survivor of childhood abuse, I also could see my story being told in so many different ways.  Unlike most books that address childhood abuse, every story in this anthology is stylistically challenging, innovative, and carefully crafted.  I highly recommend it.  
 Jim Davis, the author and illustrator of the Garfield comic strip, has a very wry and ironic sense of humor.  Garfield the cat keeps his aloof perspective on the world of his human servant, Jon, and his silly, not-too-intelligent companion Odie.  We are the beneficiaries of Garfield's point of view to the point of frequent laughter.  This book is a collection of strips drawn in 1992.  Here is a selection of the vignettes for your consideration.  In the opening of a strip Jon runs yelling "Giant rat!"  Garfield watches nonchalantly as Jon runs off strip.  Garfield then wonders whether he mentioned that he shaved Odie.  In another strip Garfield intrigues us with his Birdbath of Death.  In yet another strip Garfield discovers that a stack of cookies he just ate may have included a coaster.  Books about Garfield are consistently humorous, often to the point of needing to laugh out loud.  Be sure you read this book alone.  If not, everyone will think you are crazy for laughing so much.  Enjoy! 
 Shirley Corriher's book Cookwise: The Secrets of Cooking Revealed is truly a cookbook (instead of a recipe book) and is one of very few classiccook books which will never go out of style.  Corriher's writing is very readable - unlike recipe books which simply list the ingredients and pretty picture - and is compelling reading because she explains how and why even the simplest recipe can go wrong, and how to make sure that it goes correctly the next time.  The author does this by reducing core ingedients to their chemical make up in plain English, and the explaining how ingredient react with each other and under certain circumstances.  Had Corriher been your chemistry teacher in high school, there would be a most chemists in the world today.  Corriher does provide recipes - but these are presented not only as expiriments, but as step by step examples of how her chemistry lessons do come to life.  I was an OK baker before I read this book - but since reading it, and using it as a reference source before each project, I have become an incredible baker.  How so?  For example, Corrihers explaination of how gluten is formed has made me a master of scratch cake textures - the proper texture for the correct type of cake makes all the difference in the world.   If you want a recipe book full of studio photogrpahed foods, or one that will help you become the type of cook that can make those same delights without fuss and on a consistent basis, this is most definatly the book for you 
 I was pleasantly surprised that this book was so much different and more insightful than the other books I have read that deal with the subject matter of "integrity." Here, the focus of meaning of integrity is not so much on morals and ethics, although that is covered here, but it instead focuses on deeper aspects of character.  The basic assumption here is that "integration" or "wholeness" of character is a necessary component in order to reach one's maximum potential both personally and professionally, and that character is not fixed or unchangeable.  This book is extremely inspirational and informative. It is a roadmap to success and happiness.  Highly recommended!     
 Madeline Hunter writes excellent medievals, and this book is no exception.  While not as emotionally wrenching as "By Possession" or unique in character as "By Arrangement", "The Protector" is a well-told tale with a wonderfully strong hero and heroine and rich historical detail.  "The Protector" is the story of Morvan Fitzwaryn, brother of the heroine of "By Arrangement" and a knight who has sworn to regain his family's lost lands--lands that he had been forced to surrender as a young boy.  He encounters the lovely and unconventional Lady Anna de Leon when she rescues him from a group of fearful Breton villagers about to torch the cottage where he is sheltering with his plague-infected squire.  Anna has been left as the political and military leader of her Breton castle following the deaths of her father and brother and the devastation of her own people by the plague.  When Morvan himself is infected with the plague, Anna (who has survived the plague previously) nurses him and supports him emotionally and a special bond is forged between the two.  In gratitude, Morvan vows to protect Anna and lends his sword when Anna's enemies attempt to take over her castle.  Morvan is fascinated by Anna's strength and beauty, but Anna has vowed never to marry as she does not want to be in any man's power.    Anna is a wonderfully unusual heroine, marvelously strong and capable of holding her own with the men on the battlefield, she is insecure about her own attractiveness and cannot believe that the gorgeous Morvan would want her for herself and not for her lands and wealth.  I found Morvan to be a hero worthy of Anna--strong enough to control her wilder impulses but gentle with her as well.  There is an onslaught of negative reviews on this site about Morvan (strangely, most dating from January 6th and 7th, 2005), criticizing him for being too domineering and crushing Anna's spirit, but I saw that part of the book as two *very* strong people learning to accept each other and redistribute the balance of power.  Anna really had the majority of the power at the beginning of the book, and I would not have been happy to see her marry someone that she could ride roughshod over.   Morvan's rules and restrictions were primarily to protect her from her enemies and to maintain harmony in the castle.  The power clashes were inevitable and very realistic considering the very strong willed heroine and alpha male hero and the  compromises that both ultimately make for their love are touching.  In summary, this is a very well-written medieval with an unusually strong heroine and hero.  The historical details about the plague are interesting and well done. Highly recommended.     
 Dogman is King's X's most raw album ever. Its my favorite out of their recordings. I love the Hendrix cover Manic Depression they do. Another song I love is Complain, its fast, furious, and rocks hard. This is King's X best album in my opinion.. 
 not my favorite but still interesting.  Lots of description that can get your head pounding after a while though; it's def. not a 2-3 day read 
 This cookbook is the best one I've seen!  It's comprehensive selection of food covers all styles of French food and offers a wide variety of tastes that suit even the most selective of appetites!  Easy to follow recipies  combined with the outstanding photographs make this a truly enjoyable book  to own and use 
 The argument can be made that, along with the Ramones release in 1976, this album signaled the birth of Punk Rock.  Everything about this CD is abusive, including a violent mix that allows Iggy's voice to screech and pop; threatening to leap out of the speaker right into to your living room.  The Ashteon brothers, Ron and Scott who play bass and drums, are in full force here.  On each song they play in tight lock step with one another.  The guitars are brutal and distorted, just like the rest of the mix.  Anyone who appreciates metal, punk, or hardcore should give this a whirl and hear the roots of the music you love 
 This review was very difficult for me to write as I have mixed feelings toward the video. As a first grade teacher, I am very critical of anything that requires the very particular and accurate use of phonemic awareness. Unfortunately, as the mom in the last review pointed out, this video has many inconsistencies when the narrator and little girl say their letter sounds. First of all, when saying letter sounds, one NEVER wants to add the sound -uh after any letter!! For example, when saying the sound for "T" we don't say "TUH", we simply whisper it by dropping our tougue from the roof to the bottom of our mouth. Or, we say "W" not by saying "WUH" but by forming the W with our lips, then holding the W sound like wwwwww. Though most of the sounds in this video are correct, they occasionally slip into the "-uh" trap! How on earth are our children supposed to read if they add -uh to every consonant....tell me....for instance, what the heck is puh-a-tuh! (translation without the -uh and you get the word "pat"!) Now, looking beyond the inconsistencies in pronounciation, I have to say that my 2 year old son LOVES the video!!! I am completely in awe and amazed that within one time of watching it, he repeats EVERY letter as it drops onto the screen. Though I find it terribly repetitive and boring, he is COMPLETELY engrossed!! And you know, HE IS the one who is supposed to love the video (not me!) so I suppose Brainy Baby has hit the mark on that aspect! He sits through the seven minute introduction and is totally aware as each written letter comes on. He enjoys the kids and babies on the screen and it doesn't seem to bother him that there is no real "action" or fun puppets like they have in the Baby Einstein videos. So, as a mother, I am overjoyed that he is enjoying the video, learning his letters AND gaining a nice vocabulary. He is slightly speech delayed, so anything that will help to improve his language awareness is a blessing.  So how do I rate this?? As a teacher, probably no more than a 3. As a mother, I'd have to give this a 5 since my own child is rapidly developing his language awareness just by watching a simple DVD! I haven't watched any other letters video, so if anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them! 
 Imagine for a moment that you're a regular bloke and you want to do something to help the New York City homeless. You've got very little money, no resources, but a big heart. What could you possibly do to make a dent in their population?   If you're Marc Singer, the man behind this Sundance Award winning documentary, you found a way to do quite a lot.  For a person who'd never touched a movie camera before starting in on this "project", one can see why this film impacts its viewers on multiple levels. Shot in grainy black-and-white 16mm film, this documentary gives us a startlingly real-life look at several homeless people living in self-built shanties in the Amtrak tunnels under the city. No light makes it down there, except whenever a train skirts by or via the makeshift lighting this weird community has produced by tapping into Amtrak's electrical system.   Marc Singer delves into this society. And I mean he DELVES. Mr. Singer gave up living on the surface and slunk into this netherworld for two years in order to shoot his film. And who did he use as grips, sound assistants, and lighting experts? The homeless themselves.   More interesting than the film itself is how it got made. After watching the documentary, I went ahead and looked over the special features on the DVD and found a "Making Of" track which focused on Mr. Singer and how he accomplished his film making. This showed the incredible lack of understanding of anything related to filming and those who helped him out, both in teaching him and by giving him financial help so that the documentary made it out to the public. We also get to see the amazing multiple awards that the documentary won at Sundance; an incredible set of scenes that contrasts starkly with what Mr. Singer had gone through in order to make this film a reality.   Never giving up on his newfound tunnel companions, never letting financial devastation overtake him, never giving up creative control, all added to the success of the film and my enjoyment of all aspects of it. Bravo, Mr. Singer.  (You might be asking what happens to the tunnel-bound homeless. It's a perfect ending to the film, so you'll have to watch it. I ain't giving it away!)  
 I literally counted down the months in between Dark Victory and Preserver because I wanted to read this book so bad.  It seemed like an eternity until it came out, but when it finally did back in the summer of 2000 I wasn't let down one bit.    I just reread the mirror universe saga and enjoyed it even more the second time around. Now, a little older and have a greater appreciate for excellent science fiction I felt the mirror universe saga is one of the greatest stories told.  It rivals all Star Trek novels past and present.  The showdown between Tiberious and Captain Kirk is excellent and gribbing until the end.  The fate of Kirk's wife Telani is in this novel as well.    I loved it and still love it.  Truly a great ending and beginning to the future adventures of Captain James T. Kirk.  A definite must read!!!!  10/10 
 The good: I have made about 15 recipes from this book so far.  All ranged from "good" to "excellent", a very respectable turnout.  Not a single one was unpleasantly tough, dry, or otherwise failed.  They compare VERY favorably with other lowfat cookies I have tried.  I will definitely be making some again, and trying others. My personal favorites were apricot almond streusel squares, `gourmet' variation of the chocolate chip cookies, pecan pie squares, crunchy peanut cookies, and cornmeal maple pecan twists.  In general, the recipes in this book are reliable, tasty and have significantly reduced fat (especially saturated fat) as compared with comparable `regular' cookies.  E.g., in a typical ~ 2 cup flour recipe, there is usually ~4 T butter here as opposed to 1-2 sticks, and egg yolks are usually reduced or eliminated. The changes do reduce overall dough volume and yield a smaller batch size, which in my opinion is all to the good.  (If you're buying a reduced-fat cookie cookbook, chances are you don't want 5 dozen extra cookies lying around every time you head to the kitchen to try a new recipe).   Other pluses: these recipes use familiar, inexpensive and natural ingredients that you already have on hand or can easily find: no weird or artificial diet substitutes.  Unlike most low-fat recipes, these cookies are portioned normally and even generously; there is no artificial lowering of the fat content by instructing you to fashion micro-cookies of which you would have to eat 10 to equal one normal cookie.  In fact, in several recipes I ended up with more cookies than the listed yield, which almost never happens to me.    This book also seems like a labor of love-- the recipes are unusually well-tested and fine tuned. The instructions are clear, careful and include useful details, like tips on how to reduce the number of dishes you dirty in the preparation.  The book belies its small size with lots of helpful or interesting marginal notes and voluminous recipe variations, many of which yield genuinely different recipes (not just something obvious like substitute one variety of raisin for another). You'll find a wonderful diversity of cookie flavors, textures and styles and familar standbys as well as unique recipes of the author's own creation.   The bad:  First, I found a few baking times to be off, in particular, too long (my only general `recipe testing' complaint). The author is good about providing other done-ness cues, but I'd recommend you start checking cookies much earlier than indicated.  Second, although these recipes are very good, there were some clear `consequences' of reducing the fat.  Several cookies had telltale textural issues such as being soft and cakey instead of tender-chewy, or being hard-crunchy instead of tender-crunchy.  Also, almost all became stale frustratingly quickly, in several cases, within a few hours.  Some took well to refreshing, freezing, storing unbaked dough to bake off as needed, etc., but I had to figure this out on my own.  Given the pervasiveness of the premature staling problem, I would really have appreciated more attention to storage advice and/or strategies - no one wants to end up throwing out most of one's labors away.    Finally, the philosophy of this book is very much of a mid-nineties `reduce fat and who cares about anything else' style, and that philosophy, as most people would now acknowledge, suffered from some major nutritional flaws.  Again, the recipes do succeed, and admirably, on satisfying the criteria they set out to satisfy (they are lower fat, and they taste good-- no mean feat).  However, if you flip through the nutritional information handily accompanying each recipe, you may notice that many of these cookies are very high in refined carbohydrates and calories. Many of the bars, especially, hover around the mark of 200 calories EACH (and some even more)-- that's a lot. And of course you're not going to eat just one.  Morever, many recipe variations are rather decadent (calling for additions of things like nuts, chocolate chips and caramel), with added fat but no added calorie information.  I find all this to be off-putting in a book that promises `healthy alternatives that can be eaten without guilt.'  In fact, a number of these recipes seem to have nearly the same total calories as the `standard' version whose fat has not been assiduously reduced. In such cases, you're not so much saving calories as you are exchanging them--by and large, fats for simple carbohydrates.  Arguably, this is a trade for the worse, as it increases the "empty calorie" count of your treat and decreases the satiety that fats provide. Then there are the losses that come along with the fat for simple-carb trade--e.g., lower-fat cookies go stale much faster and without the fat, they can taste too sweet.  In many cases the new cookies, while still very good, are obviously missing elements of the old standbys.  If you slash the amount of chocolate chips in a chocolate chip cookie or the amount of nuts in a Russian tea cake, you can tell that those elements are missing, however appealing the new versions may be on their own terms. This, in combination with a belief that the new cookies are `healthier' (and are going to be stale tomorrow) can lead us to eat an extra cookie or two and thus end up with more calories than if we'd just stuck with the family recipe from the 50's.     I'll now remove my party-pooper hat and reiterate that the author has succeeded in producing a book of wonderful-tasting, diverse and easy cookies with less fat.  The book is absolutely in the top tier of the low-fat dessert cookbook family.  If you are selective, you can also find many tasty choices that are not JUST reduced fat, but also sport an impressive nutritional profile for dessert.  And the book is generally a pleasure to cook and read from.   So, I give it 4 stars because it mostly delivers on what it promises.  Just don't expect the recipes be nutritional miracles. 
 my first cd i heard from this band was "they're only chasing safety" and that was a great cd...and i always thought this band was original. "define the great line" definitely proves that this band isn't just some screamo/hardcore band, they're talented musicians..and i thought so on their previous cd, but i was a little skeptical because i wasn't sure that they would step it up and evolve from "they're only chasing safety". but they did and WHAT A CD! they're harder and more structured and show more talent in their music. one of the best cd's i've heard this year. and if you like this one you'll love "they're only chasing safety". underoath proved that they are a real band and not some carbon copy..they DEFINED THE GREAT LINE. 
 The 70's was a decade that offered a variety of styes when it came to music. This collection shows that. There's the pop side with Vanity Fare, Spiral Staircase, and Billy Joe Royal. There's the heavier side with  Mountain. And there is the wimpy side with the Sandpipers. This first  volume sets the stage for the other volumes that follow 
 Great Book with Great Information. I always say if I get 1 useful bit of info. then the purchase was worth it. This book gave more than just 1 bit of useful info! 
 Overall this is a good cd that puts together a collection of songs that have appeared else where but this cd puts a new spin to them. The remix of Mynt's you're the only one, is awesome. Other personal stand outs are Chanels My Life and Work this P***Y. Get ready to dance. 
 I use it to back up my G4 powerbook via the included Firewire 800 cable. Mine had some vibration noise which I fixed by putting some extra felt padding underneath the base. There was an issue very early on which at first led me to believe it had failed, but it turned out the problem was with my computer's firewire ports (mac users: resetting the PMU fixed the problem). I don't know if the drive was responsible for scrambling my ports -- it was the first time I had connected an external drive to that computer.   One nice feature is that it turns on, off, and sleeps automatically just as it should. I never have to touch the power button.  The drive comes bundled with two poorly designed mac applications: Lacie Backup and Silverkeeper, which come with no usable documentation and totally unintuitive interfaces. Lacie Backup is worthless; don't install it. Silverkeeper, however, is quite good for backing up your Home directory (once you manage to figure out how it works). So other than the poor documentation and software, I'm happy with this drive. 
 This book is my bible! i love it to death. It shows you simple things you forget back into the light and can truly change the way you think about yourself. It makes you realise that you're not alone out there with either eating disorders, abusive relationships, heart aches, suicides, or any situations that are hard to held with emotionally and physically. I've never really got into the chicken books myself, but this book took only a second to love it! i recommand this book to everyone 
 This book is a linear commentary on the little things in life. Each page and comment has a picture of an animal that adds meaning to the comment -almost always in a make you smile or outright laugh kind of way.  It is a gentle and sensitive light hearted book that everyone will enjoy and gain something from. Of course it doesn't answer the big question, it just gives you food for thought about it.   The only minus about this book is that all the pictures are in black and white. Color would have been so much better.   
 Those who condemn this book for not being a long, boring list of name origins and meanings, or for stating that their name has gone out of style for today's children, are missing the point. "Baby Names Now" is a fun, readable guide to what people are naming their children in the early 2000s, including famous namesakes (saints, popes, presidents, royalty, music and movie stars) and what some celebrities have named their children. It's also fascinating to read how certain names have gone out of style: for example "Lisa," "Amy," "Susan" and "Dawn" were very popular for babies born in the 60s (and thus, my classmates), but are rarely used today.   The book's major flaw is in not recognizing that parents name their children using the last names of people they admire, not just the first names. At one point, it reads "Harrison Ford...is almost certainly the reason for the name Harrison's popularity" - excuse me, ever hear of the Beatles? The entries for the name "Jordan" don't mention Michael Jordan, certainly a major inspiration for that name in this area. The entry for "Jackson" doesn't mention Michael, Janet, or Samuel L.  The entry for "Landon" doesn't mention Michael. The entries for "Cassidy" don't mention David and Shaun, so popular in the 70s when many of today's moms were growing up. The entry for "Lucas" - do I have to say it, fellow Star Wars kids grown up and naming their children? And come on, how can you mention the name "Wayne" without acknowledging the popularity of John Wayne?  Still, this is a lot of fun, and I give the authors credit for recognizing that "Althea" is from a Grateful Dead song. I look forward to the next edition 
 "Our Iceberg is Melting" is a unique book that presents some of the key business tools for leadership and change in simple terms that anyone can understand.  This fast read gives you take home points to make the necessary changes in your company or even your personal life, in order to gain more success.  It's fun to relate the characters in the book to your own company and see how each personality is a vital part in running the business.  It's nice to go back to the basics and realize that in order to achieve the leader's goals, the leader should make it a priority to get everyone on the team involved and allow them to feel important.  My company just moved office locations, so the timing was great for me in relating to some of the issues involved with what the penguins experienced in this story.  It's refreshing to take a step back and see that it's not about where you are, but the people, values and support that you have around you that matter most.  
 A stunning return to form. As assembled by producer Bill Laswell, there's not really a PiL to speak of - it's basically Lydon and a group of session musicians - but who's complaining when these guests include Steve Vai, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Ginger Baker? With its emphasis on big guitars and big drums, "Album" was written off by the unenlightened as PiL going stadium rock, but Lydon's confrontational lyrics and caterwaul vocals, and the abundance of Eastern melodies, help steer this away from the realm of conventional 80s metal. "Anger is an energy" is the mantra of "Rise": one of PiL's finest moments ever, the song manages to be both a tribute to Lydon's Irish heritage and also a scathing indictment of Apartheid torture practices. Lydon's impassioned vocal presence has never sounded so graceful. Elsewhere, the album is rife with surprising and very effective musical flourishes: never is this more evident than on the closing "Ease," a beautiful, monumental mood/rock piece with synth, sitar and didgeridoo (and a killer Vai guitar solo). In a marked contrast to the sporadic quality of the two previous PiL studio albums, there's no filler here: EVERY track is a highlight. "FFF" is a rollicking opener in which Lydon lashes out at a former friend/colleague ("Farewell my fairweather friend/On you no one can depend"). Lydon continues the apocalyptic themes of "World Destruction" (his 1985 single collaboration with Afrika Baambattaa and Laswell) on "Round" ("Mushrooms on the horizon") and the mistanthropic, catchy numbers "Fishing" ("Talking to you is a waste of time/Go crawl back into your dustbin"), "Bags," and "Home" ("Better days will never be"). Easily PiL's most essential 80s moment (apologies to all those "Flowers Of Romance" fans), "Album" is second only to "Metal Box" as the best PiL album ever. It's an extraordinary, non-condescending and underrated highlight of a largely boring musical landscape (a.k.a. the 1980s). NOTE: in keeping with the generic packaging of this release, the LP was titled "Album," the CD "Compact Disc" and the cassette "Cassette. 
 Let's face it...color is natural...black and white isn't. There is no such thing as "Glorious Black & White" when it comes to film. As has been stated before, they used it in the early days because that was all they had, and later because color was too expensive, and was used mostly for the big "epics" like GONE WITH THE WIND, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, etc. I wish they would colorize all the old b&w classics, especially the westerns. After I got my first color tv in the mid 60's, I never wanted to watch anything in black & white again. I don't understand what the beef is. For those who don't like colorization, I'm sure the B&W versions will always be available. Some people just can't stand progress 
 Here's why my boys (ages 5 and 7) and I loved this book: (1) its imaginative illustrations really capture the child's perspective; (2) in a very gentle way, it touches on WWII and an interesting historical footnote -- what a great jumping off point for more family discussion (if your kids are ready) on WWII and how it affected everyday Americans; (3) its charm: we love how William thinks the Queen is cleverly disguised as a Grandma; (4) How cool is it that the book's based on a true story? And it's a good story! In an age of predictable, formulaic children's fare, it's books like this that restore my faith that there are people out there who care about presenting children with quality storylines, and who respect children's intelligence. 
 The articles delivered to me were send in time and good conditio 
 Good historic review. A lot of information about Dal 
 The antioxidant properties of Goji Berries are ones you can feel immediately upon consuming them.  They're a legit superfood, however, the price is outrageous.  If you're comparing them with a dried snack fruit like raisins, they're 8x the cost (for organic). If paying $6 for an afternoon snack is up your alley, then there probably isn't a much better snack for you than these Goji berries.  My only beef with goji berries are that they are BONE dry.  So dry, in fact, they could hurt your teeth, if you have sensitive teeth.  I actually know someone who chipped a tooth on goji berries.  Soaking them is ideal, and then using the juice in smoothies, not to waste the antioxidants that washed off into the  water.    
 The best vampire story since Anne Rice.   This book starts off as your average teen flick, normal girl, usual life, then BAAM! Out of nowhere Velde throws in a vampire, after first leading you on a false trail. It's brilliant. The characters, the setting, it's so completely and utterly realistic that it takes your breath away.   The dialogue is perfect, it's not overdone, it's exactly what one might say or do in such circumstances. As I said the realism in this is rare, especially for vampire novels. Velde takes the genre to a complete new level and leaves practically dying for more.   This is the best book she has ever written by far.   Well worth the read! Forget the other vampire flicks. Companions on the Night is for serious fans 
 If you don't like this album, perhaps you should be sitting in Baghdad taking pop-shots at our boys over there, because you are obviously NOT American.  This album is the best mid-1980's album in its genre 
 I've had this book for years, since the late 90's I have it in the hard copy! I have given it as a gift about 23 times. Its a wonderful book that applies to life in general!  A MUST READ for musicians as well as non-musicians!  -Steve Amara 
 Ayesha Jalal has delivered a highly impressive piece of work. The research is impeccable and the analysis rigorous. Contrary to most historical accounts of the creation of Pakistan, Ayesha does not engage in rhetoric or  political slogans. Instead, her efforts to remain unbiased clearly come  across and are admirable. She is a historian par excellence and her talent  for writing clearly and lucidly about complex subjects is clearly revealed  in this book. A provocative piece of work which might actually get students  of India/ Pakistan interested in a subject which they have always found  dull 
 Not knowing much about trading I bought the book. It equiped me with the basics like trading times all over the world, brief history of Foreign Exchange and so musch more. After studing the book, I was confident and ready to trade. There are many online clsses on FX trading, but the amazing thing about this book is how one can relate to it. No matter what your idea or statergy you follow, the answers are in this book.  As a more experinced trader I ensure that I have the book is on my desk, making referance to it daily. The authors reports and commments on the market posted on the net daily, together with refering constantly to the book, gives me a true feeling of the market.  I truly believe that every trader should use the book, not just own or have the book, but use it........ A must for all traders!!!!!  Yaseen Theba   
 Very good collection for those of you who haven't alreay bought the original CD's.  
 Matthew and Tilly are best friends, that is, until they get into a fight.  Discovering that without the other, they're bored, they make up.  The plot of the story helps young children who have difficulties understanding how to recover from a fight, and helps them to see that many children argue, not just themselves.  The white-framed impressionistic paintings that fill each page portray a drab inner-city neighborhood and cause the focus to remain on the two main characters.  Although the text flows below or within the images on most of the pages, while a fight separates Matthew and Tilly, the text sits on a stark, white page, hinting at the loneliness that each feels 
 Jack Nicolson has a great performance in this twisted and mysterious thriller that continues the film noir tradition 
 All the best was the very first Paul Mccartney CD I purchased. but of course I have almost all of Pauls solo record in Vinyl. Almost all of Pauls beautiful songs are all here. not included are SO BAD, ARROW THROUGH ME , MY BABYS REQUEST & SPIES LIKE US to name a few. (The original vinyl release was a double record)fyi. Anyway, i never get tire of listening to this cd. Paul to me is the greatest songwriter ever. I became a fan first of paul mccartney & wings before the beatles. I was 6 years old in 1973 when I first heard the song BAND ON THE RUN in the radio. So I particularly grew up listening to paul. He was part of my happy childhood. So listening to All the Best brings back happy memories....  PS. My three young kids, me wife are now Paul McCartney fans. Thanks to this great album of Sir Paul 
 Excellent for folks who want a good aeroic workout without leaving home...like while the kids nap for new moms.  It gets your heart rate up, easy to do, no special equipment required, and the best part is IT WORKS.  Who would have thunk it?  If you do the routine everyday (and there is an assortment, pick one, two or three miles) you'll ose weight, feel better, and look better.  This especially good for ladies who aren't quier ready for the gym...  I got my money's worth 
 In my opinion 4Tay is the hottest rapper outta the Yay.  This album is a must have if your a West Koast rap fan.  Album has a lot of hot trackz that go along with his slow yet bangin style of flow 
 "FUBAR: America's Right-Wing Nightmare" is a book in which the writers, Sam Seder and Stephen Sherrill, express their rage about the current state of affairs of America as relative to its current leadership as well as its tactics. According to these two gentlemen, the country's current state of affairs are messed up beyond recognition, rivaling even Watergate, the Great Depression, and Vietnam, in that it is revealed that the leaders seem to have plans to taking control of every aspect of the inhabitants' lives. I found this to be an entertaining, clever, well-researched and meaningful read. The only part that was not amusing was that some of it was true 
 not a whole lot of item's. More picture's than anything. A lot of the item's in the book I beleive are way to over priced. Not a good book to take to flea market's or auction's 
 Because I have very fine, straight hair it never would have occurred to me to use a straightener. Why straighten what is already straight? However, a friend with similar hair recommended it and I have to say the results are incredible - like I've just had it cut and styled at a salon. Plus it only takes a minute or two because I don't have that much hair. I've never tried any other brands, but this one was cheap and certainly does the trick. Highly recommended. 
 Framed is an action-packed story, populated with quirky characters and incidents, and it is simply hilarious. Although I tried to restrain myself, I still ended up with more than a dozen flagged passages, most of them flagged because they made me laugh.   Framed is set in the gray, quiet, Welsh town of Manod. As the story begins, Snowdonia is slowly sinking into obscurity, as more and more families move away. Our hero, Dylan, is the only boy left in town (except for his one year old brother, who is not much good at soccer). Dylan's family business, the Snowdonia Oasis Auto Marvel (a garage) is in precarious shape, despite the best efforts of the plucky family. Dylan's dad leaves town, too, to look for work elsewhere. The future looks grim.  Things change, however, when workers from the National Gallery in London establish a clandestine art storage facility at the top of a nearby mountain. To get in and out of the facility, the workers and guards have to drive by the Snowdonia Oasis, thus becoming a source of new business. Soon the intrepid family is supplying Titian Tarts and Picasso Pie to the art-loving men temporarily stationed in their neighborhood. And as they have the opportunity to see some of the artwork, they, and the town of Manod, are gradually transformed.   There are misunderstandings. There are daring capers, and stolen works of art. There are family and neighborhood traumas. But through it all runs the theme of the transformative power of art.   This is a very British book, with some Welsh phrasing and sensibilities. It carries, to me, a hint of Roald Dahl in the exaggeration, and more than a hint of Jasper Fforde in the absurdity. The characters are slightly larger than life. Dylan is a resourceful hero who is genuinely incapable of understanding why any of his neighbors would want to leave their town. He thinks that it's perfect. Lester, the head of the art storage facility, loves art, but wants to see it kept in boxes, and not shared with many other people. Lester is blind to the way that the pictures are changing the ordinary Welsh people, and their town. Dylan's family is an entrepreneurial team, with astonishing resourcefulness and determination.  I personally found the caper and theft portion of the book a bit rushed, and the conclusion anti-climactic. I never did understand what was going on with the dad, and why he left. But I liked the spirit of the family, and the way that the town, and the Snowdonia Oasis, were improved through the residents' efforts. And as I mentioned above, this book is laugh-out-loud funny. Here are a few examples:  "Mr. Arthur is the editor of the Manod Month, our local newspaper. It used to be called the Manod Week, but there isn't enough news in Manod to fill a newspaper every week. (pg. 53)"  "Of course this information is supposed to be top secret. Publishing it in the Manod Month shouldn't compromise that secrecy as no one reads it anyway. (pg. 85)"  ""Looks like it's Mars bars again," I said. "That is so unhealthy," said Marie. "You can kill yourselves if you like. I'm going to sort out a proper breakfast for myself." She had a Bounty, because they've got real coconut in them, which is very good for you. (pg. 158)"  And so on. Throwaway line after throwaway line, most of them quite funny. I think that kids will like this book a lot, boys and girls. They'll laugh, they'll gasp, and most important of all, they'll keep reading until the end.   This book review was originally published on my blog, Jen Robinson's Book Page, on February 16, 2007 
 Spurgeon's Morning and Evening devotional offers two devotions/day, hence its name.  Realizing that Sprugeon is a 19th century English preacher, the work is quite relevant to today's world.  It is a devotional that appeals to conservative Christians.  If this is the type of devotional you are seeking, then I would recommend you give serious consideration to this book 
 the best book I was ever required to read for a clas 
 As everyone's mentioned, this is an in-depth look at keeping a house.  When a book has nearly half a million words in it, you expect some detail.  To perform all the recommendations in this book would be a little OCD.  What this book does is give anyone who wants it the tools to keep a better home. Ms. Mendelson also recognizes that there are times when our lives may be imbalanced, with guests or illness or some other situation.  In those cases, she says, give yourself a break.  But if you want to get your home clean, orderly, and running well, this book can help you 
 This book is the book you want to read for the best handling of all topics relating to photography.  Here I found great descriptions of terminology that I have puzzled about for months, but could not get answers to.  This  book will improve your photography whether you are just starting or have  been shooting for years 
 I love these Examples & Explanations books.  The rules make sense when you can get decent examples, and these books do a good job of that.    If you find your outline frustrating (Like Emmanuels and/or Gilberts - both of which drive me nuts with frustration) try the Finals series books.  I like them much better as outlines than the "official outlines."  
 This book is definitely one of the best books out there on psychic protection.  It is responsible, thorough, and very accessible.  I have used this book with a wide variety of clients in my personal counseling practice and, no matter how versed they may have been with concepts like 'subtle energies', 'chakras' and such, this book has been helpful to all of them.  Readers interested in looking further into this subject will find Samuel Sagan's books to be very helpful, responsibly-written, well-researched, and full of wise information on how we can avoid attacks and/or attachments from astral energies.  Sagan is a medical doctor practicing in Australia (he also has established a school there) and his books are top-notch.  But for a straightforward approach to this subject, Judy Hall's book is very understandable, and includes wonderful (simple!) exercises that I find very useful indeed.  I wish I could rate this book a ten, but 5 stars (the max) is the best I can give.  I heartily recommend this book  -- good job, Judy, and thank you 
 Did any of you people know that animal farm can be read on 2 fronts? It is not only about animals. It is also a mock of the russian revolution and a start to communism. If you had every went to school you would know about the Bolsheviks, Leon Trosky, or come on even Joseph Stallin. It was only 50 years ago. I give animal farm 4 stars because it illistrates how much communism sucks. Be glad you r the capitalist u r. We will never become a communism or we wil all die.  
 I lived with a cheater for 5 years and it really helped starting the process of forgivenes 
 This is a good book to escape with in an afternoon or so.  A treehugger werewolf (no joke) finds himself attracted to a woman from a family with some sort of supernatural affliction.  The only treatment has been stolen by an evil and very wealthy man.  The family had this "treatment" for a very long time and without it, lunacy and death seem pretty certain.  Anyway...turns out the love interest is a strong psychic or at least she is later on in the book.  
 I believe if you're serious about cooking, you should own great cookware and excellent knives.  I finally stepped up and got excellent knives.  For those who haven't heard the hype, Shun is one of the most respected knife brands in the world.  Check them out on the Web at kershawknives.com.     Great features of the entire line include these cool "D" shaped handles that fit your hand better.  Every Shun Classic knife is made in a right- and left-handed version (chefsresource.com for lefties).  The handles are made of wood and are specially treated so they are diswasher safe!! The steel used for the blades is harder than what you would find in most other knives.  The knives are EXTREMELY sharp.   One thing to note about Asian knives is that they must be sharpened at a different angle, 16-18 degrees vs. 20 degrees for German knives.  The Shun steel takes the guesswork out of getting the angle correct because of the flat edge on one side of the metal disc below the handle.  Tomato knife -- I didn't eat tomatoes for a week while I was waiting on this knife to arrive.  I'm glad I waited.  I used to cut tomatoes with a steak knife and this is so much better!   I think this knife is the utility knife with scallops.  I don't have enough knife smarts to know the difference between serrations and scallops, but I do know I love this knife.  In Alton Brown's "Gear" book, he prefers scallops, but didn't say why.  This is an expensive, but lifetime investment.  I encourage you to visit stores and feel the knives in your hand to make sure you are comfortable with them. For more info on Shun, check out Alton Brown's website.  For ratings on various brands and types of knives, check out cooksillustrated.coms' equipment ratings.   This is probably the best kitchen purchase I've made and the one I'm most proud of.  
 North island on one side, South Island on the other, in scale of 1:1,000,000.  Elevations are color coded and roads clearly indicated as expressways, highways or major roads.  There are enlarged inserts of Aukland, Wellington, and Christchurch.  I haven't used it yet because we take our trip later this year.  However, I have inspected it and it appears to have everything I consider useful in a map.  
 While I admit that I haven't heard all of the songs compiled here, every one is interesting and changed to dramatic effect.  It's a solid piece of work that I enjoy listening to whenever and I prefer the acoustic reworking since it shakes up the seemingly stodgy formatting of the original songs that we all love, but not know far too well.  This recording is just complete class to me, that's what I hear when I listen to it.  These versions are just so vital to me.  Buy it, listen to it, tell me what you think 
 Yes, this is first and foremost a murder mystery rather than a Western, but the Western ingredients are oh so tasty as well.  By no means a traditional Western, the plot is offbeat enough (borrowing heavily from Agatha Christie) that you can imagine it as a spaghetti Western albeit with a somewhat different treatment than it gets here. The story is this:  A game of five card stud goes wrong when one of the men is revealed as a cheat - he is lynched, despite Dean Martin trying to stop the proceedings.  Later, the members of the card game start dying, one by one in styles reminiscent of the death of the card cheat.  Has one of the players gotten scared and is silencing the others?  Is it anything to do with the preacher who just arrived in town (played by Robert Mitchum)?  Did the story get out and someone else is taking revenge?  It's not too difficult to figure it out at least in part - heck, just the casting gives it away.  But the script is sharp enough to make the journey fun, and even the bit players are worth watching. Henry Hathaway clearly wants to do something a little different with this Western ( this one is sandwiched between the classics `Sons of Katie Elder' and `True Grit') and he succeeds, though not as successfully as before and after.  The movie is unfailingly entertaining - I remember it from my youth, and it still sticks in my mind, and brings a smile when I think of it. Dean Martin croons the title song, part of an underrated score by Maurice Jarre.  I say underrated because though not having the depth of his other works, this score is catchy enough to stick in your head - rather like the movie - no depth, but just plain entertaining.  Dean Martin shows he can lead a movie effectively, and while he does not stretch his acting chops by any means, he could not be more convincing as the womanising gambler caught up in something murky and trying to figure it out.  Robert Mitchum is kind of on autopilot here by his standards, but brings enough of his character from `Night of the Hunter' to make his part feel real.  Bit parts too are worth mentioning - Roddy McDowell as the underhand nasty ringleader with a chip on his shoulder; Yaphett Koto before playing a Bond villain in Live and Let Die plays the black philosophical bartender - OK, it's a cliché, but it's one that works. There is a love interest subplot which fails to ignite - Martin starts the movie in a semi romance with the young innocent daughter of the big rancher, and then tarries with the new woman in town, (Inger Stevens) - neither is completely convincing, as is the idea he would try and manage both at the same time.  But then, this is a Dean Martin vehicle... To summarise, this film has no depth, played by actors on autopilot and a director not firing on all four cylinders - and yet it is a hugely entertaining off beat Western that you are bound to enjoy.  Just don't expect a bona fide classic 
 We in the Western world all too rarely take the time to perceive and understand our modern society through anything other than Western eyes.  So it is as well with that wondrously tragic period of our history known as the Crusades.  While there are many contemperary histories of this era incorporating Western eye-witness accounts, there are but few with the perspectives of the invaded Orientals (i.e. Arabs, etc.).  So the uniqueness of an account written by a period-contemporary 'Arab-Syrian Gentleman' will not be lost on the reader.         "The Memoirs" are essentially just that:  an autobiography of a twelfth-century Arab Muslim and the experiences of his long and eventful life. From his earliest memories in Syria before the First Crusade to his twilight days in Egypt and Damascus, Munqidh shares his vast knowledge with the reader, imparting as well his personal, ingrained biases.  It is this latter which assists the reader in understanding the mind of the Crusading-era Muslim, even now oft-considered the enemy of Western "Christendom".  Indeed, some scholars argue that the key to understanding the Middle Easterner's distrustful eye to the West lies in the very heart of the Crusades.  Munqidh writes in the learned style one might expect of the educated nobility of his period, and though exquisitely detailed, he is neither long-winded nor boring.  So whether the avid scholar or simply the interested amateur, "The Memoirs of Usamah Ibn-Munqidh" is truly a worthy rea 
 Stampp presents an even-handed and readable narrative of the events in the North that led up to the Civil War: while not "pro-South," he makes clear that there were a number of motives on the Northern side, quite aside from any antipathy towards slavery, which caused the North to push the nation into war. Among the interesting tidbits in the book is an explanation of why the issue of slavery's expansion into the territories was so hot even though the remaining territories were clearly inhospitable to slavery (answer: both North and South viewed it as America's Manifest Destiny to continue expanding southward into Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean), and the curious story of how Major Anderson, the North's "hero" of Fort Sumter was actually pro-secession and tried heroically to avoid Sumter's becoming the spark that ignited Civil War. It is interesting to compare Stampp's book to Charles Adams' recent When In the Course of Human Events; also worth perusing is Jeff Hummel's Emancipating Slaves, Enslaving Free Men 
 This is a wonderful movie and I have always enjoyed it from the first time that I watched it when I was 20 something. Then to see the actress that plays Miss Ellie on Dallas in such a young roll. It was excellent.  The story is endearing and shows the many facets of ones life 
 I have been a DBA for a bunch of small sites for many years.  Recently I committed to a job w/ a large, online OLTP retailer and needed to fine tune my knowledge of the SQL Server engine.  I was shocked at just how flawed/lacking my knowledge was after reading this book.  Let me first state this sucker isn't for people looking to get by using the Enterprise Manger GUI.  This book dissects the inner most workings of the db engine and it's under lying theory.  Their is a lot of TSQL.  I found myself limited to reading only a small number of pages at a time and then needing a break.  The book is that intense and I have a Masters of Science degree as well as MCDBA and MCITP certifications.  Probably my favorite feature of the book is its small size, under 400 pages from tip to tail.  I'd suggest this book to anyone wanting an understanding of what they are actually doing in SQL Server when they issue commands from EM.  This book should be a requirement for any DBA or DB Designer in my opinion 
 I found myself in every page.  Gives new hope and opens the oors of understanding.  A must read  for adults & teens with ADD and their families.  
   This is a masterful examination of public policy flawed by the influence of those who seek to prolong their feast on the backs of suffering taxpayers.    The National Education Asssociation and other special interests who want to continue their "free lunch" at the expense of taxpayers and the children of this nation will not like this book.    Greene dissects 18 popular myths about public education. What he is too polite to say directly is the public education has become the province of the lowest performing college graduates. They have created through their union and related special interests a sinecure for the untalented and incapable. Public education administrators and teachers mightily resist any effort to reform the system they have built and instead demand more money to perpetuate their own mediocrity.    In my suburban community every one of the myths Greene exposes operates with full force. Teachers earn $70,000 plus benefits for a nine-month work year while test scores remain static or decline. More and more administrators at $143,000 are added while classroom investment remains unchanged. Education is nothing but the adoption of the fad of the day and the kids are taught little or nothing in terms of real knowledge. Any time a taxpayer speaks out, they are shouted down by the union minions. Meanwhile the city's liability for massive pensions grows. What a mess.    Greene first takes apart The Money Myth. In scarcely more than a dozen pages he puts the lie to the endless demands and claims of there not being enough money. There is more than enough money going into the public education system: it is simply wasted.    Class Size is fourth on Greene's list, though in my opinion it should be second. The idea of the so-called educators is not to improve education, but to create more jobs while lessening the burden of those who don't yet fill their week with productive work. It's the taxpayer who should be screaming and the parents whose children are being cheated. Class size, as Greene clearly and solidly points out, is not determinative.    Myths 5 and 6 deal with the Certification and Teacher Pay myth. Here Greene shows that certifications --- almost always used as an excuse to pay teachers more regardless of their actual competence --- makes no difference in the classroom. It's a racket, in my words, not Greene's. Punch a ticket and earn more money without needing to prove your competence. Nice deal if you can get it and too many thousands do. Greene also establishes that teachers are not by any measure underpaid.    Myth after myth falls to Greene's well supported arguments. He meets the education fear-mongers head on with unassailable evidence that they are interested only in their own pocketbooks and not the welfare of the children and the taxpayers on whose backs they live, like the parasite fish who feed on sharks.    This is an important book. It is a pity that Greene and his ilk stand against a monolithic public education establishment that spends tens of millions of dollars to defeat any substantive change and reform of public education.    One day reasonable parents will band together and unite to put an end to the public education scam. The sooner the better and, undoubtedly, Greene's book may be one of the factors in this to be hoped for movement.  Jerr 
 Hi Ladies, Please read this book even if you do not want to.  If you know you should read it, but cannot get past that reader's block that is preventing you, ask God to prepare you in the right time to sit down and listen to what she has to say.  Pray these prayers, even if you know how to pray yourself.  It is good to pray together corporately, and even if we are not all praying at the same time, we are all praying the words Stormie put into this book at one time or another and are in agreement that we want our husbands to be spiritually healthy.  Your husband, as strong as he is, needs his wife to see him as one who is vulnerable to the enemy and in need of a defense partner.  He NEEEEEDs you to pray for him.  This is a great book to get you back into the habit of it!  Kelly Townsend Author Christ Centered Childbirt 
 This DVD provides a scientifically objective account of the origin and development of the universe from its first fractional second of existence to (almost) the present.  The uncanny correspondence of this factual account with all the Judeo-Christian biblical creation references certainly provoked further study in our house!  Highly recommended 
 Lost World	 		 Knopf Inc., 1995, Hardback 393 pp., $18.87 Michael Crichton		                            ISBN 0-679-41946-2  	What would you do if you were trapped on an island stuck with prehistoric dinosaurs that are ready to tear you to shreds? A group of scientists are stuck on an island are about to be torn to shreds. Ian Malcom and his three partners have gone to an island called Isla Sorna believing there are dinosaurs that are still on the island since the prehistoric time. When they get to the island they figure out that the dinosaurs are not from the prehistoric time but from a cloning company called Ingen that cloned dinosaurs in Crichton's previous novel. 	Lost World is a grabbing novel and will keep you reading for hours on end. Crichton gives great descriptions of characters, places, and objects that will keep guessing if he was really on the island. It makes you feel like you are a part of the story on the island or off. Crichton has made novels that continue this novel and start this novel. Jurassic park was Crichton's novel before this and Jurassic park III is the novel that continues this novel. 	Lost World is exciting, adventurous, grabbing, and will always be a great novel. I would recommend this novel to anyone who likes adventures and anyone who likes to feel like you're in the story. Lost World is the best novel I have read and will be for quite a while.  Andy Pop 
 This movie should be placed among the timeless World War Two classics such as Schindler's List and Life Is Beautiful. It is truly one of Williams best performances since Goodwill Hunting. It acurately portrays the life of people during the Jewish Holocaust. Iwas touched deeply by this movie and moved by the great performance of Williams and the rest of the cast. Peter Kassovitz establishes himself as a great director with this movie. The book was great and the movie was even better 
 I read this outstanding book before embarking on my first soccer coaching experience.  Although I played competitive soccer for twelve years, I thought I should get updates on any changes as well as get some coaching  tips.  This book was perfect!  It's extremely well written, accurate, and  informative.  In addition, the layout is easy to navigate, and the glossary  and index make finding answers to questions a breeze. I would recommend  this book to a wide variety of people, from coaches, to players, to soccer  moms, to soccer trivia fans.  A great book 
 I recently became a regular bicycle commuter, with intentions to do some bicycle touring, but I am also fascinated with professional bicycle road racing in general and Lance Armstrong's role in the evolution of it in particular.  This book is an excellent introduction into amazing life and times of Lance Armstrong.  It is important to remember that this story is told from Lance's perspective, and therefore can not necessarily be expected to be totally objective; he occassionally uses the book as a platform to "correct misipressions" created by others.  Although, I can't fault someone as controversial as Lance Armstrong for wanting to air his side of a story.  In short, a bloody good read, if you are interested in the core topics.. 
 A delightful tale filled with humor and beautiful illustrations. Fun for both young children and the adults who read to the 
 This book takes you from easy patterns to very difficult patterns.  The fact that there are many squares keeps one interested.  The project is down right fun, and once i finished most of the squares (i'm still working on  it) i discovered as i approached other projects that i had gone from a  beginner to an intermediate knitter thanks to this sweet little book 
 This is the definitive "text book" for the subject of rocket propulsion. Its coverage of the subject is both broad and detailed. Probably a third of the book can be understood with no more than high school level physics and mathematics. The remainder requires some exposure to undergraduate level mechanical engineering, mathematics and physics, e.g. integral calculus, thermodynamics, etc. This book is in its 7th edition and it shows. The authors have a clean, precise, almost mechanical writing style that you would expect in a highly evolved technical work of this type. I do have one minor bone to pick with this book. The authors have clearly spent their lives doing rocketry in the mega million dollar world of NASA, General Dynamics, etc. Most of the graphs and diagrams emphasis big, big, rockets, e.g. graphs focusing on thrust chambers that operate at 5000 p.s.i. I suspect that most readers are either university students or individuals involved in experimental rocketry. Those that fall into the later category might benefit from better coverage of rocketry done with less exotic materials, fuels, and operating parameters. That minor weakness aside, this book covers in its 700 or so pages, everything that has been learned in the field of rocketry in the last 70 years and it presents this material at a fairly detailed technical level. It is therefore the book against which all others in the field will be judged 
 Perhaps I expected something more. The essays in this book are often repetitive and non-progressional in subject matter. The softcover version of the book has stills that are more brown and white than black and white... For my money, I am a bigger fan of Hirsch's "The dark side of the screen". It is a well thought, well researched look at noir with a cohesive structure. This all is not to say that a majority of the essays in the Reader are not helpful. Of course it is great to read Schrader's piece and some others which deal with nice specifics (how economics affected growth of B genre, lighting, etc.) but at the end of the day I feel too many of the essays are only about defining the genre (or not genre) rather than delving into other things. Also, I probably will buy more books by these authors simply because their care for noir is so true and strong.. 
 As we learn every St. Patrick's Day, we all have a little of the Irish in us -- that irrepressible urge to smile, enjoy our neighbors and family, and tell a good story.  This is one such story. Filmed in a beautiful village on the Isle of Man, it features actors that are not beautiful physically (although not ugly either) and a story line that is incredible, but not quite impossible. And you come away from it feeling good. Even the Wicked Witch gets her just desserts.  I lent it to an Irish friend who was down after attending several funerals of old friends and it restored his good spirits. It's that kind of film. 
 Yup, this is IT!  If you want to recommend just one post-1980 Cheap Trick album to someone, "Rockford" is THE obvious choice 
 You want to know why Clinton got impeached over a personal matter while Bush and GOP are getting a free ride even while it's obvious that they are indeed guilty as sin for dragging this country into a nazi-like war in Iraq resulting in oil for blood and in the process killing thousands of US troops and hundred thousands Iraqis? Then read this book and defeat the TALIBAN RIGHTWING MEDIA !!! And yes, we need to purge the centrist Democrats and put real Democrats in their place to WIN !! 
 For their clarity, accessibility and deep insight, these 11 essays represent top grade scholarship on the part of Bernard Lewis. Those interested in the historic interplay between Islam and (for lack of a better word) Christendom, as well as those seeking more knowledge of the roots of current world events, will learn much from Lewis. The essays defending Orientalism and critiquing Western Arabic translations are the best of the bunch 
 I saw "Stardust" on cable tv and enjoyed the fact they did under line her work for the Hollywood Canteen, and Davis was the FIRST female to be honored with AFT Life Achievement Award.  *I DON'T feel ex-servants who were fooling around with Bette  Davis' husband is a reliable source for  an interview.  *ALSO, how do we know what Jack Warner said to Bette Davis regarding "Gone With The Wind" -- it is very likely he did dangled the promise of the role of Scarlette, even if he did not have the rights to the movie. ONLY the two parties involved know -- Davis and Warner.  *Also, her ex-husband "supposedly" told the women he cheated on with about events about another husband. *sigh* *Celeste Holmes is hardly reliable, she stood in front of an audience at the AFI awards praising DAVIS, AFTER DAVIS' death Holmes bad mouthed her. *cough*  Of course -- The Films Jezebel The Man Who Came to Dinner Old Acquaintance are most enjoyable! Davis is the only female actor from the "Golden Age" who carried a film on her OWN -- she did not have the strong leading man to rely upon as other famous legends.

 I have been studying the various aspects of the "Abrahamic" religions for a few years (Jewish, Christian, Islamic). I am fascinated by the grand debate among them and how it is based on interpretations of millennia old documents translated and retranslated with political intent, gender and social bias.  My first revelation came when I began reading the Schocken Bible, Volume One (The Five Books of Moses), a direct translation from the ancient Hebrew into English using modern language to express our ancestor's thoughts.  It struck me as much more lyrical and poetic than the obtuse words of the King James version. And more importantly, it reads like the documentation of an ancient oral tradition passed to us from the early days of man's civilization.  So these profound words come forth, from the ancient past, and we see them not for the guidance and connection to our ancestors, but use them for our silly social clubs. We create organizations, establish symbols, and interpret the words into complex rules. But the basic message and social conduct it wants to express is lost.  I suggest anyone who wants to find the real meaning of these books read this translation. The message is still there 
 My review for this CD brings up the same points as my review for "Flamenco" by Pepe Romero in that in both these cases, you have musicians who have spent most of thier careers in classical music and have tried their hand at a different genre.  And just as the case with Pepe Romero and Flamenco, 100 años of Mariachi gives us wonderful performances... refined, precise, not lacking anything on the surface. No doubt, Domingo sings wonderfully... but will not please "afficionados" who feel the music should have a certain earthiness and rawness of emotion only gained through years and years of specializing and living this type of music only.  Long ago as a teenager living in Mexico, Placido Domingo sang much Mariachi music for pleasure (himself a big fan of the ranchera greats) before he decided to concentrate all his energy on training for a full-time opera career. So this style of music is by no means "unnatural" for him to sing now or is it out of place for him as, say, American Broadway show tunes. However, he also admitted he could not produce the full range of mariachi vocal technique because such would possibly damage his voice for his operas.   Taking all that into consideration, I did enjoy this CD very much. I personally found Domingo's singing style highly refined yet strongly masculine... very much proper for this music. And always showing impeccable good taste and wonderful musicianship. What I always admired about Domingo is no matter what type of music he ventures into, he really tries his best to prepare and "live" the music as an actor does for a role. Don't be dissuaded by those claiming a mere opera singer can't sound convincing in Mariachi, or that he brings "nothing" to this music... as soon as I played this CD and Domingo sang the first phrase of "Paloma Querida", I was sold. Of course, Domingo is not a genuine ranchera specialist. But there are times when one can't help but believe he is based on his performance here.  I highly reccomend this CD for those new to Mariachi music, or for those more concerned with wonderful singing of this music in a general sense. True afficionados will of course prefer the genuine interpreters of yesterday and today and give this one a pass. But given the extremely poor taste of multitudes of singers who tried this music in recent years, I find it hard to believe that Domingo, with his wonderfully refined singing, could be dismissed by anybody 
 The multitude of short films presented on this disc are ones that the viewer can just watch over and over again.  With so much going on, one can literally watch them scores of times and catch something new every time.  Short as they are, I love these films of everyday people and things from the 1890s and early and mid-Aughts.  The films on this collection in particular span the years 1900 to 1906, covering the early Edwardian period (and the very end of the Victorian era, as Queen Victoria died in 1901).  Unlike the films produced by Thomas Edison and the Lumière brothers, however, Sagar Mitchell and James Kenyon actively encouraged these people they were filming to interact with the camera.  The majority of the people in these films were from the working masses (sadly, quite a few of them were child laborers), the main audience for films in the medium's infancy, and they got a real kick out of seeing themselves onscreen.  In many instances, these films were shown the very day they were shot, sometimes under 4 hours afterwards.  Watching these films is like a time capsule, what with the horse-drawn transportation, early automobiles, clothing styles, store signs, and early amusement parks.  It's also haunting to realise that all of the people in these films (but for maybe a few very young children here and there) are long dead, and that many of these little boys and teenage boys would, not that many years down the road, be sacrified on the altar of WWI, capturing this lost generation before their world changed forever.  One also can't help but wonder what these people's hopes and dreams were, what went on in their lives after they stopped waving at the cameras and went home, what it was really like to live in that long-ago world.  Extras include a featurette on how this treasure trove came to be discovered and the painstaking process of restoration, several extra films, an interview with Vanessa Toulmin, one of the restorers, audio commentary by Ms. Toulmin, and an essay read by Tom Gunning, accompanied by images from several more films.  This really is an invaluable resource for discovering how people really lived in the Edwardian era and for learning more about early film and how fast it changed.  This type of film was no longer popular by the end of the decade because people now preferred narrative storylines with real actors, not seeing themselves or other ordinary people on the screen.  And even though one usually thinks of films from the Aughts as being like this, in actual fact movies were no longer seen as a novelty or something experimental and faddish by 1900, and there were more and more films with a narrative structure being made at the same time as these people in Ireland and the United Kingdom thrilled to seeing themselves on the screen.  The films included here are just the tip of the iceberg; over 100 Mitchell and Kenyon films are known to survive, and all of them restored from their original negatives.  Hopefully there will be more volumes just like this one 
 I have always been a Robert Klein fan, even before I knew that we both grew up on Decatur Avenue. (We were there at the same time but I am two years older and lived 4 blocks away, a fact that created two separate worlds.) So, I was anxious to read this book.  I thought I would lose interest when the book turned away from the neighborhood but that did not happen.  It was extremely well written and I had the feeling of being part of each phase of his early years.  I loved it and would highly recommend it.  He is a very bright and funny man.  
 When I was shopping for a new home I bought this book based upon a recommendation I read in a book review article. I found it to be very thorough and covered every topic imagineable. You'll learn how to inspect real estate for repair and maintainence problems plus how to identify safety hazards. This book will teach you like an expert. I can now make sure the contractors I hire are doing quality work and not just rely on what they tell me. Get it, you won't regret it 
 A very moving tribute to one of the worse days in recent US history 
  Hillary Kramer (Barbra) is a successful Perfume magnate, when she finds out that her accountant has robbed her blind and left for South America. Going through all of her remaining assets she finds a boxer, purchased as a tax write off. She decides to take Eddie Scanlon (Ryan O' Neal) who is much more at home giving driving lessons, into the ring and use him as her key to riches. Eddie thinks this will only get him killed, but Hillary won't give up that easy, nor will Eddie give up that easy from never fighting again. The story lacks originality and farce, which gave "What's Up, Doc?" it's brilliance. However Barbra & Ryan are in top form & they are still great and hilarious together! 
 Reading Gene Kranz's experience as mission controller at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration brought back childhood dreams of being a "space man". Gene Kranz lead an exciting life, and he relates his story through exciting tales from is tenure at NASA.  Many times during his recollection of events at NASA I felt the the exhilaration of a mission accomplished, and the defeat and sadness during NASA's failures. I felt the adrenaline coursing through my veins during the reentry into the atmosphere of Apollo 13, and felt saddened when reading the account of the electrical fire that took the lives of three brave astronauts.  Much can be learned from Kranz's life experiences in both making career decisions and in facing conflict head on without surrendering or admitting defeat. Often Gene Kranz's bravery and persistence during a seemingly impossible situation, has inspired me during challenges in life.  I would recommend keeping this book in your library for reference in dealing with your own seemingly impossible tasks. This book will help you in making decisions concerning your career and your life.   It must have been difficult for Gene to give up his flying job for a desk job, but the world and our country are the better from his selfless decision.Gene's dedication to his family, the space program, and the the United States of America is evident in his memoirs. Gene's memoir's truly attest to his being a great Man and a great American

 A thorough and brutally honest account of a long stay in a juvenile psychological hospital.  Very, very well written.  I hope Abigail Vona will write again, and tell about her life after she returned to the outside world 
 The story was very interesting and i couldn't put the book down.  
  Time to pack up my luggage (wouldn't it be nice to have a suitcase like Rincewind's?) and take off for Discworld while the rain and gloom of a January thaw engulf the northern hemisphere.  "Guards!  Guards!" is the eighth book in the Discworld series, in which Captain Sam Vimes of Ankh-Morpork's Night Watch gives up drinking and gets married (just the opposite of most folks).  I don't read the Discworld novels in order any more, just pick up a favorite and start in.  The blurbs on the back and cover pages compare Pratchett to Charles Dickens (Pratchett is better), Chaucer, "J.R.R. Tolkien with a sharper, more satiric edge," and P.G. Wodehouse.  I think any author who garners comparisons with such wildly disparate writers must be in a category by himself.  Heck, Pratchett IS a category by himself.  So on to Ankh-Morpork where the Unique and Supreme Lodge of the Elucidated Brethren decides, with a little prompting from its Supreme Grand Master, to conjure up a dragon.  The dragon will cause enough death and property damage (including a vegetable stand and a brother-in-law's shiny new carriage) so that when the Supreme Grand Master's nephew rides into the city with his sharp, shiny sword and slays the beast, the grateful citizens will proclaim him king.  This plot works rather well, except that the dragon decides that it wants to be king and cremates its would-be slayer.  Its requirements are simple and traditional:  one well-bred virgin per month, and all of the gold, silver, and jewels in Ankh-Morpork for its hoard.   The new regime fires Sam Vimes from his job as captain of the Night Watch.  How he wonders, could things get worse?  Well, at least he's not a virgin and no one is talking to him in capital letters. 
 Could the author be speaking of my family?  This was an awesome book.  Drug addiction, single mom, lots of laughs and some sadness.  Terry, done it again.  This was a page turner 
 Roy Lichtenstein may have accomplished many things in his lifetime, but writing a children's book was never one of them.  Of course you might not know that after perusing Rachel Isadora's pop-art inspired, "Listen To the City".  Having done well enough with its predecessor, "ABC Pop!" to consider a sequel of a sort, Isadora expands her repertoire further than ever.  I first heard of this author/illustrator's work when I read her, "Ben's Trumpet" and "On Your Toes" so many many years ago.  Not afraid to switch styles mid-stream, this book is certainly a testament to one artist's ability to do whatever it takes to create something wholly original. And pop-o-rific to boot. 	 "Listen To the City" catalogues a full day in what could only be the Big Apple.  Turn the publication page and the first thing you see is a bright clock, all primary colors in yellow, blue, with a facing page of pure unadulterated red red red.  The words, "RISE AND SHINE" appear at the top of the page and you begin just another day in the city.  You hear and see all kinds of things right from the start.  Breakfast sizzling.  A helicopter high above whoop whoop whooping.  The sounds and sights of hundreds of different legs hurrying to and fro.  Sometimes pictures overlap one another, as when cars, trucks, and taxis all converge on the busy streets.  People get hot dogs and balloons ("SQUIRT SQUIRT, POP!") and when the day is done they watch movies, listen to jazz, and go to sleep.  A long, noisy, eventful day. 	 Isadora reduces the illustrations in this book to their most essential forms.  The publication page doesn't offer any clues as to how this was done (though I was amused to find that the text was set in something called, "CircusMouseBook-Medium").  Basically this book would do the aforementioned Lichtenstein proud.  Colors are bright and pop out like nobody's business.  The words offer amusing juxtapositions between different sounds.  At one point you're watching the legs of all kinds of people walk about.  Sound effects for this page include, "CLICK CLICK, CLOMP CLOMP, TINK, TIP TAP", and, "CLICK CLACK".  I wouldn't recommend this book for reading aloud during a storytime, but one-on-one it could be a lot of fun. 	 There's a rather peculiar picture in the book that shows one of the New York Public Library's famous lions (I'm not sure which) sitting mysteriously in a green park.  I'm going to get all nit-picky on you now and point out that the library lions face only a busy 5th Avenue.  The park is behind them, as well as behind the library.  You might say that Isadora isn't singling out a single "city" with the book, but how then do you describe the image of the George Washington Bridge or the Number 2 subway train?  The strongest evidence that this is a NYC story?  The last image in the book is of a garbage truck working in the dark as a snarky voice calls from an upper apartment window, "QUIET!".  A cleaned up version of what you might actually hear, but one that struck me as particularly New Yorkish. 	 If you're one of those parents who likes to introduce different art styles to your children via picture book illustrations, pop-art couldn't get a better visual aid than, "Listen To the City".  Consider pairing it with James Warhola's droll, "Uncle Andy's" or Ross MacDonald's, "Achoo Bang Crash", for a particularly pop-inspired storytime.  A nice if not completely overwhelming title 
 ok i'll admit i haven't seen "live and loose in paris" - the one that everyone else is harping about. but in my humble opinion, this is the best live concert dvd that has ever been released. i'm an audio engineer by profession and i found the sound on this dvd to be phenomenal. not great, not outstanding, but unbelievable. the production is marvelous, as is the performance by mr. collins and his band. if you've ever read a review by an unkown person and acted on it, take my advice and buy this dvd right now! there's no way in hell you won't enjoy it, not if you love phil collins, not if you love a good concert, not if you love good music.  cheer 
 This is not a commentary on the Psalms - this is Lewis wrestling personally with the Psalms, around issues near and dear to his heart. But what better way to encounter the Psalms? They are written as a songbook, as lyrical poems from the heart of one worshiper to another. They aren't primarily doctrinal theses, they are artworks of exceeding skill and ability. Lewis is intellectually and devotionally equipped to engage with the Psalms at a deep level. I love reading his meditations on the Psalms

 Professor Shapiro has since become known as a more popular Shakespearean critic.  This book shows his depth as a historical scholar.  The book's title  understates the breadth of its scholarship.  Its subject is important not only to the Shakespearean scholar but to anyone interested in religious history and the history of Jews in the Christian world up to the Renaissance. Gregory T.

 I had no idea of the content of this book when I picked it up at a Used Book Store. In fact, I looked at it several times before starting to read and then had great difficulty putting it down. My own Mother died in an instant from a heart attack. I always felt cheated that I didn't get to say "Good-bye" but after reading this book, I know how fortunate we were not to go thru the heartbreak of an illness like this........so much pain and suffering, both physical and mental for the patient as well as the family.   I will now look for all of Quindlen's books hoping they are as interesting and completely "full of life" as this one 
 Fleetwood Mac's "Tango in the Night" is a great cd and a great finisher for Lindsey Buckingham. Surely, this is one of their best albums with their most popular line-up (Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, Mick Fleetwood, and John McVie). The opener "Big Love" is a great track that is both dark  and powerful. It moves into the wonderful "Seven Wonders" in which Stevie Nicks delivers an amazing performance. "Everywhere" is one of the bets Christine McVie has ever written. "Caroline" is catchy, "Tango in the Night" delivers great guitar and vocals by Buckingham and "Mystified" is tender. But the follow up by McVie in "Little Lies" is what makes this album so good. "Welcome to the Room...Sara" is real, both by and about Stevie Nicks troubles. "Family Man" is good but "Isn't it Midnight" with the McVie Buckingham duet is my favorite. "When I see You Again" helps to round out the album and "You and I Part 2" delivers a solid finish. 
 Not as funny as his "Book of Bad Songs" -- nothing could top that. Not quite as funny as "Dave Barry Turns 40", but about on a par with "Dave Barry is Not Making This Up". Definitely a book that you won't want to miss, if you enjoy Dave's irreverent style (and who doesn't?) 
 Since the greeks, two contrasting ideas are the main players in the discussion of the Cosmos origin. Today, Inteligent Design postulates an inteligent creator for our Universe (with the hidden agenda that "He" is possibly the Christian or Islamic onipotent God). Another view postulates an infinite Landscape of possible Universes, from those, by pure chance, a tiny fraction enables complexity and life to emerge (and we, of course, inhabit one of these lucky universes). The authors discuss a Third Way, a vision that fuses both ideas: the universes evolve by Darwinian or even Genetic Engineering mechanisms where galactic biospheres play a catalizing role in the creation of baby universes. In contrast to some naive reviews done here, apparently writen by ID supporters, it is indeed an intriging and non-trivial alternative. The idea does not involves an infinite regress because at each generation the universe parameters (akin to genes) are selected as to produce more easily the next inteligent biospheres. This means that the biophylic character of the universes pool is increasing along time, it is not an stationary process. So, what it is need is a proto-evolutionary model for the first biophilic universe. Perhaps the Smolin model of baby universes catalized by black holes is such protoevolutionary mechanism. This means that the Inteligent Designer is not omnipotent or omniscient, but evolves along time by a Darwinian mechanism: a true synthesis between the ID and standard science. This means that any argument or "evidence" for ID is also favourable to the Biocosmo Hypotesis(BH), and BH should be discussed in schools where ID is taught. So, the final question is: the Designer is onipotent? If so, why the Cosmos is full of "problems" and "evil", from the point of view of Life. The Selfish Biocosmo accounts this, Christian or Islamic ID, not 
 Was required by a law class to read this...but actually found it very enjoyable and easy to read.  It flows like a fictional novel.  
 This series keeps getting better with each book! Ceremony in Death has new murders for Lieutenant Eve Dallas to solve and these take the reader on a journey into a different realm than we've seen in the previous books. With J.D. Robb at the helm, we should expect the unexpected!   A fellow officer is found dead in his living room and the coroner's preliminary report determines that his heart gave out. This doesn't sit well with Eve Dallas as she suspects foul play. This feeling of unease goes into high gear when she's asked to investigate whether he was a dirty cop, and she begins to smell a set up. This investigation also pits her against her mentor and good friend, Feeney.   As Dallas begins to wonder about her own beliefs when she's thrown into the midst of a satanic cult whose high priestess is just plain evil. Then to add to the mix, a Wiccan high priestess is introduced - a woman who enjoys torturing others and believing she's been personally chosen to do the work of Satan. There isn't a dull moment in this investigation and when it turns personal towards Eve Dallas, Roarke is just a bit peeved.   Some of the fun of this book (yes, with J.D. Robb writing, there is always a bit of fun in each book!), we learn more about Eve's sidekick, Officer Delia Peabody. The straight and narrow patrol officer wasn't always so regimented. We learn that her parents are Freeagers and that was the influence in her upbringing. Freeagers - hmm, well, I guess my best description would be hippie throwbacks without the drugs. Freeagers are vegans and believers of peace to all creatures. It's interesting to see the influence this has on Peabody and it often takes Dallas by surprise.   As for the villain behind the three murders, any mystery fanatic can figure it out two thirds of the way into the book. Even so, this still makes for a great thriller and the colorful descriptions and witty dialog keep the reader entertained until the last page is turned.   As with the previous books in the "In Death" series, this is a strong plot, has fantastic character development, and takes you on a wonderful journey. You won't be disappointed when you get to this book in the series. After reading Ceremony in Death, you'll make getting the next book a high priority! 
 This Viking saga probably has more roots in so called "myth" than any others I have read and its one of the most entertaining ones also. Includes appearances by Odin, Valkyries and a dragon along with all the usual inter tribal "politics" of heads getting cracked by swords and axes 
 I read this book when I was a child and it's scared me so much that I had to sleep wiht the lights on for weeks.  It's definitely a classic 
 Bissell, who is very young (born in 1974)to be writing short stories with this kind of wisdom, worked as a Peace Corps volunteer near the Aral Sea and has used his experiences in South Central Asia and Eastern Europe, delving into the lives of journalists haunted by demons, searchers, spoiled rich brats, do-gooders, criminals, sociopaths, and a litany of misfits to produce a rare feat of fiction--literary short stories that have the feel of expose. He takes you into the heart of modern day Afghanistan, for example, in his story "Death Defier," where an American journalist, haunted by family demons, appears to be a courageous photographer of truth on one hand and a man with a death wish on the other. In "Aral," his story that more than the others ventures into exposition and polemic, a nihilistic KGB officer lectures an American biologist UN worker about the "fat souls" of Americans who, for all their platitudes, know nothing of real suffering before subjecting the woman to a little trial of her own. In "The Ambassador's Son" a rogue narrates his licentious exploits and the manner in which he corrupts a Christian missionary.   Amazingly, these stories can be peeled layer upon layer for their psychological depth while at the same time they percolate with the buzz of the chaos that we read about in the daily newspapers and blogs. A great achievement. 
 12 Stones self titled debut album is an album that I think will be around for a while.  The album starts off with "Crash" which is a song that has hard edged guitars to off set a slower vocal delivery than you'd expect with such hard guitars.  It works extremely well and could become what their known for: mixing tempos to create a unique hard rock sound.  "Broken" seems to follow the same format as does "The Way I Feel".  Speaking of "The Way I Feel", it gives you the feeling that it could be a power ballad but decided against it.  As the album continues you'll notice the trend of smooth vocal delivery being back up by really hard edged guitars continue until the end of the album.  It's because of this that many say the album lacks creativity.  I think strong arguments could be made on both sides of that argument so I won't touch it.  Overall, I feel that this is a great album that will especially be enjoyed by fans of Creed, One Day Remains, Scott Stapp, Day of Fire and/or Days of the New 
 This is a GOOD BOOK.  Not a great book, but a Good Book.  It reads very well and is hard to put down.  Written as a narrative, it is not an analytical book that is going to hit you with a lot of numbers, facts, theories, etc..   What it lacks in details, it makes up for in it's ability to bring to life an era of American history that is little understood.     This book covers the War of 1812 in moderate detail and gives you good insight as to who the key players were during this time and what was taking place in the country.  The book begins around 1805 and progresses into the reasons for the war and then picks apart indivudual "chapters" of the war as if unfolded.  It discusses different conflicts on land and sea;  in Washington and London; Low points and high points; conspiracy and intrigue.    You should experience quite a few "Wow, I did not know that" moments with this book.    In 1812 America was at a point in her existence where the "Founding Father" leadership was retiring from the scene and the first new generation of leadership was beginning to take root.  There was a strong push for Imperialism.  It is amazing to see how bold this country was, yet how blind America was to itself as a unified nation, as a member of the world, and how blind she was to her weaknesses.    Before reading this book, I like many Americans, was very unsure on what the war of 1812 was about and what significance it held for this country.    The Revolution gave us America, but the War of 1812 completed the creation of this country and forced it to mature early and make changes and decisions that have brought us to where we are today.    Without the War of 1812, America may not have grown into being a world power so soon or even survived intact to the 20th century.  
 My sister-in-law, who interviews people for a living, took a look at this book when it came in, and pronounced it excellent. For many of us who have been in a position for a number of years, interview skills are something that most definitely does *not* come naturally. This book helps bring people like myself over the hump to feel more at home in basic interviews 
  I first heard about Bill James when I read Moneyball, which is about the odd general managing strategies of Billy Beane, Oakland Athletics general manager and James devotee.  This book lists the best 100 players at each position. While I cannot even pretend to understand the methodology of his rankings, I enjoyed the mini-biographies about some of my favorite players and James' unique assessment of their worth. James also provides a decade by decade synopsis of the major leagues, even down to the styles of uniforms and stadium attendance figures, and the style of play that predominated each era.   From Wikipedia: "Sabermetrics is the analysis of baseball through objective evidence, especially baseball statistics. The term is derived from the acronym SABR, which stands for the Society for American Baseball Research. It was coined by Bill James, who has been its most enthusiastic (and by far its most famous) proponent."  James' story is fascinating. He is an everyman. A fan's fan. He wrote his first abstract in 1977 while working nights as a security guard. Now he works as a consultant for the Boston Red Sox and played a role in their 2004 pennant. 
 This is a must-read, particularly for anyone who has seen - and been captivated by - the BBC film version of Elizabeth Gaskell's very fine novel. Although the film is excellent and largely faithful to Gaskell's story, it cannot fully convey the depth of her characters. The author herself does this masterfully, painting rich word portraits of each figure through skillful use of dialogue and description. Another especially exquisite feature of this book is the way Gaskell weaves the relationship between Margaret Hale and John Thornton into the differences between cotton mill owners in the north of England and their workers. The author creates tension and passion in the coupling of Margaret and Thornton by immersing them in the conflict between labor and management, pitting Margaret's advocacy of the workers against Thornton's interests as a mill owner. In doing so, she offers valuable insights into the needs and concerns of both sides in this labor dispute in a way that speaks to present-day tensions between unions and companies. Gaskell does this by portraying Thornton as a mill owner who ultimately tries to balance his head for business with an expanding heart for his workers and Margaret as someone who comes to understand both sides in the conflict. Readers with a spiritual bent may appreciate, too, Gaskell's tasteful use of religious imagery and language, something the film barely touches on. This is especially apparent in the exchanges between Margaret and her dying friend, Bessy Higgins, who is obsessed with the biblical book of Revelation. Margaret, the daughter of a minister, relates beautifully to Bessy's concerns and Bible quotations, engaging and respecting her religious sensibilities, yet offering a sense of balance that is drawn from her own beliefs. 
 When Thomas More wrote UTOPIA in 1516, he attempted to postulate how human beings could create a society that would be as nearly perfect as possible.  At least that is what is commonly believed that he tried to do.  For those who have read his book, they immediately see some troubling issues.  The first sticky point is to define what he meant by the term "utopia." Did he mean a totally democratic state; such as the ancient Greeks had, in which each citizen had direct voting in all issues? Or perhaps More was simply updating Plato, who saw his Republic as a society governed by a carefully selected breed of rulers who would rule an equally carefully selected brood of subjects? Or again, was More attempting to strike an impossible balance between the burgeoning rise of Renaissance humanism with a stifling set of conflicting Christian religions?  It is too easy for moderns to suggest that he was merely holding up Utopia as a fun-house type mirror by which he wished his contemporaries could see themselves reflected as zigzag images and perhaps be ashamed enough--or exhorted enough--to alter their behavior for the better.  We today are tempted to judge his meaning by 20th century standards, which do not always draw a clear distinction among the virtues that More's Renaissance contemporaries took for granted but today we dismiss as outdated, or worse, irrelevant.  The book itself has two parts. The first includes More, who places himself in the book as a traveler to Antwerp who meets Peter Giles, who in turn introduces him to Raphael Hythloday, a name that Moore punningly notes that in Greek means "nonsense speaker."   Hythloday mentions that he journeyed with Amerigo Vespucci to America and along the way encountered the mythical land of Utopia.  This first part is slow reading in that More does little more than discuss some general reforms of potential benefit to England, most of which involved agrarian, economic, judicial, military, and criminal justice matters, all of which obliquely suggest that what worked in Utopia might work in England as well.  It is the second part that has generated considerable controversy as to what More really meant his readers to grasp.  For those who come to the second part of UTOPIA and expect a 16th century version of Eden, the results are profoundly shocking.  When More details the basic government setup as one in which its citizens are living in a ruthless police state with the death penalty meted out for a variety of reasons, readers suddenly grasp that Utopia may not be all that different from Plato, who similarly envisioned his society as one free from the degenerating influences of poetry and the basic tenets of free speech.  When this sobering concept sinks in, then the term "utopia" begins to lose its cache as a synonym for a land of unrivalled happiness. But if these readers look at Utopia through the eyes of More and not their own, then a different Utopia arises.  As an educated classicist fully versed in traditional Christian orthodoxy, More was trained to evaluate any social structure according to the non-Christian but humanistic Cardinal Virtues of wisdom, fortitude, temperance, and justice, and then compare these to the Christian virtues of faith, hope, and charity.   More made it clear that both sets of virtues were needed to make Utopia an enduring entity.  More was not optimistic enough to truly believe the social inequities in England (or Utopia for that matter) could be so easily eliminated merely by rearranging the pieces of the social pie. What humans of any society needed to ensure genuine freedom from tyranny was mastery of the far more unmanageable Seven Deadly Sins.  Of these More suggests that by downplaying the importance of gold, by limiting the nature and amount of material wealth, and by forcing all citizens from the highest to lowest to share in all types of drudgery, that the worst of the sins, Pride, will be vanquished, thus leaving Utopia as ready to endure in the face of what to other and less advanced societies would be tantalizing but deadly temptations.  What emerges then in Utopia is a mythical land based on equally mythical virtues that can house a citizenry such as never existed in human history nor is likely to.  But More felt that even if his contemporaries managed to alter for the better their profligate ways, then a small sliver of Utopia might result.  For More and perhaps for us today, that might be good enough.  
 I have admired Jim Webb since I first heard about him from a close friend, Mike McGarvey. Mike was in Jim Webb's platoon in Vietnam and has remained close to him. Mike lost his right arm just below the shoulder while serving with Jim. One thing about Mike best describes his feelings about his service as a Combat Marine. He has a tattoo of a dotted line around the bottom of his stump and above it the words, "cut on dotted line". Mike is a Patriot in the truist sense. I gave a copy of, "A Sense Of Honor" to a friend's daughter to read just before entering the Naval Academy. She had led a sheltered life to put it mildly. The book allowed her to go in with a "heads up" that would have otherwise been impossible. She receive many awards and honors while attending the Academy and gradutated with honors. The book is not only entertaining but very informative. This is probably the best revelation of what our Navy and Marine Officers go through just to earn the right to become the leaders of the World's finest Sailors and Marines. I wish I could have read "Fields Of Fire" before I served as a Field Radio Operator with 1/3 in the Northern I Corps in '69.  Oh yes, Mike is now director of the prosthetics department at a VA hospital 
 If you've got a nice, sunshiny yard, why not gussy it up a little with one of the contemporary curtain ensembles that decorators now call, window treatments? I found Creative Publishing's guide to be insightful and a true resource, it's good even with the basement windows that my X put inwhile trying to give a basement woodshop some natural light, but on the other hand nosy neighbors mean that you have to have some cloth over the glass.    Whether your view overlooks a garden in the country, or St. Patrick;s Cathedral in the city, you'll want a book like this here "More Creative Window Treatments" so you can look at the color photos and decide for yourself, and for your family, which setting would look nicest. And then the book gives you complete instructions for how to sew it together yourself. Or perhaps you can enlist the assistance of the birds and mice Disney's Cinderella used to help her whip together her gown

 First off to avoid any conflict of interest claims I admit that I an a huge Rod Stewart fan. That being said, I just wasn't interested in hearing him do the old American classics(which I also love). I just didn't see how he could do them justice, that is, until I saw his DVD "Live from Royal Albert Hall" in which he did several of the songs from his first "Great American Songbook". I was just blown away. These songs were now his. I went to the computer to order one of the CDs but my wife talked me into getting all four and I am surely not sorry. I believe that there are very few CDs available with no weak tracks(there are some) but here are four that just don't have a weak track(IMHO). He has made all of these great songs his. My all time favorite song is "Stardust" by Hoagy Carmichael. I had never heard a version that I thought could top his, until now. If you love the old standards you should really give these 4 CDs a listen. They'll melt your heart!!!!  
 The music on this CD is so beautiful, so soothing, and so relaxing that it's hard for me to describe with mere words. You will have to hear it for yourself. I will tell you this- I don't care what life dished-out to bring you down during the day, if you play this CD when you get home it will free your mind. I call it "Western Wall" therapy. Linda & Emmylou, I can't thank you enough 
 This id definitely worth time and money to get. It flows well and gives enough vintage Queen for everyone to love. The two remixes at the end are classic Queen as if in concert. Bravo 
 For those familiar with the history of manned space flight, most of the information in this book is familiar. But there are also some "what if" alternatives mentioned. For instance, Shepard wanted a 3-day Mercury flight in 1963 following the flight of Cooper's Faith 7. This never came to pass. Considering how far the US was behind the USSR in man hours of space flight, this would have been a good idea.    
 My daughter wanted Easy-bake oven and this is a great alternative.   It also comes with 4 recipes that makes 2 small pizzas so it is great for a snack!   -Easy Cheesy Pizza  -Stuffed Crust Pizza   -Carmel Apple Cookie Pizza -Raspberry Cheesecake Pizza no pre-mixed stuff here.  It's great for them to learn fractions (cups) and to measure tea/ tablespoons 
 Penniless. Defenseless. Powerless. This is the reality of Jane Eyre, a young orphan girl forced to cope with the callous world around her as a child. After the death of her parents, Jane is forced to reside with her cruel aunt, Mrs. Reed, who despises her, and consequently sends Jane away to Lowood, a boarding school with little resources and poor housing conditions. Despite malnutrition and a harsh atmosphere, Jane strives to make her mark at the school, eventually becoming a teacher. Before she realizes it, Jane tries to escape from her old life and embarks on a new journey as a governess under the employment of a secretive and guarded gentleman. As Jane falls in love with her mysterious employer, she struggles to safeguard the little confidentiality she has left to protect herself from the secrecy and ill-will of others. Although Jane cautiously guards her heart instead of exposing her soul, a revelation of truth eventually catches up to her, causing more harm than the wrath of the deepest secrets. Jane finds herself trapped between truth and lies as she faces her past, her situation, and herself in a world where all odds are against her. Jane Eyre has remained a classic in literature because Brontï¿½ illustrates the necessity of secrets in life, therefore supporting the tendency of human nature to occasionally slip in a guilt-free secret or two into one's life. 
  Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing is my first Shakespeare play, read or studied, and by no means was I disappointed. I enjoyed the humor, mistaken identities, and sense of foolishness for love. Shakespeare's comedy although written several years ago still proves relevant to today. His use of love and the crazy things people will to find it, and once found keep it, will always prove a timeless message.  Shakespeare mainly communicates how foolish and deliberate people act when they find themselves in love. The title also elaborates on the fact that people spend entirely too much time worrying about nothing. The characters become enthralled in the present and ignore the future and reality of their circumstances. Many of the characters also develop a sense of selfishness when asked to choose themselves or any one else. Later in the story we see Benedick choose love over himself as his characters changes and softens through his own confused heart. The character Don John tries to stir up trouble between the soon to be married Claudio and Hero. Through a cleverly thought out mistaken identity the infatuated pair soon dwindle to a public disgrace, only to be found innocent in the end. After this action has occurred Beatrice tells Benedick that she would like to see his friend Claudio dead for what he has done to her cousin. Benedick chooses the women he loves over the friend he knows. Although Benedick does not kill Claudio he still has made this agreement in his heart to betray him. Another amusing aspect of the play was the constant changing relationship between Beatrice and Benedick. We first find them deeply involved in their continuous war of words. Soon these two bickering characters find a love through the fight and through the constant misunderstanding these characters display a hopeful love for one another. However, the reader is left questioning whether or not this love is true. One of my favorite scenes takes place in the orchard when Claudio, Don Pedro, and Leonato plan to trick the attentively listening Benedick. Knowing that he is only feet away, behind the bushes, Shakespeare's writing pokes fun at his feelings and future desires of Beatrice. I love the humor and the way that their one conversation alters Benedick's choices. An important comic relief character would be Dogsberry and his trusty assistant Verges. The usage of malapropism adds a humor to the story and it's message unable to be matched by any other character.  Shakespeare was making a point with the characters of this story by illustrating their obsession with the hear and the now instead of looking at the grand picture of their situations. He was showing his readers not to take life or your relationships too seriously. Another aspect of this play that posed a point and went equally along with the previous lesson was the crazy things people do for love. The characters in this story often would just pick up and do anything for the person they felt they loved., and on the flip side would just as quickly forget that person. An example of these actions was when Claudio and Hero had their misunderstanding Claudio shamed her in front of their town for what he had understood to be betrayal. The immediacy of actions and urgency of reason all to often compromised the characters and their emotions.  Much Ado About Nothing was a refreshing comedy with a light, but also significant meaning. Shakespeare truly captures the mind of humans seeking love in a crazy world. The play proves relevant and although the language may be different the story is not unlike our society today. I would absolutely recommend this play to anyone looking to watch a humorous love story unfold before them. I very much enjoyed the reading as Shakespeare cleverly envelops his reader into a story of crazy characters and their crazier reactions to love and misunderstandings. I had so much fun watching this play performed and seeing the genius unfold that Shakespeare had intended for us all to see. This play will not soon nor easily be forgotten by generations to come. I'm so happy to have opened its cover and now hold it on my bookshelf. 
 this is easily the best  vedic astrology book.those who want to engage  themselves in the study of this discipline will want to own this book. it opens the door to india's rich spiritual heritage 
 Not as good as her first book but has some good advise on cortisol control a real issue with both men and women. Especially women starting or going through menopause. I have been a Pharmacist for 30 years. I have seen many diets come and go, and Suzanne recommendation are was I teach my customers every day. Well worth buying. I have purchased 20 book to lend out to my customers so they can learn about themselves 
 I love birds. I love to know what kind of bird I am looking at! This book's only flaw is that it expects you to understand body shapes of birds. Still, you can't get by in the field without a guide and Peterson's is one of the best. Its size makes it perfect to stick in a backpack next to your binoculars or ride on the floor of your car which is where mine is quite often 
 I have operated a successful business for twenty years and have purchased a countless number of books on sales and marketing topics and must admit that this is the first time that I have ever been compelled to comment on a book. This is HANDS DOWN THE BEST MARKETING BOOK AVAILABLE, PERIOD! If you are looking for fast, easy, and inexpensive ways to sell more then I highly recommend that you get this book 
 This album,(along with "Black Woman and Child")is to me the best work Sizzla has done to date.By now, no true fan would be without this  album,however,for the new-comer it's definitely THE PLACE TO START.The rhythms are infectious,the lyrics positive and hard-hitting.BUY IT ! 
 I've got "Tuesdays with Mirror" as a gift from my ex-boss when I quited from the previous job.  Now I do want to thank you her.  It's such a wonderful gift.  Actually, I'm a kind of person who doesn't normally read a kind of book like this but when the first time I read it, I could hardly put it down.  Morrie got me as like he got Mitch.  While I was reading, I was curious what will happen in the end and  questioned to myself if there was a man kind like this in the World!!  Yes, there was.  Here he is.  Morrie is sweet, gentle, nice and worm.  That's the way I felt from the book.  His words are so simplicity and do touch my heart.  I wish, for the rest of my life, I could live and see the world like him just some of his parts!!  Thank you Morrie & Mitch for a wonderful thesis and thank you again, Mitch, for letting us touch his soul and know this wonderful old man, Morrie Schwartz 
 I'll admit that I only read this so that I could honestly tell people I've read it. And yet it was extraordinary, the greatest novel I've ever read. As the spotlight reviewer says, it's long because it covers everything. Tolstoy surprises, reassures, and consumes at the turn of every page. He knows me. He knows my life. He knows how I will turn out and how my life will turn out. His characters are all so alive and realistic that when a knock on the door interrupts my reading and I go to answer it, I expect Prince Andrei standing on the other side. You'd think that it would be hard to get into the head of a Russian cavalry lieutenant from two centuries ago - the equivalent of my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather - via the imagination of a Russian aristocrat who is the equivalent of my great-great-great-grandfather. But no. Tolstoy makes them feel like my friends. He describes war as the utterly confused and perpetually unjust mess that it must surely be (like the WWI poets), and covers so many other themes that it would take a work almost as long as W&P to do them any justice.  Especially when taken with Anna Karenina, which is almost as impressive and somewhat more coherent as a single story, Tolstoy seems more like the omniscient god of mankind's imagination to me than any religious "God" does. Bravo.  PS: The Oxford World Classic edition is great. The translation by Aylmer and Louise Maude was approved by Tolstoy himself and is never stilted - it hasn't even aged greatly. There are a handful of helpful maps, a list of characters, and a timeline. The typeface is easy to read and by no means small. The inner margin is wide, meaning that the words never run too close into the spine, which is itself quite strong. The endnotes are helpful and thankfully referenced by page number, thus not being difficult to find, unlike the accursed numbers-arranged-by-chapter format. The only drawback is the weight: one-handed reading will be uncomfortable for some, but on the whole I think the ever-so-slightly heavier paper will be appreciated. The price is certainly a bonus. For the record, this is the only classic which I bought and read straight away, right the way through on the first go 
 Instead of spending a lot of money on square footage and being unsatisfyed with the end result, Susanka asks for people to look at how they actually USE their houses, and to design them for the lives they live- which increases the cost per square foot, but gives you some stunningly beautiful homes, that LOOK like places you want to live.  Instead of creating a seperate dining room, why not do a bump-out and create a breakfast nook, if the only time you use your dining room is for breakfast? If, every time you entertain, your parlor is empty and the party happens in the kitchen, get rid of the parlor and put some seating and entertaining space in your kitchen!  The built-in bookshelves in this book are absolutley wonderful.  Yes, these small, thoughtful features cost more than a standard box house, but if you take these principles when you build your own house, with a little craftiness and access to Home Depot you can probably incorporate a lot of the nifty small touches into your own home, and make it feel more like a home and less like a mass-produced, soulless box you happen to live in 
 As a mother of two sons and remarried...going through the big time ups and downs of blending families, this book was the best so far in identifying the problems, concerns and conflicts in blending families and, also, for realistic suggestions on coping and living through these tough times and hopefully developing a comfortable living situation

 Simone,Simone,Simone. Whenever someone asked me "did you read Sartre?" ,I usually intend to say "yes,lots of books of him ".but actually other than 1-2 books,I heard Sartre a lot from Simone.Anyway,I read this book 10 years ago probably,and as for the other books of her I enjoyed much.It is about the death of her mother.I remembered that in one part of the book ,her mother wanted to hear that Simone becomes religous,but Simone still defended her believes about being a nonreligous woman,eventhough her mother was dying.I really like that ,because no matter what ,she was always behind her ideas,believes,feelings.She was a strong woman.She was smart.I do not admire people,but if I would, I would admire to her.I remember a saying of her which I want to be :"Being a woman,who thinks like a man,and who feels like a woman".In short,in this book you can see her strength as an independent woman again.Enjoy her ,and start to think independtly.Thanks to my dad  for putting Simone's books in his library so that I could discover it. 
 This is a great recording for track no. 1. Kleiber seems to lose focus after that.. the beautiful melodic counterpoint of the second melody is mushed out. the fugue in the third movement simply sprawls about. I don't see what the hype is all about when you have Wilhelm Furtwangler's wartime fifths. Kleiber's recording can't be compared to these far more superior outings. 
 This movie is by far among the greatest legal thrillers I've seen, not only because the writing and directing are superb, but James Woods' acting performance is nothing short of spectacular. The variations he projects in his character expressions--with so many subtle nuances--make him 100% believable and fetching as that character. And when his sense of right is piqued, he explodes in the most compelling, absorbing, credible way--one which just pulls you another foot deeper into the story, kind of the way quicksand pulls you in: you just can't get out, nor do you want to.   In this story, the Woods character is fighting not only for an innocent man's life, a prisoner doing time, but even more important, he's fighting for his own life--his sense of self-respect, honor, and decency, none of which he feels in his earlier law practice while defending and acquitting sleazeballs whom he knows should be in prison instead wrecking society with their crimes.   I watched this movie a second time the night after I watched it the first time and got even more out of it. Buy it and keep it. It's far batter than most of the John Grisham legal thriller movies.   No question about it: James Woods is one of the most underrated actors today. He performed almost equally as well in "Indightment" the McMartin child abuse case.  I've omitted talking about the plot because you can obtain that from many of the below reviewers 
 Indside, some of the most exultant photographic portraits to be found from the late Victorian period. Contained here, brief bios of family, friends, and acquaintances, who became the inspiration for the work of Proust. The book is bound and printed beautifully. The details of the clothing and accessories are well worth the price of this book. 
 Mugen is a cocky, rebellious, bandy-legged fighter who incorporates break-dancing techniques into his unorthodox fighting style. Jin is more your typically calm and stoic samurai (or ronin, to be more precise), steeped in martial tradition, who finds satisfaction in the perfect execution of his warrior craft. Mugen and Jin aren't friends - in fact, they are contentious and want to test their skills against each other - yet they find themselves joining forces, thanks to Fuu, an insistent and kinda quirky waitress who inveigles the two into helping her search for the Samurai Who Smells Like Sunflowers. For 26 episodes, the discordant trio undergo many adventures, some serious, some hilarious, some just plain out weird. The only constants are the bickerings amongst the three, the scrounging for food, and the intrusion of modern day sensibilities. Oh, and the rampant butt kicking as done by Mugen and Jin.  On the heels of his popular Cowboy Bebop anime series, Shinichiro Watanabe decided to put a new spin on the samurai anime with his irreverent, hip Samurai Shamploo. Shamploo means "stir fry" or a mix, and this is certainly what this series is about, as it fuses the traditional samurai credo and decorum with the unexpected modern day incursions of hip hop attitudes, beatboxing, street tagging, and baseball. The episodes are supported by cool Japanese hip hop music soundtracks and blazing hip hop scratches for scene segues. Watanabe also makes beautiful use of visual metaphors, thereby adding more depth to the shenanigans. The ripping animation and dynamically constructed fight scenes are guaranteed not to disappoint.  Kudos, too, to the voice actors, especially Steven Jay Blum (aka Daniel Andrews, who also voiced Cowboy Bebop's Spike) as the bestial Mugen. Kirk Thornton as Jin and Kari Wahlgren as Fuu are both excellent. The voice actor for the sometimes series narrator Policeman Sakami Manzou ("the Saw") is also very good.  These episodes are definitely rated PG-13. This anime series doesn't hesitate to throw in scenes of drug use and graphic violence. Some episodes even contain mild sexual scenes.  My favorite episodes are "The Art of Altercation" (for the rapping samurai and his beatbox backup), the atmospheric "Cosmic Collisions" (where the trio fight the undead), the hilarious "Baseball Blues" (where the American pitcher couldn't find the strike zone with the dog at bat, and he ends up inadvertently hitting the mutt - not to worry, no animated dogs were hurt in the making of this anime), and the concluding 3-episode arc "Evanescent Encounter" (where Mugen and Jin are challenged to their very limits, resolve their rivalry, and Fuu at last catches up to the Sunflower Samurai).  Here are the 26 episodes (American titles first, with the original Japanese titles in parenthesis):  "Tempestuous Temperaments" ("Storm and Stress") Episode 1 "Redeye Reprisal"  ("Veritable Pandemonium") Episode 2   "Hellhounds for Hire" Parts One & Two ("Tacit Understanding") Episode 3-4  "Artistic Anarchy" ("Utter Indifference") Episode 5  "Stranger Searching" ("RedHeaded Foreigner") Episode 6  "A Risky Racket" ("Surrounded on All Sides") Episode 7  "The Art of Altercation" ("Self-Conceit") Episode 8  "Beatbox Bandits" ("Evil Spirits") Episode 9   "Lethal Lunacy" ("Fighting Fire with Fire") Episode 10 "Gamblers and Gallantry" ("Fallen Angels") Episode 11 "The Disorder Diaries" ("Learning from the Past") Episode 12  "Misguided Miscreants" Parts One & Two ("Dark Night's Road") Episode 13-14  "Bogus Booty" ("Through and Through") Episode 15  "Lullabies of the Lost" Verses One & Two ("Idling One's Life Away") Episode 16-17  "War of the Words" ("Pen in One Hand, Sword in the Other") Episode 18  "Unholy Union" ("Karma and Retribution") Episode 19  "Elegy of Entrapment" Verses One & Two ("Generous Elegy") Episode 20-21  "Cosmic Collisions" ("Anger Shot Toward Heaven") Episode 22  "Baseball Blues" ("Heart and Soul into the Ball") Episode 23  "Evanescent Encounter" Parts One - Three ("Circle of Transmigration") Episode 24-26    
 It is difficult to believe that this one time socially challenged underdog has become one helluva wicked wicka.  But that is what we get here.  Having seen the episode on TV, I was able to picture her every move.  Even more so, Navarro depicts a Willow mindset that we only saw physically on TV.  This is a must have for any Buffy fan.

 This lovely book shares the wisdom of a teacher of silent meditation and Dharma Dialogues on awakened awareness. It is truly food for the soul.  Catherine Ingram describes her personal experiences in seeking and finding peace in the Now. While mindfulness meditation was a major path, a spiritual teacher catalyzed major shifts in her consciousness. Ingram now teaches mindfulness, through silence, through shared lessons, and (even through the pages of this book) through her personal centeredness.  Seven topics are highlighted: Silence, Tenderness, Embodiment, Genuineness, Discernment, Delight and Wonder. Each is illustrated with lovely stories of Ingram and other seekers on the Path.  Particularly helpful for healing are suggestions for acknowledging the presence of an inner observer who is detached even in the midst of crisis and suffering; for treasuring each present moment rather than living in the past or future; and for accepting that we need not torture ourselves with guilt and remorse because each of us has a lifetime of lessons to learn - and each experience offers us opportunities to develop deeper compassion for others who have their own lessons and make mistakes that may impact negatively on us. We can fester in negative reactions to life that is past or in our anxieties about our future life - or we might just let go of the negativity and move on to the ever-present Now.  I was surprised to discover this book was immediately helpful in finding a stronger connection with my own center of quiet awareness.  There is also a pleasant current of practical advice.  I warmly recommend this book for a good read and re-read. 
 This was good enough to read during one prolonged session in the bathtub.  Oops!  That says more about me than it does about the book.  I have been enchanted with all the "Cat Who..."  books that I've read, as they are reliably wholesome and fun.  I don't know why I passed Lilian Jackson Braun's books by for so long, but I am trying to make up for lost time by savoring another one each week.  Braun's clever protagonist, James Qwilleran, embodies the fantasy of inheriting billions, yet staying grounded enough to continue a newspaper career and enjoy small town life.  Although Qwill doesn't travel far, his escapades read like a gastronomic travelogue.   "The Cat Who Smelled a Rat" isn't a great classical work, but I have to give it the highest rating because it meets my 5-star criteria of "I wish I'd written that"

A superb reference or instructional text especially for students (and also for professionals or even non-specialist general readers seeking to brush up their understanding), Alcamo's Fundamentals Of Microbiology is a vital and welcome contribution to Biological Studies reference shelves 
 After the release of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith in theaters we got Lego Star Wars; a game that was a lot of fun to play simply because it emulated the movies rather well with all the characters being made entirely from Legos. Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy is even better for the simple fact of nostalgia. Any Star Wars fan will enjoy this.  You'll begin the game in the Cantina in Mos Eisley. This is the hub, and from there you can go into any of the three episodes and play through them. At the start you'll only be able to choose A New Hope, but after completing the first chapter, you can choose The Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. As you go through the three episodes you'll some of the most memorable moments of the movies acted out entirely with legos. These moments aren't only memorable, but they're given a hilarious charm. These moments are also from the actual original versions of the movies as well. In other words, Han Solo DOES shoot first.  The game is visually striking. Seeing your favorite characters from the original Star Wars films as legos is quite a treat. Not only do you get to have nostalgia with Star Wars, but with legos as well. Even better are the hilarious antics of most of the scenes. To benefit the nostalgia even more is how John Williams' classic score accompanies each and every level of the game. For a Star Wars fan this game is the ultimate nostalgia.  As you play through each of the classic episodes, you'll be in control of several characters. Not all at once, but you'll end up having to switch. At times you may only have two characters, at others there may be as many as seven in your party at once. Your characters, depending on who they are, also have their own unique skills they can use. Jedi for example, can double jump and use the force. Those who wield blasters have a grappling hook that allows them to ascend to accessible platforms. The droids can open up special doors for you. Other characters, like the Jawas and Ewoks will be able to go into vents and access areas the other characters can't. In all actuality, they're really no different than their counterparts in the original Lego Star Wars. Also like the original Lego Star Wars, you'll constantly have to switch between characters in order to get through each and every area. You'll have to switch to R2-D2 to open up a door, for example. More than one person can play at a time, which is also really cool. You can also beat up your allies if you wish, and they respawn instantly. The gameplay isn't completely the same, though, there have been some small tweaks made here and there.  The additions to the gameplay aren't huge, but they are welcome. As you progress through levels all your characters may be able to assemble certain materials together to form a droid to help them fight. In the original Lego Star Wars this ability was only given to the Jedi, but here everyone can do it. There are also moments when you'll have to dress up as a stormtrooper in order to gain access through certain doors. You'll also be given the chance at some point to dress up as a bounty hunter and you'll be able to use Thermal Detonators. Characters also have their own unique abilities. Chewie, for example, can rip a stormtroopers arms right out of his sockets. All of these are welcome additions, and that's not even all there is to the gameplay. From time to time you'll be in command of vehicles. Landspeeders, the Millennium Falcon, the X-Wing and more as you take on some of the more memorable moments from the film, like destroying the death star.  It will probably only take you five hours at the very least to complete the story mode of all three episodes. However, Lego Star Wars II is full of extras. Each time you dispatch an enemy, whether it be in story mode or not, you'll earn money. You can also destroy certain objects and obtain money. You can use the money you gain to purchase cheats and hidden characters. Each time you get a new character they'll walk around in the hub, and you can switch to them. "Purchasing" characters isn't the only way to get them. You could easily just use one in story mode and you've got him or her. You'll also get hidden characters if you've got save data from the original Lego Star Wars. Just unlocking all the characters takes a lot of time.  The importance of unlocking characters is so you can play through certain aspects of the free play mode. There are places that in story mode the default characters couldn't reach. These hidden characters might be able to reach it, though, and so you will find yourself playing through levels again. The good news is these levels are so much fun that playing through a second, third or even fourth time is no hassle at all.  Free mode also offers a way for you to customize what a character looks like. You could put Yoda's head on Luke Skywalker's body, for example. This is mostly just a lot of fun to mess around with. Some combinations are just all out crazy. You could, for example, put Chewbacca's head on Leia's body from when she's wearing the slave outfit in Return of the Jedi. This really doesn't do a whole lot for the gameplay as a whole, but it is quite fun to mess around with, and the combinations are endless.  The only real problem with this game that I can really think of is that there is little, if any, challenge at all. Each time you die you respawn right where you left off and you have infinite lives. There's really no such thing as a game over. If you die the only penalty is that you lose money. However, the sheer fun factor of the game is enough to do away with that, and still makes Lego Star Wars II a treat.  Lego Star Wars II surpasses the original in just about everyway. It's a Star Wars game for the classic trilogy done with instant perfection. If you love the original Star Wars movies, you'll definitely want this game.  On the positive side +Based off the original theatrical versions and not the special editions +Beautiful game +Addictive gameplay +Co-op mode +Several extras and hidden characters +Customizable characters +Tons of replay value  On the negative side -The story mode is quite short -While not really much of a con for this game, it's got very little challeng

 Isham's score for ARRTI is almost as good as the novella itself, so  well done in fact that my wife and I asked a friend to arrange the title theme for guitars as our wedding processional a decade ago. I bought the CD within days of first seeing the film and have doubtlessly played it through well over 1,000 times...it's the most played recording I own, and I likely have in excess of 4,000 albums/discs on hand.  The score does for the movie what Redford hoped the movie would do for the book-- it takes it to another level, provides a synergy that yields more than the sum of the parts 
 Short, pithy, collected quotes from a wide variety of writers, thinkers, and even musicians on Mozart.  Easy to read, useful for collecting impressions from a wide range of authors.  As an amatuer musician, I know it is true--Mozart is too easy for beginners, too hard for professionals.  Should inspire casual readers to seek out other works on his life 
 It seems with every CD of Lee Lessack's I buy, I fall more in love with his man.....his voice is at times unexplainable...his vocal range is astounding, you can hear the passion of love in his voice when he sings!  I highly recommend this CD among the countless others I cannot seem to stop playing!!!!!  Lee Lessack is the voice of this century and beyond!  To have this man's voice playing through your home is like living every day in a dream!....you will always have a never ending smile on your face, and you may catch yourself just singing and dancing a little more than you are used too!    I will say his rendition of "Out of This World"...is amazing!  But don't stop with this CD....get all of them...I DID!  Lee Lessack...Truly "Too Marvelous For Words" in more ways than one!  I hope this review prompts you to click on "Shopping Cart" now! 
 Long thought to have been only a pie throwing clown, (which he was NOT) Buster Keaton was and still is one of the great comics. In this book, he relates his early years as part of the stage act, THE THREE KEATONS. It's a miracle that he didn't suffer permanent damage the way his father tossed him about. The insights into life in vaudville and his comments about his father are worth a closer look. From there, Buster tells how he got into films, his friendship with Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle and his rise to fame. I was disappointed that he mentioned his masterpiece; THE GENERAL only in passing. This is a CLASSIC! It might have been a financial failure, but in terms of quality, it reigns supreme. Far better than Chaplin's works. But there is still much to hold the reader's interest, especially the era of the "talkies". Pairing Buster with Jimmie Durante was a disaster in my opinion, but Keaton holds no malice towards him. Buster's career took a dive during the forties, but he managed to stay afloat as a comedy writer. And, Keaton is honest about his drinking and his failed marriages. Let it be said that Buster is still a hard act to follow 
 This was a really great book-It really affects you and youaredrawn completely into it. It made me sad, because I felt everythingthat JP felt, even though my life isn't anything like his. I was a little disappointed in the ending, maybe because it was the end of a really good book, and maybe because it needed to be wrapped up more. There still are some things I wondered about. But the book gave me a lot to think about. I'm really glad I read this book, and I recommend it 
 This recording is one of the truly indispensable collections of steel string guitar compositions. Out of the Takoma stable, Peter Lang plays with the stunning clarity and dexterity of Kottke, and the bluesy dissonance of Fahey; yet he creates a sound world that is uniquely Peter Lang.                    Right from the swift, bright opening of SNOW TOAD this is playing of real authority. There are some fine compositions here. Lang has his own stories to tell. LAST DAYS AT THE LODGE is a tender, reflective theme. YOUNG MAN LOOK AT YOUR SHOES is a sheer delight, and FUTURE SHOT AT THE RAINBOW is a perfect example of how Lang combines technique with compositional skill to produce works that are satisfying, thoughtful, joyful, and thoroughly unforgettable. Hear, too, the lovely BITUMINOUS NIGHTMARE.             It is sad that such a talent has been so little recorded. Then again, it is difficult to see how Peter Lang could have bettered this. This reissue offers three extra tracks, which makes it all the more welcome. And they are no mere fillers; FLAMES ALONG THE MONONGAHELA  is a real gem.                 Anyone who likes guitar music (or thinks they don't) should own this beautiful record. It is emphatically not just another slice of finger picking wizardry.Its purpose lies deeper than that, and its appeal is more lasting. I have loved this record for nearly 30 (oh my god!!!!!) years, and I keep coming back to it like a trusted friend 
 I could not put this book down.  I think it is easy to relate to if you've ever had a female boss you didn't like.  Can't wait to read it again 
 I liked "The Eye 2" a lot although it's a bit different in many ways. First it's not a direct sequel of "The Eye", but rather variations on the same theme. And though it's also made by Pang brothers it still differs. They are two absolutely distinct films and probably it would have been better to give the second part a new title. It's also different because the film seemed pretty Americanized to me. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but "The Eye 2" is done very professionally, very Hollywood-like hence losing much of the charm asian horror movies possess - viscosity, slow-pacing, hypnotizing atmosphere and thoughtfulness. No, don't think it totally reminds American remakes of Asian horrors, "The Eye 2" still has this Oriental style and a bunch of thrills everyone is expecting. It's just a little bit different, a little more polished and lustrous.   Joey's (brilliant acting from a Taiwanese actress Qi Shu whom you could notice in "The Transporter") suicide attempt fails then she gets pregnant and starts seeing dead people. Yes, I know, that's an old story, but what matters are the details. Obviously there's some reason ghosts try to communicate with her and for hour and a half she's going to try to find out why. Surely the truth will be surprising and unsuspected.  Actually the first part was scarier to my opinion (just recall the elevator scene or the calligraphy scene), but "The Eye 2" also manages to scare and what's important - when least expected. There were specifically two scenes that made me jump on my chair - very gruesome and extremely unexpected. There were a lot more as frightening but generally in the tradition of Asian horror films - long black hair, strange moving etc. And I have to say some of the special effects will stay with you for a long time. "The Eye 2" certainly deserves wide audiences - it's pretty comprehensible for people who are not very familiar with Hong Kong horror movies (I say Hong Kong for Pang brothers are Chinese albeit the movie was also shot in Thailand and Singapore) and those who are will find a lot of chills they intend to find. Only I wouldn't recommend this movie for pregnant ladies - you need to keep yourself and your baby in a good mood! And since "The Eye 2" deals with pregnancy - it would be better to keep away from it for a while.   And speaking of Americanizing - Pang brothers have moved to Hollywood already where next year they ought to release a horror movie "The Messengers" and also a remake of their own "Bangkok Dangerous" that will be called "Time to Kill". Speaking frankly Hollywood killed many good directors from Europe, Asia and, say, New Zealand. I hope Pang brothers will stand and keep their style not falling into mediocrity. 
 For us, "The End of Suffering: Fearless Living in Troubled Times", is a book that unifies the greatest insights of the realms of quantum physics and the greater mystical teachings of the East. In these troubled times, when the synthetic self dominates the false image of society a new lotus of spiritual-scientific wisdom emerges from the muddy depths of the confused web of hyper-specialized reality. Nagarjuna talks to us of the middle way, which takes us into hyper-spatial/temporal realities where we learn to bring the rest of the greater 'Love' story into the sciences. If we as humanity are going to become the embryo gods the ancient scriptures talk about - the three jeweled lotus, then we need to understand the key concepts this book is saying. Which is that we are all interconnected and that our state of 'mind' plays a greater role than we where lead to believe. In the current super information age, universities and other educational organizationsare asking the question where to next? This book certainly does give a beautiful flow plan for new models of how our education and ultimately humanity must go, if we are to create a future of hope. For through the practical secrets of little gems in this book there shines now for us a hope for our future 
         Starting "The Corrections" I thought (wrongly) that it is Franzen's debut novel and I was wondering if the style can be similar to Dave Eggers' debut "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius" (which I did not particularly like) - probably because I heard about both these books at the same time and read Eggers first, which was a mistake, because I was prejudiced towards Franzen before reading "The Corrections". 	The common denominatives of both novels are: the very general subject - contemporary family life, and relatively young author. Except that, they differ virtually in everything. Franzen writes about average family, even painfully normal, whose problems it is easy to identify with. Eggers describes an exceptional situation, his book is in fact a very exhibitionist memoir, satirical in concept. 	As I found our, "The Corrections" is Franzen's third novel (after "The Twenty-Seventh City" (1988) and "Strong Motion" (1992)) and rather a different one. The first two novels were characterized by the fast, very thoughtfully invented plot. "The Corrections" show various shades of feelings in one traditional American family, which despite the "good" lives of all its members, failed as a whole. 	The main characters in "The Corrections" are three grown up children - Gary, Denise and Chip, and their parents - Enid and Alfred. The plot is very simple, and definitely cannot be called dynamic or fast flowing. In fact, very little is going on in the present, there are mostly retrospectives from the lives of all family members. 	The whole plot can be reduced to Enid's frantic efforts to bring the scattered family together for Christmas, maybe for the last time, as Alfred is fast deteriorating in the grip of Parkinson's disease. The effort is (partially, as we see at the end) successful (or maybe success is a failure in this case?). But before Chrismas, all the children, considering the invitation, are pondering on the meaning of life. The parents too, although the author concentrates rather on the children, and here lies the main strength of this novel. Each family member had their share of success in life, but none of them are completely happy or satisfied - and cannot be. The readers may ask the characters' questions himself: are they happy with their life, even doing whatever they always wanted to do and all their plans were successful; can anything be changed? Or should it be? What does the family mean? 	The subject seems to be banal and exploited enough, but Franzen's prose is erudite and light, so that despite a relatively complex form, it is easy to read. The novel is full of humor, but at the same time serious in the key issues. The only weaker point is Chip's involvement in Lithuanian political scandals... This is also the only thing opposite to Franzen's motto "to write about a society, one must join it" (famous, controversial "Harper's" essay from 1996, where the writer analyzed the state and future of American novel). The Lithuanian events are completely unrealistic and unbelievable. 	Franzen admits in the interviews (for example in "Esquire") that during the writing of "The Corrections" he used and processed his own family experience. His father had Alzheimer's disease, what the writer also described in one of his articles for "The New Yorker" (where he is a regular contributor). Jonathan was also the youngest of three siblings, and each of them had a strong personality, so there was constant tension in the family. 	I liked this novel, perhaps for the personal touch and depth, despite the joking tone. It is very well balanced 
 I think this is one os Shakespeare's most underrated plays, probably because of all the uncouth characters.  Based on Chaucer's rendition of the story, T and C are Trojan lovers, and she is then traded to the Greeks in exchange for captive soldiers.  Aside from this, the women of Troy are wanton and lustful, and the men are prowess driven.  If you can deal with this, you will really enjoy Shakespeare's ability to wrap this into all kinds of twists and turns. It delivers a mixture of satire, comedy, romance, tragedy, and a semi-historical (in that people at the time probably believed the Trojan War really happened).  Interestingly, this mixture of laughs and tragedy is reminiscent of war novels I have read about Vietnam.  The romantic dimensions give this play its edge, and somehow WS manages to make it plausible in spite of all the killing and deceit going on at the same time 
 Released in 1976 after the enormously successful Physical Graffiti, it is no surprise that Presence would struggle to meet the praise of it's legendary predecessor.  Closed minds and ears are to blame for Presence's status as an 'average' album; there are some who agree that Presence is very underated, I am one of them.  However, unlike those diehards who say "an average Led Zeppelin album is another artists best", I believe that Presence is by far Led Zeppelin's best album. Some of you are thinking: "Is this guy high or what?" let me say a few things in my defense: a)I went through rehab three years ago, so I take offense to such a comment and you hurt my feelings with your thought  b)I take that back, I am high....ON LIFE! c)an album's greatness is not determined by how much it sells or how many people say it is great and if the critics give it good ratings.  Do You have any idea what Rolling Stone magazine gave Led Zeppelin's first album when it first came out? 3/5 chance they slandered it, just like every other great band! Greatness should be determined not by status, but by the music itself: the sound, the energy, the chemistry, and the focus put in it.  This album is kind of like Fair Warning by Van Halen, didn't sell as much as all of the albums before it but the overall musical output is just that much better, because they didn't make music just to make sales, they made it because they loved it, they cherished it, and couldn't stand to stop making the music; they made music for music's sake.  The main reason I like this album more than the other studio Led Zeppelin albums is simple, because it is louder and doesn't have the weird 'variety' sound found on other Zeppelin albums.  THis is the way Led Zeppelin was meant to be heard, not as folk music acoustic playing junkies who rip off Willie Dixon covers!  Heavy rock is the arena that is Led Zeppelin sound, not weird Middle Eastern sounding harps playing in the background.  Also, there are no acoustic tracks (thank goodness, if I heard one more Led Zeppelin album with two or more acoustic tracks, I would bludgeon myself with a bedpan!) and keyboards (which would return in extremely heavy use on their next album "In Through the Outdoor")  Track Listing: 1.Achilles Last Stand (10:22): A fast paced epic opens up the album with some of the most amazing classic rock riffs I ever heard.  I think this is the same riff that Jake E Lee would use in "Bark at the Moon", only much faster and alot more chord changes.  I don't understand a single word that Robert Plant says, so I have no idea what it is about, BUT IT JUMPS OVER "STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN" AND "KASHMIR"!  Even Jimmy Page himself has stated that "Achilles Last Stand" is his favorite Led Zeppelin song. 2.For Your Life (6:20): Another hard rocker track, kind of sounds a little too much like a Who song; but I can actually understand what Plant is saying in this song as opposed to the prementioned track.  It is about getting rid of addiction in exchange "For Your Life". 3.Royal Orleans (2:58): The usual short track from Zeppelin that seems longer than it really is!  Sounds like the name of a hotel, the only real notable sound in this song is John Bonham's drumming. 4.Nobody's Fault but Mine (6:27): Once again Jimmy Page is too lazy to give credit where credit is due.  Originally a Blind Willie Johnson song, although it is only listed as having been written by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.  And people wonder why I don't praise the crap out of Led Zeppelin!  I am a little disappointed that Led Zeppelin had to put a cover song on here, but it was a pretty good one, just ticked off that Page was too high to note his sources. 5.Candy Store Rock (4:07):Lyrics sound raunchy and so does the overall sound, reminds me of early Ted Nugent. 6.Hot on For Nowhere (4:43):I Don't remember exactly how this song goes, but it was pretty good.  Had a funk element that rocked, and had some of the same raunchy lyrics as "Candy Store Rock". 7.Tea for One (9:27):A return back to the blues element, another classic epic.  Amazing how they made a better album when they were rushed.  Robert Plant was injured during this time too, which is even more impressive (although it was just his leg) 
 Book is geared towards kids - not too complicated. But at the same time a comprehensive and informative read. I  enjoyed reading it as a parent.     The book includes The history of money, how coins are made,  History of American coins, collecting basics, and care of  the collection 
 I love this book. It is one of the best books I have ever read. Eric and Leslie are amazing authors. All of their books are excellent! All are must reads for everyone, but especially for young people and singles. Their story will touch your life. They are funny, real, encouraging, convicting, and inspiring writers. READ THIS BOOK 
 One of the best business CDs I have listened to.  The four disciplines are presented in a very accessible way, with many examples.  I found myself making many mental notes of actions to take on a personal level and with my team 
 After the Adventures in the Screen Trade many years ago, I had to sink my eyes in this second adventure.  I must admit to being a Goldman fan.  It was a hard volume to put down.  I went from cover to cover in a couple of days.  Back again a few more times.  I laughed so many times I felt dizzy.  Kinda got a buzz!  Good reads are supposed to do that to you!  Goldman's read is cool!  It's heavy with experience!  He's crossed a lot of bridges, built some, and burned some too!  This one is a Do Not Miss read too.  As usual, no butt kissing here!  He tells it like it is, not how it should be!  An E-ride ticket to how things are in Dreamland.  Hey, Goldman!  We're waiting for the next Adventure 
 Christopher Marlowe is a genius.  This thorough, Oxfordiancompilation of his best known plays contains Tamburlaine the Great parts one and two, the Tragical History of Doctor Faustus in its original A-text and its later B-text, The Jew of Malta, and Edward II. The beauty of these dramas lies in the fact that they're short but powerful reading pieces.  In five acts Marlowe was able to generate a story complete with action, classical allusions, and a bawdy humor one might not expect from otherwise generally classified stuffy English Renaissance drama.  This book contains an exhaustive introduction that explains many details of the publication dates of the plays and the differences between versions (Faustus).  It also contains a thorough section for notes that further explain the texts.  Finally, it contains a glossary of the commonly used words from the texts.  The bottom line?  This book is a great read--it's funny (I can't begin to stress that enough), and you will appreciate Marlowe's wit and talent just as much as William Shakespeare did.  Buy it today 
 This is an excellent guide for all creative individuals, which really includes all of us, even those who don't think we are creative. I am a writer and it's because of this book that I can say that.   It is helping me figure out why I stop writing, why I have doubts, why I need to nurture my creativity.  The book contains spiritual philosophy that would not offend any religious order. It guides the writer (photographer, painter, glass blower, quiltmaker,whatever form in which your creativity is expressed), in practical exercises that get you moving, thinking, understanding, and practicing your art.  My dream has not only been re-awakened, it has been resurrected. 
 I'm 59 years old and somehow I missed Albert Collins and that I regret.  I recently heard an Albert Collins song on KCUV, a Denver radio station and I couldn't believe my ears.   I had to have some of his music.  What a great blues guitarist and "Ice Pickin" is a superb CD.  If you decide to get some Collins, get "Ice Pickin" for sure then get some more.  You won't be disappointed 
 Michael Jackson has sacrificed his liver so that others might know what beers are around!  This book covers just about every major beer there is. The only complaint I have is that I cannot taste them all. It covers the history of beer, different types of beers, different beer making techniques (you will be amazed!), in short - it covers everything about beer!  It has chapters on different beers, and different regions. Obviously, the chapters on Belgium, the UK, and Chech Republic are "must reads". In a very nice and generous touch, he also tells us about US microbreweries, that produces surprisingly potable products. We now live in Alaska, end enjoy the some of the local produce from the Alaska and Silver Gulch breweries. The book is a little bit to big to bring on the travel, but I think he has also written a pocket guide 
 "Decline and Fall" is the ninth book by Evelyn Waugh that I have read.  There were times, during these nine books, when I wondered what the heck I was reading and why.  Waugh's style of writing makes his books enjoyable to read but I don't always come away clear on what it was that he wrote.  He's the sort of author that can make you feel like you've just read a powerful drama only to discover how the critics loved the book's hilarious satire.  In the case of "Decline and Fall", I kept looking for a theme to the book; a reason that the author would have written it.  I confess to laughing at time at the many satirical passages and the impossible situations that his characters fall into.  Still, I kept thinking I was ambling down a directionless path.  In time I was able to satisfy my need for a theme.  I came to understand "Decline and Fall" as a comment on where do we each fit in and once we find that place in society, what does it really matter.  Our "hero", Paul Pennyfeather, starts out with an uncomfortable fit with the upper class, moves into a reasonable middle class position and then finds himself in a largely lower class position.  At every level, there are enough eccentrics to leave us wondering if anybody has a grip on reality.  Towards the very end of the book, there's a brief comparison of life to a gravitational carnival ride; only those at the center have either the time or perspective to see things for what they are.  Paul Pennyfeather's problem was that he was always surrounded by those in the process of falling off.  I feel better having found a purpose in "Decline and Fall".  I was tempted to rate the book a "3" and would have without the strong ending that it had.  It's funny and it's easily read but, I confess, I must have missed something because I don't see "5 stars" in this book. 
 Your home and business are not safe. Government can grab them at any time using anti-property redevelopment laws, paying you a pittance. Government then can give your property to a private company to develop as a mall or theme park.  That's the frightening story told in "Abuse of Power: How the Government Misuses Eminent Domain," Steven Greenhut's new book.   An editorial writer for six years with The Orange County Register, his articles have saved the property of thousands of homeowners and hundreds of businesses and churches. The total value of property protected must be more than $100 million.   Greenhut describes how, in Garden Grove, Calif., the city wanted to redevelop the land because a theme park would have paid them mountains of dollars in sales taxes, whereas people living happily in their homes pay much less in property tax. Citizens fought, and won. Citizens in other cities weren't so lucky.   More than just a description of assaults on private property, "Abuse of Power" is a guidebook on how to challenge powerful governments and big businesses.   Chapter 18 is "Fighting Back and Winning." It includes chapters describing: "Build Broad Coalitions," "Go On the Offensive," "Be Positive, Not Just Reactive," "Don't Lose Sight of Principles" and "Keep it Simple."  The book ends with lists of organizations and Web sites to help wage the fight and 417 footnotes.  "Abuse of Power" is a manifesto for taking back the right to property ownership. As Greenhut says, property rights are human rights. 
 The film (one of my favorites) inspired me to acquire the book and as usual I found the book to be far superior to the film. The norm since converting a book to film is similiar to condensing.   The book did lack in factual detail which would have made it longer and far more interesting, as a factual historical novel. As a piece on racial discrimination and women's fight for equality it is the best of reading.  For those interested in the subject the book and film are well worth adding to your collection.     
 On a daily basis, gay people are inundated with negative messages in every realm: social, political, cultural, and religious-especially religious. Many, if not most, mainstream churches have deliberate proscriptions against homosexuality, and with all that we've seen lately in the news, there seems to be no end in sight to the strife. Despite the fact that each year scientists offer more proof that sexual orientation is genetic (i.e. that's the way God made us), many churchgoers and clergy discriminate against gay people.  Lost in the midst of the polemics and condemnations are millions of non-heterosexual people trying to make their way in a world where matters of the Spirit are land mines and the path of that same Spirit does not always appear accessible. In his marvelous new book on this topic, Toby Johnson writes: "There is a Sufi saying: 'If the rose knew what the gardener's care would result in come spring, it would joyfully bend to the pruning knife.' Gay people experience pruning in late childhood and early adulthood. We realize the truth of our orientation and have to give up familial and cultural expectations of what our lives will be. Often we experience ridicule and ostracism by schoolmates and peers, along with rejection and disapproval by parents. Even if we grow up feeling it is okay to be gay, we experience confusion and trauma because we will not follow in the path that our parents, teachers, and role models have laid before us" (p. 239) It's this very phenomenon that tends to alienate gay people from churches and from the life-force of the Spirit.   For gay men, in particular, Toby Johnson' book GAY SPIRITUALITY is a lifesaver. Johnson's thesis is that gays are very much "Outsiders" in American society, and because of that, gay people possess valuable knowledge and inspiration about the true nature of the Spirit. Gay people experience the world differently than others do, including being more aware of the polarities. Rather than exclusion from the world of God, religion, and spirituality, Johnson calls for all people to listen to and heed the wisdom gay people have to offer. Because human knowledge and understanding continues to grow, Johnson wants any person struggling with gay issues to know that we are in the middle of a huge transformation of human consciousness-a major paradigm shift. Because of this, there is much to learn and room for growth, all of which is likely to give anyone struggling with issues of the Spirit a fair amount of hope.   Drawing from world religions, the Hero Cycle, Jungian thought, and dozens of other sources, Johnson discusses religion, spirituality, and sexuality from a variety of angles. With his background as a teacher, theologian, ex-Roman Catholic monk, and writer, this book has much to offer any person exploring spiritual paths. Ultimately, I found myself resonating strongly while reading part of the conclusion: "Being gay is a blessing... This discovery is an important part of spiritual maturation. As we understand how blessed we are, we begin to put out good vibes. When we realize that being gay is drawing a long straw in this life, we can forgive the world. We can accept things as they are with all the pain and loss that goes with being human. And when we do that we change the world" (p. 259).    It is clear from this book's premise (and that of the companion volume, GAY PERSPECTIVE: Things Our Homosexuality Tells Us About the Nature of God and the Universe), that Johnson is offer viable and life-changing alternatives for people, both gay and straight, to understand the search for a meaningful spirituality. This is a wonderful book to assist in that search. ~Lori L. Lake, reviewer for The Independent Gay Writer and Midwest Book Review 
 I received this as a gift a few weeks ago, and am I glad I did! This is a great resource for anyone concerned/looking at Security issues for Win 2000 Server. Excellent treatment on such things as Kerberos, Security Config Tool Set, IPSec, Smart Cards, etc. Chapter 9 is especially useful (for me at least) as it covers PKI, including enabling domain clients and certificate authorities. This book is really packed with information- a must have for anyone interested and looking for more detail in this all important topic. I'll use my copy often 
 Shocking...bizarre...funny...sad!   American politics at it's worst!  Could hardly stop reading it until I was finished 
 I bought one of these from Williams-Sonoma and love it.  So when I bought a second house and saw it practically half-price here, I bought the reconditioned one.  It brewed just fine for about a week, then it stopped.  Amazon is replacing it.  I hope it doesn't have the same problem because when it works, it makes great coffee 
 While I'm a dancer and actor, I've still been a little skeptical of dance shows on Broadway being considered musicals.  I was even more wary of this show after seeing its performance on the 2000 Tonys, mainly because in two years, three Broadway dance shows included Sing Sing Sing as a number.  However, when I saw Broadway on Broadway this past October and Ann Hampton Callaway's electric performance of 'Blues in the Night,' I decided to give Swing! another chance.  Being a fan of swing music, I was familiar with almost all of the numbers.  I found that the cast and orchestra gave WONDERFUL reneditions of the numbers, restoring them to the glory that they reached in the 30s and 40s.  I've heard many of the songs played on the local Jazz/Swing station here, and my grandparents especially enjoy the album as they were around to hear the original versions.  There is some fabulous dancer/musician interaction that must be seen on stage to carry its true merit, but the CD captures the energy and vivacity of the show beautifuly

 I can see why some reviewers want to rebel against the prevailing opinion, now over 40 years old, that this is the best stereo Beethoven cycle of all. Since 1963 we have become used to leaner textures and faster tempi in this music. But it's worth noting that in its day this was "modernized" Beehtoven, in that Karajan avoided Furtwangler's spiritual heavy lifting and concentrated on sheer power, propulsiveness, and virtuosity of execution.  Of its kind, no one has excelled him, even Karajan himself achieving nothing better in his two later cycles, which as reviewers note became too slick and smooth. The 1963 cycle does NOT show evidence of that tendency.  The major drawback for me is the sonics, which are fairly boomy and rough at times, with loss of detail and some microphone shatter at climaxes. I believe that the most recent hybrid-SACD pressing has solved some of those problems, though this set will never be a model of excellent sound.  For listeners who would like Karajan's Beethoven in leaner mode, his mostly mono 50s set from EMI with the Philharmonia is excellent, also. 
 I have studied this book and author as well as theosphy and comparative religions, philosophy, science of mind for over 20 years and the truth contained in H.P.Blavatsky's writings as well as intuitive knowledge have  caused me great joy and massive yearning for additional lifetimes of  study...I highly reccomend this book for serious students of lifes  mysteries and higher learning 
 For too long, and for too many insidious reasons, the Vedas have been ignored, marginalised or just plain derided by Western scholars.  They deserve far better treatment, and Stephen Knapp shows us why. Hidden in the Sanskrit texts of the ancient Vedic writings one can find sublime knowledge on every imaginable subject.  The author is doing a great service by making this knowledge easily accessible, and anyone searching for answers to life's problems could much worse than start looking here.  Well done Mr Knapp 
 Few can do it better than Connie Briscoe and in "Can't Get Enough" she proves she's at the top of her game. The novel picks up where "P.G. County" left off and resumes the story of Barbara Bentley, wife of philanderer Bradford, and her equally enthralling co-residents of a wealthy Washington, D.C. suburb.    Barbara Bentley, the queen of P.G. County, was once a woman who never met a martini she didn't like. But clean and sober for a year now, she's a part-time real estate agent working with a young, handsome man who's got his eyes on her "property." She's eating up the attention, since she's not getting any from her philandering husband, Bradford. He's too busy traveling, making deals and bedding young hoochies. Then there's Jolene, Bradford's social-climbing former mistress, who fully intends on winning back Patrick, the husband she lost as a result of her affair. He's hooked up with Pearl, a plus-size sistah with real values and Jolene's plan to break them up may have gone too far. And who can forget the new neighbor on the block -- the beautiful and mystical Veronique, who builds a mansion next door. Everybody wants to be her friend, but she's not really interested. She's busy working on the best laid plans yet....  Both amusing and delectable, "Can't Get Enough" is a pleasing and spirited novel - one that may entice and surprise you with its climatic twists. Again, Connie has delivered a great story line of greed, jealousy, bitterness, adultery and of course betrayal. Great writing and great character development has proving to be some of the important ingredients to a great read.  
 I think this book is a good book for kids and adults because you can learn how to plant a plant. The class has not finished the book yet. That is all that we read so far about SEEDFOLKS. 
 `The Mismeasure of Man' by the famous and recently deceased scientist / essayist, Stephen Jay Gould is possibly one of the finest essays in science in the last few decades, close, but not quite equal to the great `Silent Spring' by Rachael Carson. If there is any regrets to be felt about this book, it is that it did not appear twenty-five years before its 1981 publication date.  This book appeared after the publication of Gould's second collection of `Natural Science' columns, collected in the volume `The Panda's Thumb'. It was my purchasing this book of the `New Non-Fiction' display of my local bookstore, which lead to my discovery of Gould and my lifelong admiration of his essays. Oddly, when this book first came out, I gave it less attention than I did his collection of essays, as I sensed that this was, indeed, `old news', as I felt the civil rights battles, had been won. At the very least, I believed that the false anthropology underlying discrimination had been firmly put to death, at least in the United States. I did not yet appreciate the lessons in this book of how science can be biased, either intentionally or unintentionally, to support political beliefs.  Having now read the book through and through, I must recommend it to anyone who deals with the intersection of fact and policy. The book gives several object lessons in how `scientific' experiments can be biased, sometimes without even thinking. As an aside, I must plug the TV show, `CSI', as if it needed the recommendation, as a great showcase of how science can be twisted and how hard it can be to undo the damage done by cleverly corrupted science. In contrast, it is depressing to see how transparent are the misrepresentations of politicians and how weak are the efforts of journalists and intellectuals in correcting political misrepresentations.  The primary subject of this book is the efforts of largely competent scientists, some of them quite famous, to show by scientific means that one or more races of man are inferior to the white race by a mistaken measure of either physical or psychological characteristics. In each case, Gould shows how either the measurements were biased or the protocol of the experiments was biased or basic assumptions about the effect of the physical on the mental was mistaken.  While I have recently resumed a conversation with a long lost philosophical colleague who has a substantially poorer opinion of Gould than I, and while I have not explored his objections in depth, I think this book in particular has more of value than any three of his collections of essays. It is quite possibly his most important popular writing. 
 I was delighted with this book.  It is very detailed/thorough, yet easy to follow. 
 I learned about this book at a recent seminar. Bought it here through Amazon. Was a little worried when I read the first chapter that it would be over my head because I am a total novice, but I soon found myself engrossed in the book. It really is very helpful and the repeatition of ideas and "rules" helps drive home the important stuff. Well laid out so you can skip the chapters that don't interest you. Although I would consider reading them. I found that certain ideas hit home better in some chapters than others and I think it has helped my overall design ability. Good Book especially for those of us who love how-to books 
 Nice movie to watch. Lot of creativity for family entertainment A lot of fun. 
 I have seen the original Dutch version by Director Sluizer, and this one holds up quite well on its own. Jeff Harriman (Kiefer Sutherland) stops at a gas station with his girlfriend Diane (Sandra Bullock). In a matter of minutes, she disappears without a trace. And although Jeff searches everywhere for her, she vanishes without ever being heard from again. He lives every moment of his life trying to locate her. Putting flyers everywhere, and even going on TV.  The abducter of Diane is Barney Cousins (Jeff Bridges). I don't wish to give away the plot about what happened to her, however, I will write that Barney contacts Jeff and tells him that he admires his persistence in trying to locate Diane after so many years. He gives Jeff a chance to experience what happened to Diane, but at a cost. Enter Rita Baker (Nancy Travis) who is also the latest love interest of Jeff. Her role in the film is very important. Barney Cousins is a sociopath, and he has been abducting women for some time. How long, the viewer is never told, but it is not a spur of the moment type of abduction. He is very methodical.  As I wrote in the beginnig, I have seen the original, and while it is quite good, this film also is a very good and suspenseful film. The character of the sociopath, played by Jeff Bridges is very good. He is very convincing in his part. As for Kiefer Sutherland, I thought he gave a very good performance. Disregard some of the negative reviews on this film. Just because the original is on Criterion, and in Dutch, does not necessarily negate this very good and suspensful film. I have the DVD, but it is only listed on VHS at amazon. It might be out of print. If you can, grab the DVD; I assure you that you will not be disappointed. [Stars: 4.5] 
 I've been adventuring off reading new writers that i've been hearing about. Well Sparks was one of them and after reading this I wonder why did it take me so long to read his books. This book was really heart touching. The mom was a real inspiration for everything she was doing with her son and changing her life to better his. The love story was also great because that is somewhat reality. When you loose someone or go threw hard times; Its hard to put yourself back out there and to trust someone because its so much easier just to do things on your own . I can't wait to read more of Sparks books because I've already heard so many great things about them 
 Good Italian hitman movie boasts a good Charles Bronson performance.  The climax was really unique.  If you like this, then check out Revolver by the same director 
 This was my first Debbie Macomber book, and it was wonderful!  I have found my new favorite author.  The story is very honest, and she mixes in romance in a way that makes me smile.  The relationships are believable and touching.  Great book 
 Much to author Melissa Senate's, credit, SEE JANE DATE is not the typical mushy, happily ever after type of romance novel.  I purchased this book for one reason, because the fictional heroine went to my high school. Though she's a generation younger than I am, her fictional life of place and career are not altogether different than my real one.  While I didn't expect much from this novel, having bought it for this most personal of reasons, I was pleasantly surprised as the plot unfolded. Senate's story is engaging, and very believable. What single woman has not desperately sought a date for a special black-tie occasion? That is a main subplot of this book, as the heroine prepares to attend her perfect cousin's perfect wedding to the perfect man. The struggle that dating then becomes is the book's unifying motif, to funny effect.  Along the way, Senate explores some life lessons. She leaves her readers with the important theory that it is important to know who one is oneself, rather than creating a phony persona in the hope of connecting with a dream man; that until a woman is comfortable with herself, she cannot be comfortable in a relationship. As Senate sees it, it all comes down to basic self-worth.  The setting of this book almost rises to a character, so good is the sense of place that Senate creates both of Manhattan and of what it is like to have a job on a top magazine peopled by backstabbing co-workers.  SEE JANE DATE is not the usual "chick lit." It is far better 
 Build Your Own Web Site the Right Way Using HTML & CSS by Ian Lloyd is one of those books that I'd recommend to someone who is computer savvy but a complete novice when it comes to building web pages.  It's readable and understandable to non-techie types, and it will get them started in the right way without all the old habits that have developed over the years.  Contents: Setting Up Shop; Your First Web Pages; Adding Some Style; Shaping Up with CSS; Picture This! Using Images on your Web Site; Tables - Tools for Organizing Data; Forms - Interacting with your Audience; Getting your Web Site Online; Adding a Blog to your Web Site; Pimp my Site - Cool Stuff you can Add for Free; Where to Now? What you Could Learn Next; XHTML Reference; Index  Rather than teach HTML and CSS as separate skills, Lloyd really combines the two as a single discipline.  The book starts out with basic XHTML coding to build the structure of the page.  He even goes into div tags in preparation for the next section of the book.  That section has to do with making your page look nice with CSS.  The reader learns how to position and style the content using style sheets, rather than using techniques such as bold tags and tables.  Presenting the material in this fashion means that you shouldn't develop bad habits like using HTML for presentation rather than structure.  The examples build upon each other and are consistent throughout, so you actually end up building a complete site rather than just a collection of pages that have no relationship to each other.  There's even coverage of things such as blogs and third-party tools like statistic counters.    Overall, this is one of the better "beginner" books I've come across.  I would feel comfortable giving this to someone who was enthusiastic about learning a new skill, and I wouldn't be concerned about where they'd end up at... 
 "Opportunity Knocks" is a cute, funny movie. I have this movie and without a doubt, it's one of my favorites. It is Dana Carvey's first "starring" role as something other than a Saturday Night Live character and he is excellent. This movie never got the accolades it deserved (perhaps not enough press coverage). This movie is MILES above "Clean Slate" (Dana's second movie). I have felt for years that this movie was a wonderful little secret that only I and a few others in the world knew about. Dana really shines here. If you like Dana Carvey...if you like really funny, sweet little movies...if you have a sense of humor and like a good laugh - buy this movie, PLEASE. I want to share it with you ! 
 Not exactly a concert video, but not really a documentary either.  The few concert videos I've seen (including U2's "Elevation") are of a single edited concert, and largely limited to a handful of cameras and angles.  In contrast, "Rattle & Hum" shows a series of different concerts around the US during their Joshua Tree tour with incredible camera angles that put you right on the stage.  But it goes a bit beyond that and shows some rehersals and recording sessions for some of the new songs, some backstage shots, and a few brief interviews, but not to the point where you would really call it a "documentary."  The Edge really puts it best when he says (about the film), "it's about music."  Most of the film is in black & white, which comes across very cool.  The exception is the color footage from Sun Devil Stadium, and the sudden contrast more than half-way through adds to the "coolness" factor.  There are quite a few notable songs on the DVD such as "Exit," "Bad," and an emotional "Sunday Bloody Sunday" in B&W; and "With or Without You," "Running to Stand Still," and "Bullet the Blue Sky" in color (just to name a few!).  Also excellent are the parts with BB King on "When Love Comes to Town" and with a gospel choir in Harlem on "Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For."  And in my opinion, most of the versions on the DVD are better than the recorded versions or what was included on the CD.  Ahhh, who am I kidding... I think the whole thing's cool 
 Awesome! Although it's been more than five years since I read it, I always see it on my bookshelf and ask myself if I should read it again. It was one of those books, especially for baseball fans like myself, that I never  wanted to end 
 I am pretty much tearing my hiouse down and rebuilding it. I've been so stuck in reviewing technical aspects of framing construction and the sort that I really got hung up in "styles" and "curb appeal" and lost site of what living in my house really meant to me...being happy in my space and surrondings. I happened to order because it was suggested with another I purcahsed and it changed almost everything I was looking at and thinking of. An example, after working through some of the reading I was reminded during this cold February in Michigan that I love the smell of a coming rain storm and the feel of a breeze through a house. I went back and made some great changes to my technical specs based on the site analysis the book recommeded. I wasn't thinking about prevailing winds and storm directions at all other than the general rules of which way to point a house! Another absolutley great point is that this book is green without an agenda. I'm only half way through but I haven't read anything about building my house out of used bottles or tires yet and at one point the book suggests that a classic green application can have a resource cost point that makes it a disadvantage to the modern contemporary appraoch. Everyone wants to be at least a little green and this book helps. It's a great book and is loaded with excellent, and I stress, EXCELLENT information both technical and not that is delivered in more of an article format that keeps your attention and provides a logical sequence to putting the pieces of the puzzle together. The photos are bright and beautiful. This may turn out to be the best book I bought to remodel my home 
 I'll be honest, any movie where I get to see Sandra Oh and one of the Tilly sisters nekkid is going to get 6 stars from me.  But it actually is a pretty good movie, though it is a little predictable. I would say it is fairly realistic (having dated a couple of strippers), except for the total lack of any lesbianism. But maybe thats just in the bay area.  On the plus side, this is one of the better Jennifer Tilly movies. That girl needs to get a better manager! 
 The author suggests that parents empower children to take control of their finances early in life. The author challenges us to turn education about money into wealth and cash flow. Children are encouraged to seek professional careers and to begin small businesses to ensure cash flow well into retirement. The author's Kolbe Index seeks to train people to analyze facts, formulate follow-up scenarios, start projects quickly/efficiently and implement rational solutions devoid of analysis paralysis problems. This work is well worth the money for the information content provided 
 First of all, I have to chuckle about the people worrying about political correctness.  C'mon, folks, a little book isn't going to teach your kids about parental roles, between your influence and the fact that the world IS politically correct, they will get it soon enough!  Secondly, some households have stay-at-home moms (we work, too, trust me!) and out of home dads, like ours!  I had a professional career once too, and now I have a job that's just as important...and my husband is very involved with the kids, even though he works long hours to make our situation work.  Sorry if Daddy coming home from work to see Mommy and son offends anyone!  Good grief...  I feel like I have apologize for loving this book that so closely mirrors my life - and gives my son great joy because he can relate so closely to it!    That being said, I will climb off my soapbox and praise this sweet little book.  My son was captivated from 18 months on.  The way it flows, its sweetness and silliness...And the last page always chokes me up.  My little daughter has now discovered it, and we read it every night.  She loves the part where Daddy comes home and Mommy is pushing Jessie Bear is in the tree swing - that's pretty much the scene at our house every night in our front yard!    It's a great, simple little book - I highly recommend it 
 Every Marine that has served can easily tell you about the types of people in the Corps.  There are the people who do their job and are just waiting to get out, the less than desirable bottom "10%" and then guys like Wesly Fox: the super-hardcore, gungy types who eat and sleep Marine Corps and epitomize the professionalism and dedication of the modern warrior.  Col. Fox spent 43 year in, making it to 1st Sergeant before being commissioned and ultimately obtaining his bird.  Many field grade officers today remember him as the CO of OCS, and his reputation carries his name throughout the Corps, even today, a decade since his retirement.  Gungy Marines only come along maybe once a year in a unit, and Marines like Foxonly come along once in a great while.    The book is written by the author, and goes from chapter to chapter through each rank and his experiences in Korea, Vietnam, and all of his assignments (e.g. drill instructor, recruiter, MSG, etc.);  He did it all.  The prose is not extremely well written or memorable so much as the content of his story is remarkable.  He seems to be a very warm and realistic man.  There are almost no political views in the book, or rants about government or red tape, just his perspectives on the COrps and how it changed over 3 years.  A great read, I feel it should be added to the Commandant's reading list 
 Selecting fifteen soldiers ranging from the Napoleonic Wars to the near present, Max Hastings tells the full story of heroes, but not just at the battlefield.  Instead he also digs deep into the aftermath of life for supermen (and in one case superwoman) who no longer serve in the military.  Readers obtain a fascinating look that is actually at its best when Mr. Hastings concentrates on lesser known people instead of, for example the stories of Americans Eddie Rickenbacker and Audie Murphy, which have been told in much more depth than here.  Still this is an interesting primer that showcases how military heroes need war (no five star generals in peacetime) to win acclaim and how many fail to live up to that highlight film moment once they leave their war fighting glory days behind them.  This book is well written with interesting premises that can be applied intriguingly to sports as much as the battlefield.  Most military history buffs will feel Mr. Hastings should have gone deeper into the lives of the less famous heroes and include some non-western or at least less Anglo-American warriors as the few others like the Israeli and Aussie segments feel fresher.  Still this is worth the read for those who appreciate a short military biography.  Harriet Klausner 
 I think I was suppsoed to read this book in High School and I either didn't or i watched the movie instead. Either way, I am glad I finally did.  This book is one of the best ever written.  It makes me sad to think that so many people have not and will not read it.  Harper Lee was ahead of her time in so many ways.  Buy this book. Read it now. Go 
 Okay, so there are certain aspects that aren't very believable, but who cares, it was great fun to watch.  
 I am a novice when it comes to the blues. I picked up this disc somewhat on a whim after hearing a small clip online and i'm glad I did. This disc is amazing. I don't know what blew me away more, the vocals or the guitar playing. I can't decide on which is best. All I know is that I enjoy this disc very much 
 At first, this biography on Damon Runyon seems like any other biography: a list of dates, names, people, and places. As you start reading it, though, it becomes a story that puts you right in the middle of Runyon's life, the  good and the bad. You'll see Runyon's start in poetry, sportswriting, war  reporting, and what he is most well-known for: his short stories. Also,  you'll see the people in Runyon's life who he based some of his most  Runyonesque characters on, and people who based their lives off of his  characters. This book reads more like a Runyonesque story than a biography,  which makes it so interesting to read, besides the fact that it gives a  glimpse into the life of the very private Damon Runyon 
 I love monopoly,and besides having alot of this game. the design is so unique  and the game is fun. It's a keeper for sure.very educational and very entertaining.  
 Haven't finished it yet.  But I did stop in wonder for a good long while when I read that Plato (PLATO!) had given a good long description of the deforestation and erosion of Greece.  It covers more ground than the (similar point of view and many years later) Jared Diamond Collapse.  For instance, in a later chapter that I skimmed early on, he talks about epidemics and sickness.  Our best health care in the world, in Ponting's view, is mostly following, not altogether successfully, in the footsteps of basic sanitation--i.e., public health and nutrition trump treatment for disease.  I expect that I don't, and won't as I continue to read, agree with everything he says. But he does makes one think.

Time of Wonder. Illus. Robert  McCloskey. New York: The Viking Press, 1957. Wolf, Virginia. " The  Cycles of the Seasons: Without and Within Time." Children's Literature  Association Quarterly 19:2  (1990).      The book Time of Wonder is a  children's book written and illustrated by Robert McClosky. The book is  about an island that undergoes many changes through out the story. The  illustrations portray nicely the transitions the island encounters with the  passing of time. The illustrations help elaborate each change the island is  going through at the time. Time of Wonder's plot falls into a series of  continuous changes and a repetitive cycle of seasons. Many of the book's  ideas relate to Virginia L. Wolf's article, " The Cycle the Seasons:  Without and Within Time". In her article she states," Similarly  dependent upon the natural cycle, people find the seasons multi-leveled and  universal symbols"(170). She also states," the cycle of seasons  becomes the birth, death, and return of divine things" (170). This  relates to McClosky's book in that the book starts off with the beginning  of summer. Then things begin to turn to fall and certain changes begin to  happen with the passing of time. With the beginning of fall, the hurricane  develops and damages much of the island, symbolizing death. After the  hurricane is over, the people come out to repair the island, discovering  new things left behind by the storm. The humming birds are out singing  joyfully. The tone is energetic and uplifting. The people seemed to be  filled with new life, symbolizing the return of divine things. In the  beginning, the children are playing in the rocks and in the water amongst  the summer sun at the edge of the island, symbolizing the birth of the  cycle. Wolf refers to Northrop Frye's Mythoi, or generic seasons, which are  characterized by the seasons. He says," the full cycle may suggest  permanence, promising transcendence as spring follows winter or threatening  endless repetition as summer leads to fall"(171). In a Time of Wonder  the idea of permanence and promising transcendence to a following cycle of  seasons, is depicted in the end of the book. As summer turns into fall and  the humming birds fly south for the winter, it is time for the families to  pack up and say goodbye to the end of another summer. They must wait for  the continuous cycle to complete and bring about another summer so they can  return once again.      Time of Wonder was a book I enjoyed reading very  much. The illustrations went along very nicely with the text and added  definite zest to the book 
 First, I love this book, and am very much looking forward to the release of Tyler's next cookbook.  With that said, a majority of the recipies in this book are quite advanced.    With the exception of a few recipies, most of these will require you to make a trip to your local grocery store, and a few specialty stores as well.    As a "hobby chef" I find myself waiting for the weekend to attempt most of these recipies, as it lets me spend a good amount  of time in the kitchen.    While the recipies require a bit of work, the results are usually spectacular.  I do agree with another reviewer that the idea of "eyeballing" certain ingredients is a bit of a pain.  I really have no clue what a "3-count" of something is.  So I find myself  guessing at a few ingredents.  I think this is a great cookbook for advanced cooks, and food-lovers alike.   
 This wonderfully illustrated and detailed book has to be in every dinosaur expert's and every dinosaur enthusiast's library. It is not just an encyclopedic summary of every ceratopsian dinosaur genus and species discovered and described so far, but also a discussion on every aspect of their natural history. Dr. Peter Dodson, who is an expert on horned dinosaurs, writes on the discovery, biology and analysis of Triceratops and its kin, the Mesozoic strange beast 
 I bought this item in my last trip to US and it works perfectly. The cartridge will only print the exact same # of pictures that it is designed for and the only con I can think of is that in order for the cartridge to work, you have to twist one of the sides with your finger (haven't think of anything else) to get the ink ribbon in place for it to start printing and it's pretty hard to do so my finger hurt for a while. Other than that, this printer works like a charm 
 Titus has been maligned by many who have read the better known works of Shakespeare as a violent and gruesome play. That it is, but it is precisely that and other elements that make it remarkable. To truly appreciate Titus one must have read some  Roman plays (specifically Seneca's early tragedies) and be relatively well versed in Greek mythology and Roman history. In Titus, Shakespeare gives the audience a great deal of Greek mythology via Ovid's Metamorphoses (compare Lavinia with Philomela and the final "feast" with the infamous dinner that Thyestes had with his brother Atreus). But the play is not only a classic in this sense. It addresses  the  timeless theme of revenge and the endless cycle of violence begetting violence that ensues as the charachers seek "wreakful vengance" for each horrific deed and pain that one causes the other. There are no heroes in Titus and no "good guys" just raw emotion and passion laid bare. It is at once the worst of humanity recounted with some of the most beautiful poetry that has ever been written 
 This book although now a little dated, is still brilliant.Here in one book are the many diverse strands of Theravada Meditation, the Thai Forest Ajahns & the Burmese Vipassana Sayadaws are present. The material  covers a very broad spectrum of Teachings & approaches. I am loving  reading this book 
 I teach an 8th grade Language Arts Class in rural Washington State.  I found our textbook to be bland and typical.  I was looking for some work for my students to actually learn how to write poetry correctly. This book does this

 Aliens *is* one of the better sequel efforts, since we all know most sequels (with the notable exception of The Godfather Part II) are just awful, cynical dreck. But the Amazon review by Marshall Fine says it's better than the original, Alien, and I'm not sure even James Cameron, megalomaniacal director that he is, would dis Ridley Scott like that. Note that Ridley made another of the 10 or 15 best sci-fi movies ever made, Blade Runner. Cameron did made the first two Terminator movies, but just try and tell me the second one was better than the first. I dare you 
 I thought I was good at helping my clients increase sales and marketing before I ran across Dan's books. I'm a business coach with results that over 80% of my clients were doubling their business in 3-4 weeks BEFORE I ran into Dan and his materials, but now I've actually been able to increase my own marketing response, and that of my clients by 4-5 times, not just double.  I coach clients on marketing and sales techniques, yet Dan blows me away. Although I was already way above the national average for marketing response and sales, once I started reading and working with Dan and his materials my own figures really went through the roof.  Now I read everything that Dan writes and constantly get better and better results for my own sales and marketing, and for my clients.  What you learn in this book can be applied to more than sales letters. I use the principles for all areas of sales (networking, marketing, cold calling, etc). I've also taken his ideas for a long sales letter and applied them to shorter marketing media such as post cards. My post card response rate went up 4-5 times!! Fantastic.  Dan is probably one of the easiest marketing and sales experts to follow and learn from, and his ideas deliver results. 
 I found it very difficult to sustain my interest in this book. I found it to have a flatness of language and feeling, as if it were written by Babbit himself. I understood that Sinclair Lewis was at once satirizing and presently sympathetically this Midwestern go- getter, shallow and ambitious, who too is hypocritical in his betrayal of his wife.  I find that the great writers create characters who we come to deeply care about. Somehow I could not do this for Babbit.  The fault may be in the reader, but I found the whole enterprise boring

 I used this book to make the Storm at Sea quilt within as a wedding present for my cousin and his fiancee.  It turned out wonderful, beautiful, beyond my expectations.  It was my first full-sized quilt ... had made runners, lap quilts, etc before.  The instructions and illustrations were easy to follow ... but the quilt definitely was not "quick" ... it took me 8 months of weekends.  I know it's because I was relatively new to it, though.

 I love this book.  I read Dr. Atkins book from cover to cover which is very important, but this book is a great brush up or even for a person who haven't the time to catch the vision and need the basic details quick.  Its GREAT for INDUCTION phase, it cannot replace the Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution, but it is straight to the point for the program.  I love it 
 The following is a very frank and honest review of the CD, and really is only my opinion -- so readers, and fanatical fans of the ACO, beware.  A few days ago I purchased this very recent recording of Angela Hewitt and the Australian Chamber Orchestra playing the Bach Keyboard Concertos.  I have both good and bad things to say about it, after listening to the entire CD twice:  Positive = The first thing I noticed is that Angela Hewitt has grown as a pianist -- especially since her 80s CBC recording of the Bach piano concertos (which really isn't that far behind in terms of musical excellence, IMHO).  However, she's well maintained the positive aspects of her style: as one reviewer puts it, "you hear a more graceful and "smoother" style of Bach" (this isn't a recent addition to her style, though, she's always played with excellent grace and smoothness).  The Concerto in g- is amazing!  Linda Kent also does a superb job with the subordinate harpsichord parts, which I'm about to complain about.  Negative = I'm really not too pleased that the harpsichord makes random (yes, I emphasize random, in spite of the booklet) and extremely subordinate appearances throughout the works.  It's as if they wanted to honour the harpsichord, but still say, "sorry, no one plays you anymore -- get the hell out!"  It randomly chimes in in the background sort of confusingly and creepily at once (except in the Brandenburg Concerto).  At times, I confess, it was distracting and I began to wish the harpsichord would just take over.  Not everyone likes the piano/harpsichord mix, and for VERY good reasons (to me, it's a little bit like mixing salt and sugar -- ugghh!); there is absolutely nothing wrong with using one instrument or the other (contrary to the booklet claiming that "there is no reason why it shouldn't be part of a ... recording, even when the piano is used as the solo instrument" -- is that not totally one person's opinion?!  I'd like to ask Bach or any number of harpsichordists!).  The Australian Chamber Orchestra plays well in general, but the Concerto in d- isn't to my liking at all, and NOT because of Angela Hewitt (though it may well be to the liking of others).  It's not nearly as tragic, I insist, as the 1958 Glenn Gould recording.  They do a better job with the g-.  A severe and cynical 3/5 for the ACO, except for Linda Kent.  That said, rare are the performers whom I would trust enough to hear playing Bach on a piano.  Angela Hewitt is one of them.  Her technique really is truly excellent, and overshadows the fact that she does over-romanticize sometimes (the #1 distinction, I believe, between her and Gould).  The CD really is worth the money, if you don't mind the weirdly random piano+harpsichord mix, and especially if you're an Angela Hewitt fan; for the Concerto in d-, however, if you want to go for a piano performance, I would strongly recommend Glenn Gould's 1958 New York performance (Sony) or Angela Hewitt's 1987 Toronto recording (CBC).  Both are better, especially for the first movement (Hewitt grows, but altogether I better appreciate her old recording for that one concerto).  Wanda Landowska and Trevor Pinnock both have superior recordings available on the harpsichord of all of the concertos.  This is a very, very serious collection of concertos, and I'm really sorry to say that I don't take it as seriously as I should.  I'm torn between 3 and 3.5 stars -- so I'll give it 4 
 This book is filled with useful information about reading gestures and body- language.  It also contains diagrams showing various postures and how to read them.  Among the wise words on the subject it collects are:  "Watch out for the man whose stomach doesn't move when he laughs." Cantonese proverb "The eyes of men converse as much as their tongues,with the advantage that the ocular diet needs no dictionary,but is understood the world over. Ralph Waldo Emerson.  It does at time evidence  banality." A husband slamming a door and turning his back on his wife is heralding a significant message"  But to be fair I will cite a typically instructive  passage from the book. " With few exceptions, most of us dislike having anyone point his finger at us. We dislike it even more when we are jabbed  like a dummy in bayonet practice,and asked " You get what I mean?" In heated arguments it is very common to see people using their fingers against each other almost as epees in a fencing match.Some people use their eyeglasses as an extension of their index-finger, pointing them in a gesture of reprimand or admonishment ,or for emphasis. Since people in a quandary do not cooperate as those who are relaxed and comfortable,it behooves us not to point our index finger at anyone lest he become hostile at us or "turn off"...You can communicate effectively and not use this gesture which antagonizes others"  Ideally , then a reading of this book may help us improve our communication with and cooperative action with others.  
 In my humble opinion, this is King Enrique's best CD. It's a lot faster and better paced than his first CD, with a lot more standout tracks than any of his other CDs. My favourite is Miente, an awesome song combining a stirring piano/keyboard, short, sharp, powerful guitar riffs and a cool drum beat with Enrique's strong, moving vocals thrown on top. The next best is Solo En Ti, (which I know all the words to without knowing Spanish) it's a happy cool song. Revolucion is a mysterious, brooding song, and Lluvia Cae is cute with its reggae flavour and dub vocals. Totally phat CD 
 I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but "da Fudge" deliver! This album is nicely engineered, produced and mastered, and the band is SMOKIN'!  One lick to pick: there's a cool drum fill that Carmine has certainly mastered: he plays it in EVERY SONG...well, almost!  Couldn't resist pointing that out...Carmine's cool! 
 Christiane De Nicolay-Mazery is a fabulous author with fabulous connections.  I'm an interior designer & I find Christiane De Nicolay-Mazery's books to be the most inspirational decorating books that I own.  One of her other books, 'Private Houses of Paris', is my favorite book on the topic of decorating and I own almost every significant book published on this topic.  I do wish that this book was available in hardback, as I prefer hardback books, but this fact should not dissuade you in purchasing it because inspirational design is absolutely on every page of this book 
 It would be tough to choose Tom Waits' best album, but this one would have to be in the running.  "Tom Traubert's Blues" alone is worth price of entry.  I wonder if Shane MacGowan (of the Pogues) heard that song at a young age 
 What more can I say? It's full of Matchbox 20's hits. Their subsequent work has been good, but not the all-around mix of good music like this album 
 In my opinion this is the last really enjoyable book that was written by JAK before she entered her...shall we say, 'Difficult' phase.   This book is untainted by the Oh-So-Lame virus which blighted her later crop of novels, and is a delightful, humourous romp peppered with moments of surprisingly moving tenderness, as an emotionally scarred Alpha male is taught how to love again by a classic heroine in JAK's inimitable style.  The Alpha male here is an unusually intriguing character, with a background that makes us feel that he may in fact be justified in being such a moody prat, once we learn the full story. And the heroine manages to be stubborn, headstrong and opinionated etc, without being so irritating that you want to strangle her. The story has a nicely plotted intrigue element, which generates a couple of moments of proper menace.  All in all, a fine example of a JAK novel, well worth splashing out on

 Muller's latest Sharon McCone mystery is up to her usual standard. McCone's latest employee, Julia Rafael, is charged with credit-card fraud, and McCone doesn't believe it, nor does anyone else who knows her. However, the person accusing her, Alex Aguilar, is a respected member of the Board of Supervisors and founder of a job-training center, and things do not look good.  But McCone's investigation reveals that Aguilar may have plenty to hide, and that, in fact, a frame-up of Julia may have been set in place specifically to ruin McCone.   One thing I like very much about this series is that McCone and other continuing characters do not remain static. In this book, McCone continues to deal with her reaction to her brother's suicide, to her discovery of her own adoption and reunion with her birth family, and with changes in her relationship with her lover, Hy Ripinsky.  A fast-paced and well-written book. 
 What a wonderful book, simple and clear from cover to page. Jason has been one of my most important teachers, and I have read all that he has published in the 10 years I've studied with him. Everything till now has educated me and assisted me on my spiritual path, but nothing has touched my heart as this book does. It is the very best of his teaching, soul to soul, heart to heart, breath to breath. More than words to study, these are words to soothe, inspire, remind, restore and heal all who are willing to take them in. It is a great gift to have the heart of his teaching accessible in a form I can pick up and partake of any time my soul needs a long, cool drink of reality. Definitely one of those desert island picks 
 This is one of my favorite Joe Cocker albums.  I have it as a record and am trying to find it on CD but its not available right now.  Highly recommended 
 I was very pleased with my order of vanilla beans. The beans were soft and smelled wonderful. I will order this product again 
 An excellent story about the making  of one of the best rock alblums ever made.Those of us who remember when this alblum came out can now see what the GREAT OZ was doing behind that curtain.The sounds in Jimi's head got onto vinyl because of the magical collaboration  of Eddie Kramer,Hendrix, Mitchell, and Noel Redding--who got fed up with the delays and effectively quit at this point. But there was plenty of talent available and eager to help out, Jack Cassidy, Steve Winwood, Buddy Miles, among others who made it happen. Eddie Kramer is the main historian here, his memory of how all the tracks were layed down gives the most complete view since Jimi is not available 
 This book is great for the average dumb male who dosen't even know how to hold a baby. The perfect gift for an expecting couple 
 If you have a morale issue in your workplace, chances are someone is spreading negativity around.  One negative person can sour a whole team, so don't ignore it. This book defines workplace negativity and investigates the causes for it.  It tells you what symptoms to watch for and gives thirty quick fixes.  It also advises how to overcome individual and team negativity.  I was pleased to see the chapter on changing organizational norms, because the structure may set up repeat episodes of negativity with new staff 
 This product work perfectly in the Epson printer! The quality of printing is great! 
 Stern's book gives us valuable insight into currents of German thinking from the 19th century up to the rise of National Socialism in the 20s and 30s.  Stern's books focuses on the writings of Paul de Lagarde, Julius Langbehn, and Moeller van den Bruck.  Paul de Lagarde was a biblical scholar and a master of oriental languages like Aramaic and Persian.  He was also a rabid Jew hater who openly called for extermination.  He loathed classical Western liberalism, science, and capitalism.  For him, these were all spiritless abstractions.  For Lagarde, Western liberalism, capitalism, science, and the Jews where the monstrous embodiment of all he hated. He had a romantic notion of a mythical Germanic past, and he believed the Jews and the modern society of the West were conspiring to pollute and corrupt this pure German spirit.  He advocated a Great Leader, a "purge the Jew" program, and a divinely inspired expansionist foreign policy to rekindle an authentic and noble Germanic way of life.    Lagarde despised bourgeois 19th century German Christianity, and he called for a "new" German religion that would purge all the Jewish elements of Christianity and become the unifying spiritual basis and justification for the new German state.  This new religion would fuse the squabbling German factions and sects into a unified people and nation with one single will .... embodied in the form a "Great Leader."  Lagarde rejected the premise of general education, and instead, he proposed a totally new education system based on social status and intellectual promise.  This new, state-run authoritarian education system would mold the leaders of the new German nation.  Julius Langbehn wrote a book that extolled the Dutch artist Rembrandt as an authentic "German man".  If this sounds confusing, well ... it is ..., but recall that many years later the Nazis attempted to use Rembrandt as a cultural symbol to force a Dutch-German alliance after they occupied Holland during the war.    Like Lagarde, Langbehn hated the modern liberal society because of its mechanization, realism, bourgeois lifestyle, and commercialism.  Like Hitler, Langbehn was an "artist"; he was anti-scientific, anti-Western, and anti-rational.  He postulated a "cult of the young" (think Hitler Youth) and a "Hidden Emperor" (think Führer) who would emerge to unite the German people.  Again like Lagarde, Langbehn hated the U.S.A because it was the embodiment of all he despised.  He warned that Jews were destroying the German "Volk" by "worming" their way into German life.  For Langbehn, modernity itself was the ultimate cause of German decay, and the Jews were to blame for bringing this modernity to German society.  For Langbehn, the Jews were "democratically inclined; they have an affinity for the mob," and like Lagarde, Langbehn called for extermination of the Jews.  I won't go on about Moeller van den Bruck, because it is similar to Lagarde and Langbehn.   One important footnote:  The Nazi's got the term "The Third Reich" from one of Moeller's books.  In summary, we find a set of three German intellectual romantics who were alienated by modernism and who abhorred all that was new.  They suffered from "cultural despair." For these three, the "Jews" were the immediate agents of corrupting change, and it was America that was the colossal embodiment of all they detested.  For them, a pure and authentic German way of life was lost due to the conspiracy and confluence of these horrible forces of modernism.  All of the ills and fractiousness and faithlessness of German society were attributable to Jews and liberal modernism (as exemplified by America).  These three sought to annihilate the bourgeois modern society they found themselves in and they sought to replace it with a utopian dream.  Their utopia was a unified and harmonious German people -- purged of Jews -- who would be orderly, hierarchical, and authentic.  This unified German nation would be led by a strong emperor who would perfectly embody the unified will of the people.  They sought a "New German religion", free of Jewish influence, that would provide a unifying framework for this new society.  They proposed state-controlled education and propaganda, leadership by a small elite, annexation and conquest of middle Europe, and they called for the extermination of Jews.  In short - these three "culturally despairing" egg heads predicted much of the horror of the Nazis.  All three were widely read in German society at various points in time leading up to the rise of National Socialism.  We know that Hitler emphatically read Lagarde.  For more on this, see "Hitler's Forgotten Library" in the May 2003 issue of The Atlantic Monthly, by Timothy W. Ryback.   On p.295, Stern shows how Lagarde, Langbehn, and van den Bruck influenced other key Nazi ideologists like Alfred Rosenberg.  The book contains extensive footnotes and end notes, a large bibliography, and a good index.  I have one gripe with the book.  There are several book titles, quotes, and passages that are in German without English translation.  I could not work them out with my meager German.  I wish translations were provided.   I also wish pictures or portraits of Lagarde, Langbehn, and van den Bruck were provided.  Finally, I'd like to add that many of the themes we see having emerged from Lagarde, Langbehn, and van den Bruck are similar to what is found the more recent work of the influential Islamic radical Sayyid Qutb.  I strongly recommend the Paul Berman book "Terror and Liberalism" for a very readable and enlightening treatment of Qutb. 
 This debut solo album by Cave has grown in stature down the years. The mood is Goth, the songs are mostly folkie laments, both lyrically and melodically impressive, his voice is like dark red velvet and the whole is dark, brooding and atmospheric. With the superb backing of Bad Seeds Blixa Bargeld, Mick Harvey, Barry Adamson and Anita Lane, this album is just perfect in its blood-cuddling rawness. I love the eerie cover of Leonard Cohen's Avalanche, whilst the striking images in Cabin Fever elevates an ordinary tune into the unforgettable. Well Of Misery stands out for its interesting vocal arrangement. Cave's cover of Elvis' In The Ghetto is quite stunning. The title track is an anguished and harrowing love song with atmospheric vocal samples and industrial infusions. With these songs Cave established himself in the great tradition of artists like Cohen, Richard Thompson (in his dark moments), Tom Waits, Peter Murphy and Michael Gira, as a master of the deep, dark lament. 
 This would be a valuable text for anyone working with the Jungian model of alchemy, but I'll echo the view that it is not exactly a beginner's book. If you're new to this kind of work, a good place to start would be Calvin Hall's Primer of Jungian Psychology.   Excellent companions to Anatomy would be Jung on Active Imagination, edited by Chodorow, and Jung's own Memories, Dreams and Reflections, or Man and His Symbols.  Edinger's book would also be a smart buy for anyone practicing pathworking or other spiritual techniques that make extensive use of imagination. If this is your thing, another great companion text would be Alchemy & Mysticism: the Hermetic Museum, by Roob. That book is a peerless collection of alchemical images. Occult Psychology (one of my personal favorites), by Alta J. LaDage, would also be a very natural fit 
 I recomend this book to every new mom. It explains everything that is happening and I knew what to expect before I went to my Dr's appointment. It told me things my doctor didn't. 
 This is the "Bible" for NPD professionals.  An excellent addition to the guides by Cooper and Crawford 
 I read this book for a class in high school.  That was over 10 years ago and it is still one of my favorites.  I read the whole thing in 2 days 
 I must admit I was hesitant to purchase this DVD. A classic punk band performing twenty plus years later, what could one expect? Apparently, one can expect a hell of a lot. These guys and gal can still tear their songs apart.  It's well filmed; there isn't that MTV, rapid editing that can cause seizures. The audio is excellent; you can actually understand the lyrics. It's well mixed. It's far superior to a lot of live performance DVD's currently released by some bands. X released a product that is worthy of ones money.  If you like X; you'll love this DVD. If you just appreciate a good rock/punk concert, you won't be disappointed 
 The concept is fairly clear from the title of this, a sequel to the earlier Wall Of Soundalikes compilation put together by those benign record obsessives at Ace. Phil Spector was the creator of the trademark Wall Of Sound, and had a huge influence on his peers. Some tried to emulate his sound and success, often hiring the same studio (Gold Star in Hollywood) and engineer (Larry Levine or Stan Ross) that he used, and employing musicians who included members of his Wrecking Crew mafia; others adapted some of his techniques and many innovations to their own hallmark sounds. On this second collection several of the tracks also show how many singers tried to sound like Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield, the Righteous Brothers, and did a pretty good job of it. Nite Owl, the Righteous Brothers track chosen here, predates their spell on the Philles label and shows that they were no strangers to Gold Star or to the Spector Wall Of Sound themselves. Particular highlights include I'm Nobody's Baby Now by Reperata and the Delrons (the single of which Reperata is most proud) and Ruby and the Romantics' Your Baby Doesn't Love You Anymore, in its reverberating UK single edit mix. Some of Spector's sidemen are involved in these productions and songs, including Nino Tempo, Jeff Barry, Jerry Riopelle, Pete Andreoli, Vincent Poncia, Jack Nitzsche and Leon Russell. Surprisingly, though, there are no examples of the songwrting teams of Greenwich/Barry, Mann/Weil or Goffin and King. The collection includes some of the artists found on Phil's Spectre: the Righteous Brothers, Nino Tempo and April Stevens, the Beach Boys, Clydie King and Kane and Abel (an earlier version of the same song found on its predecessor), as well as a further couple of instances of Motown borrowing from the Spector box of tricks, this time involving Mary Wells and the Four Tops. Neither the Beach Boys or Mary Wells tracks were released at the time, though not for reasons concerning quality control. However, overall, it seems reasonable to suppose from this that their may never be a Phil's Spectre III, though Ace are welcome to prove me wrong. I wonder if they might transfer some of their energies to licensing and releasing some of the many Phil Spector productions, including whole albums, never made available on CD? There are some tantalising moments. The producer of the Bonnets' track says they were named after their lead singer, Bonnie, without revealing whether this could be Bonnie O'Hara, who sang the Spector-linked Home Of The Brave by Bonnie and the Treasures. We know Jack Nitzsche's wife Gracia sang in the Satisfactions (so named because he played piano on the Stones' song) but not whether hers is the lead vocal. There seem to be no line-up details available for several of the groups included, which is unfortunate as some pieces of several puzzles might have been found in the process. As one of the tracks is produced by Abner Spector it is worth pointing out that he and Lona Spector from Tuff Records etcetera, and who produced the Jaynetts' Sally Go Round The Roses, have no connection with Phil Spector. Their appearance on composer credits without a first name has fooled some collectors and critics. All the tracks are monaural apart from those by the Righteous Brothers, the Beach Boys, Nino Tempo and April Stevens, the Four Tops and Joe South. Unlike a previous reviewer I can detect no stereophony in the Clydie King track, though, as with all the tracks, the sound is crystal clear; also, worryingly, some of the tracks seem to be a few seconds shorter than on previous, other label re-issues. Recommended if you loved the first Phil's Spectre 
 Throughout the book, you'll be asking yourself if Francesca truly is the religious icon her community comes to believe she is. Is she carrying an immaculate conception? Can she heal people with a touch? Well told, this story is one you'll find as thought provoking as it is entertaining 
 i have always been intrigued by the concept of the journey of a soul. until finding this incredible book, i had countless questions that were never answered elsewhere. what is the soul, am i really just a repeat of a different life, does the soul reincarnate, and if so, why, how does  reincarnation affect our present day relationships, and many more  questions, all answered in a charming and concise fashion. a great book! i  highly recommend to anyone interested in this subject specifically or  kabbalah in general 
 Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1985, this thoughtful character novel focuses on Macon Leary, a travel writer who hates to travel, a man who has gone through life observing what is happening, but who has never been truly engaged.  Compulsively tidy, Macon has always believed that it is possible to order one's life so effectively that the untidiness, or chaos, that throws life into confusion can be avoided.  And then his beloved 12-year-old son is cold-bloodedly murdered in the senseless robbery of a burger joint while he is away at camp for the first time.  It gives away nothing of the plot to say that this event totally undoes Macon and his wife, and their polite and predictable marriage goes into a tailspin.  When the novel opens, Macon and Sarah have decided to separate, with Sarah getting her own apartment (where she can be as messy as she wants) and Macon remaining in the house with his son Ethan's undisciplined dog Edward.  In fact, Macon has moved back with his sister and brothers in the family house, to recuperate from his physical wounds--an accident in which he breaks his leg-- and from his emotional wounds.  Then into his life comes Muriel, a divorcee with an over-protected, allergic, and hypersensitive son.  She is a dog trainer, a flake, the only person willing to undertake the task of civilizing the aggressive, sometimes vicious "pet" that lives with Macon.  As Macon tries to deal with his life, his loss of Sarah (who is dating), his son's dog (which attacks anything that moves), and his commitment to producing yet another travel book, his life becomes more complicated, and the depth of his relationship with Sarah, relative to the shared loss they have faced, becomes an issue which must be revisited if he is ever to engage with life and explore the possibilities of a new life which Muriel offers.  Filled with wonderful descriptions of life, both within Macon's family and in Europe, where he travels for research, the novel provides the reader with a full, realistic picture of marriage between people whose relationship has been, in part, the result of their commitment to their son.  Poignant and emotional, but avoiding melodrama, the novel explores the meaning of life and love, the extent to which a marriage may limit or stimulate the growth of the people involved, and the ways in which a marriage must adapt to the new needs of the participants if it is to endure through time. n Mary Whipple 
 I marked some passages that are very telling about the novel's wonderfully passionate sentiment.  Foremost, I greatly appreciated the lack of fear and hate Kazantzakis' Jesus shows repetitively in the novel:  {p155}  'Judas, my brother is that you?' '...I swore to my brothers and to the mother of the crucified that I would kill you.' 'I'm delighted to see you, Judas, my brother.  I'm ready... I offer you my neck...' It disgusted him to touch a neck which was offered undefended, like a lamb's... 'Why don't you resist?' '...I prepared myself to be killed... Death is not a door which closes; it is a door which opens.'  This courage alone could change a world.  It is displayed here again: {p177}  Barabbas went wild... he lifted his hand and slapped [Jesus]... 'Hit the other one too, Barabbas, my brother.'  These scenes are even more powerful for us to read with Kazantzakis portraying early that Jesus is merely a confused, deserted man aspiring for greatness: {p145}  A gypsy woman passed by... she said, 'I'll tell you your fortune... I see crosses -- crosses and stars... You'll become King of the Jews!'  '...ever since then ... I haven't been in my right mind.'  Nikos' Jesus later rises to touch this greatness.  But it's in the novel's wonderful parables he tells that hold keys to an emerging paradigm of Christianity: {p202}  'God, how can anyone be happy in Paradise when he knows that there is a man, a soul, roasting for all eternity?' ... God heard [Lazarus'] thought and was glad.  '...Beloved [Lazarus],' He said, 'go down... bring him here so that he may drink and refresh himself...'  'For all eternity?' asked Lazarus.  'Yes, for all eternity.'  Jesus got up without a further word.  It's this passionate direction and frankness that makes this character so enjoyable to read.  Nicos shows it again here, in an absolutely poignant way: {p224}  Jesus said... 'God is everywhere, old man, and we all are brothers.' 'Samaritans and Galileans too?' 'Samaritans and Galileans too, old man...' 'God and the devil too?' he asked finally. Jesus was terrified.  Never in his life had he been asked if God's mercy was so great that one day he would forgive even Lucifer...  'I don't know.  I am a man, and my concern is for men.'  I so much wish that this was the concern of theologians today.  These humanistic new ideas, found blasphemous by literal interpretations, appear again, in a compelling argument between Jesus and his best mate, Judas: {p347} 'If the soul within us does not change, Judas, the world outside us will never change.  The enemy is within, the Romans are within, salvation starts from within!'  And finally: {p466} [The angel says to Jesus], 'here is the kingdom of heaven:  earth...  Here is eternity:  ...each moment that passes.  Moments aren't enough for you?  If so, you must learn that eternity will not be either.'  If that's not liberating, then I have lost its meaning.  This should be required reading. It's Kazantzakis' best attempt at living this moment (this one) as courageously and compassionately as one man did. 
 The only studio album by the Sex Pistols was greatly anticipated and didn't disappoint for buyers who did not have access to the UK singles or live/studio bootlegs that were available at that time.  For those who purchased other releases, the album did not break any new ground with the songs. Most material had been part of the band's live shows or had been officially released as A- and B-sides of singles.   But here was a group who's music was banned on UK radio, its name not permitted on the UK charts and had numerous concerts cancelled because of the "threat" of violence from the fans & band members. Not only all that, the band was cashing checks from major record companies that signed 'em and dumped 'em seemingly overnight.  And through all the controversy came the U.S. album release. The power of the band - driven by the vocals of Johnny Lydon - is captured in classics like Anarchy in the UK, God Save the Queen and No Feelings. There were questions on who performed on the album, with persistent rumors that guitarist Chris Spedding played on most of the cuts.  While the album received either rave or poor reviews by the critics, a U.S. tour was in the works, with one published report stating the Pistols were going to perform at Madison Square Garden with tickets costing a couple of bucks. Like so much surrounding the band, the MSG show was 99.9% myth.    The Pistols were slated to debut in the U.S. with a performance on Saturday Night Live and then open their tour at The Agora in Cleveland, OH. Visa problems cancelled both gigs and the band that finally arrived was as fractured as any Stadium Rock "supergroup."   It became a game at the gigs where the band tried to outdo one another in the department of parody. The band broke up after an absolutely terrible performance at the Winterland Ballroom in San Fransisco, which was released as a bootleg some months afterward.   But for some brief moments in time, the Pistols demonstrated they were a great live band that could capture batches of their raw power in the studio.    
 I am originally from Greenville, SC and it wasn't until late in my teens that I learned that my hometown was named for Gen. Greene. This book is an excellent introductory biography of Gen. Greene that shows him as a man within the context of his age, what this Quaker's military motivation was and how he was able to grow in command extremely quickly.  The General's independent command in the Southern colonies was one of the rare pieces of American leadership and forced a much quicker end to the conflict. He was a rare and very underappreciated first American 
 This is one of the best books you will ever read about World War Two. The story starts with a girl named Kay. She has many difficulties with her step-mother "Amazing Grace". Amazing Grace has to do with most of  the plo 
 I really enjoyed this book, for the most part.  I love Rubin's sheer honesty, as well as her style of writing.  I could identify with many of her struggles, and it was very enocuraging to know that there are other people out there who think like I do.  Some people may think that Rubin is neurotic, or "whiny", but I think that she is just extremely honest and aware of her inner voice. At the end of the book, I still wanted to know more about her 
  Criativity, motivation and inovation are key factors in companies today.The simple ways the Cirque Du Soleil faces these chalenges are outstanding. I have learned interesting and important lessons for applying to my personal and professional life.  Congratulations!!! 
 This CD is awesome!  I enjoy the variety of artists and the flow of each song.  It's a very relaxing CD with great opportunities to learn about new and upcoming artists.  I definitely recommend purchasing this CD 
 The Bible of course is twaddle and the source of most of the religious tomfoolery that has plagued mankind for the last two thousand years. It has given flight to the worst sort of delusional thinking (see the Book of Revelation for a text book case of paranoid schizophrenia) and fueled the fires that fried heretics and infidels (aka freethinkers) from medieval times to the present, and destroyed civilizations vastly superior to the Judeo-Christian hegemony that gave us Auschwitz and the atom bomb. (See also the writings of the church fathers, especially Tertullian, who proclaimed "I believe because it is absurd.") But if you can forgive the Bible for being a handbook for genocide, environmental destruction, and the general excesses of human dereliction you will find many glories of the English language, at least in the KJ version. Required reading, I suppose, if only to understand how Western civilization went so terribly astray, but also for the marvelous sonorities. Read it along side Shakespeare and the Book of Common Prayer and you will be transported to realms of power and majesty rarely attained in today's literary milieu deadened by blogs, reality shows and pulp fiction ephemera. 
 Wow this is one of those books that when you first look at it it looks boring its not. I ran for the Miss pagent of my town. "In my case Miss Yucca Valley" I was told that I was going to read in this book. I love to read so I didnt think much of it. I began to read every day. I fell in love with the ideas that this book holds. I began to read every chance I got. My friends were laughing at me because all I talked about was this book. The lessons in this story really taught me something. Every teen should read it 
 I spotted this book in a store one day, and was enchanted.  Adorable illustrations complement this simple story for children about accepting differences.  While I guessed that ELmer is gay, I like how the book didn't actually say that.  It described a different personality that is just different.  Who cares what label goes with it, and who needs to assume?  Socially, we're probably a ways off from arriving at that kind of comfort, but the harder we work to normalize it, the better.  At the same time, there is nothing wrong with interpreting the story to be about sexual orientation today.  The book will always be meaningful.  Some people fear showing this to their children because of the "mean faces" and "mean names," but children's stories are plenty dark aleady, sometimes even more so.  I think the old "Ugly Duckling" is much sadder.  Depends on the kid, of course, but it's your job as a parent to guide them through a story and explain things fairly.  It's both a fable and a deeper story.  To the people who are barking about the "gay agenda":  I feel sorry for you because you've resigned yourself to believing your ill-informed propaganda.   To the people who are "closeted homophobes", who try to bury their real criticism under complaints about the word "sissy" and use the oh-so-clever, "it's okay to be gay as long as they act straight in public": you're not fooling anyone and you're not helping anything.  You're totally missing the point of the book and reading into all the wrong things.    Harvey Fierstein, great applause for you!  
 I grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local Target....  craving the Summer sun and needing an island vacation....    The cover appealled to me for these reasons and I admit I was not at all disappointed in the movie.  The scenery was indeed spectacular.  The underwater diving/snorkling scenes were clear, crisp, and just what the doctor ordered.  Even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful.  OK, enough of the shallow stuff....  the movie was indeed much like the 70's flick "The Deep" which I enjoyed back then as well.  The characters of Jared and Sam were pretty believable - poor, honest, and happy folks (most of us would love to really be this happy - let's face it!) The introduction of Bryce (played by Scott Caan) really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers, twists, etc.    Overall, the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives.  Would I want to deal with Tiger Sharks?  No, but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring 9-5 job every day.     
 This album flows so easily from one song to the next.I can actually envision the part of the movie for each song.This is one of the only soundtracks Ive ever bought but its for a reason. Every song is good not just the normal one song per album.Buy it....buy it now 
 This is an amazing, fascinating, visually stimulating documentary about the campaign that American politicians and propagandists waged against marijuana in the 20th century.  It's shocking to see just how many billions of dollars had been spent on this so-called "war" by the end of the Nineties.  All that fuss over a harmless plant that scientific studies have shown really is not the dangerous evil drug many people are led to believe it is.  There are lots of great clips from vintage movies, commercials, press conferences, and concert performances to illustrate all of the points being talked about.  For someone with an open mind, this could go a long way towards dispelling a lot of the myths about marijuana.  One by one, this documentary goes through the myths (e.g., it's a gateway drug, it will make you into a sexual predator, it'll make you lose your mind, it will make you fly into violent rages, it will wreak havoc on your brain) and counters them, using scientific studies and conversations with people who actually used the drug.  Of course, the people making up the anti-marijuana propaganda and scare tactics had never actually smoked pot themselves and had no idea what they were talking about.  And like with all members of the old guard who protest against what young people are doing, a lot of it could have very well stemmed from how when they were young people, they had fewer choices about their lives and less opportunity to do these things.  It could have been jealousy that their children suddenly had much more personal freedom to do so many things that were considered taboo and a shameful social stigma in days of yore.  We also see how the pot-smoking culture changed from decade to decade; early in the 20th century, they were mainly Mexican immigrants as opposed to how most of them in the Sixties were hippies and university students.  And indeed, the campaign against marijuana started because of racist nativist xenophobic fears about the Mexican immigrants coming into the country and bringing a strange way of life and a new cigarette with them.  The establishment thought that if white people started smoking it too, they would "devolve" into people like the Mexicans, who were thought to be inferior.  This documentary presents facts that get the message across without sounding preachy.  Anyone with a sense of social justice should feel outraged that so much fuss has been made over what is really just a simple little plant, and that anyone who is caught smoking or possessing it is treated like a moral degenerate and socially dangerous criminal 
 I started reading this to my now 19 month old twin daughters when they were 9 months old. At first they just loved looking at the colorful letters, then it moved on to giggling at the "Chicka Chicka Boom Boom!" verse. Now, they actually flip through the pages and try to read the story themselves. They will actually babble the rhythm, with a word sprinkled here and there.   I have now started to point to the letters as I read them out with their various parts ("And I and J and tag along K, all on their way up the coconut tree) and we will then sing the alphabet song with the letters that are listed on the front and back pages, again pointing to them.  Each time the book is finished, they ask me to read it again. I have read it up to five times in a row, before I myself get tired of it. I suggest you see if you can get the cd with Ray Charles as he reads it. There are also children reading it, and a couple of songs. I purchased it through Scholastic Books. I highly recommend this book 
 I appreciate the more adventuresome recipes with lots of ethnic cooking and spicing.  It does require some extra work to start with but the end results are worth the extra effort and time. I still enjoy the fact that I can walk away from the food cooking and come back 10 hours later to a delicious, ready to eat meal, with lots of variety 
 See my notes on volume 1. The enthusiasm continues unabate 
 My son was premature and was on an Apnea/Heart monitor for the first six months. We recently had a string of good downloads so his cardiologist decided to take him off the monitor. I didn't sleep for a week just lying there watching him breath (still worried), until I saw this product and ordered it right away. I've had it for about a month now and have slept much better and I know he does too since I'm not putting my hand on his back every five minutes.  The problem I have with the product- The other night my son was crying and I picked him up, forgetting to turn the monitor off and it kept sensing movement (ticking). It never alarmed! My husband and I must have watched and waited for 10 minutes. NO ALARM! Now I'm wondering if it would alarm at all. I hope it's something I'm doing wrong and can figure it out. Too many good reviews not to be a good device. That's why I gave it 4 stars. I just wish I knew why it didn't alarm 
 It doesn't get much better than this.  The guys before me sing its praises in detail.  This book hooked me on hard Sci Fi at about age 17. I read this and Berserker Wars by Saberhagen back to back and have been reading the stuff ever since 
 Finally a romantic story (not a bodice ripper) about 2 people older than twenty-something, a man and a woman who thought all the major decisions of their lives had been made and accomplished. Surprise! In a reworking of Shakespeare, very different from West Side Story, Ray takes her readers through the agonizing choices Julie and Romeo have to work through before allowing themselves to succumb to love the second time around. This plot is refreshing and real, reminiscent of the stories of Rosamund Pilcher only American. Ray's style is lucid, intelligent, and flowing. The incorporation of some bits of old Italian folk customs is colorful and amusing. This novel is a little gem 
 Once again, Fox has cancelled a brilliant show. While it is occasionally a bit off-color, the dialogue is brilliant, but apparently people couldn't follow the episodes, so no one watched this great show, and it was cancelled. I haven't tried the download option, but I highly recommend the show 
 I have not finished this book yet, but I agree with a previous review: Anne's letters were nice and funny, and helped to tell the story, but really, did L.M. Montgomery HAVE to cut out the romantic parts? I was getty really interested in Anne and Gilbert at the end of the previous book, but now we can't see how they turn out (or whatever). It would be so romantic. Another thing: I feel that I am in the deepest depths of despair because Gilbert DOES NOT SAY A SINGLE WORD IN THE ENTIRE BOOK! There were plenty of oppurtunities for him to say at least "hi." Ugh!   Other than that it's a great book and I recomend it along with the entire series. (I haven't gotten past this book yet, but I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest!)  
 The Essence of Dreams...The Creativeness of Silence...The Fortitude of Love...   
 This book is so exciting to me, the Title itself  is motivating. I read of it in a magazine, immediately went to Amazon! Sure enough, there it was. I ordered it and in a few days spent time reading it (still reading). It is so encouraging to finally find something that WORKS without making you feel defeated before you start.This book  tells me what I need to make it simple,enjoyable and excited because I know if I follow this method I can  have a clean, uncluttered  houseall of the time...without the panic on hearing the doorbell ring and find my neighbor standing there waiting to be invited in. When we visited our son and family recently, I took the book to read on the way up and back,  when his wife saw it , she wanted one. so I gave her mine, then regreted it all the way home, thinking "what if I can't find another? Not to worry, I did .Now, I'm busy reading more and doing more in  less time. I highly recommend this book  to homemakers, professionals, or any one that isn't presently using this method. Try it , you will like it! 
      A very philosophically mature Gerry Beckley comes full circle and lands smoothly in "Horizontal Fall". Sumptuous melodies meshed with delicious acoustics and veracious lyrics give this masterpiece a secure place in any library or on any ipod playlist.  Songs like "Crying", "I'll Be Gone", "Warm Gone Gray" or "Here & Now" all have a distinct "America" flavor.  The up and coming CD from America to be released in January of 07' will include "Love & Leaving" which is also included on this solo performance.  Very impressive!!!  Do not miss this Oh-- so nice CD!!!   
 I thought it showed the ignorance of the American voter, and the dire need for voter education.  In my opinion, the average American urgently needs voter education.  I believe that voter education will produce a Democratic  majority, and this book gave me data to back up my beliefs 
 Ralph McInerny does an outstanding job of exploring the start of the twenty-first century with the death of the present Pope. In addition to a well written and tightly wrapped story, McInerny does an absolutely  outstanding job of blending current religious perspectivewith the Vatican's  inner workings and the sadness seen in the Princes of the Church who have  far more invested in politics than in the pastoral or faith dimension of  their lives. The best I've read so far on Post Pope John Paul II. Far  exceeds Greeley, West and Montalbano for detail and plot development  (although I recommend each of them on this same topic). An excellent  addition to this increasingly pressing eventuality of needing to replace  the current Pope. Hopeful 
 I always recommend using the OEM cartridges for printers, especially if you print a lot of photo's. That said, I liked the convenience of ordering on-line. For about the same cost as an office supply store I got Canon cartridges from the convenience of my PC.  
 'The Way of the Shaman' by anthropologist and practicing shaman Michael Harner does an admirable job in presenting core shammanic beliefs, vivid personal experiences with indigenous practicing cultures and how-to-techniques and training for individual and group shammanic journeying.   Contents (Chapters 1-7): Discovering the Way The Shamanic Journey: Introduction Shamanism and States of Consciousness Power Animals The Journey to Restore Power Power Practice Extracting Harmful Intrusions Appendix A: Drums, Drumming Cassettes and Training Workshops Appendix B: The Hand Game of the Flathead Indians  My favorite part of the book is the beginning where he shares his first experience with hallucinogenic substances administered by the Jivaro Indian shaman of Ecuador where he encounters beings known as the "Rulers of Outer Darkness". Fascinating stuff!   I don't endorse everything in the book, but it's a good introduction to the topic, just maintain and open and discerning mind as you go through the material.  
 This is my absolute favorite book on orcas. I have read it three times. I bought it years ago at the Vancouver Aquarium while visiting the whales in the area and never tire of re-reading it. One of the the things I like are the appendices which list data on the whales. I wish Erich Hoyt would write a second volume or update it again! If you love orcas you will love this book 
 Las Christmas is a collection of stories celebrating Latino families and the celebrations around Christ's birth.  Although many of the stories are full of warmth and happiness, (and recipes), there are a few with sadness  and the poignant remembrances of poverty.  This book is a must for Spanish  teachers, like me, who want to try to capture the true "flavor"  of La Navidad 
 I love this video and show it to my 13 month old, who gets a pretty good kick out of it too.  The reasons that other folks have listed are the same reasons I love it.  But "Put Down the Duckie" is one of the best songs I've seen in a long time 
 Anything showing photos of this fellow's incredible oevre would probably deserve the highest praise even without editorial guidance. But just browsing thru this one will stun anyone not familiar with Caravaggio, which is probably 98% of the populace.Ms. Puglisi interweaves the artist's life and times around the glorious color photos. The print may be a tad small,but the fact that there's around two spaces between each line of text makes it, IMHO, even easier to read than otherwise. The raw,harrowing originality of this artist are beyond description, and his life is a near match. He died violently before the age of 40...Especially recommended for those (mainly males) who may think that Art and Art History are less than manly pursuits!! (Yes there are plenty of guys out there who think like this.) Give this book, the author,publisher, and the artist way more than five stars! 
 It is SO funny and cleverly made. It seems, at first, to be a dumb movie but on closer look one can see that that's not the case. It is very clever and just so funny! Wheneve I feel depressed, I watch it and it cheers me up! 
 DBC Pierre's ManBooker Prize winning novel "Vernon God Little" would have grabbed me more if it had not been for the somewhat pedestrian plotting. Pierre is beautifully sarcastic and I love his characterisations and observations of people, but having a bit more of a story to hang them on would have curtailed my impatience. That said, it's an extremely quirky piece of fiction and has taught be a lot of what I've always wanted to know about cursing. I want to share some of my favourite quotes with you, in no particular order. "Parents succeed by managing the database of you dumbness and your slime, ready for combat." "Famous Actors put toothpast under their eyes to help them cry. Did you know that? I'm just telling you for court, in case you look too impassive. You know how impassive you can look." "A receptionist with spiky teeth and a voicebox made from bees trapped in tracing paper sits behind a desk in Dr. Goosens' waiting room." "I end up watching these useless brown moths that thwack around the light in my cell, felty splinters torn from nighttime, lost and confused." 
 Stevens is for me the great American poet of the twentieth century.  His music is the supreme music of poetry . Not since Keats is there anyone as rich in the most elaborate kind of longworded poetry.  His metaphysical meanderings may confuse but somehow find themselves justified by the memorableness of the great lines- and again the music.  No one comes close to him in the kind of deep and complicated beauty he presents- and again the music.  The meanings he makes are musical meanings, and the sounds of his lines sing in us ever more strongly , the more we read and reread.  Stevens is the kind of poet we want to memorize and always have with us inside, so wherever we go , we can stop and to ourselves recite lines of beauty in joy.  I may be wrong but I simply hear his poetry as the greatest America has had in the twentieth century - though lesser than Whitman and Dickinson. 
 I have had 3 copies of this cd if that tells you anything. Its the first cd I play at Christmas and my daughter and I sing to the top of our lungs. Its just a great memory maker for me. Not everybody's taste 
 Terrence is probably not made for the track - since he is a tractor and is meant to be used in fields, or for plowing snow.  That said, this little guy goes about everywhere in our house and we haven't had any trouble with the tire treads.  If your child is prone to pick at such things like mine is, just to see if he can get them off, then I suggest maybe advising otherwise.  My little one figured out how to get them off very quickly, but became aggravated that they were not on when he was "plowing the field."  So, I put them back on and well, they haven't come off since.  Some neat role playing occurs with Terrence.  He just opens new doors for working outside of the track and especially with all the new construction guys that have been introduced lately like Alfie and Jack.  Terrence has a lot of fun in our house and he comes highly recommended 
 I went into a Barnes and Nobles looking to indulge myself in a quick read and noticed Dispatches from the Edge (not really what i was looking for but i thought i'd give it a read anyways), after reading a few pages i had to take the book home and read the entire thing. I was just utterly fascinated at how Anderson went off into some of the harshest regions in the world alone with a fake press pass and little experience. The book had a fascinating mix of personal tragedy and the barage of events he would witness throughout his career. I really enjoyed how the book didnt follow a linear pattern of events (...as so many do), instead the book jumped back and forth between events in his personal life and how they related to current events he witnessed while covering stories. At no point was i ever lost while reading.   He was very honest in this book about the many complex emotions of the job. Every sense was so detailed, i could almost imagine myself on the ground besides him. At times i would tear up at the utter loss that so many have felt in this world...yet in the end the world just keeps going. I would recommend this memoir to anyone. These days, so many books are released just for the name recognition yet this is not one of them. There is true emotion, feeling, loss in this book that any person could relate to on some level.  
 This DVD changed my opinion of Disney's Sleeping Beauty.  Since the story has been summarized elsewhere, my review will focus mainly on the DVD itself.  I had never been much of a fan previously and viewed this as a sort of Snow White and Cinderella also-ran, although I did love the gorgeous, sweeping adaption of Tchaikovsky's ballet, with "I wonder" and especially "Once Upon a Dream" being among Disney's finest and most transportative musical pieces.  The difference between this and prior releases of Sleeping Beauty (indeed, of many Disney movies) is that the digital restoration truly enhances the film possibly beyond what, as one reviewer put it, may actually have been experienced by the original theatrical audience.    The results are nothing short of stunning!  At last, viewers can really see the intricate details of Eyvind Earle's brilliant animated medieval tapestries, any still of which could hang in an art gallery.  For a comparison, check out the unrestored segments on Disk 2, such as the trailers, and see how grainy and washed out those look.  Whereas, in DVD's like Bambi and Cinderella, the restoration went somewhat overboard with excessive brightness and "dead" backgrounds in the former, and questionable color "improvements" in the latter, for this release of Sleeping Beauty, Disney struck the right balance.  One note on this "Special Edition"; that term has been used rather loosely by Disney over the years.  This 2-disk set actually contains a fair amount of extra material, including a few rarities like vintage documentaries and specials apparently found nowhere else, such that it could technically be called "Platinum."  While the word is that Sleeping Beauty will eventually be given a proper "Platinum" treatment, perhaps on Blu-Ray, that won't be for at least a few years yet.  The time and care devoted to crafting Sleeping Beauty shows. It was an elegant 70mm stereophonic visual and sonic feast that fit in well with other literally "big" movies of 1959, even though it nearly bankrupted the studio at the time.  Given the film's ever-increasing stature within the Disney canon, particularly its acknowledged influence on anime, I would especially like to see a theatrical re-release, with further sound enhancements, as I believe it would play well in modern cinemas.  The sheer spectacle and escapism of Sleeping Beauty outweighs whatever shortcomings have existed in terms of character development.  (For the record, aside from the three fairies who take up the most screen time but are less irritating than Cinderella's rodentia, 1. Aurora is every bit as appealing as Snow White or Cinderella, 2. Disney finally managed to create a believable prince in Phillip, and 3. Maleficent is an awesome villainess who can transform herself into a scary dragon and doesn't need any magic mirror to tell her what to do!)  The bottom line is, if you are a fan of classic animation, epic fairytales, or the grandeur of Tchaikovsky, Sleeping Beauty is a must.    For these reasons, I heartily recommend Sleeping Beauty Special Edition. 
 I have read a few stylebooks in my day, but reading this one was the most fun I've had while actually learning something.  I felt like I was reading a friendly book. He is not one of those fashion snobs who make you feel bad about your body or cluless about your clothes. It was funny, smart, informative, and had a great flow to it. It went through all the basics, but also let me in on a few secrets I did not know about.  --I am now looking at the necklines of all my tops, which has made a huge difference with my shoulders (and the girls.) I had no idea that wearing a deep v-neck top with my small shoulders and small breast was a bad thing????  --I bought a cute new pair of jeans--with a little bit of effort and some help from Sam's book--that my kids say make me look "cooler."  Now they can sleep at night...ha!  --The tailoring chapter was really great--I took my "cool" new jeans to be fixed on the way home before I ever wore them..."Stop off and Drop off" I now feel like I can talk to my tailor and know what I want done without being shy or feeling stupid. I also have no more gap at the small of my back from bad fitting jeans.  --I promise I will no longer wear clothes that are "almost right", as long as I can afford to get things tailored...ha!  --I also tried "the twist" with an old bra, and it really does work!!! (Though I still love my padded bras)  A lot of the other stylebooks have a tone that is harsh and judgmental.  Not this book. Things are explained in an easy to understand way, without assuming that the reader should know everything about styles and types of clothes and fashion. I always felt stupid when I did not understand what a certain term was, this book describes things really well.  I have watched Extreme Makeover many times waiting for Sam's part to come on, because I'd actually learn something (and the surgery was gross.) I always wanted his part to be longer because I wanted more information and he talks too fast...:) This book is like a whole episode of Sam, complete with his funny way of making women feel good about themselves even when he's talking about something NOT so good...ha!  My only complaint is that I wanted to see more of the pictures that were on the cover--the book has lots of cute drawings which help and are very stylish and well done--but the pictures on the cover have some great things written on them that I could not read very well. I was about to get out my magnifying glass...ha!  This book will not disappoint you.  As a divorced mother of two, I needed something to help me get off my butt, make some changes, and feel better about myself.  I read the whole thing, had few good laughs and now I know a heck of a lot more about how to get dressed 
   Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) lived a long and fruitful life. He was born in Dorchester in the West of England (called Wessex in his numerous novels) to poor but industrious parents. Tom enjoyed playing the fiddle with his father at various celebrations in the community. He was a studious lad who had a liking for the ladies. Deprived of a university education due to Britain's rigid class system he was articled to a local architect. While on a journey to restore a Cornwell church he met and in 1874 married Emma Gifford.    Hardy shot to fame with such great novels as "Far From the Madding Crowd" "Two on a Tower"; "A Pair of Blue Eyes"; "The Return of the Native"; "The Woodlanders" "Tess of the Durbervilles"; "The Mayor of Casterbridge" and his last dark novel "Jude the Obscure." Hardy's vision is tragically dark. He was an atheist who viewed humanity as alone in the universe. Hardy believed he was a poet writting novels (which were often serialized) to pay the bills.  He was, nevertheless, a great novelist whose lyrical description of the English countryside, irony and ability to draw such enchanting women characters as Eustacia Vye, Tess and tragic heroes such as Michael Henchard have placed his name high on the list of English fiction writers.   Hardy had a love-hate relationship with his wife Emma. Emma was religious and eccentric. Her family refused to associate with Hardy and his family led by his indomitable mother Jemima did not like Emma. The couple enjoyed biking across the countryside; spent the season in London and kept a menagerie of dogs and cats at their ugly home Max Gate near Dor-chester close to Hardy's birthplace of Brockhampton.   Hardy always loved the ladies. He had platonic relationships with several ladies such as Francis Henniker. After the death of Emma in 1912 he married his much younger secretary Florence Dugdale who survived him. Hardy died in 1928 at an advanced age disdaining modern life. He is the last in the line of great nineteenth and early twentieth century novelists.    Claire Tomalin is a distinguished literary biographer of such figures as Jane Austen, Samuel Pepys and others. In this fairly short biography she emphasized how great a poet Hardy was and what a miserable marriage he experienced. Hardy, she says, was retiring and did not like to be touched.  The marriage with Emma was childless and the couple grew apart. Tomalin's book is written with clarity and is well illustrated. Her bibliographic use of first person accounts of people who knew Hardy is impressive.    The Tomalin biography is not as detailed as that done by Michael Milligate or Martin Seymour-Smith but to this reviewer's eyes it is a great way to be introduced to Hardy and his world. I always read any new book by Claire Tomalin. Her Hardy biography is worthy of your time and money. Return to the time when England was moving from a rural to an industrial society and enjoy the beautiful prose and poetry from the pen of Hardy 
 Terribly interesting. I got it especially for Gen.P.Orridge's essays. It's also got a great Crowley section and a nice piece on John Dee. This is both a great collection for seasoned occultists and magick enthusiasts and an excellent launch pad for those delving for the first time. Enjoy 
 I initially purchased this CD because of the Roots.  My thinking is that anytime you can get any product with the Roots performing live, you should cop it.  However, it was through this album that I actually became a Jay-Z fan.  Prior to this release, I did not like the Jiggaman at all.  It wasn't anything that he did, I just didn't give him a chance.  I just thought that he was another overhyped, commercial emcee from Brooklyn and I had no patience for that.  I rep the underground, fool!  But this album caused me to appreciate Jay-Z for what he is:  yes, he's popular; yes, he's all over MTV; yes, all of his albums go platinum based on his name alone, but none of those are reasons enough to despise him.  The man is a talented emcee and a good lyricist and this album reinforces his strengths.  There's no way that a rapper who is just a studio creation would be able to sound as dope as Jay does with a live backing band.  My favorite moments on the album:  3)  During "Takeover" when Jay-Z is dissing Mobb Deep and Nas, the beat switches over to "Shook Ones" and "Oochie Wally"/"New York State of Mind," respectively.  I thought that that pretty clever on the parts of Jay and the Roots, and is something that can only be done with live instruments (I can't see the cats from Queensbridge ok'ing their tracks to be sampled so that they could be dissed by them).  2)  Jay-Z getting lost at the end of "Song Cry."  That was a pretty touching moment, and is probably the first thing that allowed me to start appreciating him.  It shows that he's not just writing for the sake of it, but actually puts thought and feeling into his lyrics.  1)  Jaguar Wright absolutely GRABBING ownership of "Ain't No Love."  There is no way you can listen to her singing on it and then hear it any other way ever again.  Like I stated earlier, I purchased the album because fof the Roots and comparing this album with their own live project (aptly titled THE ROOTS COME ALIVE) just further underscores how supremely talented these cats are.  Their album basically captures a Roots performance, which is all over the place with incredible improvisation and off the cuff moments.  On JAY-Z UNPLUGGED they do a complete 180.  They bear down and with their live instruments actually re-create studio sounds initially made with programming and samples.  The fact that they can do both, and do so better than just about anyone else out there just shows how talented they are 
 I am and have been a huge Garth Nix fan for several years.  I have chased after this series since the very first book Mr. Monday and have waited patiently till I have come to Lady Friday.  I am not sure why I feel differently about this book, than I do the others or even if I've just out grown the series.  I don't feel that anything new or interesting happens in this books.    Half way through the book, I got tired of the same old stuff happening to Arthur and his constant protestations about wanting to stay a Muggle (or whatever the term is), but I just had to fast forward to the final chapter to see how it ends.  I think that the author rushed this book a little too much and didn't invest too much creative energy in making this books shine like the others in the series have.  It could be just that the series can't be sustained to last 7 books, and his next book should just be titled "The Weekend Twins" or something like that.  Either way, I was not impressed with the book.  I still love the author and will religiously pick up any of his future works. 
 This is a must have book for anyone whow wants to learn and use efficiently the new JPA API. The authors explains very easily how to map all kinds of classes to a database, even for more complexes relationships between entities.  It is also a great book to be used as a reference when designing enterprise applications. Mainly if you are a Java programmer and not an expert database architect.  I highly recommend it 
 Dr. Karty does an excellent job of organizing organic chemistry by its fundamental topics! His method makes learning organic chemistry very feasible and provides the student with effective stratagems for solving problems. As a pre-medical student who constantly worries about doing well, I am glad to have been exposed to such a useful tool that gave me confidence and helped develop a clear understanding of such a complex topic. Thank you Dr. Karty 
 As the follow-up book to 'Touching the Voids' Simpson details his life with the emotion and detail you would expect from a truely remarkable individual.  From his early childhood to his most advanced expeditions this  book takes you on a journey through the highest and lowest points of  Simpsons life.  Truely blessed with the ability to write with a fine  balance of humour and compassion 'This game of ghosts' captured me with  three basic emotions; extreme happiness, sadness and a great deal of  despondency to finish the book, Perfect 
 My 1 yr old loves these blocks, and so do I.  They are sturdy and they have old style charm.  The ONLY gripe I have about these blocks is one of these blocks has a sea lion on it, but is labelled "seal."  It's a commonly made mistake 
 Considered by many to be Teena's best work for Motown (My personal preference is "Irons In The Fire"), this album was by far her most successful work for the label.  Interestingly, it would be her last and was birthed in the midst of great legal and financial woes.  From start to finish, this album has PUNCH.  The title track kicks the album off with a steamroller of energy and a fun guest spot from The Temptations.  It sets the pace for what the album is: a celebration of the world of music...and the host of influences that comprises the work of Teena Marie.  "Revolution" is an incredible lyric, inspired by the assasintation of John Lennon and is the second piece of political work that Teena recorded for Motown (the first being "Too Many Colors" from "Lady T"). Rick James lends his voice to the track and the two, as always, blend brilliantly.  Teena definitely had some "starburst" moments...particularly with the standout upbeat tracks, "365" and "Square Biz".  "365" (according to the liner notes) was inspired by Aretha Franklin and comes off as warm as a spring day.  "Square Biz", probably this album's most popular track, is a quick autobiography of Teena's life...and she blesses everyone from her godmother to Brahms to Nikki Giovanni (something she most recently followed up with "La Dona"'s "Makaveli Never Lied").  Mad props to the Stone City Band for lending an incredible rhythm and horns section to the whole album, but these two tracks in particular.  They leave an indelible impression.  Teena wears her heart on her sleeve with the ballads most notably on the simple piano and strings "Yes Indeed".  It's been reported that this is Teena's favorite song that she's recorded...and it is certainly one of her most prolific lyrics.  When she croons the line "You broke my spirit", we all feel the pain and glory of her heartache.  "Portuguese Love" is a tour de force...Eight amazing minutes...It's hard to say exactly what it is that makes this track stand out, because all of the elements are so distinct. The percussion is amazing...but so are the horns...the strings...and all of the vocal nuances that Teena has happening in the background.    The bonus edition has an incredible live moment...Teena covering Donny Hathaway's "Someday We'll All Be Free" and seguing into her own "De Ja Vu" (which is an incredible 12 minute experience).  Motown did an incredible job with the packaging on this reissue...even giving us the poem from the original backcover (something Sony DIDN'T do with the "Robbery" reissue) in addition to new photos and a great essay by A. Scott Gallaway which features an interview with Teena.  
 This fellow gives new meaning to irreverence and "farce". His views on the virtues of having a satirically empty head  as written by one appears to be the well written best example? His characterization of the English upper class as both idle  and clueless came too close to the truth. Yet he mostly has happy endings and a good laugh for all 
 This is an excellent overview of Indian art for beginners.  It takes you through the major periods and styles, and concisely explains why each artistic/architectural development is significant 
 Like my cousin who said he loves his Grandpa book, I too think it's a great book for those who are looking to know more about the anatomy of ducks. Along with Dick's other books and works, he always put so much  effort into everything he did. I was there when many of the pictures for  the book were taken. The pictures that look as if they were taken on a real  pond were actually done at a pond on property Dick owned. He took a goose  decoy, placed an electric motor, prop and controls inside, and a remote  controlled camera pointing out from its side. Before his death, he told me  he wanted to come up with a way to take pictures of ducks and geese from  the air. He talked of developing a remote controlled goose with a camera  that would fly. I believe he would have done! It is truely a pleasure to  look at my copy of the book and remember his genius 
 Until recent times, in this age of terrorists, the Western world's most memorable impression of the Middle East came through Scheherazade and her wonderful tales of "The Thousand and One Arabian Nights." That's why it was a pleasure to leave behind the suicide bombings, beheadings and snarling hatred, to revisit this magical world of romance and intrigue; even if only for one night.  Most of us are familiar with the best-known tales of the Arabian Nights, `Aladdin and the Magic Lamp' and `Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves' but as the story goes, there were more, a lot more.  Plot  Emmy award winning, Arabian Nights, is a shortened interpretation of the saga of Scheherazade, an Arab Queen who delayed her scheduled execution by weaving a web of incredible tales for a thousand and one nights. Each night she would tell her enchanting tale, making sure to leave the story unfinished at dawn forcing the king to stay her execution on a daily basis, until finally, he was hopelessly in love with her, and deferred her execution permanently.  The Story  The Sultan Schariar (Dougray Scott) was driven paranoid by his wife's infidelity and collusion in his assassination attempt by his brother Shazanon. (James Frain) - an attack, in which the Sultaness was killed. Needing to take a wife to keep his throne from his brother, and no longer able to trust the women close to him, the Sultan concocts a bizarre plan in which he will execute his bride the morning after their wedding.  Knowing full well, that it is Sultan Schariar's (Dougray Scott) intention to have her executed the morning after their marriage, Scheherazade, (Mili Avital) the Grand Vizar's daughter and childhood friend of the young prince, volunteers to marry the Sultan in an effort to bring him back to his senses while saving other women of the harem from a similar fate.  On the wedding night, Scheherazade begins telling the Sultan a story, which extends far into the night. It is the story of `Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.' By daybreak, the scheduled time of execution, she is at a crossroads in the tale and the frustrated king suspends the execution for a day. So goes the pattern Scheherazade initiated, deftly weaving the fabric of an enthralling story, yet not finishing each night and getting a morning reprieve. This goes on for a thousand nights, until the Sultan not only trusts her but loves her as well.  Arabian Nights was a made for TV movie which aired on Hallmark Theater early in 2000. This condensed version shows only five of the hundreds of tales that Scheherazade ostensibly spins for the Sultan. In a twist, the show tries to portray how these tales later helped the Sultan turn back an attack sponsored by his treacherous brother. For me, this seemed rather forced as the tales only mildly fit the scenario in which they were placed.  Not unexpected, the film takes liberties by varying from both history, being Persian rather than Arab, and the actual story, wherein Scheherazade had a little sister and portraying Scherazade as the first wife chosen, rather than the last of a bloody trail of previously executed women.  As a whole, the show was most enjoyable. Almost but not quite five stars. The acting, especially by Mili Avital was very good, the story flowed well and despite it's extensive length of almost three hours, never loses the viewer's interest.  This is a family movie, suitable for all but the youngest (under six) of children 
 Wow!  Well, no, this will NOT be everyone's cup of tea. However, if you like Aphex Twin's musical reductionism, Squarepusher's disjointedness, Radiohead's stream-of-conciousness poetry, and Matmos's then-remembered melodic fragmentation, you will ADORE this album. Sets up a sort of harmonic mantra.  It is often disjointed and makes me think of poorly remembered memories of songs I thought I knew. It's sometimes mayhem, yet quite tranquil at the same time.  A little bit like Mum... on cocaine... with a guitar 
 Not far from participating in the Vote for Change Tour during the 2004 presidential champain, 2005's Stand Up is filled with a lot of political statements when you listen to the lyrical content in two of the album's best songs with "Everybody Wake Up," and "You Might Die Trying," and they still show the deep thought the band has always had. "American Baby," is another exceptional piece and filters feelings on political and emotional levels. Musically, the production is tight, and while the songs don't carry the instrumental pauses or extended jams as often, they also don't lack the energy. Tinsley's violin may sound a little more discreet, but not lacking as he takes control in the final moments of "You Might Die Trying," and plays a fabulous finishing take on "Louisiana Bayou,"(and Tinsley plus the band jam long and hard when they perform these tracks live). The band experiment with some musical edges with soft R&B on "Stolen Away on 55th & 3rd," and the Southern Country feel on "Louisiana Bayou," but there are a few flaws here and there. "Smooth Rider," would be the dud on this release and not one I would consider as the band's shining moment. "Hello Again" doesn't work well either. But overall, the Dave Matthews Band haven't lost their musical cool and conclude with two more great tracks in "Steady As We Go," and "Hunger For the Great Light," containing the spiritual honesty and raw emotion the band is so well-known for.   
 If you are doing a writing project, trying to get ideas to write, or just in the mood to learn something about your favorite authors, then Author Talk is a book that you should read. It is very in-depth, and it provides an up close and personal look at the lives of many different writers. This is a great book that is worth looking at even briefly when you are passing through the biography or children's nonfiction section of your library 
 The author is the unsurpassed guru of InterNet searching, and is explicitly relied upon by other authors engaging in the same work.  His website is the mother lode of additional information, which is very helpful.  If you have one book on your shelf regarding InterNet resources, this should be it.  That said, Mr. Sherman relies heavily upon explanations of the breadth and depth of various resources; these explanations are designed to pique the reader's interest in further self-directed exploration, but may be more than the average searcher might need 
 This is an excellent book giving very complete instructions for a quilt based on variations of the Rose of Sharon block. It contains full size patterns and a clear photograph of each block, as well as pictures of the  finished quilt in a both a 12 and 20 block version. There are also photos  of the quilt in several colourways - including blues and autumn tonings.  Can't wait to begin 
 This is a beautiful book! The illustrations are worth the price of the book. However, its text is quite lacking in many areas 
 I have read over thirty books on the subject of blackjack.  The third edition of Blackbelt ranks right up there as one of the best.  It is the most comprehensive, well rounded text that I have read.  The beginning blackjack player will learn everything they need in this one source to become a proficient advantage player.  The expert player will learn advanced techniques that are only mentioned in other books 
 Any drum teacher worth having will insist you buy this book. I bought this for my daughter who will be adding jazz drumming to her arsenal of rock drumming. This is one book all drummers should hav 
 There are two problems with this book. The first is that it should have been longer. For the first four hundred pages Wolfe builds up our interest in a host of great characters. The book shows every inch of Wolfe's narrative abilities and he delivers a terrific page-turning pace. But then he seems to tire and all the loose ends are clumsily tied up as the last page nears. Up to that point the book had been wonderful - as good as the Bonfire of the Vanities and more believable than a Man in Full. The second problem is that Wolfe seems to lose his nerve with the subject. Why doesn't he subject the odious Quat to the sort of biting satire that the Reverend Bacon received in Bonfire of the Vanities? You know that a satirist has lost his way when he starts picking only on the easy targets 
 I really have enjoyed watching the movie...three times already and I can say that it "tickles" your mind and think a lot of things at the end of it.  Dont judge the book by its cover they say .... and its correct. 
 Great book. I've worked on a few late night shows, and Alex's blog and book have helped me shape my spec and move into scripted work. If you're getting ready to go to meetings, this book will give you the right language to use so you don't sound like an amateur. I completely recommend it, especially to stand-up comedians who want to write more than jokes. 
 I found the book both informative and well written.  Having lived in the  Texas Panhandle for 21 years, I could easily relate to the area.  What made  the book double interesting for me was the way it helped me to connect the  dots, so to speak, of the period since some of my acquaintences lived  through that period 
 I saw _The Incredibles_ in the theatre, & was blown away. When it came out on DVD, I bought it immediately, & have since watched it three more times, something I've done with only a few other films of any sort.  After sitting through that delightful & well-crafted rollercoaster, what stood out most in memory was the artwork in the closing credits. And when I watched the Features & noted the artwork tacked to the walls in the studio, I needed to find out more.  The heroes of this film, for me, are the artists who created apparently most of those angular saturated-color "sketches," Lou Romano (primarily responsible for the closing-credits illustrations) & Teddy Newton (whose techniques of creating "sketches" & panels from cut-out bits of photographs). Between them, they seem to have provided half of what's in the book.  The book looks pricey until you realize that it's entirely on heavy gloss paper. I entirely recommend this to artists of any stripe (advertising, fine arts, computer rendering) & to digital renderers from programmers to detailers -- this shows you what you start with & some tantalizing little bits of evolution. And, it's simply a great bit of fun & visually amazing 
 Mr Wheaton seems to understand a very fundamental problem that we all share.  We are, regardless of whether we believe it or not, all influenced by what we are exposed to.  Advertisers understand that very well.  No one forces kids to eat the junk that advertisers are pushing.  No one forces a kid to start smoking just because all of his friends do.  And as another reviewer pointed out, no one forces college students to engage in harmful activities.  But the fact is - they do it anyway. Even the best of kids (and adults for that matter) are influenced by their peers.  So do we not warn them of the pressures and temptations that they will face because we know that no one will force them into anything?  Of course not.  If they are at least warned about what they are getting into, they have a much better chance of "keeping the faith".  A truth that christians have accepted is that we all need help to stay on track.  We know we are all weak with out the help of the Lord.  Mr. Wheaton is offering very practical help for those who honest enough with themselves to acknowledge they need help.  Most students don't realize they need help so they are not open to it when it is made available.  "For those who have ears, let them hear. 
 Like all of the Jodi Picoult novels I've read to date, this one slides down as easily as ice cream. She is a masterful storyteller, with the ability to pull you into a time and place, and an extraordinary family situation. Plain Truth tells the story of an Amish girl by the name of Katie Fisher and the lawyer, Ellie Hathaway, who defends her in a murder trial. Katie is accused of neonaticide, killing a baby she refuses to admit she delivered even though it is a medically indisputable fact that she has just given birth.  The plot unfolds around the psychological treatment of Katie and Ellie's immersion into the Fisher family and the Amish (or Plain) way of life. It held my interest from the start, until what at first appears to be a tidy (and disappointing) ending. But to my delight, it offers an unexpected twist. I read the last page with complete satisfaction.  Certainly a must for Picoult fans, but for readers unfamiliar with her work, if you like well-written stories, with emphasis on both character AND plot, this one's for you. Additionally, if you have any interest in the Amish culture, this book is interesting and enlightening. Picoult has certainly done her research.

 This is a great book.  You almost feel that you shouldn't be reading some of it.  Many of the letters are touching.  There is a great diversity of material.  I am surpised by how many different and interesting subjects are  covered 
 My cousin has one of these bears.  He allowed me to play with it.  I really liked it.  I'm going to save up my money so that I can buy two of them.  These bears are able to move their heads and front paws, although the bottle doesn't have a purpose except that you can pretend to feed them.  
 An indispensable reference for Jazz fans, especially for those interested in pre-Coltrane Jazz, like yours truly. 
 JD Robb delivers another hit in the Eve Dallas series.  If you have begun the series at the beginning, by now Eve and Roarke seem like people you know personally, and even better, like as individuals.  The plot and action are fast paced with enough twists and turns to hold your interest from beginning to end.  Can't wait to read the next "episode" 
 James' style is indeed difficult. I found that reading some sections of the novel aloud helped me keep my focus and enhanced my enjoyment of James' language. Also, I read the Norton Critical Edition and the critical essays that accompanied the text help me get a lot more out of the story than I would have been able to on my own - Milly, the American innocent vs. the mercenary and dehumanized Kate Croy; Densher as typical Jamesian hero, charming, goodwilled but morally indecisive; self-consciousness or self-knowledge as characteristic of James' greatest heroes and heroines 
 Is it because each of her novels is as finely crafted as this one? Or, is it because she prefers to put thought, depth and profound consideration into her books, rather than churn out multi-volume "epics" that go on far too long?  "The Privilege of the Sword" is as wonderful as Ms. Kushner's previous novels about Riverside. I am always amazed by the exquisite detail that she includes in her stories. She includes not only seemingly frivilous descriptions about clothing, furnishings and food, but telling details about the society of Riverside--the manners, social structure and culture. Best of all, she makes her characters come alive with engaging descriptions of how they stand, their facial expressions, and of course, how they FEEL about particular situations.  And the situations in "Privilege" are VERY particular! A young, impoverished noblewoman is "sold", not into slavery, but into swordsmanship. The young lady, Katherine, is a one of the most lovable female characters to appear in a fantasy for quite some time. She defeats other swordsman in duels--and she is always as surprised as the onlookers! She becomes quite accomplished at her craft, but never stops longing to join society, and enjoy being a young woman crossing into adulthood.  The plot of this delightful book is elaborate as the snowy white lace that everyone seems to either wear, make or covet. Although it may appear to be another "swords and sorcery" fantasy, there is not one ounce of sorcery in it, but a tremendous amount of beautifully described swordplay.  And every single swordfight scene resonates with depth and meaning which propel the plot and affect the characters in profound ways.  Charming, funny and a real treat, "The Privilege of the Sword" stands head and shoulders above the glut of fantasy novels available.  Thank you for writing so "slowly", Ms. Kushner! Always worth the wait.  
 Few works survive two and a half thousand years and remain a masterpiece. This is one of them.  Thucydides crisp account of the long struggle that brought disaster to his native Athens is remarkable for it's candor, despite events that must have been tragically painful. The text includes legendary personalities (Pericles, Alcibiades, Demosthenes, Nicias, etc): their actions, words, and fate. Facts license readers to decide what's important, and the events described are worthy of discerning the essence of humanity.  Who would have thought the promise of Persian defeat (told by Herodotus) would be squandered in a tedious contest that ultimately proved grave for all involved? Athens' distinction as the first democracy makes it a vital epic (given recent attempts to democratize the Middle East). Melos destiny at Athens' hands may give pause. As may the Syracuse expedition (especially Book Seven).  I read Warner's translation thirty years ago (it was 50p then), and still turn to it from time to time. Also recommended: `The Landmark Thucydides' (Robert Strassler, Victor Davis Hanson). This is a volume for those willing to spend a bit more to obtain the history matched with maps and footnotes 
 david kersh is my favorite country singer!  he's sooooooo SEXY!  he is very talented and i love him to death!  his 2 cd's are my favorite cd's that i've ever owned!  if you dont have them you need to get them!  i absolutely love every single one of his songs!  he's THE MAN!  it doesnt get any better than david kersh! you'll fall in love with him and his songs just like i did 
 If the Eagles never won a Best New Artist Grammy,I'm sure they were at least a nominee. Here is their 1972 self-titled debut featuring three Top 10 hits:TAKE IT EASY which begins this album,WITCHY WOMAN and the soft-rock PEACEFUL EASY FEELING. This is followed by five more non-compilation albums on the Asylum label. 
 . . . a very challenging combination.  I recommend this for everyone developing an e-mail application.  Every standard that it covers is done in a thorough fashion.  It is much more readable and comprehensible than the RFCs themselves, but no less accurate.  The author obviously speaks from experience when writing about specific traps, and how the protocols are used in the real world 
 When I first read this book I was overwhelmed by the information and have had to struggle through all of the technical work. There is so much to learn, and much of it is technical.  That said,  Mr. Lynch goes out of his way to help his readers, and includes extra tools on his website as well as a forum.  The extra tools alone pay for the book - he includes Curves and demonstrates how valuable this is.  He also has tools to give you great photo frames, etc, with a few quick moves.  If you are willing  to put in hours learning to achieve his results you will be very happy with this book. If you simply wish a basic beginning book on Elements this is NOT the book for you.  I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to be proficient with Elements 2.  I am going to buy the Elements 3 book 
 This is a professional review from a dietitian and diabetes educator. A wonderful cookbook for people who want to prepare meals at home to promote a healthier lifestyle. Ideal for busy families, people at risk or who have diabetes, those who need to trim calories or lose weight and those who want to reduce their saturated fats and sodium. This book is packed with practical tips on shopping, motivating reminders, sound and up-to-date nutrition information and quick, easy and delicious recipes. This is a rare treasure and is especially helpful for someone who wants to learn how to cook healthy meals or anyone who needs more variety in their menus! I recommend it to many of my clients and they are always pleased to report back to me on their new success stories in the kitchen that the whole family enjoyed 
 What a delightful surprise this 2 disc album was and I'm not a big fan of Christmas music.  I loved all the selections and felt they were well performed.  This is a true "must have" for any Christmas collection.  Superior to many other compliations on the market.  This one is a keeper!  It is the one album I'll pick first to listen to after Thanksgiving 
 A lot of people think that "Nicholas Nickleby" is a bit of disorganized confusion, but I think it's a pretty good effort.  It is one of Dickens' earlier works, and he certainly did get better as time went on, but there is greatness here too.  Dickens is noted for his social commentaries with his books, and with this one he took shots at an actual private school -  Dotheby's Hall and it's master Wackford Squeer - and the book actually did cause reforms to be implemented in the infamous school.  The hero Nicholas is the handsome, warm-hearted son of a widow whose husband's death left her and her two children impoverished.  With the help of a shrewd, miserly uncle, Nicholas obtains a post at Dotheby's Hall.  Nicholas finds conditions at the school impossible to tolerate, so he thrashes his employer and quits in disgust.  The rest of the book outlines Nicholas' life in London.  There are a lot of characters in this book, and it's difficult to keep them all straight, but Dickens' skill for characterization shows itself even in this early work, and the reader gets to know and love each one.  The plot is a bit melodramatic and complicated, but the characters almost carry that failing through.  Certainly worth a read 
 I love watching movies and this is an awesome projector with an outstanding image quality. Obviously, like everything else in life it does not fit everybody's needs. Let me explain.  We don't have a spare room in our house that can be used as a dedicated theater. So, ceiling mount and fixed screen is out of the question. Also, I do not have dedicated audio speakers. Portability without compromising on image quality was critical for me. I had three options: Optoma, DV10, Epson Moviemate and 'tape a cyberhome dvd player to a regular projector'. I chose Optoma DV10 for its image quality.  This thing is very portable. I plug it in, pop in a dvd and project it on a wall in our family room. Even without a screen, the image quality is outstanding. Some days when we feel like it, I carry it upstairs (its like carrying a laptop) and project it on a wall in the bedroom. You get the point.  We use the built-in speakers and a sub-woofer. Not ideal, but works until I get a better speaker system. For tiny 5 watt speakers, they are actually quite good. You SHOULD listen to it before making a decision either way. Reviews don't really help much in this regard.  Overall, if portability and picture quality are decision variables for you, this is a great projector. If you have a spare room that can be a dedicated theater, this is probably not for you 
 Have you ever been to a model home in a midwestern suburban housing development in the midst of being completed? These houses, constructed inside and out to look as though the most pleasant families in the world have been happily inhabiting them for years, create the kind of warmth and familiarity that one could be convinced can never exist elsewhere. Nowhere else except perhaps in the cascading strains of "Yellow House". Much comparison has been made between The Grizzlies and The Beach Boys and Animal Collective...but I hear bits of Eno at his most jilted, Vashti Bunyan at her most tender and even, yes, Aphex Twin at his most melodic. This is not experimental music for pop fans, nor is it pop for fans of experimental music. This is intriguing music at its most populist...tuneful, expansive, exposed and redemptive 
 This is one of the most exciting thrillers I saw in the 90's. Kurt Russell's performance is great! The cinematography and direction are excellent.  The movie works because it doesn't try to be TOO serious. This is a Hollywood thriller, so the action certainly gets extravagant at points. The premise of the film is a fantastic setup.   I love films like this where the editing is paced, rather than sporadic and choppy. For instance, the scene with Kurt Russell climbing on the outside of the semi is shot masterfully. The tension is real. The supporting roles played by Kathleen Quinlan and J.T. Walsh are convincing.   This movie, considering the low price it's at these days, must be owned. It's one of Kurt Russell's best films. 
 This book can be useful to the layman and has the depth for the pro.    The author clearly knows her subject and has the technical expertise.  The biology and chemistry is over my head (it has been a loooong time since taking those classes), but it is actually readable.  Some items simply have to be taken on faith if you haven't got the background to fully comprehend everything. In other words, one does not have to understand 'redox equations' to get the content.   I haven't tried her methods yet, but I am intrigued.  It goes against most of my library, but she makes a lot of sense.   
 Koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late 1500s. The career and tactics of this Admiral are still studied at the U.S. Naval Academy, and doubtless those of other nations. The screenplay is based on a couple of novels, so there is some fiction, but the life of Yi Soon Shin was well documented, so there's plenty of fact supporting the story.   If you are not familiar with Korean Drama, it's good to keep in mind that  this is not a Hollywood product, but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non-Hollywood budgets involved, and it's easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told.   It's a long series, but presents an epic with power, depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode.  It would be great also to see KBS make other dramas available for viewing through Amazon, such as "Seoul 1945".       
 This is one Great Book! Easy to follow, real advice ... a leap towards healing the warped image we have of our bodies, especially in this culture where the emphasis on image often ranks above substance.  Personally, this book helped me to connect deeper to my body, I am now including short mini-meditations specifically to connect with the center/belly.  The instructions are clear and easy and much of it can be done in a matter of minutes!  I have also finally changed my wardrobe to eliminate restrictive clothing, my posture changed in the process as well and I feel SO much better!  I have recommended this book to many of my female friends, clients and acquaintances and will continue to do so.  A real jewel 
 I use the book along with my Peterson Field Guide and am able to distinguish birds from each other by what the birds tend to eat, according to Birds At Your Feeder.    Some birds, from far away, even with your binoculars, may be so similar in appearance (size and color), and their visits to your feeders so short, that you can't get a good enough look a them. However, what they eat will help you to identify the birds.  For instance, that small gray bird might be a titmouse, a thrush or a vireo.  But what did they choose to eat from your feeders?  Was it mixed seed, sunflower or suet?  I flip through the Peterson Guide to select which birds might meet the size and appearance, and then refer to BAYF for what those birds most commonly eat, using process of elimination to identify the bird. 
 It is booth a drama and comedy with a good mix of booth.Casting is tremendeasly good and it gives many hours of joyful watching and relaxation. For us who have grown upp with the show it also give us a nostalgian feeling of times gone but remebered. The same review includes all three seasons. B.A.Gorton, Sweden 
 With all of the designs for tesla coils circulating the internet I was curious why I should pay $10 for this book.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The detail and simplicity of the book make it a great beginners guide.  I am using the authors general design but altering it in some ways to give it my own flair.  Mine is nearly complete!! With this book you really don't need to know anything about a Tesla Coil to build one (just have some basic Algebra skills).  I highly recommend it 
 This is a nicely padded case with a separate front pouch that will easily hold a couple of batteries and a memory stick if you need it to.  It fits my DSC-W100 (3.75 x 2.5 x 1 inch, "excluding protrusions") fairly loosely.  Both pouches have high-quality double zippers.  The case is too bulky for most pockets.  I have a separate leather case that fits snug enough for that, but the leather case has absolutely no room for accessories.  I can fit the camera in the leather case inside the main pouch, although it's a squeeze.    This case has a belt loop and a clip for a strap, but no strap.  If you just want a hand strap, you can thread your camera's own strap out between the double zippers and through the clip.  That arrangement will allow you to take the camera out and free it up very quickly.  I wouldn't want to carry the case with a strap over my shoulder -- for me, it's too small for that, even in the case.    This is the perfect case for me to keep the essential camera items together, whether in a drawer, in a travel bag, or in a car.  It feels very rugged, like ballistic nylon.  Again, my only reservation is that it's too bulky for a pocket with the possible exception of a winter coat pocket.  It's a high quality case, relatively expensive, but worth the money 
 Doctor Zhivago, written by Boris Pasternak, is a story about the turmoil of revolutionary Russia and its people.  It begins a few years before the Bolshevik Revolution and follows events that lead to Civil War and the establishment of the Soviet government.  The main character is Dr. Zhivago, a kind and passionate man, who is constantly affected by these events. The book has excellent historical value as well as detail of its characters so that it fully embodies the disorderly mindset of the people.  This is most evident in Dr. Zhivago's relationship with a woman named Lara.  He and his wife Tonya were happily married but when he was drafted to a medical outpost he fell in love with the nurse Lara.  Though the Doctor is a good man he is torn between his two loves and inevitably cheats on Tonya.  His relationship with Lara beautifully parallels the political struggle that was taking place in Russia.  She represents the Communist Russia that the people longed for.  She is so close yet unattainable; every time the doctor begins to settle with her they experience pain and hardship, whether it be by outside forces or their own actions.  She is impossible to reach, impossible to forget, and their relationship, like the revolution, was impossible stop once it began.  Dr. Zhivago allows the reader to witness a struggle of the human mind's judgment and its desires.  It demonstrates that our decisions can start us in one direction and that life's unforeseeable circumstances can easily lead us astray. 
 Document, R.E.M.'s fifth album, is further testament to the group's ability to write catchy, jangling rock tunes, complete with soaring hooks, locked-in rhythm sections, ringing guitars, and Michael Stipe's soulful, sky-scraping vocals. The highlights are all over the place: "Finest Worksong," which opens the album with an anthemic vocal burst and a crunchy guitar riff, is a rousing kick start to the proceedings. "Welcome to the Occupation" keeps things going strong with its fist-pumping chorus and sublime guitar work, not to mention those tight vocal harmonies. "It's the End of the World as We Know It" is a maniacal stream-of-conscious folk-rocker along the lines of Bob Dylan's classic "Subterranean Homesick Blues," complete with breathlessly shouted lyrics, whirlwind imagery, and the catchiest chorus you've ever heard. "Disturbance at Heron House" features some soaring vocals from Stipe and an echoing, subdued guitar performance. The sitar-tinged "King of the Birds" marches along on an airy melody and a rumbling drum attack. "The One I Love" is a haunting, dramatic classic, with a gorgeous chorus and some impassioned howling from Stipe. The punky "Lightnin' Hopkins" is also cool. From start to finish, Document is an excellent album full of catchy rockers created by a band from which we've come to expect no less. A great listen. 
 I was impressed with the quality of the writing and organization of the story. I understand that this is Keith Donohue's first novel. It is certainly one that is unforgettable.  The story itself is haunting and very sad. The idea that a small boy can be kidnapped from his own family and instantly replaced by a fairy or "changeling" is frightening. The effect on the family who suddenly finds itself with a child identical in appearance but obviously different was, to me, terribly sad and tragic.   The story is told through the eyes of Henry Day,a child taken from his family and replaced by a changeling. The years pass as Henry learns to live as a changeling with a group of other children who, like he, have been stolen from their families.   I found myself hoping for a happy ending for this child (Henry) who remembered his old family with great longing and a desire to return to normal life. The ending left me surprised and emotionally drained. It was not what I expected.  The characters are well drawn and sympathetic. For those looking for a frightening and thought provoking fairy tale, this is it. But, definitely not for small children 
 I'm especially impressed by the contagious enthusiasm in reading Darby's book, and the tremenduous images one can create of goal completion and personal fulfillment. Of special interest was the idea of getting out the book that is within you. I feel this read has helped motivate me to do that. No one could come away empty-handed from reading this book who has whole-heartedly considered its message.   Mike McPheters, Moses Lake, Washingto 
 The book is sort of slow to start with, but it picks up in time.  A lot of it is predictable, but by the end of the book I liked the story enought to buy "At First Sight", the follow-up.  If you're looking for a good airplane book or something to read on the beach, look no farther.  If you want a truely compelling story, why are you considering Nicholas Sparks anyway? 
 Another classic text from graduate school (text for class taught by P.L. Duren) providing a background in introductory complex analysis.  This book is nicely written with some elegant exploration of the motivations and backgound for a number of the central concepts.  This may be surprising given the physical slimness of the text (I noticed elegance of the exposition and attention to motivation on a recent reread of some of the book after nearly twenty years -- I had not remembered this exposition, perhaps because the reading in graduate school was not quite as "liesurely" (unless "fear driven" and "pressured" are synonyms for "liesurely").  The theory topics are nicely covered -- if, however, you are an engineer looking for methods of calculating complex intgral there are other texts 
 this is his best book.  I am a pro cook, and have met and talked to Martin on several occasions at professional conferences. He says this is his best cookbook. I have used it, as well as a couple of other of his cookbooks. I agree, it's his best.    Besides, who am I to argue with Martin 
 I've been an avid Montgomery Gentry since about 1998 when I first heard this album.  They are best country duo in the business and they just don't stop getting better.  Their tough, thorough, and modern cowboy ego is extremely intense.  In almost every song, there is something great to relate to or laugh at.  Not only do they put extremely well written and well composed country music, their concerts are as good as they get.  I RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANY COUNTRY FAN! 
 Great book, simple language for the beginner (Me), love the sprial style of the book, lays flat and stays open.  Good Buy 
 A good thriller, that was very Grisham.   Delivered on exactly what you read Grisham for.  
 I bought this cable gateway to replace the NetGear cable modem supplied by my internet provider.  The NetGear would not allow access to everything on the web, and after a week of talking with NetGear and my IP, I decided to try the LinkSys gateway.  I received this cable gateway yesterday, spent less than 10 minutes installing and setting it up.  And now I have all the protection offered by the NetGear, but I am able to access everything on the internet.  I would highly recommend this produc to anyone looking for a cable gateway/router combo 
  I am very happy with my purchase, the unique way that it allows you to drink without raising your head. I got it mainly for when I am on my motorcycle 
 "Pharmako/Gnosis" is the crown jewel of Pendell's superb trilogy, and indispensable reading for anyone interested in psychedelics, botany, anthropology, and earnest inquiry into the nature of existence. Covering LSD, mescaline and peyote, DMT, psilocybin mushrooms, esoterica like Syrian rue and even xenon inhalation, as well as other signposts on what he calls "the Poison Path," Pendell continues his profound investigation of mankind's relationship with plants and chemicals that can seem like helpful teachers, demons, pernicious addictions -- or all three at once. (The truly addictive substances are mostly discussed in the previous two volumes of the trilogy, "Pharmako/Poeia" and "Pharmako/Dynamis.")  Even if you never touch the stuff yourself, Pendell's trilogy is worth reading as one of the most graceful and powerful breakthroughs in prose in many years.  Combining poetry, deep history, science, psychological insight, and Zen-style humor in the face of "the Great Matter," Pendell has created a voice that is wholly his own. He can be radiantly tender in one passage, saltily irreverent in another, and certain sections of this book -- such as "Splitting the Hair" and "The Two-Dragon Problem" -- come as close to saying the Unsayable as any literature I know, outside of such Zen classics as "The Blue Cliff Record." A section called "The Hallucinogenic Properties of Maize" is a brief tour-de-force that should bring a knowing smile to fans of "The Matrix" and other works that suggest that what we call normal waking consciousness is worthy of closer scrutiny.  Like the Poison Path itself, Pendell's books are not for everyone.  They may be difficult reading at first for those who are totally unfamiliar with botany or Zen, and their frequent flights into personal witnessing of altered states may piss off readers who are expecting an "objective" textbook or how-to-get-high cookbook.  But stick with them -- these sly books instruct even as they tease or confound expectations, and will still be whispering in the inner ears of shamans and potential initiates many generations from now, long after most so-called drug books of our era have been forgotten. And Pendell's Coyote-like wit -- taking the narrator to task for his own pomposity in italicized sections that the author calls "the back channel" -- never allows him to wallow in the kind of self-importance or vacuous yakking that afflicts so many self-appointed psychonauts.   At the level of book design, Pendell's luminous and subtle use of images is nothing short of revelatory. The sudden appearance of Walt Whitman's youthful face after a particularly lovely passage, for example, says more than another ten pages of prose could have. Mercury House has done an admirable job of bringing the author's hard-won mapping of the other world into this one.  In some of the book's most memorable passages, the author seems to step aside to let the spirits of the plants themselves speak -- no easy trick without seeming ridiculous. Bravo to Pendell for creating a guide to uncovering essential experience (with the help of potent allies) that will be, in the words of Allen Ginsberg, "good to eat a thousand years. 
 I have to admit, when I first heard DKL's first record, I wasn't that impressed. So I was a little edgy towards "Dead And Dreaming". But I decided to give it a shot after hearing "Paper Tiger" on a modern rock station. I wasn't at all let down, this album blows their first clear out of the water. The songs are brilliant and meaningful, unlike most nu-metal. The song "The Perfect Enemy" should make Slayer proud, it is a crushing, very 80's thrash inspired track and one of the albums best. Also the closer is a stand out, a song called "No Reason" a dark, acoustic ballad. Dead and dreaming is a very deep, Kick a$$ record for true fans of metal. Limp bizkit fans beware: This is not poser metal 
 Ayn Rand's " The Virtue of Selfishness" is truly a new moral philosophy. Her essays in this book are profound. In this volume, Rand rejects the idea of self sacrifice and metaphysics and embraces rational self interest. Rational self interest is the philosophy that your life belongs to YOU, it does not belong to anyone else. YOU are responsible for your life, feelings and actions. Rand lays out the argument that self sacrifice, and altruism, have denigrated man's sense of self and caused mankind innumerable centuries of suffering. Man was only liberated by the Western Enlightenment and the use of his reason through science and capitalist economics. Where the Dark Ages end, progress and freedom begin.  Rand is an unabashed fan of America and our Founding Fathers. She is absolutely correct in affirming the fact that they founded the American Republic on the Enlightenment ideas of liberty, freethought,individual rights, amd scientific progress. Rand obliterates the view of the Religious Right that American was founded as a "Christian Nation" and the view of the Left that America was founded as a "conservative" nation. She points out that the Declaration of Independence was a radical document affirming the rights of all men as individuals. As a consequence of the American Revolution, capitalism unleashed nearly a century of classical liberalism, freedom from government, and individualism never before seen in any nation or age. Rand shows that the American Republic was the first nation to ever proclaim man as a rational being with inherent and unalienable rights.  The basic thrust that Rand is attempting to get across to the reader is that altruism and the concept of living for others is not only immoral, but fatal to the maintenance of an enlightened republic. Altruism is the root of all the other "isms" that afflict the world. Communism, Fascism, conservatism, liberalism, socialism, all promote the idea of the tribe where the individual is submerged and drowned out by voices degrading him with notions of original sin, "common good","public welfare", mankind's "depravity", and obligation to others. If you want a philosophy of life, liberty and one to truly pursue your happiness with, Ms. Rand's "Virtue of Selfishness" will help guide the way 
 Having seen Gaelic Storm twice in concert, watching this recording done at the House of Blues in Chicago is the next best thing to seeing one of their concerts in person. 
 Want to show your kids or students just how fun math can be?  Students of all ages will thoroughly enjoy finding the answers to these crzay riddles by doing the math problems, then turning the calculator upside down to read the answer.  This is a great item to keep in the car with a calculator to keep kids busy while on a long trip or running errands.  You'll wish there were more of these books when you finish the final riddle 
 I had to say I loved the view into history that this book gave me. I also happen to be into the equipemnt of the G.I. This is THE book for that. It has over a 100 pictures that show what Patton's GIs really looked like during their epic campaign across Europe. The author is very good at pointing out details in uniforms and equipment on every picture. From types of boots and undergarmnents, he has a great eye. This book will stay in my library 
 Stanley D. Toussaint, a pastor of more than twenty years and a senior professor emeritus of Bible exposition, presents Behold the King: A Study of Matthew, a scrutiny of the gospel of Matthew that traces Matthew's thoughts about the foundation of Christianity. Though Behold the King draws historical and grammatical hermeneutic directly from the Greek text, fluency in Greek is not required for students and theologians to understand Toussaint's comments, ponderings, and interpretations. A close study of Matthew's words, God's eternal kingdom, and Jesus' role as King of Jews and Christians, Behold the King is study steeped in both scholarship and faith. 
 I picked up "Sniper" in a book store far from Washington, DC and had to buy the book and bring it home -- I couldn't put it down.  Horwitz and Ruane have taken events about which I thought I had heard everything and brought new life to them.  Anyone interested in police work, investigative reporting, or how our lives have changed in this time of a feeling of increased vulnerability to acts of violence should read this book.  Forget the one-hour TV crime dramas -- this is the real thing 
 As a fairly experienced science writer - http://www.sciencebase.com/resume.html - I didn't anticipate learning any news tricks from this book, but it's well worth checking out if your journalistic beat is anything from astronomy to zoology by way of molecular architecture and quantum mechanic 
 This can be a very easy to use camera. Simply by using the auto mode and composing your pictures properly you can get very good JPEG images. It also can be about as complicated as you want to make it. It has many advanced features on it. I have been shooting 35mm for about 32 years. My most recent before this one being an Elan II E about 7 years ago. It's still working also. The 30d is my first digital and I absolutely love the camera. I generally work in the aperture priority mode with a tripod at 100 ISO when shooting landscape. But, the camera is very capable in auto mode as well without the tripod. I like to shoot RAW so that I can tweek things a bit, but the JPEG images are very acceptable. It also works extremely well for portraits. It actually is better than the 35mm to me because it has very low noise even at higher ISOs. 1600 looks about like 800 film to me. This is a very good value for the money in my opinion 
 This book is excellent.  I am a relatively new crocheter and I have been looking for resources to help me expand my abilities.  This book has excellent photos of a variety of different stitches.  Their explanations are easy to understand and the projects are modern and cool.  Great 
 Ludacris knows how to make a album that is made for the club and the streets and to me that is a great artist. I like almost every song but some are a little too much and I won't say which ones because I will let you to figure out when you buy it. I have all the Ludacris except Incognegro which is a pointless album because it is exactly like his debut except for a few songs. Anyways buy this album it is fun to listen and gets you hyped up for sports. HOLLA 
 From the point of view of most academic historians, the title of this review would seem backhanded praise, given that narrative history is greatly out of favor in academia.  (Instead, we now have pedants writing more and more about less and less.)  To be sure, there are plenty of works in the genre that are treacly with sentimentality, dull with didacticism, or inaccurate with facts (sometimes all three).  This book is none of these, and while it is certainly not the last word, I can think of no better starting point for those wishing to explore Roman history.  By taking some of the focus off political and military matters and including everything from descriptions of the everyday life of subjects and citizens, to beautiful and illuminating excerpts from Roman literature, Durant brings to life a vanished world and makes the reader eager to learn more.  For my own part, I doubt I would have come across the poetry of Horace (I am now but the latest member of his 2000 year-old fan club.) had I not read this book.    One of the charms of the book is the astuteness of so many of Durant's judgments.  For example, he is perhaps the first English-language historian to write of the Emperor Tiberius as something other than a monster of vice and cruelty.  Interestingly, most modern historians of the subject would probably agree with Durant that the picture of Tiberius painted by gossip-mongers such as Suetonius and novelists such as Robert Graves is an enduring libel.  Instead, the author writes movingly of then-Emperor Augustus commanding his chosen successor Tiberius to divorce the beloved Vipsania Aggripina and marry the loathsome Julia, to further Augustus' plans for a dynasty.  You start to get a better idea of what is meant by the phrase, "the tragic sense of life" when you read of such things here.  Durant's discussion of the life of Jesus and the origins of Christianity tracks well with recent detailed studies of the historical Jesus by such investigators as Geza Vermes, E.P. Sanders, and Paula Fredrikson.  Readers may well disagree with his opinion of the provenance of the miracles recorded in the New Testament, but they will agree that it is at least informed speculation.  I have to agree with H.L. Mencken (who had dismissed Durant as a "mere popularizer"), when Mencken recorded in his diary that to his surprise, "Caesar and Christ" was "a thing of extraordinary merit...  full of sound sense and sound learning, [and] wholly free of sentimentality.  The best conspectus of Roman history I have seen. 
 The novel, Cassandra at the Wedding (first published in 1962), starts out simply enough; the first-person narrator, Cassandra Edwards, tells us that the spring semester has ended at Berkeley, California, where she is writing an M.A. thesis on the contemporary French novel; and she's packing a bag to drive to her parents' ranch near Tipton to attend her sister Judith's marriage to a truly lovable man.  Not only is Cassandra a budding scholar, she's a talented pianist, and competitive swimmer, and she loves her sister more than anyone--even more than her sister's fiancee--so Cassie thinks. For this is the point: Cassie cannot bear to part with her nearly identical twin sister and will do almost anything to stop their wedding.  As Cassie lets us deeper into her thought processes, the reader will find that--as learned and cultured as she is--Cassie isn't aware of the effects she has on others and on herself: Cassie is often cynical, passive aggressive, and wantonly perverse in her refusal to "get it," i.e., to love and let love.  Her insolence towards the people she says she loves is an astonishing dismissal of their emotional lives.  The fact that Dorothy Dodds Baker makes it easy for us to see Cassie without Cassie seeing herself is testament to the author's mastery of irony and understatement.  Without a doubt Baker has created a character who is both infuriating and heroic.  In fact, it's Cassie's youth and intelligence that makes her inability to let her sister go such a riveting contemporary drama. Also of note: The NYRB book cover is an appropriate painting by David Park; Deborah Eisenberg's "Afterward" is informative.  
 I will not simply stand by and see my favorite author disparaged.  I enjoy every AB installment and await them with baited breath.  I "read" them in audio form mostly and treasure each.  You simply have to allow LKH to develop these characters as she sees fit.  If its too hot or too nontraditional stop reading her.  If you can stand being challenged or stand for your IMAGINATION to be stretched, then stay tuned. We're working up to a knockdown dragout with the Mother of All Darkness and Jean Claude's sire. How can you stand to miss that?  DM was thoroughly entertaining, intriguing, and noncompromising.  I hope LKH never changes her original vision to accomodate any lightweights who maybe should stick to lighter faire.  It's so hard to find an author like her.  I wish she was as prolofic as Nora and could write a different book every 3 months 
 Nice, solid, small footprint.  I would have given it a higher rating but the "3-foot" cable is actually 20".  It wouldn't reach the hub on my desktop to the tower below.  Luckily, I had a spare cable, so I didn't need to buy another and could start using the hub immediately 
 I read Culture Warrior (one of the best) just before the recent elections, and subsequently reviewed many of our local and state candidates during TV debates and in the press for being either S-P or T-W.  Regardless of party affiliation, our community and our state elected mostly Secular Progressives (about three to one).    To me, this helped explain why our state is experiencing so much challenge being prosperous and successful in the twenty-first century.  We've somehow forgotten or ignored what it was that made our state and our country great.    Every conscientious person should read this book and try to understand the root issues that affect us today and what we can do to return our cities, towns, and country to the higher quality of life we fought for, won, and lived in years past.    Read the book.  You won't be disappointed. 
 I am fond of this book because it is the first of it's kind that I have read.  It presents relevant information logically and doesn't go too far with the more advanced information.  It is no replacement for a biochemisty degree, but it sure does help you learn about each plant and gives you a general knowledge of what it does and how.  
 In "The Pilgrim Hawk" American writer, Alwyn Towers, relates the events of one strange afternoon in the late 1920s. Towers is visiting a friend, Alexandra May, at her country home in France when the Cullens, a wealthy married Irish couple, arrive unannounced. The Cullens are "self centered without any introspection, strenuous but emotionally idle." Towers notes that during the twenties, one often came across "foreigners in some country as foreign to them as to you ... and you did your best to know them in an afternoon." Towers certainly does 'get to know' the Cullens who are "mere passers of time" during this brief afternoon, and Towers is able to observe and analyze the strange relationship between the seemingly frivolous Madeleine and her half-inebriated husband.      Madeleine Cullen sports a captive and crippled Pilgrim Hawk--which she wears attached to her wrist. At first, the hawk, named Lucy, seems to be a fetish object for Madeleine. Lucy wears a feathered hood that matches Madeleine's hat, and the manner in which the Cullens demand accommodations for the hawk is rather peculiar. Madeleine, for example, is eager to show off the bird and expects that special arrangements should be made for the bird's dinner. But soon it becomes obvious that the hawk is more than just a fetish object for Madeleine. Madeleine and the hawk are practically inseparable--a fact that Mr. Cullen finds both irritating and nauseating. Is he merely jealous of the attention the hawk receives, or does Cullen's hatred for the hawk have another origin?  Towers relates the events of the lazy afternoon as "something a little sour and dark" creeps into the conversation, and through Tower's observant eyes, it becomes apparent that the hawk represents many things. It is as if Lucy is the third participant in a bizarre love triangle, for she is Madeleine's beloved, and Larry Cullen despises the hawk for this. Just as Lucy is a captive in her relationship with Madeleine, the Cullens are also captive in their unhappy marriage: "when love has given satisfaction, then you discover how large a part of the rest of your life is only payment for it, installment after installment." The Cullens' unhappy marriage seems to fester around the hawk, and as Larry Cullen drinks the afternoon away, simmering resentments develop into a spiteful and desperate act.  "The Pilgrim Hawk" is a short novel, and it is utterly exquisite. Author, Glenway Wescott focuses on the incidents that take place during a few hours, and he reconstructs the afternoon with perfection and skilled descriptive power. The narrator's initial reaction to the Cullens and his subsequent curiosity about their marriage conveys a very personal recollection that is shared between the narrator and the reader. Consequently, one feels as though the narrator, telling the tale 20 years later, has never forgotten the incidents of that one afternoon, and he shares that peculiar and lasting memory with us--displacedhuman 
 I love the Paul McCartney song that they played during the "dance" scene.  The rest of the cd is background music.  I would have like more lyrics, but it is still a soothing soundtrack all in all 
 Of all of Tupac's post death material, this is probably my favourite album.  Though some may complain that the songs were not as Pac intended, I think they are a fitting tribute to him and for the most part, the updated production is great.  Most will already have heard the singles "letter 2 My Unborn" and "Until The End Of Time", both are great, and it is easy to see why they were chosen as singles.  Other notable tracks are "This Aint Livin" which is probably the best track on here, "Breathin", "Everything They Owe", "Lastonesleft", "M.O.B" and "World Wide Mob Figgaz".  In fact most of the tracks on here are at least good.  It goes without saying that this album is not as good as the material Pac produced while alive, after all these are his throw away songs.  Just goes to show what a genius Pac was, that these are songs he didn't consider good enough for his albums, they put most other rappers A tracks to shame.  I give it 4 stars because there are a few filler tracks and The Outlawz are just on here too much.  While I have a load of respect for The Outlawz for staying true to Pac, I just don't rate their rapping skills too highly.  Anyway an amazing album, especially considering Pac had been dead for 5 years when this was released.  R.I.P Tupac  
 But they kind of strayed from scripture with Samson and Delilah, important events were omitted.  Too much time on non-scriptural characters 
 I had seen this book referenced throughout my life, but until I hit Amazon, never seen the book. And now that I've read it, I can't imagine why it's not required reading at every school! Beginning with the earliest European literature, Dodds traces the development of psychological and spiritual concepts we now take as our common heritage, showing the contexts in which they arose, and how the meanings of words such at soul, fate, temptation and others changed over time. The immediate reason I was drawn to this book at this time in my life was my reading of Julian Jaynes' "Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind", and it is an excellent companion to that volume. "The Greeks and the Irrational" also can serve as a perceptive guide to further studies of ancient literature, drama, and thought. What a book 
 MY FIRST SINATRA ALBUM WAS "STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT", WHICH I WON, ON THE SEASIDE HEIGHTS BOARDWALK, AT THE JERSEY SHORE, IN 1966, AT THE AGE OF 11. I FIRST BOUGHT SEPTEMBER OF MY YEARS" 3 YEARS AGO, AFTER MY DAD WAS DIAGNOSED WITH TERMINAL CANCER.I HAD ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT HOW GREAT THIS ALBUM WAS, SO I JUST HAD TO BUY IT FOR DAD AND ME.ONE OF MY MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES WILL ALWAYS BE LISTENING TO THIS CD WITH DAD, ON HIS DEATH BED.HE AND I BOTH SHED TEARS, NOT ONLY OF SADNESS INTERSPERSED WITH JOY, BUT ALSO OF  A REVELATORY COMRADERIE,THAT WE SHARED WITH THE LATE SINATRA.HE WAS ABLE TO PLUCK AT OUR HEARTSTRINGS AND MASSAGE OUR MEMORIES,IN A WAY THAT SEEMS ALMOST ILLEGAL.I WAS APPROACHING 50, DAD NEARING HIS 82ND BIRTHDAY, AND BOTH OF US SPELLBOUND BY THE SHEAR POWER AND GUT PIERCING PENETRABILITY OF THIS MASTERPIECE."A MAN AND HIS MUSIC, "IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF","ONLY THE LONELY" "SONGS FOR SWINGIN` LOVERS", AND "STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT" ARE THE BEST OF SINATRA."SEPTEMBER OF MY YEARS" IS THE BEST OF THE BEST 
 although i have only read this novel once so far,i found it to be extremely compelling. questions of: deceit,betrayal,revenge,desire and power tirade throughout the play. for who is really honest?- certainly not  gerardo(a recarnation of robespierre); nor paulina (your frustated,  dillusional, prototypical housewife);nor ricardo (the sly,oil slicked  stranger accused). these characters undeniable flaws (it could be argued  that dorfman has potrayed every piitful and pathetic trait ever known to  man)seem to cause their downfalls,but also growth within themselves and  their relations with others.  surely the final setting will  influence the  reader to think so 
 Such artists were known a lot for their ALBUMS, like Dave Brubeck, AHmad Jamal, Ramsey Lewis Trio, MIles Davis, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, and the Modern Jazz Quartet. The artists mentioned above all have trademark album covers and material on them. For the mjq, this was a common thing. Albums like Django, Concorde, and Fontessa are all trademark albums, and constantly appear in jazz lists and discographies. This album was one of them. All though this album has a lot of "re do's" like Django, and Dont Mean A Swing, we were all introduced to Vendome. And all though, you might of heard of Pyramid before the date of the session of this album, it was not done in an established and well-formed arrangement like this. This album is great. Each man delivered something. John Lewis gave his light, but blues influenced block chord playing, Milt Jackson soulfully strutted his things, Percy Heath delivered rich and fufilling bass lines, and Connie Kay added his light and dynamic drumming to fit the MJQ. This is one of the top five best mjq recordings ever 
 THIS ALBUM NEEDS TO BE WORTH MILLIONS OF STARS, SOME OF THEIR BEST TRACKS APPEAR HERE AND IT'S RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO HELL, DUST AND BONES, AND NOVEMBER RAIN. APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION IS GREAT TOO, BUT THIS IS WORTH BETTER STARS BECAUSE IT ROCKS HARD. GO GET THEM BOTH, AND GREATEST HITS TOO, GUNS N' ROSES ARE ONE OF THE GREATEST BANDS IN HISTORY!! 
 Plague Wars is as fresh as tomorrow's headlines and very relevant to the fact that we in the U.S. are suffering our first biological attacks. I read the book when it came out a year ago and its predictions are uncanny, Thoroughly researched and sober yet never less than fascinating. What a read.. 
  There are many Rosanne Cash collections out there. This one lives up to it's title though. The songs collected here are truly some of the best from Rosanne's albums. Although most of the songs on here were hits there are a few that recieved little to no airplay. Her #1 country singles are included as well as one previously unreleased track. That track, "Never Be You" was originally recorded in 1983 for the "Streets Of Fire" soundtrack. For whatever reason Rosanne's version wasn't included on the soundtrack, instead Maria McKee's take on the Tom Petty song was. Rosanne would later redo the song for her "Rhythm & Romance" album in 1985. The original version, produced by Rodney Crowell and Jimmy Iovine lacks the punch of her later remake, but is a gem nonetheless.  Just about each of Rosanne's albums from 1979 thru 2003 are represented here. Only 1982's "Somewhere In The Stars" is overlooked. Too bad too, "Ain't No Money" was the hit from that album but perhaps because it's sounds too much like "Seven Year Ache" it's not thought of as her best?   In a sense "Very Best Of" replaces her earlier "Greatest Hits" disc, in some ways it's a nice companion to it. If you're new to the music of Rosanne Cash, this album is a good place to start. If you find you do like this album, you'll want to explore the other albums in her catalog. For the most part, Rosanne's albums are much like Emmylou Harris's in that there really isn't a weak one in the bunch 
 It follows the lives of several people from the '50s to the '80s.  It's an engaging read.  I highly recommend it to all 
 With the hindsight of several decades, it is easy to poke holes in I.F. Stone's writings.  Yes, his notion of combining a free society with socialism was utopian. Yes, his economic arguments tend to be wooly in the extreme. Yes, he was wrong in denying the Soviet connections of some of his communist friends. Stone's books stay fresh despite those mistakes because he was right about a lot: governments, racism, wars.   He was so right that what he says about the cold war and Korea and Vietnam provides insight into the wars America wages today. Beyond the light he sheds on specific events, Stone offers an alternative model of journalism. His journalism, based on a close reading of all sources, is independent of the powers that be. Today's news reporting is dominated by the hypocrisy of the "he said, she said" model: include a counter-quote and the story supposedly becomes neutral. Stone was not politically neutral, but he was independent and truthful. He did not regurgitate the received view. He would not have fallen for the addled rationales that skewed public opinion in favor of starting the war in Iraq.   MacPherson's biography is a great way to get to know the irrepressible, fiercely intelligent and marvelously funny Izzy--a man who retains his curiosity and innocence even as he fights against injustice and idiocy and is beset by malignant bureaucrats and scheming politicos. It's not about his private life, but the book does bring the man to life.      Through Stone, one understands American history with all its grandness and squalor, in ways rarely available from history books.  MacPherson has done a service to the Republic in bringing together this mass of material and preserving the memory of an outstanding American. Anybody who cares about the country should read it.  
 I first heard this CD in a restaurant and the voice whom caught my attention was Macy, girl!  I asked the restaurant owner about the music, he happily obliged.  I love the diverse mix of music.  Each song captures each respected musician/artist in his/her own element.  I enjoy the lyrics, however, the raw sound of each instrument puts me in a trance and offers a deeper appreciation for culturally diverse music.  My favorites are with Miles Davis, Macy (of course) Sheryl Crow, Deloris O'Riordan and Cheb Mami.  I had to buy a second copy, I wore it out.....Oh yeah, I am also diverse in my bloodline, no bias here. 
 I really like this CD as well as most of the Ultra Records CD's I especially like heady female vocal trance and dance music with lots of drive. However I have exausted the Ultra Records CD series. If there are any CD's that highlight (heady hard driving) trance and or dance music with beautiful female vocals email me with any suggestions at: Carol-Ann26@webtv.net

 I really like this book. I recently added a few new pieces of McCoy pottery to my collection. This book has great photos and concise information. It is full of a variety of items that I did not know McCoy  produced, but now I do know. I was able to accurately price some items that  I have on the market and I was able to review items that I have seen for  sale. I was hoping for a book with photos and prices only and that is what  I got. There is very little time waisted in this book. The photos are well  produced and labeled. Great for those of you who are looking for  collectibles and wondering about the justification of their price. I highly  recommend this book 
 I have been following Liz Carroll since her trio "Trian" days.  She is an immense musical talent, including both being a master of Irish style fiddle and a composer.  I have been following John Doyle since the first Solas album.  He is one of my two favorite Irish guitar players (with Daithe Sproule of Altan).  I suppose John is the surprise of this album and his own solo album.  I remember the boyish young lad that put the bounce in the early Solas albums, and a bit unassertive in lead vocals.  That has now changed and I hear an accomplished guitar player and lead vocalist that is comfortable in the unique style he has created.  I saw them presenting these songs at a recent Celtic Festival, and just the two of them filled the stage with gorgeous music 
 Exploring the Northern Tradition provides a truly comprehensive foundation for anyone curious about the practice of Heathenry. This direct descendant of pre-Christian folkways and worship practices of far-Northern Europe is possibly the least-understood religion frequently lumped together with neo-pagan paths.   Who are the Gods and Goddesses Heathens worship? How do they worship Them? What values do Heathens hold dear? The author, a member of the Heathen clergy, has written of her religion in depth; researching and organizing her work thoroughly. It's not an easy book to read, but then neither is it unnecessarily complicated. The author succeeds in conveying the importance of a respectful attitude toward the Gods.  Through reading Exploring..., I learned Heathenry is set apart from other "Pagan" religions, by being based on, -and practiced as closely as possible to- that of the ancient Vikings and others, as revealed through the study of written lore. This lore, comprised of centuries-old Eddas, (poems), Sagas, Anglo-Saxon Healing Texts, law codes and histories, as well as current anthropological, archeological, and historical analyses, forms the basis of Heathenry, and intense study is required of the would-be convert. This is no easy religion to adopt.  At times I found the many foreign names and words overwhelming, and I'm glad I don't have to learn how to pronounce them. I appreciate opportunities to learn about groups different from myself, both to discover common ground, like the Nine Noble Virtues (Chapter 6), and an emphasis on scholarship, and what etiquette faux pas to avoid (including Heathenry as a Pagan religion, for instance.)  To satisfy curiosity, or to embark on lifelong study, this would be a great book to begin with. 
 The watch performs as advertised.  Atomic clock.  I live 2k miles from Ft. Collins and the watch automatically syncs every night, even if I don't put it near a window.  Solar recharge.  The watch arrived with a low battery.  It charged up to full after sitting in the sun for an afternoon.  Since then it has been on full charge with no special actions on my part.  The watch is big and heavy.  I take it off when typing because it slides down to the end of my wrist and knocks against my hand.  The watch's user interface is unintuitive.  This is the first watch I've owned where I had to read (and re-read) the manual to set an alarm or the hourly charm. I find the Timex interface and the old-style Casio interface much easier to use.  In the interests of saving battery power, the alarms are short and quiet.  I can't count on this watch's alarms to wake me up.  It'd be nice if the watch had a power-hog mode with loud insistent alarms and long illuminations.  All in all, I like the watch.  It is nice to have a digital watch that sets its own time and doesn't run out of batteries.  I wish the user interface was more intuitive, the alarms were more effective, and the watch was smaller 
 I read this book to my infant daughter every night during her last feeding before bedtime.  By the time I get to the end of this short book her eyes are heavy and her breathing slow.  I love the book's bright colors and sweet, short story about getting ready for bed.  I know my baby will come to love it too as she gets older 
 This book has changed my life.  I read it for the first time about 8 months ago and continue to re-read and re-read it.  It is one of my two favorite books and I use it as a guide to everyday life. You will absolutely love it 
 I've heard that steaming vegetables is much better for you than cooking them otherwise.  This does a great job at it.  It makes vegetables taste great, and works well.  Easy to clean 
 This album is Sting's prophetic masterpiece, a brilliant work of rocknroll genius with a soul, a conscience, and some of the most powerful, beautiful songs written. In this ablum Sting addresses crucial political issues of our time, and timeless subjects like love, redemption, war, and more, in poetry that ranks with the very best. Like others, I loved Dream of the Blue Turtles and Nothing Like the Sun, but Sacred Love truly surpasses them in its depth, maturity, passion, varied range and lyrical beauty. This is as good as rock gets, and it rarely gets close to this good. That said, "Sacred Love" may make some people uncomfortable due to the issues Sting takes on here, and to the new territory he is exploring through his art. And it may go over the heads of those who don't want rock and roll to challenge them, musically, politically or spiritually. Thank God for artists like Sting who follow their muse with unwavering integrity and let the chips fall where they may 
 Growing up in a family with five kids, I am very familiar with the topic of sibling rivalry- the constant squabbles, the nasty name-calling, and the occasional all-out brawl.  However, the occasional fights between my siblings seem minor when compared to the non-stop warfare between the brother and sister characters in Jerry Spinelli's "Who Put That Hair in My Toothbrush?"  "Who Put That Hair in My Toothbrush?" details the lives of two suburban Pennsylvannian middle-schoolers: ninth grader, Greg Tofer, and his seventh grader sister, Megin.  Spinelli gives each character a viewpoint with alternating chapters to allow Greg and Megin to discuss their lives.  Greg's life revolves mainly around girls- his desire to impress his crush, Jennifer Wade, with a body toned and tanned by a summer of weightlifting and healthy eating, and his relationship with a much more available girl, Sara Bellamy.  Greg also details his friendships with immature loudmouth, Valducci, and fourteen years old going on thirty, Poff.  On the other hand, Megin's chapters present her as a hardnosed tomboy- whose life revolves around hockey, donuts, and a friendship with a lonely old woman.  Megin has friends her age too- flighty chattermouth, Sue Ann, and the "exotic" Californian, Zoe.  However, the majority of the book deals with how much Greg and Megin literally hate one another.  They battle over EVERYTHING and there is not one tactic they won't resort to in order to embarrass and annoy the other such as sticking a hair in a toothbrush.  They won't even acknowledge each other's names- to Gregg, Megin is "Megamouth" and he's "Grosso" to her.  They even use their four year old brother, Toddie, as an instrument in their warfare with each vying for the affections of the little boy.  Oh, they also resort to violence against one another on occasion.  Their good-hearted, jolly father and tired mother try to reconcile the two, but it seems hopeless because as Megin puts it the two of them are like a cobra and a mongoose- "natural enemies."  However, events will prove that Greg and Megin do need each other.  Jerry Spinelli writes in an extremely humorous style which captures the emotional upheavals of the average middle-schooler so it was surprising to discover that he's a grandfather!  In fact, "Who Put that Hair in My Toothbrush?" was first published over twenty years ago and it's age shows in spots- record players, leg warmers, Wayne Gretsky as an Edmonton Oiler, ect.  However, it still captures the subject of sibling rivalry fairly well- although Spinelli at times paints the picture a little broadly and the characters little too unlikeable (Megin in particular can come across as an appallingly spoiled brat!)  Overall, though, this is fairly amusing story and will keep one entertained.    
 I got this grill last year as a father's day gift. I'd never smoked any meat in my life but have been a grill-man for a looong time. This smoker makes it easy. I've done ribs, brisquet, pork steaks, chicken. All turned out great, that brisquet especially! Make sure you cure the inside of the grill before cooking anything in it. There are instructions in the box. Also, if your model doesn't come with the built-in thermometer, make sure you order one from the char-broil website. Using a standard oven thermometer wastes time and precious heat 
 This book is well written and easy to understand.  Most people would think a book about a tax plan would be a snooze fest but I had no problem getting through it.  I wish everyone would get behind the Fairtax, I am 
 I bought this book for my husband who has a significant family history of heart disease.  He has already read it from cover to cover and keeps it next to the treadmill he uses now.  I especially appreciate that Dr. Agaston uses common language to describe and explain how our bodies work and what we need to do to stay healthy. 
 Stick with the story to the end, and you will find that it is not only a comic novel, but something else, too 
 There is no disputing that Capote is a God.  All of Truman's work is excellent, but this book takes the cake.  A page turner that will have you questioning the security of your own home.  Warning: If you live in a rural community and decide to read this book you may find it difficult to sleep!  
 This is a well-researched and revealing account of the inner experience of a wealthy and powerful member of the Boston community.  Largely based on Samuel Sewall's voluminous diaries, it covers his life from birth to death. It goes into detail about all sorts of events in Boston and Newbury.   The cover blurb ("The Story of a Good Man and an Evil Event") and the title inflate the importance of the notorious Salem witch trials in the book.  The publisher can be forgiven for this exaggeration: scandals grab public attention just as much now as then.  If the witchcraft "angle" induces more people to take a look at this interesting book, the exaggeration will prove worthwhile.  The witchcraft angle made me pick it up.  I live scarcely a mile from the homestead of one of the women accused in that terrible crisis, and I am quite interested in what happened.  Sewall was a Puritan magistrate. They sat in a panel over various trials, including the witchcraft trials.  The nuances of Sewall's interior experience of those trials are revealing about the late Puritan age's issues of gender, social standing, and economic class that underlay the witchcraft panic: it started among women in run-down rural Salem Village (now Danvers) and was prosecuted by men in wealthly Salem Town.  Both Sewall and his biographer convey an understanding of these struggles straightforwardly without polemic.  Francis just tells the stories, and resists the temptation to draw simple moral lessons from what happened. By doing this he cuts through the illusion that Puritan culture was morally simple-minded and brings it to life.  The people of the Puritan Commonwealth felt the presence of God looming over them with a clarity and intensity that is very difficult for us to understand in the 21st century.  Those people thought their culture was destined to be the fulfillment God's divine Providence.  Everything that happened, from earthquakes to the birth of infants to the attacks of Native Americans, they understood as expression of God's approval or disapproval of their personal conduct. Sewall was a diligent student of meteorology. He repented and apologized for his role in the witch trials partially because he saw signs of divine disapproval in the elements, and believed that the trials were a sign of collective delusion.  Sewall's accounts of trying to persuade his contemporaries of this position are especially revealing about the complexity of the American attitude towards official mistakes and misconduct.  He worked hard to declare a day of public fasting and repentance five years after the trials. He tried to get Minister Cotton Mather (that ghoul!) to write a declaration for the fast day specifically acknowleging the collective evils committed during the trials, but Mather would not go beyond broad generalities.    Sewall's acceptance of personal responsibility for official misconduct is as American as roast turkey and apple pie.  Unfortunately, so is Mather's refusal to accept it. This fine biography presents clearly that contradiction in American character in all its complexity 
 The review by Joke on March 29th gets the author of "My Voice Will Go With You" wrong. Sidney Rosen is the author 
 very interesting look at the mystery that is delta force. this book is written by the founder and first commanding officer of the force and represents an intriguing look at what was formerly kept secret. look into the world of some of our country's most daring and important servicemembers. this blow-by-blow account reads like a novel, and sometimes you wish that is all it was 
 I used one of the readings in this book and one of the readings in its sequel, "More Language of Letting Go," as the topics in a recent 12-step meeting I was called on to lead.  I was a little bit fearful about using these books, as this was not a meeting of the 12-step program that might be most naturally associated with Ms. Beattie and her writings (although a close cousin).  The second person to speak up after I opened the meeting for sharing confirmed my belief that these books were "spot-on," and so I have chosen that as the title of my review.  (You know who you are, should you ever read these words, and I thank you once again.)  I first discovered this book just over two years ago when I experienced the first temporary break-up with my partner, a break-up that would happen several more times over the succeedings months and only recently happened in such a way that I intend to be permanent.  At the time of the first break-up, I turned to this book for reassurance that I was not a bad person for wanting out.  Now, two years later (and having discovered the sequel in the meantime), the affirmations I'm finding in it are much deeper and much more positive affirmations.  Of course, it's obvious from the title of the book that these little readings, usually about a page or so in length, are directed most specifically towards those who have decided that "letting go" is an appropriate response to a particular person, place or thing in his or her life.  And it's amazing how often Ms. Beattie says things that I have personally experienced, although often without sufficient insight at the time to realize that I was experiencing them.  It's as though she has the ability to put my feelings into words.  For me, the hardest thing to do when reading this book is to restrict myself to the reading for that particular day.  I have finally given up.  When I feel the need to, I just read on or skip to a different section of the book.  I am always encouraged by what the author has to say.  I gave "The Language of Letting Go" five stars because that is the maximum I am allowed.  If it were up to me, I'd give it a hundred.  This book and its sequel are the best of the many meditation books I have been through.  Most enthusiastically recommended 
 A friend gave me this book shortly after I lost my beloved Tasha, a German Shepherd who brought endless joy into my life. Her own life was cut short by cancer, a month short of her 5th birthday.  There are all sorts of books available deal so seriously with grief and coming to grips with loss and bereavement. If that is what you need, then the other current review of this book is correct: this is not the book for you. If, on the other hand, what you need is for someone to hold you, rock you, and whisper silly "meaningless" things while you cry your grief out, then this book may be for you.  Virginia Ironside has been an "agony aunt" journalist for some time and has collected thousands of anecdotes on all sorts of topics. She's gone beyond collecting, though, to finding resources to share with people who have too much to cope with to look for them on their own. This is obviously a collection of those anecdotes as well as a resource of (yes, British) resources for dealing with the loss of a pet. The "messages" of this book have as much depth as a magazine or newspaper article can have. But there is much to be said about the value, the worth, of a soft touch as opposed to some serious, deep examination by some psychologist or doctor or self-proclaimed expert on coping with grief and death.   Nothing I could read would ever make the loss of my Tasha "make sense". But reading the anecdotes did more than make me feel that I wasn't alone -- after all, if misery loves company, what good is miserable company? No, these stories made me remember all the joy of the time I was blessed to share with my dog. Ironside organizes of these anecdotes into chapters based on the questions we all have, such as coping with the decision to put a pet "to sleep" or facing the inevitable, uncaring "it was only an animal" comment someone is bound to say. And Ironside's own prose weaves them together with common sense advice, which is often more helpful than what any expert can share.  The one chapter that helped me move beyond my loss was, appropriately, the last in the book. The message, from your pet's point of view, is basically this: "You shared so much love with me, but don't let it end with me. There are others out there that need your love -- find another and give to it the same love you gave to me." When the time was right, that sentiment gave me the will to look past my grief.   And by circumstance or serendipty, I find myself writing this review on the birthday of Leyna, my wonderful and true best friend, who today finishes her fifth year of bringing me joy and begins her sixth.   If you buy this book, I hope it brings you the solace I found in it 
 My current Sam is the fifth family Labrador Retriever and I want him to be the best.  This book has all the basic dog stuff in an easy to read and use format and enough about just Labs to be very helpful to me.  I don't need a pretty color picture book, I take daily pictures of Sam, but the public library also has a wonderful book about Jake a Labrador puppy if someone needs color pictures to be happy.  The unique and beautiful temperament of these dogs is a treasure when they are taught to be a companion.  Don't just have a dog, train him to be one of the family 
 Next (1977.) Journey's third album.  In their early days, Journey was nothing like the Steve Perry-fronted band that would rise to fame in the late seventies and early eighties. The group was formed initially by Neal Schon and Gregg Rollie, both of whom came from Santana. Although Neal Schon was always the group's guitarist, Gregg Rollie was only on the band's first few albums, and he only served as lead vocalist on the first three albums (althought he would sing on the occasional Perry-era track in the later seventies.) 1977 was the year tht saw the release of the third Journey album, and the final one to feature Gregg Rollie as lead vocalist. Read on for my review of the Next album.  To put it simply, if you liked the first two Journey albums (which also had Gregg Rollie singing), you're very much likely to like the third one in the line. On this album, the sound shifts in a slightly more commercial direction than the previous two albums, but the band still manages to maintain the hard space rock sound that made their first two albums so great. I admit, this album is a step down from Journey and Look Into The Future before it, making it the weakest of the three albums to feature Gregg Rollie on lead vocals, but even the weakest Rollie album kills the best Steve Perry album dead. From start to finish, Rollie's vocals are absolutely incredible, and Neal Schon beautifully demonstrates his role in the music industry as a guitar god - something he'd lose in the eighties as the band gradually sold out and went totally commercial and poppy. Truly, the Next album is the end of an era. Five stars for Rollie's last stand.  Journey's first three albums aren't as readily available in stores as the better-known Perry-era albums, but when you can find the Rollie-era albums in stores, you'll notice that they are priced very low. Do all the searching it takes to find them if you're a fan of progressive heavy space rock - you'll be more than satisfied in the end.  Next was an appropriate title for Journey's last album with Rollie on lead vocals, because by the time their next album came around, the band would be a totally different one from the one that Rollie and Schon gave birth to. Steve Perry would take the band in a more commercial direction, and Rollie would strictly be an organist and occasional vocalist, before his inevitable departure. The first three Journey albums depict the REAL Journey, before Perry changed them. I strongly recommend buying them if you're a classic rock fan 
 I have been a first grade teacher for 4 years in an area where the students are very diverse.  I have learned over the last few years that it is a teacher's responsibility to teach these children academics but more and more it has become our responsibility to teach them how to care and survive in society.  This book has helped me to do just that.  I have read this book every summer before beginning a new school year and have had 4 successful years.  It gives great examples and senarios.  It is a book that can be easily read on the beach or during the school year 
 I love this book. I've been trading personally for just under a year and have been getting creamed. I know why now. This book interviews several of the best traders in the world. They all have different styles, and investment vehicles, commoditites, currency, bonds, equities. Yet whatever the vehicle they all seem to drive on the same steet. There are lessons to be learned throughout your trading/investing life, they are all here.   Great writing, great questions, even better answers. A great read, right up there with "Good to Great 
 I bought this book expecting that most of the pictures would be for specific applications and not of use as a relevant technical guide.  I did find three or four that would be interesting to use in today's machinery, but probably not feasible on a day-to-day basis.  I bought the book mostly as a pleasure read.  Yes, I am a nerd.  Anyone buying this book as an engineering reference guide will be severely disappointed, unless you are working with wood gearing or old clockwork devices 
 i AM LOVING THIS BOOK IF ONLY FOR THE STEAM FACTOR.  THIS BOOK IS TOO HOT TO SIT DOWN.  IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SUBSTANCE, NOT THAT GREAT.  HOWEVER, THE SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS WILL LEAVE YOU LUSTING FOR MORE 
 I haven't yet read this book, but wanted to point out that Jill Switzer has indeed finished a book which Amazon does now list. The publishing world does not move quickly by the "gotta have it now" standards of the Internet Age. It takes a while to get a book listed and ready for publication. Jill Switzer said she was putting the spit and polish on her book back in July 2004. She never said that she would be finished doing so in a week, a month, or even a year. Using her as an example in such a manner was inappropriate and made her look bad. The review was supposed to be for this book not Ms. Switzer. By the by, for those who may care, the title of Jill Switzer's book is The Diva Next Door: How To Be A Star Wherever You Are. As of the date of this post it is as yet unreleased, but the listing does sport a cover shot.  I have a credit coming my way for a duplicate Christmas present which I intend to use for this book. I will write a proper review at that point 
    David McCullough once again demonstrates his ability to research carefully and write clearly with an exceptional balance between careful forshadowing and suspenseful piling of details to reveal the causes and the extent of the disaster.  By alternating between individual details and the larger events of the flood, McCullough highlights both the personal suffering and loss and the tremendous destructive power and ravages of the flood to the whole area.  
 This is truly an inspired piece of writing. Right from the first page where we are introduced to A'Tuin the Great, to the last page where Rincewind the failed wizard is for the umpteenth time facing certain death, I was enthralled and entertained and left begging for more.  Consider the brilliance of the conception of Discworld itself: A world that is flat, where if you get to close to the edge you fall off, where the sun and moon orbit the world, where Gods are real, have character and flaws and are constantly competing with each other. A world that is full of Dwarves, Trolls, Wizards, Heroes, Witches, Tyrannical Despots, Thieves, Assassins and Monsters of all descriptions. A world that is supported on the back of Berilia, Tubul, T'Phon and Jerakeen, four enormous elephants that in turn stand on the back of A'Tuin the Great, the cosmic turtle, who swims forever through the vastness of space.   Yes, these are things that Terry Pratchett has taken from all manner of ancient and modern writings, with a hefty dose of Dungeons & Dragons thrown in, but the genius of the conception is that he has taken everything that is patently untrue and used it to mirror the truth. It is this bizarre juxtaposition that provides the rich vein of thematic material and humour that Pratchett has been mining so successfully for more than 20 years and more than 25 novels.  I have read about 10 of the Discworld series and in my opinion "The Colour Of Magic" is the best. Although the series is consistently entertaining and each book offers something new, yet they do get a bit samey after a while, like a pair of comfortable old slippers: you know what they will feel like when you put them on. But that is not true with the first of the series. It is new, it is fresh, the inspiration is red hot all the way through.   All the characters are new: Rincewind, (Pratchett's favourite anti-hero), the failed wizard, who cheats death again and again, who plays the hero against his will, not by courage and skill but by great, bizarre, strokes of fate. Twoflower, the medieval insurance clerk who becomes the world's first tourist, who enjoys all the danger and adventure with the fearless, good-humoured aplomb of someone who is only watching. And, of course, The Luggage! Sapient Pearwood! Loyal, ferocious, fast, strong, bloody minded and indestructible, who will also keep your clothes freshly laundered and neatly pressed. Now there's some rich and unique characters!  Terry Pratchett's inate philosophy of life comes through clearly in this volume, just as it does in all the other books in the series. All his characters are flawed, most of them deeply. Few of his heroes actually want to be heroes, those are do are invariably dumb as dishwater and are soon killed or made to look foolish. Rulers, whether of countries or organisations are generally paranoid, selfish and cruel. Happiness is only found by those without ambition who are blessed by fate. And, of course, books are special and must be preserved!  Pratchett is one of the most successful writers in the last 50 years. Every bookshop in the world has a rack of his works, and they are greatly loved. If you read a few you will quickly see why. The combination of magical adventure, clever humour and humanist wisdom put together by a master craftsman is a winner.   Yet every successful series has to start somewhere, and this is the first... and the best 
 This movie is hilarious.  Its definately a movie I'd take to college with me for some great ideas (streaking, haha) and for a good laugh.  I didnt think there was alot of nudity though for what the edition said 
 This book is a good resource.  It has helped me make informed decisions about which invertebrates are best for my reef aquarium set-up.  Although, it does seem to be missing a fair amount of species that are for sale in the marine fish stores.  Despite these missing species, this book is still a must have for any marine hobbyist 
 If you are wanting a garment that will cinch you down a few sizes this is NOT for you.  If you are looking for something that will smooth you out under your clothes and not make you sweat all day this is the PERFECT item for you.  It does not roll down - even after wearing it all day.  You do not get overheated in it.  I love it to hold that flabby skin tight.  After having kids my stomach moves with each step and its very uncomfortable.  Lipo in a box keeps me all together.  It really is a superior product as long as you are not expecting it to drop you two dress sizes.  
 The author is confused about why accountants do what they do with their "numbers" so he tries his best to relate it in terms of logic. Good intro and overview for my MBA class 
 If I had to name the single person, alive or dead, who has had the greatest impact on my life it would have to be Machaelle Small Wright.  For me, Garden Workbook II represents the core of her work but, like Dancing..., it is not a good entry point to the ideas and processes pioneered by Wright. To begin to appreciate the full flavour of Wright's work your heart and mind need to be pervious and you need to be able to accept, at least as a working hypothesis, that nature has intelligence. Wright brings  a highly practical, and supremely down to earth approach to processes that may be essential if you want to create balance in yourself and your environment. To begin, read whichever of her other books draws you. For example, Wright's semi-autobiographical work, Behaving.... Or, if you like plants or animals or are interested in the environment, Garden Workbook I. If you're primarily concerned with issues like human health, MAP may be where you should start. Or there's Flower Essences or Co-creative Science. These books take a while to absorb. Bits of them are quite difficult, because the approach is so different. But gradually you may begin to feel comfortable with the ideas and processes contained in them. This may be the point at which to venture into Garden Workbook II, if you feel you now want to expand the scope of your work.  While primarily focused on environmental issues, the book teaches you to work at the energy level and some of the processes it sets out can be applied in any field. It provides a stepping-stone to those two humdingers, Perelandra Microbial Balancing Program Manual, and Dancing.. 
 A lot of people will find this book overly-simplistic, but it has a lot of valuable infortaion and tidbits of knowledge tucked here and there.  It has a wealth of basic information that covers many things you'd otherwise overlook in the course of trying to set it up yourself 
 I finally got around to reading this book after a friend recommended it several years ago, and I wish I'd taken it up sooner!  This is the colossal story of how the fictitious, 12th-century Kingsbridge Cathedral in England was dreamed of, designed, built, rebuilt and finally achieved its ultimate glory. The entire cast of characters, down to the very mundane aspects of their lives, is painted realistically and in great detail. I really appreciated that the author poured his heart and soul into telling the entire story, despite it resulting in a quite lengthy and intimidating book. I reveled in the amount of detail offered -- it only served to fascinate me further about this time period. The only thing that could have improved the story is if Kingsbridge Cathedral had been real 
 I absolutly love this book.  The one thing I have to say against it though is the new cover.  I think they should replush another version of it with the original cover.  I would make it less clincal feelin 
 Teddy is definitely an egomaniac, but he does write well.  He also benefits from a good plot, his extrodanary life.  Jolly good read 
 Honestly, I wish I could give this series more stars; Red Dwarf is the Smegin' Greatest Creation of Mankind.  I began watching this series in 1991, and I have always recommended Red Dwarf to everyone. I've been pimping Red Dwarf since the early '90s, but I never had a chance to finish watching the series.  Now that I own the entire collection of episodes of Red Dwarf, and I have finished watching the series, I thoroughly recommend purchasing the Boxed set of DVDs.  These DVDs have many extra features, edited and extended scenes, numerous extra bits, hidden features, and humorous additions which provide countless hours of entertainment.  No matter how messed-up the world is, or how much the daily news can ruin your day, this Boxed set of Red Dwarf episodes and Bonus materials will brighten your life! If you do not find the series humorous, you might want to check your pulse.    I personally feel a deep connection to the sets of the scenes, as well; Commodore geeks from back in the day will smirk often.  In fact, the entire Red Dwarf series is likely to make you laugh and smirk, as well as adopt Red Dwarfisms. When your boss is a jerk, you can just say, "Smeeee....Smeeee."  Your coworker will get it, but your boss or Human Resource Manager hopefully will not.  There are a wealth of inside jokes, catchphrases and memorable scenes within the world of the Red Dwarf crew.  This boxed edition is well-worth the investment!  Back in the day, I watched episodes that friends had taped, so I greatly appreciate the convenience of these great quality, well-packaged, stylish, well-documented DVDs.  I am very impressed with every aspect of this set; the collection was well thought out, and I look forward to inducting more people into the Red Dwarf Cult in the future.  Speaking of which, the bonus DVDs also include interesting Convention footage.  I will definitely update this review at a later time, but I want to start pimping the series, so more folks can enjoy the fantastic world of red Dwarf 
 The era and the setting of the novel was something I could relate to.  Growing up in the 60's and 70's and knew it was a tumultuous time The book was about the innocence of a neglected young white girl caught up in the racism of the time and specifically the South during the civil rights era.  It was wonderfully told and beautifully written. 
 This was an excellent book about Jedi Padawan Barriss Offee and other Republic Surgeons (the main characters were Jos Vondar, I-Five, Tolk le Trene, Zan Yant, and Den Dhur, who's a reporter covering the war. A side character is a spy who works for both Black Sun and the Seperatists, and whose identity is unknown. It'll be great to find out who it is in book 2. Growing on Drongar is a "miracle drug", called bota. It supposedly cures almost anything with no side affects. A great story that really shows more of what life is like for Republic troops and workers. Battle Surgeons also has some humor, thanks to I-Five. I-Five is a protocol droid who knows little about himself due to something wrong with his memory. He is always playing Sabaac with the other surgeons and trying to find a way to get drunk. The end of the book is very sad, but I guess that's why theres a second one. Overall, a great read 
 I read this book as a child and it was always one of my favorites, it is such a beautiful story.  I now have a two-year old daughter and I wanted a copy for her.  I hope when she learns to read, she will enjoy it as much as I did 
  This book is awesome. I have had it for about 3 years now,and every time I read it I learn something new. Even the book itself is a conversation starter with its bright orange cover and hologram on the front, but you're friends will really be amazed when they hear about the only albino giraffe or the man with the Devil's toungue.I recommend this book to anyone who likes the Bizzare, for thats what this book is 
 This book and its companion by Alison Jay, "Picture This," are two of our daughter's favorites books.  The illustrations are beautiful and capture her attention.  She loves pointing out all the characters and toys, especially as they repeat onto pages throughout the book.  I also love how each letter page will have many things starting with the same letter that may not be immediately obvious.  For example, the "D" page is for "Dog," but the Dog is Dancing, there is also a Donut on a Dish on the table, with a Duck in the picture on the wall, a Doll on the shelf, a Doorknob on the Door, Diamond shapes in the floor, etc. The more we look at these pictures, the more we see!  We've given this pair of books to several new parents with rave reviews.  You can't go wrong. 
 We have a home-based business, and do not need a complicated fax machine. This was just the thing that we expected, and it works great.  The copy function is not as clear as our copier, but that is not the main function of this machine. So we are very satisfied with our purchase. Right price for the product 
 I cook for 6-24 people at a time, for casual to black tie formal occasions, and this book has beautiful and tasty recipes that have always gotten requests for "What is the recipe", or Is this easy to make?"      I do not have a lot of time to prepare complex recipes, so this book's numerous offerings, with usually readily obtainable ingredients suit me just fine!    My final appetizer is often slightly adapted from the book's recipes, my changes based on substituting local fresh herbs, fish for meat, or other seasonal or tropical substitutions.  Recipes such as the "Filo tartlets with spicy cilantro shrimp and Thai red chili dipping sauce" are quick to make, and stand out above other more "conventional" appetizers, and can be used without the tartlets, even on toast, to keep it easy. This and other appetizers have gotten rave reviews-if you prepare this, be warned that some guests may fill up on this alone, and not have room left for the entree and dessert!     Worried about not having an item...then for example, substitute sour cream for creme fraiche if it's not available for a different recipe, and it's no less tasty!  There's a mix of easy creations, and some more formal ones as well in this beautiful book.   The hints on preparation, and the pictures are inspirational to create numerous variations, so you get several hundred recipes from this beautiful book.  I need quick, easy and tasty for my uses, and cooking from this book has provided just that. See also "The Appetizer Atlas : A World of Small Bites" by Arthur L. Meyer for more complex and varied appetizers.  Buy this book, cook from it, and enjoy the smiles of your family, friends and guests 
 I'm not even an electrical engineer but I can appreciate the depth of this mammoth compilation of information. It's a great technical reference for electrical engineers, network engineers and anyone who needs highly  intricate information covering an enormous range of topics. This book is  pretty darn heavy and isn't one of those books that many people have bought  at one time or another, where the publisher could have compressed it down  to a quarter of its size. There are enough illustrations to explain a  point, however, there is no hint of placing pictures and illustrations just  to fill space. I have so far enjoyed the chapters on SONET networks and  fiber optic cable production but there is so much more. I have other books  on LAN and WAN standards but this one descends deeper into the workings of  the technologies, which makes this book a great asset. The one problem I  have with it is that the section on microprocessors is somewhat dated, but  the author of this section acknowledges that particular inevitability, so I  guess that makes it ok 
 Wow! Being a fan of Courtney Love's music, and acting at some times, I vowed to see all of her movies. This one was next on the list, besides Basquiat. I was going to rent it, but my local movie store had 2 copies on VHS for sale for $2.99, I knew I couldnt pass it up. The film is set up like a soap opera, ya know? where the camera flits from person to person, and situation to situation. Its hilarious! This movie is great! I love seeing some REAL punk rockers in this film, as opposed to all the posers of today, (okay they might be actors but who cares?) 200 Cigarettes features an all star lineup, of todays hottest new actors. And most of the acting is suprisingly realistic. My favorite part of the whole movie is when Dave Chapelle(The disco loving taxi driver) tells a "heart warming story" of when he was jealous of a friend because he had a girl he wanted, and the friend "Twayne" ended up choking on a string bean. And Courtney Love portrays her character in the way that she REALLY is in real life. Its really ironic how similar her character and her true demeanor are 
 The product was in great condition and arrived in a timely manner!  Thanks 
 I was at first a bit reluctant to invest my time/money in a book written by jurist for the UN, but found The Tyrannicide Brief, by Geoffrey Robertson, not only well-written, well-edition and organized but fascinating from beinging to end. I came away with awesome respect for this humble Puritin, John Cooke, who should be the first entry if anyone ever decides to write an English verision of JFK's "Profiles in Courage."  Robertson is able present scenes of tremendous drama while avoiding purple prose that often gets in the way of other writers when dealing with huge personalities or events of enormous later import. Also, as one would expect, is well-referenced, comes with several pages of interesting (rather than the usual superfluous) illustrations. There have been comments elsewhere by reviewers about how this book may have something to say to the Bush government and its heavihandiness with the law, habeous corbus, etc.  If that is the case, it is very subtle point, and believe Robertson's audience is more general than than...he obvious has great concerns about the social contract between the governed and those governing. I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys history and who enjoys good writing and scholarship 
 Nobody sang about the dirty side of love like the Whigs. This is their masterpiece, a truly perfect record from first lovelorn, alcohol-soaked note to the very last.   The Whigs are no more but their songs still give me chills. 
 Maya Angelou is a timeless treasure, and so is this book. It takes you on a journey that can help anyone rise above difficulties and sorrow. I highly recommend it for anyone who is searching for meaning in life, this book gives it! 
 These are good episodes, but what's so christmasy about Procrastination? I don't see snow, no stockings, no tree, no nothing about Christmas in it!  But you chose pretty good episodes 
 I came across this book and took a look at its table of contents and thought "Oh, just the basic information about drums I'm sure I'll find in any other general drum info book"... WRONG! This book is good stuff! If you're new to the drumming world like me and only got a chance to play on someone else's drum set and never knew where to look to learn about all this drum stuff like the different types of hardware qualities, whats the difference between a steel snare drum and a wooden one, etc. This book explains it. I have to say, just the 1st chapter about the basics taught me so much I'd have to pay double the amount this book costs just to get a teacher to take me on a tour like that... I recommend it for anyone who might not be too experienced or has not had too much exposure to the drumming world because this book explains a lot of the information very well. On a side note tho, if you've never drummed or have not much of an idea about some technical terms like snare throw-offs, you might have some prolbems when you come across these terms 
 I came across "Caddie Woodlawn" as I was making my way through all the old Newbery books.  I was pleasantly surprised at the gentle style of storytelling, and the author's knack for telling a good tale.  The book reminds me a lot of the Laura Ingalls Wilder series both in style and content.  The author is writing a semi-biographical account of her grandmother's life in the end of the 19th century on the midwestern frontier.  There are a few tales within the tale that are interesting as well.  The reader will not be disappointed.  It is definitely a must have for the young adult library 
 While I have not listened to many recordings of these Latin American showstoppers, (all two of them currently out) I have been a fan of Michael Tilson Thomas.  I have a few of his recordings (of which I have reviewed two others, check 'em out if interested) and feel he is one of the best conductors alive at this time.  He has been able to make a second tier orchestra compete with the best, and even made a student orchestra put forth some top shelf recordings.  This CD is one of the latter.  The New World Symphony, based in South Florida, is an orchestra of students from the finest schools across the nation and the world.  They gather together and record some wonderful performances that the public should consider.  I speak of this recording namely because I can say with very few grudges that it is as close to definitive as I would dare say (I don't believe in calling recordings definitive, it's not fair).    I purchased it mainly for the Revueltas "Sensemaya" but found myself being able to listen to, and enjoying, anything on this disc.  The Ginastera "Estancia" is wild and fancy all at the same time.  The Piazzolla "Tangazo" and the Roldan "La rebambaramba suite" receive their best printing to date.  I could go on and on.  In conclusion, Michael Tilson Thomas has done it again.  These performances and the sound quality are top notch.  I cannot recommend this enough.  Get it before it can't be gotten 
 I read this book a few years ago twice, because it was so exceedingly different than anything that I have ever read.  Actually it is the BEST book that I have ever read, and I have read thousands of books, everything else pales by comparison in imagination and creativity.  You may not agree with the book in any way, shape or form, but isn't that the reason one reads?  To be taken to places that are very different from the daily grind (and don't you see a hint of possibility in our future in this book?)?  If I only read to have someone to agree with my life, why bother to read?  I read several of the reviews you see, especially the ones that gave 1-2 stars.  One review stated that this book was garbage!How very sad!  I have read nearly all of Arthur C. Clarks writings, this is his best.  I am looking for his latest book right now.  I thought so much of this book that I lent it to my daughter, she was blown away by it and also says that it is the very BEST book that she has ever read.  She lent my book to someone else and now we are looking for replacements to make sure it remains in our libraries of excellent books.  If you love imaginative writing this is it.  Give it a chance 
 Revolution, aliens, young love; hot stuff to a teener.  Uncle Bob at his political, inventive best (this tale includes the first literary description of "stealth" vehicles,,,decades prior to their actual construction in "our" world) 
 I loved this trilogy.  The Blue Dahlia started out a little slow, but soon grabbed my full attention.  I couldn't wait to buy the Black Rose.  I was not disappointed, but was even more in Nora's grip. The story line just gets better and better.  The Red Lily finishes the series with a big bang.  I highly recommend this trilogy 
 I got this book just for the heck of it, but it turned out to be an amazing WoD addition.  It is very in depth, and is a must have for a WW:tA fan 
 Lionheart is similar to Kate Bush's debut album, The Kick Inside, though she regards her second album as rushed and it contains fewer songs.  'Symphony in blue' is like 'Moving' with the fragility ('You crush the lily in my soul' replaced by sexual assuredness- she can categorise herself as having red or blue moods.  A theme evident in Lionheart more than The Kick Inside, though, is that of film/theatre eg. the loneliness of being on the stage in 'Wow' (listen to Kate whisper 'He just holds his breath'- sublime).   The mysterious and magical 'In search of Peter Pan' follows, which partly seems to be about the sadness of reality not living up to dreams, whilst 'Oh England my lionheart' is a medieval-style lament.   In contrast to this Englishness, but just as mysterious, is 'Kashka from Baghdad' which is bookended with an exquisite beginning and ending and 'Coffee Homeground' which, like 'Kite' on her first album, is a delicious slice of catchy bizarreness. It has a Germanic, waltz-like flavour ('Heads we're dancing' from 'The Sensual World' would return to the German theme) about an arsenic poisioner. It could be superficially treated as camp or comic but I see it as avante garde. The closest equivalents I can think of to her specific type of experimentation are Radiohead during the Kid A/Amnesiac period and Bjork but those artists are operating in a time when you aren't entirely alone if your work seems wilfully strange/ utterly heartfelt.  'Hammer Horror' continues the menacing theatrical feel. It's the kind of 'acceptably bonkers' performance that the British public loved from her in the late 1970s as, as long as they could treat Kate like a bit of whimsical fun, they didn't feel too threatened by her evidently unique genius and powerful insight. The introduction to the song is movingly grand, making it seem like a fitting end to the album.  I left the other three songs out until now just so I could discuss certain themes. 'Don't push your foot on the heartbrake' features an Elton John type chorus and is a 'James and the cold gun'-style rock song but, of course, it has some wonderful quirks such as a bridge featuring Kate playing around with vowels: 'Her heart is out there'.   'Fullhouse' seems relatively ordinary by Kate's standards but there's nothing wrong with it.   In 'In the warm room', Kate sings with seductive weariness. There's a beautiful, knowing inevitability as the piano follows her singing: 'Down you'll go to where the mellow wallows'. This song could melt everyone in a room if she played it live.  The album cover isn't the best ever but, if you want a less intense version of 'The Kick Inside' with a dash more theatrics and fairydust, then 'Lionheart' is a decent addition to a Kate Bush collection. but it is a step sideways, and even perhaps a bit back, from her debut.              
 The comic novel "Quite Honestly" by John Mortimer lampoons many cherished ideals while asking some intriguing questions about crime, rehabilitation, and the nature of good intentions. Lucinda Purejoy, the daughter of the Bishop of Aldershot freely admits she's had a "lot of privileges." After finishing university, and at loose ends, Lucinda--Lucy to her friends--discovers that she's rather interested in the "causes of crime" and so she volunteers to be a praeceptor to a freshly released career criminal, Terry Keegan.   Although Terry is only in his twenties, he's been in and out of various reform schools, institutions and jails for a great part of his life. The product of a broken home, and an unstable mother, he drifted into living with relatives--specifically an uncle who happens to be a bank robber. To Lucy, and Alexander Markby, Terry's parole officer, Terry is a textbook case of a career criminal. Lucy believes that crime is rooted in "poverty" "lack of education" and "the corruption of the monetary society." Lucy is committed to helping Terry and ensuring he doesn't 're-offend.' But just how far is she prepared to go to make sure Terry doesn't end up back in jail?   "Quite Honestly" unfolds through the eyes of its two leading protagonists--Lucy and Terry, and alternating chapters shift between the points of view of these two characters. Both characters describe their initial meeting, and this opening establishes the novel's style. Lucy and Terry have their own social limitations and prejudices which they inevitably bring to their relationship, and the opposing viewpoints of each character establishes the difficulties these two have with fundamental communication. The novel then sails on from this initial meeting and follows the relationship that develops between do-gooder Lucy and Terry as he tries to go straight.   With tongue-in cheek humour, author Mortimer (who created the fictional Rumpole of the Bailey character) sets up some deliciously sly, funny scenes. Some of the funniest scenes in the book involve Lucy's parents--her father the Bishop and her hopeless mother--a woman who watches the clock and pounces on the Gin at noon ("The sun's over the yardarm. Who's for a little G&T?"). The Bishop lives on his own planet, loves to read letters that attack him in the Daily Telegraph, and is seriously troubled by the thought that god has any relationship with Bush and Blair. In Lucy's world, "they all talked about sin and crime" but no one actually ever does anything illegal--the closest anyone comes to a criminal act is Lucy's hapless mother who "fell a victim to the G&Ts." Some writers might create a plot in which Lucy became involved in Terry's crime sprees and ended up as a stereotypical victim, but Mortimer's wicked humor has an entirely different plan in store for Lucy. This is a lighthearted, enjoyable read. Quite delightful--displacedhuma 
 This DVD is the most comprehensive representation of this amazing artist's collection of photographic works as well as his initial foray into film. It is a "must have" for fans as well as newcomers.  His unique and hauntingly honest representation of the human condition is both refreshing as well as intensely emotional.  The glimpse into his creative process is also fascinating and inspiring. If you have not experienced his work this is definitely the best way to get an initial taste. You will likely end up thirsting for more 
 As an American curious as to what exactly is going on "over there" where our boys (and girls) are fighting, THIS book has helped me most, with insights not just into the facts of the centuries-long fighting in Afghanistan, but also insight into Afghan culture--heart understanding.  The author writes a narrative, but skillfully weaves in Afghani tales of old that help to clarify the viewpoint of those of a culture foreign to most Americans....foreign to most of the West.  The author is the daughter of an Afghani father and Indonesian mother, and was raised in England.  It is apparent, as she reveals to us her own struggle of East versus West, that she is attempting to be as fair as she can to both viewpoints, and even more than that...she is trying to carve out the truth between the two.  Sometimes the truth hurts. The myth of the Afghani Mujahidin, the Northern Alliance, the "rescue" of the Afghani people by the West...all is revealed.  It would seem that such a thing would leave the reader in dispair, but instead the author leaves the strand of hope for the future. Anyone who is interested in understanding Afghanistan or simply understanding other cultures will find some insight in this wonderfully written book. 
 This mill performs as promised and is beautiful to boot.  I would expect to pay much more for such a product.  The grind is even and consistent.  The appearance is sleek and modern, yet classic.  I would highly recommend this mill and will consider buying another in the future as a gift.  
 While it was certainly thought provoking, HBHG almost requires the reader to have a knowledge of French history and geography that, unfortunately, I don't have. While it is certainly conceivable that Jesus married the Magdalen and sired children, you have to wonder if that bloodline is still around, and what good would it do to maintain this secret all of these centuries? Between wars, plagues, the French Revolution, etc., this bloodline is probably lost. Even if it's not, what's the big deal? I don't think that there's any call for a "priest-king" over all Christians. I have to wonder, what's the point to keeping this big secret? 
 The book is very good and give the reader a broad perspective and 360 degree view of business model. It tells you how to think on another side of what we thought. Tell you the examples from the past. Even though it forces some example to be an example of the strategy, it's still good to know what we should look. I believe this is one of the best book for any business man who has 360 degree perspective 
 Harry's breakthrough was the soundtrack to the movie"When Harry Met Sally" but this is the album that established him as a true musician and entertainer. The songs on this album are foot tapping and heart tugging a perfect blend and the jazz and arrangements are outstanding. Harry's singing is often described as "Sinatra-like" but I think he has his own style and tone that was influenced by Sinatra and others from his New Orleans background. Outstanding work and the place to start if you don't have any of his albums 
 Yes, absolutely, the strong theme of this classic Victorian ntale by Anthony Trollope published in the 1870's rings true in our present day. The BBC first released it and then it was broadcast on ExxonMobile Masterpiece Theater on PBS/KCET in America in 2001. On DVD, it's a treasure to own if you liked it the first time around. Four, 75 minute episodes comprise this grand and moving story. The cast includes David Suchet as the power-hungry and corrupt Melmotte, whose shadow looms big in both novel and film. Shirley Henderson, an adorable dimunitive woman plays his rebellious and spirited daughter Marie, Cheryl Campbell as the social-climbing writer Lady Cardbury, Matthew MacFadyen as the two-faced, insensitive gambler Felix, Baeza as Paul Montague, who is on a more noble path of marrying for love instead of money or societal benefit, to the equally sincere and idealistic Hedda, Lady Cardbury's oldest daughter. The mood of this story, with authentic Victorian costumes, mostly dark clothing, is what made me love this film. Throughout the film there is an air of inevitable despair and gloom, as if the world is losing its soul to the capitalistic venom of industrialism and in man's pursuit of power. However, it is a film balanced in contrast by humor (mostly with the courtship of Lady Cardbury and her suitor) and by characters who are optimistic and turn their backs on the pursuit of money. It is perhaps the greatest novel to satirize Victorian mores and fastidiousness and pokes fun at the imperalism of Queen Victoria's day. Surely Queen Victoria disliked this novel if she read too much into it. But the Queen never had time to read such novels, which were probably considered modern or even offensive. It is straightforward and it packs a cynical bite. There is one scene in which Malmotte and his colleagues eat a lavish dinner and gorge themselves like pigs. This is who they really are, power-hungry and piggish, far from the conventional image of elegant, conservative and restrained English folk.   The characters in this movie, and moreover the actors portraying them, carry the film. Sushet's Malmotte is not so much an example of the Anti-Semitic sentiment in Victorian literature but a symbolic figure who stands for the totally corrupt and soulless man. An Austrian-Jew he may be, but even Trollope meant to imply that British men of upper classes were like this. Malmotte is insensitive, cruel and ambiitous. His dream of a railroad across North and South America costs more than money, it costs people's lives. Felix, though of a lower station than Melmotte, is equally as wicked in his own way. He is in constant pursuit of pleasures- be they gambling houses or whores- and has no real love for the rich Marie Melmotte, whom he courts. When Marie realizes what a cad he really is, she despairs and believes that all men are like him. Her notion of marrying for love is never realized but Hetta and Paul do triumph in the end. Their story is markedly different than Melmotte's. Melmotte is brought down by his own greed and loses respect from his peers at the House of Common and literally has a downfall. Paul's relationship with a fiery American woman from the South is a nice touch but I thought she was too much a figure of stereotypical American women in the 19th century. Like a heroine in Henry James, she is a liberated woman and not the more conservative and traditionalist women of Europe. Nevertheless, she is not seen as a kind of heroine. It is Hedda we are rooting for. The music is moving, and the acting is really powerful. Enjoy this classic costume drama with a message that rings true today. Aren't we a society that is constantly in search of capitalist ventures ? I am not a Communist but I do realize that we are driven by a need to market all the time. We are a commercial society. In the process, we often lose our souls and we forget people's basic needs of love and family. Terrific film.    
 This is a wonderful reference, whether you're brand new to cooking or like myself, have been around the kitchen for 50 years.  Most all of the recipes use ingredients that you normally have in your cupboards.  When I get a new cookbook, I read them like a novel and check the ones I want to try.  There's so many checks, I don't know where to start!  
 I see some people are giving only a one star rating to this book because they view this "fictitious" book as a "child neglect" story rather than the imaginative, artistic, creative one that it is. ARE YOU SERIOUS?? Parents: LIGHTEN UP! You're taking this book much too literally. Enjoy the concept and the touching illustrations. Let your children, also. 
 This is a wonderful tool to keep track of all those mystery books on your shelves. This book offers a comprehensive listing of women's fiction mysteries. Books are listed by author and title. It is great way to see the  order of books written in a series. There is also a check list where you  can check off the book once you purchase it, and then check it after you  read it. I like to make notations next to the books once I finish the book.  Books that have been nominated or received awards are designated with a  star by the title 
 I have been taking these vitamins for two months and already my hair has grown more than three inches!!! I can't wait to get started on my new bottle. Highly reccommended 
            Noam Chomsky's critical analysis of U.S. hegemony is on point. He uncovers the U.S. government's recidivism. One particular case was President Reagan's terror campaign in Nicaragua. The excuse was that communism was beckoning at our doorstep. Nicaragua had become the second Cuba in the eyes of the knee-jerk Right. But what really transpired was Reagan's attempt to overthrow the Sandinistas with U.S. trained Contras. When congress became concerned over this injustice (for financial reasons of course) the Reagan Administration began selling weapons to Iran, further financing their terrorist war in Latin America. Reagan in the 1980's wanted regime change in Latin America and in 2006, history repeats its self since George W. Bush is continuing Reaganite policy in the Middle East. The tactics Bush is currently using might be construed as different but the results are still the same. These campaigns aren't much different than George Washington's campaign to eviscerate the Iroquois, which Chomsky briefly alludes to in the book but for more information on the subject I strongly recommend reading "The American Indian Wars" by John Tebbel and Keith Jennison. Howard Zinn's book "A Peoples History of the United States" also covers this subject.  Chomsky delineates about the 1961 campaign called Operation Mongoose: "Operation Mongoose was the centerpiece of American policy toward Cuba from late 1961 until the onset of the 1962 [Cuban] Missiles Crisis." This was a result of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. "Operation Mongoose, also known as the Cuban Project, is the general name for CIA covert operations and plans from 1961-1962 to destabilize and overthrow the Communist government in Cuba." (Quoted from Wikipedia).  Chomsky covers many subjects such as the Israel/Palestine conflict, which the U.S. sends more financial and military aid to Israel than all other countries combined. Iraq is also a humongous issue that Chomsky successfully tackles since World War II the U.S. government has participated in more than fifty wars and to this very day is continuing with their plans of hegemony in the Middle East, Latin America and other countries abroad. This is all transpiring either without the knowledge or consent of American citizens.       It is estimated that the Bush Administration has spent more than $300 billion in Iraq, and Afghanistan. These are disheveling developments considering the Congressional Budget Office estimates that another $450 billion will be needed in the next ten years. Moreover, the U.S. nuclear weapons program isn't included in the defense budget its part of the energy budget, and intelligence gathering is in the Black Box budget program.  It is estimated by 2008 that the U.S. will have 14 nuclear-armed submarines in the Pacific armed with 336 Trident 2 ballistic missiles with 2,000 nuclear warheads.       And in spite of this debauchery, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said, "We're trying to figure out how you conduct a war against something other than a nation-state and how you conduct a war in countries that you are not at war with." This is nonsensical hegemony in motion; the bottom line is the Neo-Cons are planning to wage a never-ending war campaign against the entire world. Just ponder on this for a moment. Half of the United States' aircraft carrier fleet occupies the Pacific Ocean, plus the U.S. has over 1,000 military bases worldwide.          Knowing that this is the case: one must take a step back and become a little more circumspect when gazing at Bush's Neo-Con panorama and inquire about the issues of Medicare, Education, Food Stamps and Veterans Insurance, simply because the elites are also waging a war campaign against the American people. The world is involved in a grave war for its survival against an elite system set up to enslave many and genocide the rest. This book is a comprehensive history of U.S. hegemony gone tumultuously awry. From George Washington to George W. Bush. This book compiles 230 years of U.S. imperialism in the continental United States and the whole entire world.  Moreover, I would like to point out to all the reactionaries who'll give my review a bad rating, that this isn't about racism or religion. It's about the elites' mad proclivities for empire, and if you don't wake up soon, and see it for what it really is then our world will not survive. Wake up! You reactionaries will not be apart of the new world order ruling class because you're enslaved by it already.   As a matter of fact we are all slaves to this system of world government. And in this system, some of us will remain thralls and the rest are expendable. Remember 9/11 was an inside job. The government committed several heinous acts on that day just so we'd rescind our Constitutional Freedoms. Chomsky has stated that he doesn't believe that 9/11 was an inside job and I have to say that I totally disagree with his assessment on the matter, but I still think Hegemony or Survival is an essential read that we must all look at.         
                                 Walk Two Moons                                 Sharon Creech                                  Joan Gray  				 Mrs. Cooper  	 In this heart- touching, heart-warming story about Sal and her past comes together binding wonderful stories of her and her best friend, Phoebe. Her grandparents take her on a road trip. Along the way, she describes her happy, sad, and beautiful stories. Touching you heart one story at a time. 	I loved this book. It was not only a good, but also a great book because, it teaches life lessons, and it's sad in many ways, at the same time beautiful. This book teaches you that life is there, you have time. It also teaches not to judge `a man until you've walked two moons in his moccasins'. And to not let sad things effect you, and so much more! I love this book so much. 	If you're fifth grade or older, no matter what it will touch your heart. I would suggest it any day. It will be a page-turner from beginning to end. You'll never put it down. So pick it up and start reading it! 				    
 I love this series and this book.  It is fun and fast-paced.  An easy read for summer 
 Spellbinding takes on new meaning as this tale twist and turns through treacherous waters.  Just when you think Grisham can't do it again, he does it anyway 
 I loved this book.  Its information was upfront and unapologetic.  Wonderful.  Simply wonderful.  It has changed my life.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to look at courtship and dating from a Christian prospective 
 I love this book, I read it over and over, I cannot get enough of it. This book has taught me how to remain positive regardless of the situation. My new motivational word is now "Resilience". Whenever I am feeling stressed or facing a challenge, I think about what Roger Crawford says in the book and the experiences and examples of so many people given, and I feel better. Great book. I would love to meet him one of these days. I would urge you to recommend this book to anybody who is facing any type of challenge in his/her life. THANKS! 
 My family has been playing boggle since I was 10 yrs old! I am now 46. Somewhere along the line we graduated to big boggle (5 letters or more ) We always played after dinner, even my grandmother. We needed teams to beat my dad! Our set has seen better days. We can't seem to find a replacement...does anyone know where big boggle has gone 
 Most comedians end up selling-out and doing cheap, shallow-humoured movies because their careers are slowing down and they need the cash.  I would never do that, and Bill Murray hasn't either (not the only thing we have in common, we were also born in the same month!).  Garfield brings some much needed sass to the big screen.  And I'm glad he's animated, because that means he won't have any dander (I'm allergic to cats).  Just kidding!!  (get it?  even if it was a real cat, it would be on the movie screen, so I wouldn't be allergic. it wouldn't matter if he was computer generated or real!)  I only caught the first half of this movie because I was getting tired and I still had to watch "Garfield - A Tail of 2 Kitties" that night - my friends and I were doing a Garfield marathon.  Anyways, Murray is a 10.  Garfield is a 10.  Move over Arbuckle, the fat cat is back Jack!  Jack = Jo 
 The Emperor of Scent is a scientific page turner and five-star read that details the development of a new theory of the sense of smell by Luca Turin, an Italian-born, French raised biologist/physiologist at University College, London.    Turin is a Renaissance man with competencies in physiology, biology, chemistry, and physics and a life-long fascination with scents and the sense of smell.  Among his accomplishments are the development of a comprehensive guide to perfumes, of which he is a connoisseur.  He is also passionate about opera and knowledgeable about wines.  Unfortunately, Turin's considerable talents do not include the management of academic politics and the ability to humor slower mortals.  The Emperor of Scent follows Turin's revival of a previously discredited theory of how the nose processes smell, and his herculean efforts to publish the results of his research. Despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that Turin's research could potentially revolutionize the science of smell and the development of commercial fragrances, he encounters stunning difficulties in publishing his results and gaining the attention of the scientific community.  The novelty of Turin's theory presents one barrier to acceptance.  Additional barriers are created by Turin's reputation (partially justified) as a difficult, eccentric and renegade scientist, as well as by the fact that his theory embraces aspects of biology, chemistry and physics, which discomforts scientists who have difficulties in bridging diverse disciplines.  In combination, these conditions dissuade the scientific community from considering Turin's work seriously.  The Emperor of Scent is a fascinating read.  It is not a balanced journalistic account-- according to the author, Turin's theory is so unnerving to the scientific establishment that Turin's opponents almost uniformly refuse to read and comment upon his work. The book therefore focuses on Turin's rejection by the scientific community, and in so doing offers a briiliant case study of closed-mindedness in the dissemination of ideas. This outcome is unfortunate, because Turin's theory (at least to this non-scientist) seems highly credible.  The refusal to consider Turin's theory is also a fascinating cautionary tale of how readily established elites reject innovators-- particularly unpedigreed, outspoken innovators like Luca Turin.  The Emperor of Scent explores these themes brilliantly.  Yet another reason to read and enjoy The Emperor of Scent is to make the acquaintance of Luca Turin, a scientific ground-breaker in the tradition of Galileo or Copernicus.  Turin's forays into the perfume industry and his eccentric lifestyle also make for fascinating reading.  Highly recommended-- a five star read.  One quibble: The Emperor of Scent does not portray the ending to Turin's saga very clearly.  At book's end, he has turned his research interests to other areas and earlier allusions in the book indicate that he has lost his post at University College London.  But the concluding chapter of the book is sketchy and unsatisfying at best, and leaves Turin's fate unclear.  Which led me to research Turin's whereabouts on the Internet.  Inquiring readers will be pleased to learn that he is now using his theory to develop new fragrances for a new U.S. venture based in northern Virginia.  Let's hope that this is a happy and lucrative outcome for a multi-talented man whose ideas are ahead of their time 
 Gwendolyn Bounds does a beautiful job telling the story of her time spent at Guinan's Pub.  She guides us down her path of self-discovery without any confusion and with vivid details that almost turn the pages for you.  Gwendolyn said this about Guinan's, "Later, I will come to believe that this place steals time, because of some magic grip it holds over those inside." (p. 55). The book does this as well; you become so engrossed in the story of this magical place that you can hardly put the book down, that is except to tell someone else about it. 
 Well I am very surprized, frankly, that no one has reviewed this superb musical experience yet, so I will!  This DVD was released in May 2005 and is the first real taste of Robben Ford live since his excellent live set in Baden-Baden Germany in the 1990s as part of the "Ohne Filter-Musik Pur" series-and they are all great! In this Paris set in 2001 Robben has his best band yet- with a great drummer, super bassist (check his solo in "Help the Poor") and, for the first time, keyboards. I can't praise this performance enough. Robben exhibits his style masterfully, without a lot of show, and demonstrates how he has successfully combined Jazz (especially Jazz Sax) with Chicago Electric Blues.  Ford started around the Bay Area in the 1960s and built up a large following with the "Charles Ford Band" (named for his Dad) during the end of the Blues Power revival of the 1ate 1960s. He got to play with Charlie Mussellwhite and then Miles Davis which really extended his blues-jazz style and chops. I love the part in the interview (a great bonus feature!) where he said Miles liked him when he played his own stuff, his own way...not what Miles had originally thought he'd play.  Well this DVD is well produced, has a good lenght and track selection and the sound is excellent, as you would expect from the Inaukstik people! The opening track "Prison Of Love" one of Fords strongest numbers is magnificent and sets the stage for the rest of the performance. It's a cool Jazz-Blues. The top selection of the DVD is "Help The Poor" from his most famous and acclaimed recording "Talk To Your Daughter". This version is great the the solos are as good as you'll ever hear from anyone! I always thought this and "Born Under A Bad Sign" were Ford's greatest songs ever! "Chevrolet" is a remake of a Donovan song "Hey Gyp"(Ford is a master of re-doing old tunes, especially blues, in a new groove and extending them!) This song was done by the Animals as well in the late 1960s. It is great!  "Start It Up" is a Ford rock staple with his trusty 1960s telecaster, which he plays through most of this set-that's also unusual. His version of Mike McDonald's "Nothing To Nobody" is outstanding with its great jazz chord structure. The minor key blues offering "Moonchild Blues" is perhaps the second greatest tune on the DVD, it sounds very close to the Howlin' Wolf classic "Who's Been Talking"! You just want to keep on playing it!  I highly recommend this DVD. It is the best new Blues inspired DVD of 2005 and a great addition to anyone's collection. If you only get one Robben Ford DVD, this is it! Great product and interesting bonus interview 
 It was nice to be able to purchase just one mug.  The delivery was quick.  
 Aha, here you go, the full bio of El Che The man, the myth, the child, the revolutionary, the father, the friend, every aspect of Che's life is mentioned and well presented. one thing that bothered me is that the book is really sophisticated (it's a hard read), so you need to concentrate Enjo 
 I can't tell if Angry Reader #whatever is for real.  He's either a first-rate psychopath or has a very dry sense of humour.  Of course if the latter is true, I fear that his tongue-in-cheek review of Oedipus may put  off potential readers.  The fact is, Oedipus is a classic, a must read,  disturbing and unpleasant as it may be 
 This book is an ethnography that studies everyday life at an African American tavern.  It does a great job at portraying the lives of African Americans.  It allows the reader to see how African Americans interact in a casual type setting.  The reader is actually able to feel that they are a patron at the bar.  In this book,the author, Dr. May, even provides the reader with actual dialogues that took place in the tavern.  These dialogues are especially helpful in creating the image of African American interactions. Through examining various issues of African American life, such as how the patrons feel about certain issues like infidelity, racial conflict and much more, the reader is able to witness the views that different African Americans hold.  Thus, after reading this book, I feel more knowledgeable of African American life. I think that this book is very useful because it can help erase any previous assumptions and stereotypes that the reader may have held and replace them with the truth.  I also feel that this book was an easy and quick read 
 For someone looking to "make a difference" in our world so filled with unrest and need, responding to Pope John Paul II's call to embrace the Rosary is one affirmative step that can be taken immediately.  As a resource for making contemplation of the Rosary a part of your life, authors Michael Dubruiel and Amy Welborn have compiled the book Praying the Rosary: With the Joyful, Luminous, Sorrowful, & Glorious Mysteries (Our Sunday Visitor, June 2003, hardcover, 64 pages).    Though compact in size, this book can and will have a tremendous impact upon your life if you choose to read and implement its suggested format.  The book's introduction reiterates the Holy Father's call to this perfect form of Christian contemplation and points to the Blessed Virgin Mary as a role model for contemplating the true mystery of Jesus Christ, his life, death and resurrection.  Bearing both the Nihil Obstat and the Imprimatur, Praying the Rosary incorporates all four sets of mysteries, including the new Luminous mysteries.  Welborn and Dubruiel follow the format suggested by Pope John Paul II in Rosarium Virginis Mariae  including the announcement of the mystery, scriptural references, contemplative silence, the formal prayers of the Rosary (including a short prayer phrase following each Hail Mary related to the specific mystery), and a brief concluding prayer for each mystery.  Newcomers to Rosary devotion will find the compendium of prayers at the completion of the book a helpful resource.  Complimenting the suggested format, stunning artwork graces the pages for each of the mysteries.  Contemplation of these wonderful icons provided courtesy of St. Isaac of Syria Skete allows the user yet another point of interaction with the mysteries of the Rosary.  This book's compact size makes it the perfect tool for incorporating the Rosary into your daily devotional routine.  The hardcover format is durable and will stand up to daily use.  The book will easily slip into a purse, briefcase, day planner or coat pocket.  Praying the Rosary has taken up permanent residence in my "home away from home", my vehicle, where my boys and I daily contemplate the mysteries of the Rosary in our own effort to better know and love Jesus Christ.  We pray each day, joining our hearts and minds with countless millions around the globe, for peace in our own little corner of the world and beyond. 
 I bought this for my granddaughter to go with her new Cabbage Patch doll and she was thrilled with it.  She immediately packed her doll's clothes into the case and was pulling the case all over the house. The case was a big hit with her 
 Every gay person knows at least 10 hetero couples who are EXACTLY like this film. Heck, every Irish Catholic family is made up of couples like this.  This is one of the best movies ever made. Ever. I think the reason why it hit such a nerve is how true to life it is. This is how heterosexuals act.  I am just so glad that me and my partner can't get married.

 First, I've bought the magazine just about every months (for 6 months) but I liked it so much that I've decided to subscribe for it. If you are into the shabby, cottage, romantic home decoration then you gonna love it! I must tell you that the pictures are sooo inspirational, that when I put the magazine down I can't resist the urge to decorate and come up with great ideas! However these fabulous homes/shops futured in the magazine look very expensive, cost lots of bucks to put together! If you have planty of $$, then it's not a problem but the average person doesn't. So that's the time to get creative! I'd say get the decorator books out too, that will help!  Personally I dont' pay too much attention for the articles since about 80% of the time the Shop/Home owners only talking about how much they like to live/work in their great romantic cottage environment, which designer helpd them to get the look or which part of Europe they flew to purchase that chandalier and so on...but not a word of advice about decorating! The other 20% of the time you get designers, or other people talking about THE look, etc. that is useful. There's also a great list of websides at the back of the magazine where you can shop on line or at one of the first pages quite often a few beutiful object futured (sometimes it's even affordable)! There are not too many adds here, like in other magazines that sometimes you can't find the end of the article..so that's a big + too! 
 ...worth the read!!!  Allen's book is composed of a bunch of short stories, plots for operas, essays, plays etc.  It's all hilarious. Once you start the book, you wont be able to put it down 
 There is not much that I can say about this book, except that it was THE best book I've ever read.  The unspoken medaphors and the underlying currents made reading this book bliss.  I will say this, however.  They don't use quotation marks (sometimes a tad annoying) and you must be in a rather reflective/melencholy mood to read this.  THIS BOOK ROX MY SOX! 
 Sometimes I watch a movie and it turns out to be far more entertaining than I thought it would be. Such is the case with CELLULAR. I had seen the ads for the film and even though it starred Kim Bassinger, I thought that the movie wasn't going to be entertaining at all.  My brother had seen the movie when it came out in theatres and had enjoyed it immensely; he as especially intrigued by the "average citizen becoming a hero" angle.  When I borrowed the movie from him to watch, I tried my best to put my predispositions aside and suspended my disbelief.  I surprisingly found myself becoming immersed in an action-packed and suspenseful story.  CELLULAR takes places in the showy and flashy wealthy environment of Southern California.  Jessica Martin (Kim Bassinger) is a high school science teacher who lives with her realtor husband and son in the L.A. suburb of Brentwood.  After dropping her son off at school, Jessica's home is invaded by a gang of thugs, her housekeeper is shot, and she is kidnapped and taken hostage.  The kidnappers want something her husband has and she has no idea what it is.  The criminals lock her in the attic and smash the building's only phone as they plan to later kidnap both her son and her husband.  Jessica must teach at a private high school because she is able to scrounge together the parts and revive them into a working telephone.  She is only able to call blindly and reaches a self-absorbed, young, and immature kid named Ryan (Chris Evans) who is cruising down Venice Beach on an errand for his ex-girl friend in an attempt to win her back.  At first Ryan thinks the call is a joke, but he soon becomes convinced and attempts to help Jessica as best he can.  Thus begins a lengthy adventure of car chases, attempted killings, more kidnappings, uncaring salespeople, a carjacking, people playing their car stereos too loud, and crooked cops for Ryan all while trying to maintain a constant conversation with Jessica via his cell phone.  The basic concept of CELLULAR seems incredulous at first.  However, it works rather well.  Cell phones have become ubiquitous in our modern society (except I don't have one yet) and as far fetched as some of the events in movie seem at first, the more one thinks about the situation the more credible the idea becomes.  The film's writer, Larry Cohen, also wrote the movie PHONE BOOTH.  This movie tackles some of the same issues that were touched upon in that film, but fleshes them out a bit.  Should Cohen decide to write another movie about communication devices it could very well be a sensation.  Perhaps another reason that CELLULAR works so well is because of the acting.  Even if you have no desire to see the movie because of the concept, see the film because of Kim Bassinger and William H. Macy, who plays a good cop named Mooney who is preparing to retire from the force.  Bassinger is lovely to watch and her portrayal of a kidnapped mother is convincing.  Macy brings a lot of humanity and humor to a character that could have been rather dry and dull in the hands of a lesser actor.  Chris Evans also does a decent job and seems to mature as an actor as his character matures as a person on screen.  Some of that might be because Evans ended up doing almost all of his own stunts in the film.  Overall, I really enjoyed watching CELLULAR.  It's not necessarily a great movie, but it is a good action/suspense/thriller that isn't a waster of one's time.  The DVD includes three documentaries, an audio commentary, and a trailer.  I found the documentaries informative and engaging.  One, "Calling Out" is on the history of telephones and how cellular phones have and are continuing to change society.  "Dialing Up Cellular" is about the making of the film.  "Code of Silence: Inside the Rampart Scandal" is about a 1999 LAPD corruption scandal.  I hadn't heard of this case before and I found it quite interesting, especially how the writer was able to incorporate some of these events as a plotline for the film 
 I do not recommend this book if you are a casual reader, you will misunderstand nearly every line of it.  The Gems found in nearly every aphorism of this book must be decoded with years of research and a comprehensive understanding of Nietzsche's entire philosophy.  Many will not admit this, or do not understand this because they are thrown off by the fact that Nietzsche was not a systemitizer.  I, however, do not wish to discourage anyone from reading this book, in fact I wish everyone would, but without a comprehensive understanding of Nietzsche you will be confused and most likely adopt an incorrect view of Nietzsche's philosophy.  With this said, this is one of the most beautiful achievements of man.  From the very first aphorism, one is thrown into the agony of having to question everything one thinks.  The beauty of Nietzsche lies not only in his prose, but also in the fact that in reading him, one feels as if one is reading a more elegant and articulate version of the struggle that goes on within.  This book will be mirror for many, a mirror that makes the ugly beautiful 
 Want an interesting and entertaining way to get a lot of business management points across to your employees; or perhaps you are looking for something to enhance your own leadership style? May I recommend that you get a copy a very knowledgeable but slightly unorthodox business book called "Leadership Sopranos Style: How To Become A More Effective Boss".  It is not your typical dry and humorless regurgitations of old management mantras. This book, with tongue-in-check at times, explores the world of management through the leadership style of that fictional TV anti-hero Tony Soprano. That should be enough to shake up the old school managers but once you relate to what the author Deborrah Himsel is really saying about his style you will find a real personal vehicle for leadership growth.    This book in no way endorses the mob, whacking managers who fail to achieve but does point out the advantages of looking people "right in the eye" and letting them know what it is that you expect from them. It also takes a look at Tony's approach to conflict resolutions with sit down meetings. Once you realize that most all of these references to Tony is most just a cleaver and entertaining metaphor to make a point you will not only enjoy the book but also learn something valuable from it.   Himsel's book gives the reader many newer and sometimes edgy insights to the workplace and those you need to work with. She does a craftsman's job of presenting strategy and management leadership principles.  The book is charming and a pleasure to read even if you are not going to be a big Fortune 500 executive. You also do not have to have been fan of the TV show, or in fact, had ever even seen it to make the leadership connections.   The book receives the American Authors Association's top book rating of FIVE STARS!   The American Authors Association's- Best Business Book 2006 
 I'm a fan of Five for Fighting so was interested in the new album.  I found the last one a little disappointing, aside from a couple of good songs.  This one however shows a return to form.  THere are some great songs on this CD, from Freedom Never Cries right through to Johnny America.  It's one of those CD's that I can listen to over and over without getting sick of it.  
 This was absolutely awesome. I would take this as good a Tosca as there is. Gheorghiu' best performance. The only thing I didn't like was the flashbacks during the movie. That in no way diminishes this DVD. It is truly a 10. A dark Scarpia is played by Raimondi. I was so moved by this performance. WOW!!! Don't pass it by 
 Before his untimely death in 1991 David Herlihy presented three lectures examining the Black Death and in doing so redefined the entire historical outlook on the great plague.  These speeches may have been lost, if it were not for Samuel K. Cohn, Jr., who collected Herlihy's lectures and notes and presented them in a concise tome.  According to Herlihy although the Black Death had a devastating affected on everything in European society, it kept European culture from getting stale.  While historians originally viewed the "great plague" as a disaster that hit Europe and set European society back 100s of years, Herlihy sees the "death" as a liberating force, pushing European society forward, destroying it, but at the same time transforming it, spurring new growth and possibilities.  There is a reason according to Herlihy, "that the...characteristics of the population collapse of the late Middle Ages [were] Europe's deepest and also its last."     Herlihy's thesis is a simple, yet revolutionary one: that the Black Death created the demand for labor saving devices as the population dwindled, and this in turn pushed European society forward.  While most historians approached the subject from a political and military aspect, Herlihy looks at the social effects of the plague on women, art, and society in general, and comes to the conclusion that the plague was, in the long run, a good thing for Europe.    The book itself is divided into three major parts reflecting the lectures that Herlihy had delivered at the University of Maine in 1985.  Cohn adds an introduction and an extensive section of End Notes, but overly keeps Herlihy's text intact.  The first chapter explores the idea that the plague itself may not have been bubonic plague, which is the standard historical theory to this day.  "Medical writers of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages," writes Herlihy, "recognized only one type of epidemic disease marked by only one kind of symptom, inflammations, boils, or buboes in the area of the groin, [which] the authority of the ancients may have blinded later witnesses to other symptoms, indicating the presence of other types of epidemic disease."   To back up his argument Herlihy knocks down the age-old notion that the plague was spread by infected rats, moving throughout Europe.  If, according to Herlihy, the "death" was bubonic, then there should be evidence of an epizootic within the rat population.  "To my knowledge," Herlihy states, "not a single Western chronicler notes the occurrence of [such] an epizootic, the massive mortalities of rats, which ought to have preceded and accompanied the human plague."   For Herlihy, the disease that ravaged Europe was most likely anthrax.  "Anthrax can produce the characteristic swellings which might be mistaken for buboes."   The second and third chapters of the book delve into the economic impact of the plague on European society, and how that society rebounded from it.  For years historians have look at the reasons behind the cause for the plague as a "Malthusian crisis."  That the population had just grown too big for the land to sustain it.  Herlihy disagrees with this thesis, and sees European society before the plague in more of a social deadlock, which societal numbers maintaining themselves.  "The medieval experience shows us not a Malthusian crisis but a stalemate, in a sense that the community was maintaining at stable levels very large numbers over a lengthy period."   To back up these arguments Herlihy relies on several medieval sources, including documents from the city of Tuscany.  "In spite of frequent famine and widespread hunger, the community in ca. 1300 was successfully holding its numbers."   It is necessary to point out however, that Herlihy's argument that the Black Death was in reality anthrax relies too heavily on sources from Italy, and one can find just as persuasive arguments to support the standard notion of bubonic plague.  In fact Cohn shines skepticism on this theory himself in his introduction.  Yet despite this slight flaw within the first section of the book, Herlihy's argument as presented in the second and third chapters, that the plague was a catalyst and driving force for change within Europe, is well supported. 	 The Black Death "gave to Europeans the chance to rebuild their society along much different lines,"  the author writes.  The unprecedented drain on the labor force, especially devastating because of the feudal society, drove the need to produce labor saving devices, and thus broke the "stalemate" of that feudal society.  "Europe at the time of the plague...was a society reeling under repeated, powerful shocks; burdened with huge numbers of dependents; struggling with difficulty to maintain its occupational cadres; struggling also to uphold the quality of its skilled traditions."   Herlihy clearly put into perspective the situation that existed during feudal times, explaining how land use and societal class differences stagnated European culture.  The plague, killing off large numbers of the labor force, created a situation in which the surviving Europeans, both Nobel and peasant classes, had to adapt in order to survive.  "Above all [the plague] freed resources...mills and mill sites...[that] could now be enlisted for other uses; the fulling of cloth, the operation of bellows, the sawing of wood."   While the horror of the disease took a great toll on the families who lived through it, in the long run "the late Middle Ages were a period of impressive technological achievement."   To arrive at his thesis Herlihy uses an interdisciplinary approach to the Black Death, using comparative narative, as well as a social and medical historic approach, to try and develop a model of how the disease progressed and how populations reacted.  To expound on the latter, the author uses modern approaches as one way of trying to allow the reader to relate to the overwhelming effects the disease had on Europe.  To do so Herlihy creates a comparative analysis with the AIDS virus, and how people reached at first to both AIDS today (homophobic feelings) and the Black Death (anti-Semitism).  To support his arguments Herlihy relies on Church sources from the 1300s, focusing on marriage and death records, drawing most of his data from Italy.  This is one flaw of his work, but should be of no surprise to readers' familiar to the author's other works, as Herlihy is a Medieval Italian historian.  Therefore most of his research focuses on the effect of the Black Death in Italy, and uses literature of the times (poetry and songs), to try and paint an entire picture of medieval life at the time.  To even further understand the social impact of the plague on 1300 society, Herlihy uses as secondary sources monographs, and newspaper articles for comparison with modern plagues.  The concentration on Italian sources however, is a weakness in his thesis, as it does not take into effect the Black Death in England, France, and several other European nations.    The book ends with an extensive section of End Notes, taken from Herlihy's "incomplete" notes, and expanded upon by Cohn.  This section also serves as a Bibliography, and points the reader to other sources of information.  In addition Cohn uses the notes to expand on Herlihy's lectures, providing new and updated information, and sometimes contradicting the author himself.  Unfortunately the book falls short in several places, especially in light of examining other societies that fell victim to the plague.  Herlihy seems to gloss over the fact that the Black Death was a pandemic that effected more than just the people of Europe, and nether Herlihy (or Cohn for that matter), addresses the questions as to why the Middle East, also effected by the plague, did not experience the same cultural resurgence Europe did after the epidemic.  Nor are the effects of plague on China mentioned.  China in the 14th century was also hit hard by epidemics almost identical as that as the Black Death, yet China started falling behind Europe soon afterwards.  Surely if the devastation of its society was the catalyst which prompted innovation in Europe, would it not have had the same effects in China and the Middle East?  It is possible that the European transformation can just as easily be explained by a different theory: the influences of the Mongol Empire.  The Mongol Empire, which crumbled around the same time as the Black Death was ravaging Europe, had transmitted much of China's technology (gunpowder, paper) to Europe.  Over time, as these innovations slowly caught on within European society, these technological changes would have taken place regardless of the death of so much of its population.  It may be that it is more to the Mongols than the plague that Europe is what it is today. 	 Overall what Herlihy and Cohn have achieved here is to present a theory that asked the question, was the Black Death a bad event, or good event for European society?  In and of itself it poses a grand question, and allows the reader to rethink previous views regarding Europe during the 1300s.  While readers interested in a more traditional "history" of the great plague will be disappointed, serious scholars will find Herlihy's arguments provocative, and thought provoking.  Despite its few flaws, Herlihy's "The Black Death and the Transformation of the West" is an excellent collection which challenges the views of mainstream history, and that is always a good thing.

 This is the best lit that Sartre produced.  He was one of the first "intellectuals" who I dutifully followed like I did Rock Stars once their original groups broke up:  once I found something good, I sought more and was continually disappointed.  That is not a criticism of the plays as they are here, but of the man in a wider context.    No Exit is a great masterpiece of European literature, with echoes of modernism, surrealism, and the theatre of the absurd.  I did not think it was all that deep, but it is a wodnerful theatrical experience and full of potential for later analysis.  Like the best of Brecht, the viewer is left in a state of conflict and ferment, ready to talk after the work of art is over.  Sartre's work meets this standard, and is very close to first-rate literature.    Warmly recommended as a quintessential link in leftist, existential literature.  It opened a world to me 
 This is an excellent book which provides just enough insight and expertise for casual dog fans and owners without overdoing it.  More intense, information-hungry dog aficionados might want more but that's not what the book delivers.  The quality of the pictures is outstanding and give an accurate representation of the dogs appearance, although there aren't too many (if any, as I recall) of the depicted breeds as pups.  The rating system for strengths and weaknesses of each breed is an extremely effective way to quickly educate the readers, especially on types they may not be familiar with.  I'd give the book a five star rating, but then Dr. Coile would have nothing to shoot for 
 Loved this movie! Eddie is in his element; this movie will leave you cheering on the edge of your seat. Both Eddie and director Robert M. Young are magical 
 Just for the record, I'm reviewing the 2006 edition of this book, so it is no longer as out of date as the previous edition.  And it is a very interesting book.  We learn definitions of terrorism, we see what terrorism is, how terrorists recruit, how many of them think, what some of them say, how they get publicity, how they take advantage of media opportunities ("Don't shoot, Abdul!  We're not on prime time!"), and so on.  We also read about circumstances in which terrorists may decide that mass murder (involving huge numbers of deaths as opposed to spectacular but less deadly acts of terror) makes sense.  Can terrorist groups be defeated?  Of course they can.  Most of them do not last long.  A few such groups do last for a while, especially if they get some support from one or more nations.  But even these can be defeated.  Bruce Hoffman makes the point that while media coverage is essential for terrorists, the net effect of such coverage is mixed: audiences are eager to follow the exploits of terrorists, but much of the media coverage of terrorism is negative, and most of the audience is opposed to terrorism.  The author recommends patience and determination in the fight against terrorism.  And I think that human civilization always has a chance against any terrorist foe.  If not, the terrorists will, of course, destroy themselves along with the rest of us.  Terrorists often claim that their victory is inevitable.  But it rarely is.  After all, most terrorist goals are incredibly arbitrary.  Without the use of violence, terrorists would rarely have any chance of even temporary success, and in the long run, they usually have no chance.  Almost all terrorist groups are therefore at a big long-term disadvantage.  Still, I think we may be overlooking something here: what about those cases in which terrorism is not the first option of some greedy extremists?  What about those rare cases in which it is a minor option of reasonable people?    For example, suppose some of us decided to try to accomplish some possibly dubious but possibly reasonable goal, such as the expansion of the Church of Latter Day Saints to 30 million members, or autonomy for Poles, Kurds or Tibetans.  Would terrorism be our first choice?  No.  We would realize that our goals were not so arbitrary as to be impossible without violence.  We'd be patient and slowly move towards success.  But now suppose that, with the Church of Latter Day Saints increasing in numbers, some nations, including the United States, decided on a controversial policy of genocide to get rid of all Mormons!  Oops!  Now what?  Well, in that case, terrorism might well be one of several options for those trying to change such a strange and catastrophic policy.  And in that case, with the goal of terrorism simply being to stop the genocide, the terrorist aims would be anything but arbitrary and dubious.  I think it is always important to notice the difference between the wild actions of extremists and those of people who are merely trying to defend themselves.  And I feel that many people, including some experts on terrorism, fail to emphasize this sufficiently.  Even in this book, we see the author point out that in some cases (such as in South Africa), terrorism can help achieve goals.  Hoffman does explain that in this case, the terrorist goals were very coherent and relatively reasonable, but he fails to emphasize the fact that without violence on either side, those goals were likely to be achieved!   I think we also see a little confusion about the false similarities some people see in Jewish terrorism versus Arab terrorism.  Much of the Jewish terror in the 1940s was indeed arbitrary, but at least it was in support of a goal (Jews getting human rights in the Levant) that was going to be achieved if neither side used any violence.  Much of the Arab terror was also arbitrary, but it was in support of a very different goal, namely the permanent obliteration of human rights for Jews in the region.  That goal had no chance of being achieved without violence.  I think the author should have been clearer about such differences.  After all, the former kind of terrorism has goals that are indeed likely to be achieved in the long run, and moreover, mere achievement of such goals is not much of a threat to society.  The goals of the latter form of terrrorism have little chance of being achieved in the long run and constitute a great threat to everyone.    In spite of these minor complaints, I like this book very much.  It is comprehensive and useful, and I recommend it. 
 As a mother just begining to teach the "birds and the bees" this is a terrific help.  The material is age appropriate and interesting to read.  The best part, however, is the Christian aspect.  I know that our children will understand and respect their sexuality more because they will know why God gave them this gift and the value of protecting that gift. Thank you for the Learning About Sex Series 
 This is a great introduction on NT survey. It gets into the issues of textual criticism and authorship and the dates of the NT books. The book is written at a seminary level, not for those who are not well read or trainned in this area of study. I recommended this book to a friend, in which I had to explain to him the issues in the text while he read this book. Great for readers who know a lot about the issues that the average Christian could care less about.    
 Common is one of the best rappers hands down. I think this CD is good but "Like Water for Chocolate" is sicker. One track that you heads need to hear is a white label edit on vinyl by Karu featuring Common called "Faces on the Mural". This is deep house at it's finest with the ripe vocals of Common. You guys should check out Karu's "Amazing Place" CD for some great deep jazzy house & trip-hop. Wow! I can't believe it. I just bought the Illform "Next Level Fusion" & Quentin's Ladder "Delusion" on here and realized Quentin Allen produced all these including Karu "Amazing Place". Don't be fooled! This definitely is not Quentin's first CD. It is the third CD and maybe the best. People need to check out this music. The jazz & hip-hop influences are all there and come together nicely. My favorite track is "Out to Get Mine" Hot EPMD vocal snippet. Another great track is "Sketch the Play". You'll here a great texture of sounds too. Rhodes & acoustic pianos, synths, deep basslines, great vocal samples, tight house beats, awesome jazz solos and nice chords. The Karu sound is like deep house by Hanna, Office Gossip, Miguel Miggs, and Chuck Love. If you want to here a great producer at work, get Quentin Allen latest offering "Amazing Place".  
 This is a wonderful album and it shows us some of this amazing band's diversity, but not everyone will apreciate it. If you only like Good news for people who love bad news and Moon and Antarctica, then this isn't for you. It is much more raw and a lot stranger. If you do like this, then you will probably also like Long drive and Lonesome crowded, which is their best album and my personal favorite album period 
 My husband got these for my mother.  She LOVES them.  She recently has needed PT and uses them where ever she goes now.  I have had 2 pairs now, that I have lived.  Highly suggested 
 For the fan of classic Cleese, you will not be disappointed.  This movie is blessed with a spectacular cast and a superb script.  The comic timing and sheer talent of the cast, make this one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever watched.  There are so many memorable scenes in this movie, it is difficult to describe without resorting to spoilers.  One thing I will say, however, is that this film has made an indellible impact on my family.  Hardly a family gathering will go by, without someone saying, "Oh do shut up, Porche!"  Some of the most hilarious scenes, in my opinion, are between Otto (Kevin Kline) and Ken (Micheal Palin).  Strangely, even though the character's are supposed to be a band of thieves, you can't help but almost root for this gang of underdogs.  Speaking of Dogs, some of the scenes may not appeal to animal lovers.  However, these scenes are handled in a fairly cartoonish and very "Monty Python" fashion, so I don't think they will insult the sensibilities of most viewers.  This movie was given an R rating, mostly for dialog and a brief view of Cleese's buttocks, but I doubt that it would even receive a PG-13 rating now.  While it is not a movie I'd recommend for young children, as the humor is likely to be over their heads, I recommend this as one of the funniest movies I've seen in the last 15 years!

 Even as a avid follower of the Tour and Bicycle racing for that matter, this book gave me insights about the Tour and Bicycle racing, that I guess would make it really a book not just for Dummies!  It was just plain fun to read this well research guide to a different world 
 The fact that this books starts when Darwin disembarks in England after his strenuous and fact-finding voyage on the Beagle makes this book ever so much more interesting.  Quammen has certainly done his homework when it comes to explaining Darwin's ideas.  The book is not dry at all.  Very readable and engaging.  Anyone who has ever been intrigued by the theory of evolution should pick this book up and give it a go.  
 The best book of Lucid dreaming writen by the man who discovered Lucid dreaming and proved it to the scientific community. He is a visionary and this is his masterpiece 
 Eragons journey continues in this 2nd book from Christopher Paolini. Although a great deal of time is spent in the politics of the different races the storyline progresses fairly well. I have been reading this series to my boys and with the exception of having to explain quite a bit of the vocabulary, they have been enraptured by the story. We can't wait for book number three 
 I own about 30 books in mechanics of materials (Also mechanics of solids and strength of materials) and am very happy to see an elegant text like this one. I'm not new to Lardner's books (I own An Introduction to the Mechanics of Solids) but this one surpass the previous title and present a more detailed materials and subjects supported by good numbers of examples. I'm also pleased with the level of problems given in this text (good number of changeling problems). On the top of that, answers to all problems are given in the text end and that will give the student the opportunity to benefit 100% from this book. I would like to see most mechanics books that deal the same subjects follow the steps of Lardner and Archer (in all aspects). If I give 5 stars to a book, it will be this one. I believe that all engineering students who are taking a course in Mechanics of Materials should have a look at this one, no matter what book is your text 
 "Deep Six" is an captivating and interesting novel.  The story plot is great, the President of the United States is kidnapped while on a cruise along to Potomac River, and a deaadly nerve agent was released off the coast.  From the first page, the story captivates you so much you do not want to put it down.  This book is not as good as his other novel, "Shock Wave", which is my favorite.  He spends Some of the time, about one hundred pages, on setting up the scene.  Overall, this is a good read.  I would reccomend this to anyone enjoys a fast - paced and well written book 
 If you enjoyed Nancy, Bess, George and Ned as a child you will find comparable delight with Mariah Stewart's books.  Moderate suspense, minimal gore, unoffensive language, steamless romance and characters who fight for truth and justice without the aid of pyrotechnics.  A nice change-up from the standard twisted fare that has become the norm 
 Angus Maddison's The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective is highly unique because of the long historical perspective it brings to the understanding of global economic development and fluctuations.  Maddison provides data on population growth, per-capita income, and gross domestic product on regional, national, and global levels for the last 1000 years.  The last two centuries receive special attention.  For more books on economic development go to my profile and see my Amazon Listmania "Future Studies Reading List. 
 A treat for the ears and for your memory.  What would Christmas be without hearing three of the happiest, jolliest Christmas songs ever.  I taped the album and have had the CD for years.  It NEVER gets old.  Listen to it and you'll know what I mean.   
 Yes, it's true, the Queen of Norway is a sworn enemy of all giraffes, as are Gila monsters, millipedes, toucans, Lee Iacocca (and his nephews), and Matthew Perry. This educational book will teach you these facts and many more about giraffes. Did you know that giraffes are from Neptune and came to Earth on a conveyor belt? Did you know that if given the choice giraffes prefer to live in Terre Haute, Indiana? Did you know that giraffes control the world's supply of ice? You will discover these truths and much, much more in this book, written by noted giraffe scientists Dr. and Mr. Doris Haggis-On-Whey.   This book is suitable for all ages, and even includes several useful flash cards in the back to help you study important giraffe facts. One of the most useful topics covered is the useful list of giraffe expressions, such as "I'm about to go High Renaissance on your toes," and "My pants are off, put the kettle on." There is even a chapter on the little known mortal enemies of giraffes, sea monsters from the deep, and illustrations of such epic battles as "The Clipper Ship Edward Rhys-Davis Battles the Humongous Sand Woman From Upper Volta," and "The Clipper Ship Tina Yothers Battles the Indescribably Inimitable and Big Driftwood Creature of the Bay of Bengali." These battles are illustrated with the monsters represented by plastic toys, while the Clipper Ships were fashioned out of fig-oriented treats for utmost realism.  This is a wonderfully entertaining and hilarious book, which I highly recommend to anyone with a sense of humor. If you want to know more about giraffes, I guarantee that this book will reveal things which you had never imagined. 
 The first time I heard this CD was in a store in Santa Barbara, and I went straight to the cash register and begged for the title.  I have only good things to say about this album and I could go on forever.  I love the beat - gentle but driving.  Makes it good for any setting.  Actually, I found that the best place to listen to this CD is in the bath with some aromatherapy candles burning.  *contented sigh*  : 
 The Last Worthless Evening is Andre Dubus's least acclaimed collection, but it contains one of his most moving novellas, "Rose," and another fine novella, "Molly," that has been neglected by most readers because it has not been collected in his Selected Stories or Collected Novellas.  I can hardly think of a more adult book than The Last Worthless Evening. It is compassionate, wise, and unflinching in its examination of its characters. I only wish Dubus had stuck around a few more years so we could have more stories like these 
 As always Dan Brown writes lively characters and a quick paced story showcased against a vivid, informative background. Add a few plot twists and you have a story that reads like a movie thriller. If you've read Dan Brown before and liked him, you'll see his usual storyline unfold and enjoy this book 
 If you spend a lot of time in New York, it's easy to take it for granted.  Mr. Nash is someone who does not.  Each building in this sumptuously photgraphed book has a story to tell and he does so with a lot of  admiration. Now, when I walk through the streets and recognize one I read  about, I stop and notice the details and try to recall what was in the  text. It would make a nice gift to anyone who loves the city 
 I'll be the first to admit that I do not read very often. Rarely does a book captivate me in a way where I feel I cannot put the book down. I've read the book three times already. I could relate to her in many ways and maybe that is why I found her sarcasim in the book very humorous. Although she doesn't offer any answers, that was never her intention. She didn't know what the answers were. All she knew is that in the end you've got to make a choice to live or die. She chose to live and get help. Anorexia didn't start because she came from a bad home or something tragic happened to trigger it. Carrie simply fell into the addiction of losing weight, counting calories, and greuling exercise routine. What for? Hell if she knows. I absolutely loved it and wish she would write more books. I love her style of writing 
 I originally picked this up on a whim, seeing as it included Blink 182 and Death Cab for Cutie, and I'm very glad I did. As with any compilation, there are some hits and some misses on this album.  The theme is definitely punk, but it runs the gamut of Blink182's brand of pop-punk to the classic punk style of The Bled, and just about everything in between.  While my personal preferences lean more to the pop-punk end of the spectrum (classic punk, to me, sounds like melodic screaming), there's enough variety for anybody who likes punk to find *something* they will like.  However, that also means that just about everybody is also likely to find something they don't like.  I think this album achieves what it sets out to do: collect a wide variety of punk styles.  However, because it is such a wide variety, the theme isn't as cohesive as it could be.  All in all, I recommend this as a good introduction to a variety of bands using the many different incarnations of the "punk" sound 
 The intricate plot of this novel achieves a state of mystical paranoia by echoing its human developments in symbol and allusion that seem to resemble the world as whole. It takes a slacker from impotence to self-assured determination, and in that is a beautiful work of literature within the tawdry (but enjoyable!) setting of mystery novels. I was completely hooked and engrossed for the first 3/4 of the book, but after that it faded into a less assertive ending. However, it doesn't matter. This is one of the best mystery novels I've ever read because it so carefully suspends disbelief, and matches every detail with an ecclesiastical or social paranoia. I would recommend this even to people who hate mystery novels 
 I loved the book for adults and I think that it is a wonderful book for children. 
 The 10th story (9 novels, 1 novella) in the In Death series gives readers a break after the emotional intensity of the preceding book, Conspiracy in Death.    Instead of a murderer or a serial killer, this time NYPSD homicide lieutenant Eve Dallas is up against terrorists who are bent on blowing up NYC landmarks.  The Good: The characterization.  As always, that's J.D. Robb's (Nora's) genius.  Whatever the plot, she nails the characters. The balance between seriousness and exaggeration.  In this book, much is larger than life, but it's balanced with some serious and emotional scenes. The continuing story.  We get developments in Eve's past and in Peabody's life, and my personal favorite: Eve and Roarke's relationship continues to develop at a realistic pace.  The Bad: I had a problem with the explanation for the first murder. The motivation for the terrorist group was unclear. The subject matter might hit a little too close to reality for some readers.  The Unusual: It's a departure for the series, and I found I enjoyed it more if I viewed it as such.  It's a bit over the top, moreso than other books in the series, as is particularly evident in the opening and closing scenes.  The Verdict: It's an exciting, lively story, and the developments in the personal lives of several of the characters are well worth the read and a good addition to the series 
 Overall this is the best investment guide I've found yet. Rule #1 is "Don't lose money." Fair enough; no one wants to lose $$. But how? The author answers that question. First, buy wonderful companies. For Town, that means companies with strong and consistent growth: 10% minimum average annual growth for EPS, free cash flow, sales, and book value for the last 10 years. Efficient, well-managed companies, with great return (10% or higher) on invested capital. Once you've found that company, determine the fair value, and buy it ONLY when it's at a 50% discount, thus giving you a "margin of safety" against the vagaries of the "Mr. Market."   He makes it sound easy, but it's not. He admits that it can take 4-8 hours of research on each company to determine if it's "wonderful" or not. And even after you've done a preliminary search with a stock screening tool, you might have to research dozens of companies to find one that's wonderful AND trading at a 50% discount.   One great feature of this book is that Town provides a fairly simple method for determining the fair stock price of a company. This is a notoriously difficult problem, but Town's method is quite good. The problem is that you have to determine the expected growth rate of the company and the future PE ratio. He provides methods for doing so, but the process is necessarily quite speculative. But if you're going to invest in stocks (as opposed to mutual funds), this difficulty is unavoidable. At least his method is fairly rigorous and scientific. There is little guess-work. Town recommmends buying only when the price is at least 50% below the "fair value price."  Once you've chosen a "wonderful" company and sunk your life savings into it, Town outlines a trading strategy designed to avoid losing your money (rule #1). His trading method relies on 3 technical analysis indicators, MACD, Moving Average, and Stochastic. These indicators are easily available at many free stock charting sites. Basically, you trade out when the trend is going down, and trade back in when it's going up. It's therefore a form of market timing, which is very controversial and tricky. The advantage is that you will avoid the big market meltdowns like 2000-2002. Even if you don't know anything about technical analysis, his method is easy to follow. On the other hand, if you don't feel comfortable market timing, you can buy and hold, and still presumably do well if you've chosen your stock according to Town's guidelines.   According to Town, anyone who follows his method is guaranteed to get 15% minimum annual return in any market conditions, thus doubling your money every five years. Unfortunately, there are no "sure-fire" methods for getting that kind of return, especially in a bear market. But in any case, he still provides a detailed, coherent, and understandable method for finding great companies to invest in and avoiding losses. 
 I had this book as a child and loved it then.  Now that I am a parent, all of Dr. Seuss' books are a must.  This one happens to be one of my favorites.  I highly recommend it.  It's also the perfect gift for little ones on their birthday.  
 My all time favorite book. Read it for the first time when i was nine and  enjoy it still. For mystery fan, this is a must! Don't miss it 
 I have referred all of my depresssed cleints to this book.  It is a broad-based approach to contending with depression, and is eminantly usable.  O'Conner takes a commen sense approach to a debilitating process, and in doing so, exhibits uncommon intelligence in offering a wide variety of approaches to dealing with depression, which is notoriously difficult to treat and requires a multi-headed approach for best results.  No one school is best, and clients benefit from a multitude of suggestions founds in this book.  
 I enjoyed the many twists of speech in this movie, though I found the movie itself vulgar. I reminded myself a few times that this was part of the point that the movie sought to communicate about the Earl, so was pacified.  The value of this film is indeed in the acting performances of Depp and Samantha Morton. I enjoyed the Pirates movies, but wasn't particularly dazzled by the acting. Those films are fun, but not memorable in the best sense of the word, for me at least. This helped me to get a stronger impression of Johnny Depp's great talent.   This movie has moments I'd like to forget, but the Speeches! The superb Acting and speaking of the Words!   If you take the movie in pieces, and listen to it, it elevates, though the visuals ultimately are dark and gritty in a way I've chosen to call "uncomfortable."   If you can't take those moments without it casting a shadow on the whole film, don't see this movie.  
 I purchased this book out of curiosity. I haven't been a student for longer than I'd like to admit, but this book welcomed me home like I'd never left academia. The writing is superb. The analyses and time lines are expertly done. And, there is more than enough appropriate authorial humor. Edith Hamilton would have recommended this work of art 
 Valeries serious and lovingly book about her life as married to one of Hem's sons is also very well written. For all of us still reading about the astonishing life of Hem (there are several 100 around)this one is a must. Don't miss her sound opinions from a life within the family 
 As the singer has said many times before. He sings into the ear of his fans. But its nice to know a little bit more of his life, and more clearly in a conversation.  Great book. Great person. Great Thougts.  thn 
 It will certainly help me on those nights when I am too busy to think and need a peripheral brain. I will just whip this puppy out of my pocket, and whalla 
 This book completely demystified teaching my son the three R's, and at such an affordable price.  Before I read these, I was still concerned that I wouldn't do as good of a job as a trained educator -- but this really breaks it down and even makes it fun for my son.  Each chapter had several helpful activities that helped hone my son's skills without worksheets and without having to buy extra stuff from a specialty store.  I look forward to using it on my daughter this year.  I'm buying my fourth set, since I keep loaning out my copies and never get them back!  It's an economical, encouraging, practical resource for teaching K-3 
 This book is excellent for in depth knowledge on CLR issues. Use it to e.g. get more info on how to handle exceptions properly, or to reveal the secrets behind the locking mechanisms. Note that this book is referenced several times in the MCTS Exam 70-536 .NET Framework Training Kit 
 I listened to the CD version of Simple Courage.  Other reviewers have deducted marks for the book's length and author's personal narrative.  None of that mars the audio version.  LISTEN to the CD.  It's been expertly abridged by Kristin Lesko into a tight, taut, compelling story.  Frank Delaney is an absolutely OUTSTANDING reader/narrator (a long prior career at the BBC probably helped).  I begrudged every moment it took to eject the finished CDs and spin up the new ones. 
 When we first bought this book for my then two-year old daughter, I could barely get through it the first time.  I didn't much like it.  That's probably because I was so busy trying to say the words it, I couldn't pay attention to what was actually happening.  Since then, the book has grown on me, and my now three-year old daughter loves it, as well.  After reading the book aloud a gazillion times, I can now say it almost without getting my tongue twisted, and my favorite part is the ending, where Knox finally gets his "revenge" for what Fox has put him through.  One minor complaint:  Seuss uses the word "dumb," a word I would prefer to keep out of my daughter's vocabulary, and it could easily have been replaced with "glum," a change I try to institute when I read the book 
 This album is full of excellent songs from "Love Is All Around, Heavan, and much more like the heart felt song of I'll Be There and daydreaming song Trippin. I glad I came across this album when I did...and 1nce again the A&R reps did'nt push enough grab it b4 it's gone....u won't disapprove 
 This book is well written but is easier to read if you understand a little bit about DNA and its double helix structure.  Someone who knows nothing about DNA's structure may feel a little frustrated in parts.  The author writes so well that I have to say the book was a page-turner - it is a little unfortunate that a few of the past reviews told some of the "surprises in the plot" (Reviewers please don't tell the less known facts and ruin it for the rest of us!)  I would recommend it as an inspirational book for young gifted scientists -- especially females.  That may seem odd because some people would view her life as "tragic" but I feel it encourages a person to forge onward in spite of the negative actions of others.  It would've been interesting to see if she'd been awarded the Nobel Prize -- then again, would she have cared since she appeared to be a scientist first and notoriety seemed secondary.  Then again, it is still important that this book be written so people know the real story!  A gutsy, intelligent woman I would've loved the opportunity to know!  
 The book is full of short activities that answer some natural questions that youth often ask. The activities tell information with wonderful graphic sense.  Good for scout leaders, teachers, home school parents, camp counselors and outdoors families.  Preparation and materials may take ten minutes to gather.  Reading the activity can use up five to ten minutes.  Yet, with such a wide variety of activities, each tuned to a particular season of the year, there are lots of options to do or not do.  Very pleased with the thoughtful and "hands on" aspects of these activities. A motivated reading student can do most of them with out supervision 
 As a member of the younger generation, it was great to learn what happened on the set before me.  It's cool to hear how the different clubs got along and how sometimes color doesn't matter, but sometimes it does.  This book is great for anyone wanting to know more about the black biker set 
 This book was recommended by none other than Stephen King, his best book pick for 2005 in Entertainment Weekly.  His last Best Book pick was Vernon God Little, so I had some trepedation going in.  Readers should not be put off by the first 22 pages.  They come off as a fey literary novel about English sisters.  Boring, right?  But the book picks up speed from there and has everything a good book should: 1) Intersting characters, 2) Great writing, & 3) a sense of humor.  Atkinson's writing is top notch while her characters continue to surprise.  Jackson Brodie, a PI with the same bad luck as any American PI including a troublesome ex-wife, somebody out to kill him, and investigative problems, is a sympathetic character who we don't even meet until Chapter 4, 45 pages in.  That's the beauty of this book, there is no hurry, characters are developed as you go, yet the story moves along at a nice pace.    
 Many people fall in love and get married and by instinct the children come.Many planned over what shall come after and are prepared.Many married for love,some for conveniance,but when things go wrong,children are always the victims.They never have faults over what their parents like or dislike. In this movie we learned that if you wanna change another person,you have to change yourself,because we can never change a person.Some people need to be alone sometimes and it has to be tollerated because the person doesn't belong to us,neither our childrens are ours.They don't come from us,but through us.Somewhere it has to be a compromise,respecting the individual's need because every person is an individual. Giving a space to another person is also giving a space to ourselves. This movie was a 'boom' in Europe,one reason is for the stars and characters,another one is because the men lost their homes...! 
 This is the fourth set of DVDs that complete the WrestleMania Anthology.  Sadly, the last two WrestleManias (19 and 20) aren't that great.  However, this set includes some awesome matches from "WrestleMania 2000" (Edge/Christian vs. The Hardyz vs. The Dudleyz in a Ladder match, or Mick Foley vs. Big Show vs. The Rock vs. Triple H in a No DQ Elimination match for the WWF Championship).  "WrestleMania X-8" from 2002 is also a solid PPV.  Hollywood Hulk Hogan has one of his best matches as he faces The Rock, and The Undertaker battles Ric Flair in a No DQ match.  Also, see Triple H in a rare turn as a good guy as he wrestles the first-ever Undisputed WWF champion Chris Jericho.  But the real treat on this compilation is "WrestleMania X-Seven" from 2001.  This is the best WrestleMania ever released!  Vince McMahon and Shane McMahon in a Street Fight...TLC II...Stone Cold vs. The Rock (Match 2)...Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle...and the best match of the night - Triple H vs. The Undertaker!  This PPV is superb!  Unfortunately, the last two events aren't that great.  "WrestleMania XIX" is forgiveable, because it has two stellar matches (Chris Jericho vs. Shawn Michaels, and Brock Lesnar vs. Kurt Angle).  But "WrestleMania XX" is merely okay because while it has some good ones (Chris Benoit vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H---Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle), it has some stinkers too (Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg), and also has three matches that WWE didn't even want to put on the VHS tape (Tag Team Titles matches?).  The scratch logos are partially blurred in the first three PPVs, but no audio dubbing seems to have occurred.  My suggestion is that you simply purchase 16 (er, "2000") and 17 individually.  The 18th WrestleMania wouldn't be too bad of an investment either.  However, if you're a completists like me, you'll want to buy all six of them in this pack.  Even though I've written harshly about 19 and 20, they aren't bad.  They just simply could've been so much more and make some questionable decisions.  Enough talk, go ahead and buy this.  "WrestleMania" does not survive through nostalgia.  This Anthology is well worth your time 
 I am going  to purchase "Red Tails in Love" for gifts and to show my support for Pale Male and Lola. Perhaps, others who support these magnificent creatures, will do the same. It's one way for individuals who live far away from "927" to support the efforts to keep Pale Pale and Lola in their home 
 I have to admit I was pleasantly surprized to find that the comfortor & sheets were so nice. They were very colorful & seem like they will hold up well against the hard play of a two-year-old & his 4-year-old brother! When they opened the boxes & saw Thomas they opened the package right away & played with them like tents & played tug of war for HOURS & the sheets didn't seem to mind. My great-grandsons both like Thomas but one has a twin bed, the other a full-size so finding something for the both of them was difficult. But, once agian, Amazon made my life easy - just got on line & there they were - two different styles for the different sized beds 
 HEARTS IN ATLANTIS by Stephen King  THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON by Stephen King   Two reviews in one? What up with that? Well, I read HEARTS IN ATLANTIS some time ago and, beyond "rah rah go read this," I said it exposed my inadequacies as a reviewer. How stupid was that? I'm going to try again.   I finished reading MY LIFE by Bill Clinton late one Tuesday afternoon, then immediately picked up THE MAN WHO LOVED TOM GORDON. I figured my old friend Stephen King could clear my exhausted mind. He immediately pulled me in, and I read it in a single sitting. It's gripping stuff. Incredibly realistic, insightful regarding human nature, and it'll scare your pants off. The Master is most definitely at the top of his game with this book. Ditto with ATLANTIS.   Authors, how do you feel when you spend months (years?) writing a book only to have some reader say he polished it off in a single evening? Actually, I think you oughta feel good. No writer, not even Isaac Asimov, could/can be sufficiently prolific to be the only one a reader ever needs. I think this is very cool, and I love working with fellow authors to promote this thing we do.   Okay, back to my book review. King was always great, right? But there came a point where a certain sameness crept in. It's hard to define, perhaps, but you know what I mean. I don't think he was having as much fun as he used to, and after a time, neither were we.   Then came ON WRITING, which I never run out of breath raving about, and now books like these. He's scaling back the supernatural, which never bothered me at all, because he's found even scarier things to write about. The Master has raised his game, and it's a joy to know I've got a big old pile of unread Stephen King novels downstairs. Expect more rave reviews.   Oh, and Stephen, if you're reading this, and you ever get the desire to raise your game yet again, just let me know. I'll go rent a truck and hit you with it. (It's a joke. Just like the idea that YOU subscribe to MY rag. I know you'd rather read DAVE'S RAG.) 
 This is the best overall book on lean management since Lean Thinking.  An excellent methodical description and analysis of the Wiremold lean journey, demonstrating the tools and leadership required to execute a lean transformation.  Like Lean Thinking, you have more "a-ha!" moments each additional time you read it.  Very highly recommended 
 Stossel covers a variety of topics in this book.  I get the feeling that many who read this book will be a bit uncomfortable with some of the topics discussed.  But that probably has more to do with people's desire to keep blinders on than the way in which Stossel covers his topics.  Ranging from topics about how there isn't an out of control cancer epidemic, as is portrayed in some areas of the media (eg. the nightly news) to things like how poorly of a job public schools are doing and why, most will  be intrigued by this book, if not angered.  I loved it.  I enjoyed Stossel's explaining that many 'conventional wisdoms' may be conventional because alot of people believe in them, they are certainly not full of wisdom, because they are often untrue or greatly exagerrated. 
 From my opinion, Ballbreaker deserves 3.5 stars, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt for a couple great songs. Otherwise, Ballbreaker is a sub-par album that is in the same vein as Flick Of The Switch, but some better songs.  1.Hard As A Rock- The best song on the album is incredibly catchy and funny as well. 10/10 2.Cover You In Oil- Okay song, pretty good beat, but not great. 7/10 3.The Furor- Great guitar in the beginning give this song an ominous feel, but it gets old rather quickly. 7/10 4.Boogie Man- Fantastic blues song that has Brian Johnson growling out the vocals while Angus provides the trademark AC/DC guitar. 9/10 5.Honey Roll- More great guitar work in the beginning of this song give it a lasting effect. Also, you gotta love the double entendre "Honey roll over, lettuce on top." 8/10 6.Burnin' Alive- The guitar in this song almost gives it a melodic feel, making it great in the process. 10/10 7.Hail Caesar- Mediocre song, but has a cool chorus. 7/10 8.Love Bomb- Kind of repetitive, not really that good. 6/10 9.Caught With Your Pants Down- Classic AC/DC jokes and great guitar work from Angus, but it's really just a   lame song. 6/10 10.Whiskey On The Rocks- Another great intro by Angus can't really help this sog from getting repetitive. 7/10 11.Ball Breaker- You think they would end it with a better song, but it's just as mediocre as some other ones on this CD. 6/10  This album is speckled with some great guitar work and catchy songs, but in actuality is just a sub-par album. A pretty fun listen though 
 "Righteous Revenge" first novel by Beverly J Scott will have you on the edge of your seat and keep you engrossed. This is a read-in-one-sitting well-written mystery. There is just enough romance mixed into the plot to entertain most readers. Marvelous first novel 
 This was one of my favorite Rinaldi books, out of all 12 that I've read. Emily Pigbush's mother dies in the beginning, and she has to choose between living with Annie Suratt, Mary Suratt's daughter, and her Uncle Valentine, a very good doctor. When she ends up unwillingly staying with her Uncle, she learns something terrible about him, that forces her to run away. When his assistant finds her and brings her home, Emily discovers that the crime her uncle commits is for the good of everyone. I don't want to give it away, but this book is fascinating, and I forgot to say that it is during the time of Lincoln's assassination. I would reccommend ALL of Rinaldi's books, even though I haven't read them all. I just know they're good anyways 
 My computer ran great with the extra memory. It recognized it right away. I upgraded from 512MB to 1.5GB. Very solid and relabl 
 Without a doubt, this stands as one of the great baseball movies. Unlike "The Natural" or "Field of Dreams", this is a true story- that of the 1919 Chicago White Sox and their plot to throw the World Series spurred on by the miserly ways of their owner Charlie Commiskey. The movie brings to life early 20th century baseball and all of the many actors are very good in their parts. Bringing to life people, events, and an era almost a century old are not easy but it is very well done here. I think the movie will appeal to non baseball fans also as the film is more concerned with the drama of the characters rather than the "X"s and "O"s of baseball 
 "The Story of O", after reading it, is definitely one of a kind. It reads, at first, like a typical love story until Sir Stephen gets on the scene and then it gets a little scary. It is the untimate in female submission as O completely and untimately turns herself over to her "master".  This is a book that can be a tad disturbing--if you're not ready for it. So, be warned but know some do consider it to be a classic. I liked it, but also like a little "lighter" fare, such as "Breaking the Girl", though this is a must read for any fan of the BDSM genre 
 Seldom does one get such a multifaceted picture of small town life in Ireland. There is a kaleidioscopic collection of characters, all too human, and Maeve Binchy weaves them together with great skill and dexterity. One senses the deep religiosity of the Irish people and their trust in the benevolence of their saints. The razor edge of scientific rationality has been unable to affect and extinguish the embers of a genuine and wistful belief of the people, in a saint's ability to perform miracles after being prayed to with longing and sincerity. One gets a glimpse of the Irish soul, so to speak, with all its' fantasies, foibles and frailties.  This book is essentially a collection of short stories. Each chapter depicts an event that is told by an ensemble of different voices, all in the first person. The underlying thread is a wishing well inside a wood near the town of Rossmore. Water from the well has healed and given solace to many. A road is being planned to reduce traffic within the town. However, permission for building the road has to be sanctioned, and the stumbling block is that it would have to go through the wood and the wishing well would have to be demolished to make way for the former. The merits and demerits of the road construction, among other themes, are played out in this novel, using a host of characters, whose lives are intricately intertwined. There is the story of a mother whose baby daughter is stolen and also the story of the woman who stole her, years later, after the daughter has grown up. Somewhere else in the book, the story of the same mother, is mentioned, as seen through the eyes of her best friend. There is also the Forrest Gump kind of character who makes it good, because of his golden heart, and who ultimately has a hand in resolving the dilemma of the road and the wood. Alcoholic fathers and infidelities abound as also the fallout in the lives of those they are close to, all presented with Maeve Binchy's characteristically non-judgemental style. In all, a colourful mosaic of Irish small town life and a riveting read 
 This book is basically the nuts and bolts to good design. If you are not interested in reading about theory and want to jump into designing correctly or you want to improve your designing skills IMMEDIATELY, this is the book to buy.  Many design choices (mistakes) are addressed and explained in simple English. You are able to enhance business cards (for ex.) without reading a complete chapter.  This book offers instant results. This is definitely one that should be in your collection whether for small business needs or a designing career.   I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 only because I wish the author would have given a bit more suggestions 
 The book is wonderful and a great tool for my course.  I received it without delays within a week of ordering.  
 This wonderful collection of stories is a favorite of mychildren. My children ask for this one again and again, but I enjoyhearing the masterfully told stories so much, I don't mind hearing it over and over myself 
 Francisco Goldman's (b.1955) second novel, "The Ordinary Seaman" has been described as a modern parable of America's hidden immigrant culture. Son of a Jewish American father and Catholic Guatemalan mother, Goldman populates his fiction with characters who serve as projections of a self that is culturally divided. "TOS" is essentially a story about liminality: that space, like the sea itself, where one's perceptions or situation blends with, or crosses over into, perceptions or situations of others.      The novel centers upon Esteban, a nineteen-year-old Nicaraguan between adolescence and manhood, communism and capitalism, first and second love. An ex-Sandinista guerrilla, he signs on as a sailor without seaman's papers and is transported, with a makeshift crew of fourteen other desperate Centroamericanos from varied backgrounds, to the urban jungle of a remote pier in a desolate Brooklyn shipyard. Abandoned, in political, legal, and personal limbo, they become virtual prisoners on a ship that never sails, the broken-down, rat-infested Urus. A cavernous freighter crippled by fire damage, stripped for parts, and lacking even the most basic provisions for human habitation, this vessel becomes a deathtrap.     A "greenhorn" undergoing a rite of passage, Esteban had been encouraged by a surrogate father-figure to jump ship in a foreign to escape a magalomanic captain with no regard for his ship or crew, beyond their usefulness. Goldman uses the uniquely privileged position of the sea captain to illustrate the corrosive effects of unbridled egoism, not merely skewing the moral compass but jeopardizing life itself. 
 A great book for the imagination.  It inspired us to go outside and see what shapes our "Little Clouds" were becoming 
 I love Nora Roberts' books.  I've read most of them and have never been disappointed.  Homeport is the story of Miranda Jones and Ryan Boldari.  Miranda works in the family art business.  She is a renowned specialist in being able to take art pieces and determining how old they are.  Ryan is a thief, a very good one, that comes in to Miranda's life when he steals a piece from her Institute only to find out it's a fake.  Miranda's reputation has already taken a hit because a piece of art she confirmed to be real was also discovered to be fake.  As the two work together, they realize that there are too many coincidences between the two pieces being fake to be ignored.  People close to Miranda are murdered and they both start to realize that they are falling for each other.  The dialogue is great, the story moves at the right pace.  Miranda more than holds her own with Ryan. Ryan is slowly able to break through the barriers Miranda has set up.  The ending wasn't what I expected which was a good thing for me.  I don't like figuring things out too early in a book, it doesn't make the story as interesting.  I highly recommend it 
 I just watched this movie and absolutely loved it.  I know in some ways it's a bit corny and the story has been done so many times but this film rises above the rest with a great cast and a real genuine atmosphere that captures perfectly the mood and feel of a football game.     Kuno Becker was very convincing as Santiago Munez a Mexican who starts life playing for a small local side in LA before being discovered by a former scout and setting off to England to play for Newcastle United. At first he finds the transition difficult and almost gives up but the last half hour in particular is very heart warming.  The movie over all is very engaging and a treat from start to finish.   Even if you don't like soccer I still recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good sports film.  This is part one of a trilogy and I can't wait for the second one to come out 
 This movie was made in 1963, if anyone tries and judge movies from 1963 by todays standards they typically think the movie is boring and slow moving. The movie is based on a true story, there is a book you can read if you want more detail. You probably have more great actors (James Garner, Charles Bronsan, McQueen, Attenborough, Coburn, etc) in this one movie than you have combined in all hollywood today.  Today is all special effects, blood and guts and the more brutality the better.  Imagine any movie today with no cursing, would not get past the screening room.  Listen to Richard Attenborough classify all the Germans as one enemy, does not differentiate between SS and Gestapo.  We are at war with ALL of them, not just the SS.  Teenagers drive todays movie market and there a few movies which can keep their attention if there are no special efects.  This movie is an adult movie, plain and simple. The motorcycle scene is awesome.  I think Steve McQueen did most of it.  Richard Attenborough is one tough guy in the movie, you do not have to be steroid pumped up to be tough, you can be tough with your mind.  The music score is great, scenery is great, actors great and it is an entertaining movie.  I really have tried to tell that I enjoyed this movie and it is a good movie. Remember this movie is made only 16 or so years after WWII 
 Being a woman not well versed in military terminology or familiar with WWII, I was unprepared for this magnificent, captivating and thought provoking novel.The descriptions of the submarines and the war strategies were as interesting as the characters.  I agree with another reviewer that the Holocaust descriptions were horrifying but nonetheless accurate. When I read the descriptions, I kept thinking about my Jewish friends and wondering how a man as deranged as Hitler could hypnotize so many people into performing those hideous acts. Mr. Wouk stated that he hoped to see the end of war, yet he clearly understood that war is not simply a necessary evil but necessary because of evil. The events of the Holocaust must never be forgotten.    Mr. Wouk created memorable characters, each flawed in their own way, yet engaging, very likeable and often heroic. The depth of research required to create this story staggers the mind, yet history and fiction meld into a wonderful story that will stay with you long after you close this book. This is a great story told by a great writer 
 I picked this booked expecting a bad book or that this book is not for me, but when I kept reading this book it really described me in way.  "The Pigman" is about to normal teenagers John and Lorraine who find friends with this old guy who is fat and bold. He lost his wife earlier; he has all these things that remind him of her. Like her dresses and a lot of glass. Mr. Pignati starts liking these kids because he never gets visitors. John and Lorraine try not to take advantage of him but he is so generous.  I thought that "The Pigman" was a good book it was like what high school kids do. It wasn't as interesting as I would of though when I read the first page, but it was still interesting enough to keep me going. I don't recommended this book to people who are young but it is a good book for people who mature.    
 There was- one dog and one girl.  They had a picnic.  They would take martha Jane to the dentist and take her to the book shop.The owner helped Martha Jane when she needed help to finf the books.  Martha Jane loved her owner.  The owner really loved her job and really loved her dog more.  I would recommend this book to any young boys and girls because it was a very happy story 
 I am an assistant (and sometimes still an apprentice) editor. When my Academy Award winning editor/boss told me to get this book, I didn't believe him. I knew how to run the Avid in my sleep and was getting jobs. But he was using it and recommending it to everyone he knew and then it was reviewed in this month's (July/August) Editors Guild magazine by a guy I trust. So I ordered it. Now ­I am recommending it. It covers everything you want to know about editing but were afraid to ask. It talks about the process and why editor's cut, not just how to digitize (it covers that generally) and how to get a job (I agree.) It has lots of useful charts and tables of all the stuff that you forget to remember such as formats, aspect ratios, film-to-tape conversion and vice versa. The author has clearly been in the editing trenches. I like her humorous tidbits and historical references like how R2D2 got his name. She also covers film - syncing, cutlists, neg cutting, etc. thoroughly which freaks the computer generation like me sometimes just as much as digital stuff can freaks older editors and directors. The film information as well as the digital, Web, DVD, and tape processes she so thoroughly details, have been invaluable to me in my work, paid and non. Speaking of which, gotta get back to my web film!     
 This music is from an era where music was changing from one maximum to another.  This is very good to hear at least once 
 What a great story of a city (Atlantic City) and a man (Skinny D'Amato) who was larger than life. I enjoyed the rise and fall and re-rise of AC.  I was swept up with the history of Victorian Era resort and wish that the old hotels were still there today. I'm a sucker for old, historic buildings. To read about the decline of AC and the revitilisation with the casinos in the late 1970s/early 1980s was also interesting reading.  At the center of it all was Skinny - friend to the stars, on the fringe of the mob; an interesting character to say the least. This is a "two thumbs up" book - recommend to anyone interested in nearly a century of American history 
 After watching "Ten Benny", I would have to say that Adrien Brody is not another Al Pacino.  He is in a league of his own.  The fact that this young actor is able to demonstrate every emotion just by the  movement of his eyebrows is awe-inspiring.  He played the role of Ray with  vigor and truthfulness, and that is why it was so enjoyable to watch.  Even  when Ray was violent or doing things that were distastefu, you ended up  feeling sympathy simply because of Brody's performance.  I would recommend  this movie to anyone who enjoys watching Al Pacino or Robert DeNiro.  But  to not confuse Adrien Brody's stellar performance as a mere carbon-copy of  those fine actors. He deserves his own credit 
 All I can say is that this show is delightful, funny and surprisingly interesting.  Not being a KISS fan and knowing little about Gene Simmons apparently didn't affect my enjoyment of this show.  It shows you what good and responsible parenting does for kids.  In a way, it's not fair to compare these kids to the Osbornes who as much as they love each other, live in chaos with a father who cannot (due to his own drug addition), set a good example for his kids.  Do you think Gene Simmons would allow one of his children to drop out of high school?  Not in this family 
  This novel is bitterly funny as well as subtly tragic.  Pnin is a Russian expatriate during the mid 20th century who teaches language in an American college.  His so-called friends and colleagues see him as a risible crackpot.  Although he is sort of a random tornado of words and thoughts, Pnin is also deeply passionate and intellectual.  The most striking aspect of this novel was, in my opinion, Pnin's disconnect from humanity.  I broke the threshold of tears in the last few pages where Pnin, bitterly leaving his pitiful life and associates behind, is seen driving off, suitcases packed in his car with a little white dog panting out the window (this is the first time the dog appears).  This is also a story on the experience of Russian expatriates during the Cold War era (since WHEN is the Russian language "obsolete"?).  It is also, like Lolita, a thesis on the contrast between American and European intellect.  Great read.  MOVING and sometimes outright silly.  If Nabokov were alive, I would hug him for being such a brilliant writer. 
 A great book for starting out. Covers all aspects of growing blueberries. Just enough detail 
 Europe's Last Summer offers a revealing look at the myriad causes of World War I, particularly for those of us whose high school history textbooks taught that it was brought about simply by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Not only does Fromkin lay out the case that the murder was merely a convenient pretext for a war that Austria-Hungary was already planning, but also that this otherwise local conflict was then twisted by Germany to become the catalyst for a European war that she believed to be both inevitable and necessary.  While the table of contents officially lists eight parts, I think the book is more neatly divided into two. In the first section Fromkin presents a broad overview of European history in the years leading up to the war. The background information helps explain why Austria-Hungary and Germany desired war and how the various European alliances were formed. In the second section Fromkin analyzes the so-called "July crisis", the thirty-seven day period between the assassination and the outbreak of war. While this conflict may have been inevitable, a remarkable series of events had to occur for it to begin in 1914. Fromkin does an excellent job of explaining how, seemingly against all odds, it happened.  As other reviewers have noted, the book can feel redundant at times. And for those already well-versed in World War I history, Europe's Last Summer is unlikely to offer any groundbreaking new information. However, as someone generally interested in history I found the book perfectly readable and highly informative 
 Nancy Garden's ANNIE ON MY MIND, originally published in 1982, was recently re-released. (It includes an interview with the author herself.)  The book represents an early example of realistic young adult fiction depicting a lesbian relationship between two high school seniors. It is still a fitting portrayal for today's teens.  Liza and Annie meet in a New York museum and develop a fast friendship. Both seem to realize there is something different about their relationship, but admitting that at the start is difficult for both. The story is told as Annie remembers it, and focuses mostly on her struggle to accept the facts she is learning about herself.  The book's first half takes the reader into the growing friendship between the girls. There is considerable time spent describing how they discover their common interests and the activities they find to spend time together. The girls come from different backgrounds - Liza attends a relatively sheltered, private school currently struggling with financial difficulties, while Annie attends public school and is faced with drugs, violence, and other social problems public schools must deal with both then and now.  As the girls' relationship develops, the plot becomes more involved in Liza's role as student council president and her school's struggle with a fund-raising campaign. Liza and Annie begin to accept the true direction of their friendship, and of course, as other people become aware, controversy surfaces. Will the admission of their gay lifestyle cause acceptance or abandonment by family and friends? Could their situation adversely affect a similar relationship between two teachers in Liza's private school?  ANNIE ON MY MIND delves into the acceptance of homosexuality. It seems there will always be two sides to this controversy, but the re-release of the book may ask readers to decide if things are changing as time passes. What really matters in love - what is "right" for those involved or what is perceived as "right" by those whose views may differ?  Reviewed by:  Sally Kruger, aka "Readingjunky" 
 I sincerely think Soul of a Citizen is one of the best books ever written.  I have given it as a gift and know others who have thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's filled with wonderful insights and great examples of ordinary people doing extraordinary things.  It inspires all of us to believe that we can be the change we seek in a world in great need of healing.  It is uplifting in a very depressed time.  It is hope-filled in a time of despair.  It is a light in the dark.  In short, it is a must read. 
 I just love these guys, and this albums is by far THE BEST of their three previous albums. I love listening to soft songs that also carry rich harmonies, and this album has it all! "Time to Come Home" is a  masterpiece, besides ofcourse "Smile like Mona Lisa", and the  very decorative acappella "Fear no more". If you like and have  albums by other groups like BSB, 98 Degrees, Boyzone, Boyz II men your  collection will never be complete without this one!! A must have for  R&B Lovers! 
 All I can say is WOW!  I watched the movie "The Secret" 48 Hours ago, and now have found Esther and Jerry Hicks in that same time period.  If you are earnestly seeking a better Life, you will find it.  "Birds of a Feather Flock Together"  I am just blown away with my Transformation in the past 2 days.  I went to Barnes and Nobles last night about this time.  We couldn't find any of Esther and Jerry's Books.  I just began walking around, believing some how, some way this book would find me.  Well the Employee at Barnes and Nobles tracked me down, and guided me to another section.  We still couldn't find any of their books.  The Employee walked away and I thought I would never see him again.  Well, as I started to walk away the third time, he came walking towards me with asserment, and handed me the Book "The Law of Attraction"  Never in my Life at Barnes and Nobles had I met a Employee who was so PERSISTENT on finding me a Book.  Then I began asking??  Was this myself, the employee at Barnes and Nobles, or the Principles of the Law of Attraction?  They say when the Student is ready, the Teacher will come.  Well it's 10:35 P.M. almost 24 Hours later and I have read all 194 pages of this Book.  I truly have found what I am looking for in this amazing Book.  In life there are Laws, Laws of Gravity, Laws of our Government, Laws of Prosperity, Wealth, Health,etc.  If you want to play the Game of Life, you must know the Universal Laws.  It starts with getting a foundation within the Laws of Attraction.  When you think your life sucks, your work is awful, your relationships are just horrible, guess what you will attract?? Those exact things.  Your life is a magnet, what you think about you will attract, it's a Law.  When you think about Health,Wealth,Prosperity, Great Relationships, you will attract those things.  Your Life's make up is within you, you dictate how it will be played, not your surroundings.  Get your mind right and start today. Read this amazing Book!.  I had no idea who the Hick's where 48 Hours ago, but by reading this Book my life has been transformed overnight.  I will never be the same person again, and the same goes for you.  Think outside the Box, and if you earnestly want change, start by buying this book today! 
 There isn't much I want to say in the respect of giving away what the book is about, but I am very impressed with this work. The mere concept of machines becoming aware of their own state of being, though this isn't a new idea, is written very well. Anyone that would read this book will find themselves not being able to put it down. Definately worth the time to purchase and read 
 This book was reoommended by a friend who read it when her husband was dying.  He had read it also and found it very helpful to understand the process he was going through and he highly recommended it and THAT SAYS SOMETHING!   When my Mom was passing I read it and although I was scared to read it, it actually was nothing to fear....it was comforting and enlightening and made the process much easier for me as the caretaker and daughter.  I recognized and understood the things she was saying much better and knew how to respond in some unusual circumstances.  I recommend this book to ANYONE dealing with the process of dying.  I bought extra copies to give to others who are losing someone close to them 
 DO any of these authors live in California?  Is all this going on in some McDonalds heavy midwestern back water? B/C this is NOT my reality!  Regardless of the hour, I cannot turn on the news w/out hearing alarmist "statistics" about how unforgivably fat Americans are!  This is all ofcourse intercut w/ads for designer drugs to "control" fat through the wonder of outputting fatty oily stools. (OF course I find the almost ethereally uplifting and lengthy ads about why putting your 4 yr. old on ritalin much more disturbing, causing me to wish there was some way I could transport my wickedly fat @$$ back to what used to be planet earth.  I hope this anorexic thinking author atleast reserves a fraction of his/her consternation for the diet industry-which it has been proven (by actually telling peole what these authors recommend "eat less-move more," cut fat out completely with fake foods-fill up on those politically correct eath sustaining carbs.  Because when it really comes down to it who cares about your health-we only care about how you look!) has in the long run made people morbidly obese diabetics uncontrollably obsessed with food.  Sort of like the same way making certain drugs illegal fuels crime.  But hey the solution really is encouraging (Yes actually encouraging!) insurance companies to discriminate against people on the basis of weight and publicly humiliate and abuse their children at school. (I guess that isn't happening enough already!)  It's only a matter of time before smoking, bulimia and anorexia are brought back and lauded for their appetite supressing affects.  Call me crazy, but I find the pressure of a soda much less irresistable than the pressure to look like I just walked out of a prison labor camp 
 This book is good for those starting out for the first time ( like me!). It gives information on everything from door shutters to major appliances 
 Finally a main stream author is telling the story of the afterlife like it is rather than the one size fits all "tunnel of light" or "everyone ends up at the same buildings" and a "heaven" that exists exactly 3 feet above the earth where they travel in atomic powered hover craft... and other such nonsense.  Thought creates reality in physical life and afterlife.  The other two books that tell it like it is are also "challenging" to some... to use Deepak's own words.  They are "Seth Speaks" trance channeled by Jane Roberts and "Parting Notes: A Connection with the Afterlife" written by individuals who have actually died physically and continued to tell about it on a very individual basis via internationally known Open Deep Trance Channel April Crawford.  Thank you Deepak for telling it like it is, even though many who believe what they were told in Sunday school may not get it and may probably complain about it.  After all, the idea the thought creates reality is well beyond some who profess an interest in this area.  Yet even exposing them to this idea will help them along their evolutionary way.  And.... for those who do get it... it is a fantastic map to how to improve everything via raising their conscious awareness up a notch or more.  -Allen Editor of the trance channeled newsletter "Inner Whispers" and writer of the introduction to "Parting Notes: A Connection with the Afterlife".

 This is a good ficton book. That's what I think. It has a good cover It was a good story, and it is especially funny when Flea popped out of Gray's head. Then they had to teach her how to fly. It didn't seem so exiting that Bullsnake was not moving. But it got exciting when he moved. This book has great excitement in it! I hope you have this GREAT Book like me!                 
 This book details the lives of Grace Kelly and Rainier Grimaldi otherwise known as Princess Grace and Prince Rainier of Monaco both before and after their "marriage of the century."  Grace Kelly was born in Pittsburgh, PA. In 1929 to Jack and Margret Kelly. She had an older sister Margaret (Peggy) and older brother Jack Jr (Kell) as well as a younger sister Elizabeth Anne (Lizanne). From the time that she was young she wanted to be an actress. When she was a teenager she modeled to pay for an acting school and thanks to her uncle George got some early work on the stage. Soon after she started making movies such as High Noon (with Gary Cooper), Mogambo (with Clark Gable) and won an Oscar for her portrayal in The Country Girl. It was because of this that she was offered the opportunity to go to Cannes to the Cannes Film Festival. During her time in France she also was offered the opportunity to go to Monaco to visit Prince Rainier little realizing that the visit would change her life.  Prince Rainier was born in 1923. His mother was the illegitimate daughter of the Prince of Monaco and married a French Duke in 1920. Rainier had a younger sister named Antoinette. When Rainier was six his parents divorced and he and Antoinette were mostly raised by their grandfather. Rainier was educated in England and France and in 1949 became heir to his grandfather's throne after his mother and sister renounced it. He became Prince of Monaco in 1950. During this time he was single, but dating an actress. Shortly before Grace Kelly's visit he and the actress broke up.  Several months after the meeting between Grace and Rainier he came to the United States. Grace and Rainier used this time to better know each other and shortly after Christmas they became engaged. After several months of negotiations they where married in Monaco.  Nine months later they had their first child, Caroline, and five months after that Grace was pregnant with Prince Albert. They later added to the family with princess Stephanie.  The marriage between Princess Grace and Prince Rainier was not always the best, but ultimalty they loved each other and their three children. When Grace was killed in 1981 after a car crash Rainier mourned her for the rest of his life. 
 This is a great book for parents, pastors, worship leaders, as well as lay persons.  She explains worship, educates on why the church does what it does how it does, and challenges churches of all denominations and leanings (traditional to contemporary) to re-examine the way they approach youth involvement in church 
 This is a great sequel to "Beyond the Gathering Storm."  I notice that another reviewer complained that Christine couldn't possibly decide she was in love with Eric at the end of the book just by reading the Bible.  Why not?  Plenty of real-life people have made decisions that way!  There have also been cases of people in love with someone for years before they knew it, I'm glad the story wasn't like that.  Perhaps the reviewer has never had such an experience, but that doesn't mean they know everything!  It's great to have stories where people read the Bible and act on what they've learned, and Janette Oke is one of my favorite Christian writers!  My only complaint is that sometimes it took too long to get through a part of the story that seemed unimportant to me 
 Excellent book - a must have!  Writer is knowledgeable of real live classroom situations.  A plus is the book does not need to be read cover to cover, but you will want to after you start.  Excellent resource for middle and high school teachers.

 Kevin gives us a nice twist with Black Maria.The title is a slang for a police wagon or hearse. This collection is a  blues based detective novel written in poems and is actually a screenplay.It takes a very talented writer to pull that off and Kevin has done it well. I read this novel/collection/play straight through. The story is captivating. What do you get when a sexy singer crosses paths with a drunken detective?

 This book has all the answers to the questions that Catholics have had pass through their minds about the life of Christ and the Holy family during the 33 years that Jesus lived here on earth.Miracles that preceded  Cana are explained. It also has God the father's views of why he formed man  and the universe. The Father explains to the author what happened in the  sequences from the creation of the heavens and angelic beings, to the  creation of the earth and man in God's image. His ideas of what he wanted  to do to redeem man and the creation of the physical beings of Mary and  Jesus to do this. It explains the workings of the demon angels and what  their part was in the life of Christ. It is a facinating account of our  world from the Father's viewpoint. I have read the one volume abridgement  but it does not have all the interesting information that the four volume  set has . I recommend reading the four volumes 
 Like him or not you got him. Paul Newman is HUD. He sees things through a world made moral to his own liking. In the modern Western Paul Newman is the anti-hero who we sort of admire yet ignores his motivations at the same time. HUD shows his dead brother's son played by Brandon De Wilde the ropes of life. In today's world of avarice and deceit I just wonder what moral ground HUD would stand on and be perceived. Brandon De Wilde gives a wonderful performance ranging from a naïve idol worshiping nephew to that of a seasoned student to the lessons he learned. The choice of his future path is perhaps uncertain but yet perhaps not. 
 Most books on golf instruction are all about one teacher's view of what is good and proper with his version of the ideal swing, etc.. The only time we get a guest appearance by one of the greats in the game, or another instructor, is when they happen to say something along a similar line and they make a name-dropping cameo.  With The Nicklaus Way and others in Andrisani's series, we get a look at a specific golfer, Jack Nicklaus, and what he does best. It is given in full, whether we want to agree with it or not.  For example, most would agree that a slow takeaway is a good idea for a well timed swing. We also all have our bread-and-butter shots that we are more likely to hit than anything else, simply because that is our style, and we should play with this in mind. Nicklaus did and does all these.  However, not all would buy into the idea that learning power should take presidence over precision. This is meant to be advice for absolute beginners, but it still probably has most of us questioning Jack's early teacher Jack Grout's sanity. Another is the fact that Nicklaus not only lifts his heel well off the ground during the backswing (most teachers put a limit of one inch), but shifts his foot's position while replanting it. This probably gives some top 100 instructors short breath.  The why, when, and how of the Nicklaus game is here, in all its glory. The book is short and an easy initial read, but going back to some of the points gives a person pleanty to think about and to experiment with.  Most reassuring, though, is that this is the technique of a golfer, and we know it from the start. It isn't one-size-fits-all instruction. I can only hope that we will be seeing more of the same in the future 
 The characters in this story are full of contradictions, especially the priest, but his great virtue is that he knows this. As his character is humbled and stripped down, step by step deconstructed, and as he is less able to hide himself from himself, flashes of brilliant humanity begin to emerge in descriptive conversation that is a gift to experience.  What IF you love the sin, or the product of it? Is it possible to repent of something you can't be truly sorry for? These are the sorts of questions that plague this character, and the sorts of questions it takes an author like Greene have us ask.   In Greene's work, there is a vein of holy struggle that one needn't be religious to understand. I love to read books by authors which mine this very personal territory. Chaim Potok is another.  I leant this book to a friend who took a little issue with the ending. He felt that it was anti-climactic, but I guess this is where people differ. The anti-climactic ending was satisfying to me. I don't require a large *bang* of an impact, and feel that it would have undermined the book to give it such. It would have made it feel like a fairy tale, which would have been out of step.    -Stephanie   
 The flavor was light but the tannin a bit stronger...I had to add a tad more cream

 Those are adjectives my son used when I asked him to describe these slippers.  I had bought my husband the men's version for Christmas, but he had not been able to wear them because my son wouldn't take them off.  I could not find any to fit my son, so I bought him a small size in the women's and he loves them.  He puts them on as soon as he comes home, sleeps in them, and only takes them off to put on his shoes for school in the morning.  We highly recommend these slippers!    
 This book is a winner in every way. Readers will learn why it is important to stand up for what is right, to band together to fight unjust and  unethical situations, and the power of the written word. Ana Rosa is a  really neat kid who cares deeply about her family and about social justice.  When the chips are down she takes action.  I am not from the Dominican  Republic (nor is the author, though her husband is and she lives there) and  I would be interested to read what a native person thinks of this book.  As  an American it made me angry to read first hand about the impact of our  tourist industry upon cultures that are so poor they can't afford paper to  write upon.  I was uplifted and inspired by the close family ties and  support of this family who were financially impoverished, but enriched  beyond belief in human values and compassion.  This is one of those books  where you can learn something about another culture while at the same time,  being entertained by a really good story.  I think Lynn Joseph was careful  with her words in crafting the story. Ana Rosa was even a bit rebellious  and "different," but her family stood behind her.  Great book.   Great boy characters and girl characters -- all kids who dream to be  activists would enjoy this story

 I was fearful that this book would have the same old money-saving tips, such as "invite fewer people" or "get married on a Wednesday."  But this book actually has good ideas and resources.  The authors guarantee that you will save $500 or more or your money back.  The book is in an easy-to-read and engaging format.  It is definitely no-nonsense and gives the pros and cons of most everything.  It also includes a multi-page bridal gown source guide via the Internet (accessible through a password located in the book) and rates gown makers and sellers, from David's Bridal to Kleinfeld's.  The web site also has message boards that are a good resource.  The book starts with an introduction to the multi-billion-dollar wedding industry and how the industry tries to use emotional hooks to get your money.  It provides brief checklists to ask vendors (I would recommend a separate wedding planner for more detailed checklists) but more importantly explains the major traps and pitfalls.  Sometimes the suggestions, such as getting everything in writing, are overkill (duh!)...but better safe than sorry for such an important occasion!  There are plenty of vignettes from actual brides who rant or rave about certain vendors and the like.  The authors give practical tips for dealing with sticky situations.  The largest portion of the book is devoted to gowns and has been invaluable to me.  It truly has given me many resources that I never would have known of without the book and is a lot more than "buy a sample dress."  In fact, it warns that these dresses may not be such a great deal.  Who knew that you can order a gown directly from China for $100-300, and that the dressmaker will even customize it?  The book also details the problems with such arrangements.  It is filled with names of online, brick and mortar, and other retailers, including discounters, outlets, and local stores.  It explains what to look for in a quality gown.  The book does the same for other major wedding expenses, such as tuxedos, florists, invitations, etc.  This book is not just for people on a budget.  It has ideas for people who just want an unusual or personal touch.  There are parts that are geared towards people on a strict budget, such as arranging your own flowers purchased over the Internet.  But some suggestions are downright pricey.  I would actually say that the book is more about getting good value and quality than finding a bargain that is inexpensive but cheap.  I would highly recommend this book to any bride-to-be, regardless of budget.  I do not think, however, that it substitues for an etiquette book or wedding planner.  By the way, I glanced at the 7th edition of this book, and the 8th version has been completely updated.  
 I walked into the Acropolis Bookstore at 7:30 pm, just after a cup of java and piece of apple pie.  The evening rain fell steadily.  Cars whizzed through the puddles on Washington Street outside.  I was wearing a red wool hat, blue parka and old, black sneakers.  When I saw that book on the shelf, I knew it had to be the one.  I bought it, got the hell out of there.  Sam's my man.  He don't mess around.  Dames, hoods, rogue cops---he knows how to handle'em.  Back home, I lay down on the green plush sofa with its musty smell of too many New England winters and turned the pages.  A great yarn.  Gotta hand it to Hammett.  I looked out the window.  A kid was standing out under the street light, his collar turned up.  I knew he was a plant, hadda get rid of the punk soon or all hell might break loose before I could write up my Amazon review.    THE MALTESE FALCON is a private eye classic---terse, colorful prose, non-stop action with very few philosophical asides, a cynical view of human nature, many twists to the plot which keeps you guessing right to the last page.  Hollywood did its usual best to screw it up---a lot of simplification in plot plus whitewashing of Spade's role in the movie, even though many scenes, many lines, are instantly recognizable.  Muy macho Sam Spade prevails over a bunch of treasure-hunting crooks who will stop at nothing to get their hands on a black-enamel falcon believed to be hiding a gold and jewel-encrusted treasure inside.  Four beautiful `dames', a fat crook and his kid accomplice, a `Levantine" dealer, tough cops, even the D.A.  This is an American classic with or without Bogie.  There's no predicting life, as the story-within-the-story of Flitcraft shows, so live for today, fear not, and watch out for Number One every time.  THE MALTESE FALCON reflects the world view of Americans in its day--seen also in cowboy films---of how the lone hero, if he is strong enough, can overcome all the obstacles thrown up by an unfair and uncaring society and by cruel Fate.  He needs nobody else, especially not women (though he uses them at every opportunity), and always rides off into the sunset alone.  While on the shelves of world literature, THE MALTESE FALCON may come across as a minor work, for a novel of this type, Hammett has created unforgettable characters in Spade, O'Shaughnessy, Gutman, Cairo, and more.  Read it or you'll get what's comin' to ya.   
 I gave this book to an friend of mine who lives in India and she just raves about it.  Tagore is a great poet and this is in my opinion his best colletion 
 Without a doubt, this has got to be one of the best, if not the best book on Arts and Crafts Tile I've seen, and I've got them all.  Although dealing with California tile makers only, there's enough material here to fill two books - and in fact, that's what they did!  I didn't realize that this is really Vol. I of II, the other covers the rest of the H's down to the Z's.  And that's my only gripe - $82 if one buys both, AND now I have to wait 4-5 weeks for the 2nd part.  But as a reference to companies and what they made, this book is outstanding. Can hardly wait - Note, the cost of this book has gone up from $41 to the present $59.59 - So, I'd suggest buying the second vol now, before that goes up also. Note II there are two DIFFERENT Books the first covers Tiles from A to half way through the H's, the Second volume covers the rest of the H's down to the Z's.  Even though they have different ISBN's Amazon seems to be getting them mixed up, calling the first the "Hardcover" the second book the "updated" book.  There are two books, get them both!  The 2nd book just as good as the first! 2006 update - these two books remain about the best for CALIFORNIA tiles, but The Encyclopedia of American  Art Tiles (by  Norman Karlson) Vols. 3 and 4 are just as good. However Norman's books (as great as they are) are a bit  pricey - You  just want California tiles?  Then stick with the California Tile books (one and two)  But want to have the best reference for  ALL the U.S.?  Then go with Karlson, but you will easily spend $200-$240 to get all four vols.  If you go with Karlson, then you don't need this California book 
 This is a fascinating book on the migration of people from the Midwestern Dustbowl during the Great Depression and what happened to them once they got to California. It is extremely well written. It makes reading the newspaper in California much more interesting because many of these people have gone on to shape current event 
 Dear Else Minarik,  I was so excited about owning this book. It is the first book I ever read. (36 years ago) I saw something different everytime I read it. It warmed my heart to see it again. I didn't take very long to recieve it. Thank you for opening up a whole new world, reading. gwe 
 Um otimo livro. Atende as expectativas teoricas e de implementacao. Os exemplos encontram-se um linguagem C. A biblioteca de algoritmos idealizada preve a utilizacao do compilador C GNU. Mas, com poucas modificacoes  pode-se utilizar estes algoritmos para outros compiladores. Recomendo este  livro para estudantes de graduacao como acompanhamento de disciplinas de  processamento de imagens, os quais, como eu, geralmente anseiam por ver  realizadas as explanacoes teoricas 
 America is more than familiar with the stereotypical blonde bombshells that grace the covers of magazines, television programs, movies, and advertisements.  In Carolyn Kitch's book she is able to outline the origins of how stereotypical images came about.  Her extensive background in the media along with the use of actual magazine illustrations allows her to present her arguments in a way that anyone with an interest in women's history in the media can understand.   Kitch's book maintains the reader's interest by citing specific examples, providing information about the time period, and providing illustrations. Keeping a loosely chronological form allows the book to flow, but the ideas of the time period are more important to Kitch than keeping a pattern.  She breaks at appropriate points to discuss alternate visions that challenged and reinforced stereotypes in the media.   While Kitch's book is effective, it is not extensive.  Its sheer size just doesn't allow Kitch to get as in depth as she could.  She promises so much in the introduction, but isn't able to deliver all that she promises.    The books briefness keeps it from being extensive, but it is still able to provide me with a more organized knowledge of how stereotypes of women in the media such as the ever-popular blonde bombshell came about 
 And even then, you have a very good chance of appreciating the amount of insight that Dr. Oliver Sacks has into the minds and lives of his patients, and into life and the human condition in general. Sacks, both the author and the narrator in this book, has chosen some of his favorite, poignant, and exemplary cases from the many patients he has worked with in his home for those with neurological disorders (or, more romantically, a home for those who see the world in a completely different way.). Not only does he describe the disease and condition of the patient, he describes the life, the person, behind the disease. In some cases, he also updates the information he has with the specific patient, i.e., what the patient has gone on to do, or not to do, with their life.  Since this book is a reprint of the original version, a postscript after some of the stories describe similar patients, revelations that he has had, and the medical advances that have been made since the original writing. These also include incredible insight, as well as a sense of hindsight and fondness on the part of Sacks.   As both the writer and the narrator, Sacks exhibits both his impressive clinical knowledge and his personal feelings on each case: it is obvious in reading this book that he cared about and was interested in the well being (or, if well being was impossible, simply the being) of his patients. His writing makes each of these stories, for the most part, assessable to anyone, regardless of their previous knowledge on the subjects of psychology and neurology or attention span: these short stories are comprehendible and, for the most part, concise, and are written in such a way that the reader gets drawn into the story of the patient and feel, at least partially, invested in their health as well, and make you want to keep on reading to find out how, if at all, they were cured or treated.  Whether the story is comic or tragic, whether you want to do a little more general research on neurological disorders, or if you just want to feel lucky that your body and mind work to the capacity that they do, Dr. Sacks' book The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat will keep you both informed and entertained. You don't have to be crazy to read this book, but if you are, I'm sure Dr. Sacks would understand. 
 Simon Winchester is a popular historian, in the modern mold. This means that he's socially and politically a liberal, and that he's interested in *everything* connected with a specific event. He'll examine it from all angles, and attempt to see it from everyone's eyes, look over everything connected with it, and then draw some conclusions. Usually, those conclusions over-reach some (I'm being general about this type of writer, not of Winchester specifically) and the point of view is relentlessly modern.  Winchester has chosen as the topic of this book the explosion of the volcano Krakatoa in 1883. Interestingly, the author is trained as a geologist, though he has spent most of his life working as a journalist and writer. This means that he actually understands the terminology of geology and vulcanology enough that he can at least make an attempt to explain it to the rest of us in layman's terms, and the result is generally a happy one. Krakatoa was a complex event (the island had three summits, each a separate volcano: two disappeared in the explosion, but they erupted for a good while beforehand, and their effects lasted for years afterwards) and Winchester does a good job of relating what happened, the prelude to it, and the aftermath.  The one criticism that people have which I agree with is that he tends to wander a bit, at times. There are discussions here of everything from Dutch Colonial policy to the habits of spiders to rather technical (though carefully explained) geology. While it's all interesting, sometimes it does stray a bit far from the chosen topic. The author also occasionally over-reaches, a bit. For instance, his assertion that the explosion of the volcano indirectly led to Indonesia's independance is a bit much. My edition included a magazine article he'd written just after the Boxing Day tsunami, in which he attempts to connect the San Francisco earthquake with George W. Bush's election as U.S. President...that seems and even bigger stretch, to be honest.  When the author sticks to the story, however, what he writes is very interesting. I would recommend this book 
 Of all the tour books I hauled with me to the great city of New Orleans,  this was the best.  Detailed mapping of the city especially the French  Quarter.  It tells you the truth of where to go and not to go and where you  can get a decent cheap meal but it also tells you where to go when you want  to wine and dine.  It tells you fascinating details of the city and the  best haunts of the city and places that you are best missing but it tells  you why in great detail.  And it tells you of it's famous residents from  Anne Rice to Tennessee Williams.  I couldn't survive without this book!  It  is a must have for anybody going to New Orleans 
 I found this book to be a great resource for a first time mom.  Not only does it give a general idea of the things your baby may be doing at different times it also gives suggestions of fun games to play every week.  Since I never spent a lot of time around very young babies this really helped me to figure out which games were best to play at which stages and gave me some great ideas when I was running out of new ways to entertain my son.  It also had some special notes that highlight where premature babies may fall developmentally at different times.  I know this book may rub some breastfeeding mothers the wrong way but I was not bothered by it.  As the breastfeeding mother of a 5 month old I felt that it highlights the importance of breastfeeding but also supports the decisions of formula feeding moms or moms who find it necessary to wean to formula.  There is even a section with tips on weaning from the breast to formula at 6 months which I found refreshing and guilt-free in comparison to other books.  Some of the advice is not the best but as with any parenting book use your own judgment before using any book as your bible 
 The kittle looks good and I tried, it was not very fast but was accepted. 
 For those of you looking for that one "generic" system, look no further. Big Eyes Small Mouth is the game for you. Based on Guardians of the Order Tri-Stat system, BESM has all the rules necessary to create any kind of character you can think of and play in any world your imagination can create. The rules are simple yet complete, and you can concentrate on the details of the game without being bogged down by tedious rules. All dice rolls are based on 6 sided die. (The normal kind) so you don't need any polyhedral (funny looking) dice. Even though the game is suppose to be an "anime" based game, you can use it for any type of genre. The book is also very colorful and filled with great art. The pages are glossy and feels like those expensive manga books. Pick this book up and you won't regret it 
 Judd Nelson has made some good movies and some not so good. I count this as one of his best. As an attorney "Stormy Weathers" he can't be beat. He will stretch the limits of courtroon etiquette well past the limit if it will win his case. This is by far one of the best melodramas I have seen. Not often do we see a movie full of comedy and drama at the same time.   The beginning is very light stuff, but midway into the movie we start to see the darkside of humanity. John Hurt turns in a magnificent performance as Judd's client in a murder case. Judd can't decide if his client is innocent or guilty, but once he knows for sure he has to learn new tactics in dealing with the judicial system.  Fans of courtroom movies should enjoy this even if they are not fans of the 80s bratpack. Great directing and excellent cast make this a winner. A nice soundtrack and scenes in Boston don't hurt either. Good quality DVD but no extras 
 Mark Joyner has created another idea packed volume dedicated to your success.   He has a clear, enjoyable, writing style. He is the ultimate teacher who showers you with countless examples and ideas to stimulate your marketing.  This time around he has enlisited some of his  friends to share their knowledge of The Great Formula. This section of the book was a surprise bonus, with many marketing insights.  Keep this volume on your reference shelf and refer to it often. If you are a marketer of any kind, you need to get this book 
 This book is a wonderfully engrossing read - almost as good a ride as any  at Disneyland. It takes you through detailed accounts of the inner workings  of Hollywood and most especially the inner workings of one self-centered  meglomaniac with a startling lack of conscience (for someone in charge of a  studio touting its appeal to children) who rules the Disney roost and will  undoubtedly be its unmaking if he is left to rule as he does now...

 Yakov Bok is a humble Jewish fixer (carpenter) living in Russia in 1910. He leaves his small village and moves to Kiev, looking for work and a better life. His wife has left him for another man and he has no significant relations to speak of. It's a dangerous time to be Jewish, as the pogroms are widespread and practically government sanctioned. Pretending to be a gentile, Bok finds work with an anti-semite at a brickyard and moves into an area that is off limits for Jews. Things go well for a while, until a young Christian boy is killed and Bok finds himself framed for the murder.   Although there is no evidence against him, other than hysterical, unreliable anti-semite "witnesses", things look bad for Bok and he is thrown in prison to await a formal indictment.   The majority of the book covers Bok's time in prison and solitary confinement. It becomes clear the prosecution is dragging its feet, not delivering the indictiment, as they have a shaky chance of winning the case if it ever goes to trial.   It's a fast book, but a very painful and somewhat depressing one. It deals heavily with anti-Semitism. Some of the anti-semitic passages are almost breathtaking in their ferocity. It becomes very painful, at times almost (but not quite) tragi-comic. In particular, a lengthy sermon (?) given by a priest that basically likens the Jewish to vampires.   In many ways the book reminded me of "1984". A man up against the monolithic powers of the state. Not quite as imposing though, because Bok seems to grow stronger and more resiliant in his spirit even as his body and mind are broken. The prosecution repeatedly dangles a confession in his face but Bok refuses steadfastly to sign, even at the risk of triggering a pogrom. It's interesting to note that Bok is also an avowed aetheist, and stolidly refuses to seek solace in God. He reads the bible only as a way of keeping himself from going insane, and the only thing that really seems to comfort him is philosophy (Spinoza, in particular) and the philosophical concept of freedom.   Part of what is so painful is that for long stretches the entire world seems to be against him. EVERYONE he encounters is either a thug, a snitch, a backstabber (or all three!).  An excellent book. A fast read, but very painful.   
 This is a great book, which I would classify as a historical novel.  I read it before I went out to Gettysburg (along with all the two others in the series, which are just as fabulous).  I love the Civil War and work in archives cataloging many actual Civil War letter and artifacts.  However, to someone who was not too interested in the war, history or is younger this might not be a good book for them.  Nor is this book a supplement to actual research and factual histories. In the book, expect many reports about troop movements (war is 99% boredom, 1% sheer terror).  Expect lots of inner monologues, speeches, and flowery language because that is how it was in the Victorian era (it is the truth I have read enough letters to prove it).  I can say this book is one of the best historical fiction books I have read but it is not for everyone.  As for the movies based on this series, Gettysburg and Gods and Generals, they have to be the most boring movies I have ever seen, just awful.  Read the book over watching the movie 
  This film was atmospherically stunning! The special effects were near perfect, and I havn't been more disturbed by a film in years.   The actors were wonderful, the dubbing worked quite well, and in certain parts it even look like they've used slide film.  I am by far one of the biggest horror/ gore junkies I know, and I have to say this is the best film i've seen yet, from unearth films.  The director did an amazing job, and I can't understand why the last person would give such a bad review other than ignorance and perhaps feeling uncomfortable during the homosexual parts 
 Absolutely the best book I've found to explain electricity, in the most simplictic form.  I'm a person who learns through visual diagrams and this book is chaulked full of easy to understand drawings.  Each chapter ends with a review section to reiterate what you've learned and a self-test that follows.  Excellent book 
 I bought this for my boyfriend as he is an avid fan of playing Golden Tee for countless hours at the bar. The actual joystick and game are very similar to the bar version, although the graphics are somewhat reminiscent of Nintendo circa 1990. Regardless, a fun, well priced way to simulate the game in your own home 
 The Oregon Trail still stands as a classic of American literature and of a rapidly vanishing past.  Written as an account of a summer he spent traveling the Oregon Trail, Parkman captures the details of communal Native American life with no sentimentality, just hard reality.  Even though written in 1846, Parkman is amazingly precise in his estimation of the vanishing frontier and Native American way of life.  At times, he is rather callous toward the Native Americans, but this also reflects his times and environment.  Highly recommended.  
 False Memory was the first Dean Koontz book that I read, and I was enthralled from page one. Koontz's descriptions pull you into the story and his suspense is chilling. He has a way of revealing information bit by bit, stringing the readers along until we're snared in his web, desperate for the resolution he does so well.   This book is a fabulous example of Koontz's talent; buy it 
 Ken while I agree with almost everything you say, I have to inform you of an error. The outstanding soul tune "Tell Mama" IS NOT the "Memphis Sound." It is in fact part of the immortal legacy of Rick Hall's FAME Studios in the Southern Soul Mecca of MUSCLE SHOALS, ALABAMA. Trust me check out the orginal liner notes. Or just check out the FAME Studios Website 
 This is one of the greatest recordings in history!! These songs came out in the 1980's, when disco had died, along with our sex lives. These songs are total F.U.N., they're so wonderfully devoid of any real meaning. Dale Bozzio was the only girl Pop singer besides Debbie Harry who could instill such a campily knowing wink unto each song. And that squeak!, the first time we'd heard it, it sent us ALL running to our telephones.  She inserts that little trademark falsetto squeal in just the right places, without over-doing it. "Words", which is included here, was the song that introduced them to the public. I'll never forget seeing her sing it on "The Merv Griffin Show", all wrapped in silver & plastic, it was a defining moment in my life! These songs were among the first "techno-pop", with tons of wavering synthesizer, and they remain timeless. "Destination Unknown", "Windows", all so great. And, "Walking In L.A". Has there EVER been a musical homage that so perfectly captures the scathing indifference of that wonderful town, where everything is so beautifully, unapologetically fake? It gets me so excited everytime I hear it, it makes me want to jump off the Hollywood Sign! Miss Bozzio spews out her venomous paean to Tinsletown as  only someone who loves it could truly understand, knowing that we'd all trade our 40 years at the factory for a few snippets of celluloid immortality, as would any sane person. She leaves the devestated victims in her wake as she blurts out the last notes of her pitiless spite! Most Pop music today is so cornily self-conscious. If you want to hear a perfect example of what the 80's were about, with songs that will make you want to bounce up & down,  you MUST get this recording! Pop it in, blast the volume, lock yourself in the bathroom,  & make funny faces in the mirror while you spike your hair. You'll feel great 
 This really is a great book.  I am no longer a "young adult," but I enjoyed it 
 This is a great book by Dan Corner.  One of the things I had to do is to read the Word myself, without any preconceived ideas of what to expect.  I can to the conclusion that my theology was definitely wrong and this book articulated many of the things I discovered with my much more depth than I had discovered.  Prayerfully read this book without any preconceived opinions and let the Bible speak clearly for itself, which is always does if we have an open heart 
 If you're looking for an inside look into China, this is your book!  It's not often that one thinks of a non-fiction book as a "page turner," yet I found myself speeding through the book, disappointed when I came to the last page.  Cheering for the many underdogs depicted, Mr. Johnson's light and lively writing style helps to paint a clear picture of the social inequities found in modern day China.  I particularly enjoyed the second story about the demolition of the old hutongs to make way for new construction.  Johnson's prose paints a vivid picture of the beauty that is now forever lost and the fight the long-time residents have sadly lost.  I've travelled to China twice and never felt as connected to the people as I do now.  China seems to be struggling with its identity, working on cleaning up its image as the 2008 Olympics approach.  Wild Grass is an invaluable depiction of the fight that is carried on daily by ordinary people simply trying to live what we accept to be a normal life.  
  This was the first Sisterchick book I read.  I really loved it and couldn't put it down.  I told my Mom and sister that they HAVE to read it.  It was very interesting hearing about two Christian friends and their Hawaii adventure.  I would highly recommend it 
 Garth Nix's Shades children is an amazing story of tragic loss and revenge. It has a wonderfully thought out story line, with interesting characters and enough conflict and problems to keep you reading page after page.  The tale of adventure is told from the view of Gold-eye. He is a young teenager who escaped from the dormitory's of the wicked overlords just before he hit the sad age of 14, where kids are taken to the overlords `meat' factory's and there brains and muscles are used for the creation of malicious creatures. Who's sole purpose is to fight meaningless battles for the overlords personal enjoyment.  Once Gold-eye has escaped and is on the run, he meets up with other escapees and learns of a place underwater where children are safe from the overlords and there creatures. However this place is not as safe as everyone expects, For Shade, who looks over the children, is far too greedy for his own good.  In this novel there are many conflicts, not only between the Gold-eye and the creatures, but also between Gold-eye and the other young escapees. One of the most recognized conflicts in this story is involving the children and Shade. Shade keeps sending the children on pointless, dangerous missions to gather information, and the Children are not getting along with Shade and his ways of doing business.  I think this novel is extremely well written, and the action and adventure is more than enough to keep you reading. I passionately recommend this book to young teens, especially males (for they generally like gruesome tales more than females). This book is fast paced and full of exciting situations that leave you wondering, "How did he do that". I assure you that you will not want to put this book down! 
 Another great book from "White Wolf"  First of all, this is a huge book with nearly 400 pages (it has 395) with (beautifully written!) information on this very cool world and system.  It is also visually stunning - with full color, high quality pages, lots of original artwork, and a short comic at the opening of each chapter.  Highly recommended 
 An actual translation of a Chinese detective novel, this is good fun for mystery buffs, and especially for anyone familiar with van Gulik's Judge Dee series.    The Judge, with his familiar retinue, faces three puzzling mysteries.  Some elements of this are reworked in later Dee novels:  the poisoned-bride story inspired part of THE CHINESE GOLD MURDERS and the killer widow story was lifted and slightly altered for THE CHINESE NAIL MURDERS.    Nevertheless, this is a breath of fresh air for those who want something different.  Readers curious about Chinese culture will appreciate the text and the notes, and will enjoy a good, readable translation.  To start on the fictional Judge Dee novels, start with THE CHINESE GOLD MURDERS 
 This album is great. In the begining I didn't think this band would be as  huge as they become. They are slow putting out albums, but when they do their quality. 
 I bought this book close to it's US release primarily because I loved the cover art. The photo that makes up the front of the book brings back every happy memory and flashes of sunshine and splashing and friendship, and what do you know, the book does the same thing.   I don't know if I can find the words for it, really. My copy is flagged and notated and battered and I bring it out every time I need it. It's the sort of story you want to crawl inside and look around in, live in for a while, get to know the characters all over again. O'Neill writes so masterfully that you find yourself expecting to run into Doyler or Jim at the local lake or to walk into the little shop in town and find Mr. Mack behind the counter.  It might take you a bit to get into this one. Stick it out. It'll be worth it.  I once took this book to bed with me. I wasn't ready to let it go. I'm not sure I'll ever really let it go, because when I find myself needing to be somewhere I feel immersed in love and friendship, even in the face of adversity, I pick it up again 
 I took a lot of time researching work out videos.  I had read an article about Cindy Crawford having her baby completely natuarl with a midwife.  I was intrigued.  Then I saw a special on models on VH1.  Again I was intrigued.  A friend recommended this video saying her roommate did it faithfully and got a great body.  Basically the video has three segments.  One 10 minute, one 20 minute and then one 40 minute.  It incorporates simple lunges and squats with some aerobic cardio and weights.  Cindy and Kathy and very upbeat, but not in a cheesy way.  Cindy is way impressive since she just had a baby.  You might think you would pass on this video since it is for post natal exercise, but I am telling you to keep it.  It works!  I worked out with the video a couple of times this week and I love it.  It was beautifully shot and had pleasant music.  The workout wasn't hard, but it wasn't easy.  I woke up the next morning completely sore and unable to barely sit down.  This work out definitely sneaks up on you.  I am going to incorporate this video with running a few times a week and I can't wait to see the changes!!!  Buy this video 
 This is a very good story written but a great author.  I am so glad that he stayed so true to Asimov's original intentions for the series (unlike Brian Herbert with his Dune books).  It does not read like Asimov though.  This is forgivable because Bear never tried to emulate Asimov's style, he only tried to take Asimov's unfinished story and do the best job he could with his own writing style, which is really a better way to go if you think about it 
 I bought it as a gift for a digital camera/video I'd gotten a few years ago, so that I could send it to a couple who had a new baby boy. They are pleased with it and thanked me for such a great gift not only of the camera but also the charger and a battery that would last 8 hrs to shoot their Christmas 2006 
 I saw this movie a few years ago when it was out on VHS. The story line is simple but not implausible. Eric Schaeffer shows his poetic side and Amanda Decadenet even though not perfect is also great 
 An impressive treatment of Monk's music. This is what makes Wynton such a great artist. His respect for the masters is a lesson that every Jazz listener should learn. His tone, attack, and approach are flawless! His heart wrenching expression on "Reflections" proves that Wynton can be be very emotional.  Words cannot express the expression of "Brillant Corners". Truly a great recording 
          Dead as a Doornail is the fifth book in Charlaine Harris'  Sookie Stackhouse series. Sookie is the smart, feisty, compassionate barmaid from Bon Temps who also happens to be a psychic. Because of this she has one foot in the door of the surrounding supernatual world around her.    Jason, Sookie's brother has been changed into a werepanther. Sookie is very worried about him, but finds to her surprise, that Jason is very happy in his new life and enjoys shifting into a werepanther at the full moon. Sookie doesn't enjoy her relief very long however, because there is big trouble in Bon Temps. Someone is killing shifters, and after 3 deaths, Jason seems to be the prime suspect. In a hold over plot line from the previous book, Eric, the vampire doesn't remember the time he spent with Sookie, but he knows something important happened between them and wants to get to the bottom of this mystery. Also, Debbie's (who Sookie killed in self defense in the previous book) family has hired 2 private investigators to search for her and they've come to town to question Sookie. These two plot elements will be resolved in this book.    Dead as a Doornail focuses on the supernatural shifter society, the werewolves and werepanthers. We get a more detailed and clear description of their politics, their place in society, as well as the structure of the pack.      When Calvin Norris, the head of the werepanthers is shot Sookie is determined to find out who did it, not just because of Jason, but because she thinks the world of Calvin. The solution to the mystery is a surprise to the reader, as well as to Sookie. However, the clues were there and Charlain Harris plays fair with the reader.   I really enjoyed reading Dead as a Doornail. Sookie is an intrepid and entertaining heroine. She has courage, heart and intelligence. It's no wonder her love life is so complicated! everyone loves her.  It's pretty important that readers start the series at the beginning in order to get the full flavor of both the plot and character development. The order of the books are: Dead Until Dark, Living Dead in Dallas, Club Dead, and Dead to the World.     
 "Media Control" is a part of the "Open Media Series" for "Seven Stories Press."  This is an ongoing series since the Gulf War and have published numerous (short) political books on media subjects (not just media related).         This short but eye-opening look into the propaganda system of today (as well as the early part of the 20th century) is a flawless and easily understood text that will change your thought on how the U.S. government as well as media corporations operate.          Noam Chomsky is arguably one of the most intelligent political and linguistic authors of our time.  This book (although short) will spark some thought about the democracy we live in today (as all of Chomsky's books).  This book is worth the small sum you pay and is a great introductory look into how media and information are controlled and distorted by the powerful 
 I've read a lot of books on sewing techniques, some better than others, but this one "takes the cake."  I thought this book was easy to read, and very well explained and illustrated.  I actually felt like I could go back into the sewing room with confidence!  Many of the author's directions could be applied to more garments than just shirts, so I think this is a valuable book. 
 This is awesome great to chill out with.  Even the kids love it!!! 
 I took this book out of our university library to have on hand while reading Françoise Gilot's "Living with Picasso", in order to see representations of the artwork to which she refers throughout the book.  "The Ultimate Picasso" proved invaluable. Not only does it contain Picasso's complete major works, they are also presented in chronological order which made look-up easy despite Gilot's often describing an artwork and the process used to create it but not always giving its title (she always gives dates).  I ordered "The Ultimate Picasso" before the library due date because I couldn't bear to not have the book in my house! The photos of the artwork are brilliant and crisp, and the accompanying text is informative.  You will not be disappointed by this book 
 I think every artist should read this book. it immediately changed the way I look at color. just ONE part of the book saved me a lot of headaches and explained a lot of the reason I was having so many problems working with color 
 The Bushnell Powerview 12x25 is a fine, small pocket-sized binocular.  Since my wife is an avid bird watcher, we already have several binoculars of various sizes and viewing power.  Our grandson accidentally broke her small 10x25 Bushnell that we used for trips, so I researched, then bought this one from Amazon for her birthday.  She loves it.  The viewing power is a bit greater than the other and is every bit as compact, which makes it easy to pack for vacations, yet provides for a good viewing experience when enjoying the various bird populations around the country.  We both highly recommend this, and other Bushnell products 
 The Dreamkeepers: Successful Teachers of African American Children By, Gloria Ladson-Billings  	Gloria Ladson-Billings starts this book by posing this question, "Do African American students need separate schools?"  She concludes her studies by saying, "What African American students need are better schools."  Her main argument throughout this book is that culturally relevant teaching practices would be a huge part of creating these "better schools."  Ladson-Billings suggests that there are many key characteristics of culturally relevant teachers.  Some of these consist of the teachers seeing themselves as an artist and teaching as an art, they believe that all students have the ability to succeed, they demonstrate a connectedness with all of their students, and they help students develop necessary skills for their lives.  These are just a few of the many characteristics that have to do with culturally relevant teachers. 	In order to find out more about culturally relevant teaching, Gloria Ladson-Billings conducted a study to find and examine culturally relevant teachers.  She started out this study by asking parents and community members for the names of some teachers who were very successful at teaching African American students.  Next she asked the principals of area schools to provide a list of successful teacher's names.  Once eight of the same teacher's names appeared on both lists, and those teacher's agreed to participate, she stared her investigations.  She combined classroom observations, interviews, and personal experience to come up with her argument for culturally relevant teaching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	Ladson-Billings' argument for culturally relevant teaching came about because she saw negative effects on students whose culture and history did not appear in their textbooks or in their lessons.  She believes that African American students need to achieve academic success while still maintaining a positive African American identity.  She believes that it is the teacher's responsibility to help the students want to choose academic success. In her study she had multiple teachers who were just like this.  They did not care where these students were or what other people had said about these students, they knew that they could succeed and that they would succeed with their help.  They, many times, would work with them on an individual level to help them in whatever way that they could.  In the end, all of the students who were thought of as being difficult or not intelligent enough to learn certain skills, ended up learning what they needed to know and sometimes more.  That is what made these teachers such great teachers. 	Personally, I agree with these reasons to support culturally relevant teaching.  I think that if students do not see their cultural history correctly displayed in textbooks or in lessons in the classroom this could cause the children to see themselves as insignificant or inferior to those of a different cultural or racial background.  I also agree that African American students should and can achieve academic excellence while still maintaining a positive African American culture and identity.  I think that it is a wonderful teacher who can do both of these things, help them achieve academic excellence and maintain a positive image of themselves and their background.  I hope that I can be one of these wonderful teachers who can do that. 	I also believe that Ladson-Billings' evidence for culturally relevant teaching is both convincing and relevant.  Most of her evidence is given through her classroom observations and her interviews with the teachers.  She shows that when a teacher is culturally relevant, the students end up learning more and in many cases the students like that class more.  In situations where the teacher is not culturally relevant the children do not learn as much or as easily and do not enjoy the class to the same extent as the other students with culturally relevant teachers.  In the final chapter of this book she talks about one of her student teachers who is too impatient and does not bring in any cultural relevance when trying to teach three sixth graders math.  That teacher ended up sending those students back to their seats with homework that they had no idea how to complete.  This would be an example of a teacher who is not culturally relevant.  The result was that the students did not find it interesting and did not learn anything from the lesson.  	The one problem that I do see with her study is that she only examined eight teachers.  I think that is hardly enough to base a whole argument off of.  I do think that is definitely a great start but it may be more helpful so study many more teachers.  She also only studies African American students.  She does not even begin to look at any other races.  I believe that culturally relevant teaching would be a wonderful idea for both African American students and students of any other race. 	Altogether, I think that Gloria Ladson-Billings makes a wonderful argument for culturally relevant teaching.  Her main point is that students will learn better and will enjoy learning more if the lessons are culturally relevant and if the teacher is also.  The only weakness that I saw with this argument is the amount of people that she studied.  Overall, I think that this is a good argument and was a great book for a future teacher to read. 
 I think this is one of Icey's better releases. I find him to be hit or miss, but this one is spot on. He's got a good cut selection, and everything is solidly mixed with a good blend of barn burners and floor velcro.  The stand out cuts for me are:  Feelin' Kinda Strange (Bass Kleph & Nick Thayer Remix)- This one is infectious. It has one of the better build sections I've heard in a while.  Like This (Main Mix)- I can't remember how this one goes, but I remember thinking "This is sick!" and looking to see what was playing and it was this.  Closer - This is a nice break from full on action and features hot chick samples.  Everybody Get Up (Circuit Breaker Remix)- This is a full on barn burner and my favorite cut on this CD. Very electro, great bass.  Like I said, I think this is one of Icey's better mix compilations. Definitely worth a look 
 I am biased about this book, but in a good way and with deep respect for the Japanese culture and the author. My husband Bob Heiss was one of the recipe testers who worked on this book from our kitchen in Massachusetts. During this process we had constant emails going to and from Toyko about the progress of the recipes, questions about confusing issues, product availability, etc. I know that a handful of others across the USA were putting similar time into the perfection of these recipes and this book. As someone observing this process,but benefiting from the results, I was very impressed with the amount of effort that Ms.Andoh put into making sure that the recipes would be clear and concise to American readers.   If you are curious about Japanese food but have perhaps been intimidated by it, then please give this book a try. I know that that you will get excellent results from these  recipes - all of the dishes and sauces that I tasted were delicious and accentuated with very well-defined flavors.  As a food enthusiast, I for one am ready to move beyond 'sushi' and learn more about the fascinating world of Japanese food and cooking. 
 I bought this book for my 11 yo daughter but I read it before giving it to her.  This is an excellent story and a must read for all girls who like adventure and mystery.  
 Two sessions: from 1957 and 1959. This is great big band music for a nice price, performed by the best musicians of the west coast scene.(see booklet front). Jack Sheldon is brightly recorded en sounds well. The arrangements are good, with space for solo work. The soloist are sometimes a bit far from the mike, or the recording level is too low for some soloists. The overall impression of the recording sound is very acceptable 
 These are two of my most watched MGM Midnite Movies, they are superb in every way! If you can buy the Soundtrack to 'Dr. Phibes Rises Again', it's great too!  
 Absolutley brilliant. One of the few albums I have brought that i like every track. 
 One of the most extraordinary things about this wise and gently profound book is the way I have come to experience myself - a truly ordinary person - as one who can bless.  Imagine that!  Whether I am sitting quietly at home or on a bus, engaged in my daily work or doing something more unusual for me - like stepping up to lead an invocation at family gathering  - I am finding I can do this!   I highly recommend this book.   My favorite part of this book is the workbook section.  The exercises take one to ever unfolding riches and depths - revealing in turn - the wonder of ourselves as ones who can bless.  I think David Spangler is redefining what it really means to be human 
 Judy Brown has done it again! As in her first book Joke Soup, Judy Brown has collected an unbelievable amount of material from the best comics around, (young and old). This is the perfect book to pick up and put down (i.e. great for reading whilst visiting the commode). I bought several copies for people in my family all of whom loved it 
 I'm in love with this CD. First off we must take a look at Pee Wee. He is a shy guy with a funny expressive face and numerous Facial and body ticks. But when he puts that liquorish stick in his mouth, all that melts away and sweet jazz just seems to ooze out into the air. Pee Wee spent numerous years playing with Count Basie and often performed with Basie alumni. On this CD he is paired up with a fantastic valve trombone/bass trumpet player named Marshall Brown. The music is bordering on old school swing with a tinge of New Orleans blues and Cool jazz with a Dixieland touch. It may sound weird but that's because Pee Wee has a style that is in a class all its own and is hard to define. Pee Wee has always been wrongly categorized as a Dixieland musician. He performed at the Newport Jazz Festival with Thelonious Monk and on this CD performs composition written by Monk, Ornette Coleman and John Coletrane........That ain't Dixie to me. You'll just have to decide for yourself 
 Funny. There seems to be a Law of Nature that fantasy and science fiction series descend rapidly in quality after the first few books. Terry Pratchett is a notable exception to this rule. The first few Discworld books are a pleasant enough way to spend an afternoon. The later books are considerably more than that. In them Pratchett's characters have deepened and the engrossing storyline is only the top layer of the book. This is one of the best of the Discworld books I've read (my favorite so far is Monstrous Regiment). I'm sure both that I'll be rereading it and that I'll be pick up subtleties I missed this time around. 
 Is it possible that this film didn't receive its due credit because it was far too intelligent for the ordinary viewer? Sean Connery is simply brilliant in putting together a tale that weaves many familiar characters of classical literature together into one fast-paced and suspenseful adventure. While some may think of it as cheesy, I actually enjoyed the nuances and subtle hints back to the stories that shaped literature as we know it. Watching it again two or three times later and I had found at least a half dozen references that I hadn't heard before (Capt. Nemo's first mate's name is Ishmael - 'from Moby Dick', the Phantom is considered to be 'quite operatic' by Alan Quartermain - 'The Phantom of the Opera', just to name a couple.)But I guess if the film was viewed by deadbeat teenages who can't even stomach the short story of the 'Portrait of Dorian Gray' or even 'Tom Sawyer' in their high school English classes, then it is no wonder that the film didn't receive high reviews. They wouldn't have any idea what was going on, much less understand the subtle humor. It's too bad really. It's a literary genius of a film. Sean Connery's character, retiring hunter of English legend Alan Quartermain, is quite comfortable to live quietly in Africa where he will age peacefully. Until he is summoned back to England to lead a group of misfits against a mysterious villain who calls himself the Phantom. Quartermain is called by one who refers to himself as 'M', maybe a gentle jibe at the James Bond series which vaulted Connery to fame?, who turns out later to be none other than James Moriarty, of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Quartermain finds himself in league with Mina Harker (Dracula and Van Helsing), Rodney Skinner (the Invisible Man), Captain Nemo (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea), Dr. Jekyll and his vilent alter ego, Mr. Hyde (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), the immortal Dorian Gray (The Portrait of Dorian Gray) and special agent Tom Sawyer of America (Tom Sawyer and the only character that hails from American literature). As it turns out, each of them has a special ability that gives them an edge above the enemy and soon a race to save Venice ensues that twists and turns right up to the very end. It even leaves the impression the a sequel may perhaps follow, but I suppose that Connery won't continue to put his genius out there for American moviegoers to complain about. 
 My girlfriend has a huge stack of these books on the bookcase, so I decided to take a gander at them.  After consulting her which was first (I did not realize they were labeled), I dived into the first book.    As the story unfolded, I found myself introduced to an interesting cast of characters.  Some likeable.  Some not.  Detail varies depending on how central they are to the story.  Nevertheless, I did not feel that any of them were bland.  Cadfael is a curious rogue of a character who has his elder years to temper him.  John is mischievous and good intentioned.  Robert is pompous, well composed and intelligent, while having good qualities such as being charitable and forgiving (most of the time).  Peters is able to characterize in broad strokes or narrow detail as necessary.  I was duly impressed.  Now the core of the mystery is the murder, and I found that did not happen until halfway through the book.  I did not find myself lacking for it though.  There is enough going on that you are curious about the plotting and the discoveries that take place.   Peters' setting is fantastic.  Yes, she is drawing upon the historical past, and in a way, it is already made for her.  However, she is good at communicating it to us without loosing us in the language. Neither does the language sound modern.  She meets us in a middle ground with emphasizes the style of the setting while not loosing us along the way.  The book is very good, and I look forward to picking up the next.  It is also brief.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in any manner of fiction.  It would appeal to mystery readers, those interested in speculative settings or even someone who does not lean toward any genre.  The book should appeal to all 
 While reading this book, I realized that besides all of Newton's troubles with his family, his nervous breakdowns, and his arguments with other people, he was a wonderful scientist. He achieved so much during those times of confusion in England, when people could not express their ideas freely. It was a sin to contradict the church with theories. Newton had his beliefs already set and that did not trouble him. He clearly knew God existed, having no doubt about it. But he also thought that his theories had to be proven. In trying to connect these two things, he acquired more followers and enemies. In the field of science, he is one of the greatest scientists ever, having discovered gravity and many facts having to do with light and motion. He established principles which are known as Newton's laws.  I like how Gleick, the author of the book, provides pictures from Newton's originals drawings and sketches. He also provides quotes which help us understand how Newton thought and felt. This book is well balanced, giving the reader information that explains many aspects of Isaac Newton's life.  It provides us with information about his discoveries, his troubles, his friends, the time he lived in and many of his ideas.  If you are looking for a good biography of a historical and unique science figure, I recommend this book 
 Peter Lance writes like a fiction writer. Unfortunately, this `fiction' has grounding in fact. While it is a book of factual investigative reporting, it reads like a detective story.  The scandalous story of the FBI's slipshod pre-9/11 fight against terrorism, as told Lance in the stories of key three characters: the world's most treacherous terrorist, and two Americans who worked, to their personal detriment, to stop him.  Lance contends that before the actual attacks of 9/11, the FBI had missed several signs over the ten years prior that could have prevented the attacks.  In fairness to the actual participants hindsight is always easier. Yes, what seems like clear signs now of an imminent attack, may not have seemed like it then.  After uncovering all this information, what we need to ponder now is: (1) What have we missed?, and (2) What is al Qaeda's (or Osama bin Laden's) next move.  What this book should really teach us is that there is so much out there that we missed and possibly could be missing.  Lance, by threading the narratives of FBI agent Nancy Floyd, FDNY fire marshal Ronnie Bucca, and bomb-maker Ramzi Yousef, Lance brings to presence years of behind-the-scenes wasteful intrigue.  Lance uses his journalistic flair to place three strangers on a collision course.  The underlying premise that grids the work is both wearisome and frightening: Our government may not be ready to protect us from external threats.  Mind you, I am merely echoing what I read from Lance's book.  Reading the 9/11 Commission Report (also available on Amazon.com), one gets the sense the issues outlined by Lance have been identified and steps are being taken to rectify the situation - a most reassuring climate is the order of the day.  Lance provides critique - valuable critique of a bureaucracy gone soft after years of complacency - this book is a wakeup call.  Miguel Llor 
 This is more like it.  A good exciting book that keeps on moving.  It was not as good as Absolute Power but way better than The Winner.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good non-stop excitment 
 If the registered trademark "RealAge" mentioned countless times and often more than once in a single paragraph doesn't bother you, you'll love this book.  In 13 well-organized chapters and 474 pages of the most understandable medical text ever written, the term "RealAge" is estimated to exist nearly 1000 times!  But "The RealAge Makeover" is worth every penny and provides fascinating details on how you can lower your RealAge and make you feel years younger than your RealAge by simply using the RealAge concepts described in the RealAge Makeover.  Ooops!  See what I mean?  I can't get the phrase out of mind now.  And since I now expect to live about 10 years longer than I would have, had I not read the book, I'll probably say "RealAge" another 2000-3000 times 
  It's been my dream since childhood, since I read for the first time the immortal ancient myths and legends; Greece where the sea is so blue that Aphrodite could be born only from its foam and the sun so gold that it makes the whole country glow with the eternal forever young smile, Greece that the Gods chose as their residence. I always wanted to go but the film "Shirley Valentine" (1989) directed by Lewis Gilbert and written by Willy Russell (also play) with Pauline Collins has added to my desire to see the magic country.  Pauline Collins reprises her Broadway's role as the hilariously charming and unpredictable 45 (or so) year old Liverpool housewife Shirley Valentine - Bradshaw whose life is the humorist Sam Levinson's lament: "When I was a kid, they told me to do what my parents wanted. When I became a parent, they told me to do what my kids wanted. When do I get to do what I want?" until one day she proves to herself that it is never too late to try to make your dream come true. When a friend wins the paid trip to Greece for two, Shirley joins her and finds that Greece is her dream because she always wanted to see the sunset over a blue sea. She says yes to the romance with a handsome Costas Caldes (Tom Conti) who likes her in spite her extra weight, saggy boobs and the stretch marks. She began to like herself, too. Sounds like your typical sloppy romantic comedy, ah? Wait until you see it. This is a wonderful and delightful film - clever, witty, funny, and thought-provoking. And to Roger Ebert goes my question "what is wrong with you, man?!"   4.5/5  
 I have been reading the Avengers since 1964 and this is my favorite Avengers story ever...and the Avengers has had no shortage of great ones!  It is difficult to review a story of betrayal without giving too much away so I will cover the finer points: Story by Brian Michael Bendis, Pencils by David Finch, Inks by Danny Miki and Color Art by Frank D'Armata.  If you read comics at all you are aware that these are the four biggest names in their respective fields in comics. Characterization is an order of magnitude greater than any previous Avengers tale...and did I mention, an Avenger betrays them - at the cost of several member's lives!  I have bought this book 3 times (not counting the comics) and given 2 copies away. I repeat: THIS IS THE SINGLE GREATEST AVENGERS STORY EVER! Buy it 
 I picked this up because of the movie released based on this book.  It is a well-written story (supposedly true, more on that later) of a poor family in the 50's and 60's.  I appreciated the book for the glimpse into the culture that my parents grew up in.  Our culture has definitely changed sociologically and economically in the past 50 years.  The characters in the book (outside of the father) are good, and fun to cheer for.  This is a good, all-American family struggling with poverty and an uninvolved father, probably representative of many families at the time.  Of course, the family goes through many hard times, but there is always a humorous story to make the book a little more enjoyable.    Just a note on the `memoir' controversy...  James Frey's best-selling book, A Million Pieces, was a memoir on his troubled, drug-filled life.  It was found that much of what was written by James Frey were large exaggerations, and some of what was written were outright lies.  The author defended himself by saying that his book was just a memoir, not a factual recollection.  Why do I bring this up?  As a skeptic in general, I seriously doubted a lot of the stories that Terry Ryan recounted in this book.  No doubt, much of what was written was true- but how could so many details be remembered so clearly?  Why do the details of this family resemble a TV sitcom rather than a real-life family?  The story (if told in truth) probably would not be as exciting, or as funny as recorded in this book.  It also would not sell very many copies.  Do I know for sure that this book is an exaggeration?  No, but it came across that way to me, and it dampened my appreciation for the book.   
 ...in forty years of relentless reading. We have all seen the evidence of subjects driven mad by sensory deprivation. We know that the health of an individual is tied up with the health of the community. Shepard gives us a glimpse of the myriad ways in which the mental health of our species is tied up with the interspecies conversations that produced our consciousness. To vastly oversimplify his synthesis of anthropological, biological, and cultural sources, Shepard's thesis is that the only argument that can possibly save wild animals and the environments upon which they survive is this: that without them we will destroy that heritage of which we are most proud: our human consciousness. The arguments are expanded in his other work, and I keep meaning to read them-as soon as I have absorbed this one. I've been rereading it for 20 years 
 This is a very interesting history of Scouting as it began in the United Kingdom and what it has become there today.  What was Boy Scouts is now, in Europe, just Scouts and includes boys and girls and makes no distinction in sexual orientation.  It is also a much more urban organization.  This book is full of interesting and useful information and great historical pictures about the origins of Scouting and its spread around the globe.  On pages 186-187 it lists many countries and how many registered scouts there are in each of them.  Indonesia is by far the largest with over eight million scouts (8.9 million).  The United States is second with 6.2 million.  Another section of the book provides a paragraph or two of how scouting functions in various countries around the world.  And in the appendix there is a chronology of important events in the history of the scouting movement.  If you love scouting, this is a very nice book.  However, for Americans with our more conservative approach to Boy Scouting, some portions of this book will seem a bit odd.  However, this book is about the GLOBAL view of scouting over history and our BSA is only a portion of it, no matter how much its culture and history matter to us here in the USA 
 This is one of the business classics in the past twenty years.  It has sold a huge number of copies and I am sure many of those purchased copies were actually read!  As impressive as its sales numbers have been, the way it has affected the approach to the way business was discussed and talked about for the past dozen years has been even more impressive.  Yes, there are always newer fads and business is subject to fads more than most fields of human endeavor.  There are lots of theories about why this is so, but it might have something to do with the new managers coming in wanting to bring something new with them and so the previous guy's stuff is no good.  Hence, something comes and something goes for reasons beyond its ability to run business in a sound and profitable way.  However, when something comes along with some real substance it spreads and lasts, at least for awhile.  The ideas of core values and big (hairy audacious) goals hit a chord and lasted.  Of course, today they are part of the air businesspeople breathe rather than a quote from this book.  The authors looked at a number of big companies and found a list of those that had been around a long time, been financially successful, and were on a roll at the time of this book (but they don't say this is one of their criteria).    They also found some comparable big company that hadn't found the level of success of the "visionary company" as they call the successful firms.  They then looked for some traits common to those big successful companies that might explain their success.    The four big principles they came up with were: 1) Be a clock builder - or architect - not a time teller [once you read the chapter it will be clear], 2) Embrace the genius of the AND, 3) Preserve the core / stimulate progress, and 4) seek consistent alignment.  All this has to do with being opportunistic, building the organization that best supports the opportunities you are pursuing rather than letting the organization dictate what you pursue, that success requires doing seemingly contradictory goals simultaneously, making sure that the core culture gets preserved (if it has been a successful culture), and making sure that the whole process is focused on the core ideology - the core values and core purpose of the organization.  Sounds simple?  It's not.  And even so, the "visionary" companies the book lauded a dozen years ago have all, or almost all, fallen on various levels of hard times since the book came out.  This fact is addressed in a soft way in the frequently asked questions addition for this paperback addition.  There is also a new last chapter on building the vision and a section on questions for research (this acknowledges areas left unexplained by the book).    A book that has been this influential deserves your attention if you are interested in business literature.  However, as with all of these books, use the principles as they apply to your real life in the real world of competitive business rather than treating them as some kind of final truth.  
 don't believe what you read in other posts.  they are obviously written by people that have no programming capabilities what so ever.  i am actually one of those people that have limited programming knowledge but i got this remote to work for me right out of the box.  no problems, no glitches, no calls to tech support.  this  remote works great and is an asset to any beginning HTS enthusiast.  i will say that it is no MX-3000 but if you can live without making your own pretty buttons this remote will work for you. this remote has customizable buttons you just have to read the manual and use the "help" function to figure it out.  it's very easy. you can even do two "activities" at the same time if you map it out correctly.    if this "caveman" can do it so can you.  at $379 this remote is a great deal.  buy it, you will like it.!! 
 Since so many able reviewers have provided insightful and lengthy reviews of this book, I shall keep my comments short.  This book, to put it simply, should be THE starting point for any and all who question or wish to think about the doctrines of (primarily) Christianity, though the discussion of the Old Testament clearly has relevance to Judaism, too. Paine makes an assault on these religions, and utterly rejects their holy books and doctrines, because he sees them as horribly divergent from what a rational conception of God requires. Paine explicitly advocates Deism, but the arguments he makes are equally useful to atheists, agnostics, theists, and all others interested in religion.   These arguments may not be accepted as decisive by all, but they will indubitably cause any open-minded individual to seriously consider them. This is simply one of those books that anybody who seriously considers the philosophy of religion must read 
 Highly recommend to sewers who want to have their garments really shin 
 What a great book!  It has everything I could ask for in a homeschooling book.  I'm new to homeschooling and not many books I found gave me all the information I was looking for.  This book gave it all and then some.  I will keep it on my desk with me at all times because it is like having an experienced homeschooler next to you.  It got me even more excited to homeschool than I already was.  Talk about a comfort to a homeschool family.  The title Homeschooling Companion is accurate.  Thank you Saba and Gattis! I feel like you are my new best friends 
 I had searched for this movie...my husbands favourite as a teenager. I found it on Amazon, for a good price and easy purchase. Thank you for a quick Christmas delivery. He was THRILLED 
 Truly Nitty and Gritty... I was after old bluegrass, guess I found it.  Seemed some of it was in need of a little lawn maintenance, but overall, an enjoyable CD, and nice set 
 I have to say alot of Johnny's stuff I don't like at all but this is a good show. My husband made me watch it on HBO. I didnt't want to, but when I sat down and looked at the TV ,It just made me laugh! We watched it about 4 times and then I got on the computer and bought it. Just a really good show 
 A very engaging story.  I had a really hard time putting it down when I had to go do other things.  I liked the unique aspect of the heroine being a butler.  That's not something I've ever some across in a book before. The suspense plot wasn't exactly the most original thing - a psycho stalker - but Howard uses the other details to keep the story from becoming too mundane.  The romance really adds to this story.  I really enjoyed Sarah and Cahill.  They had great chemistry, and there were some fantastic steamy sex scenes in the book.  Howard did a nice job developing their relationship and intertwining it with the story.  It was a definite bonus to the suspense aspect of the book.  Overall, just a good read.  Sure I've read more suspenseful and creative books, but there was just something about this story that really kept me into it 
 This is a great book.  The girls of my girlfriend love the book.  As soon as I sit down, they grab a book and jump in my lap.  
 Everything I thought it would be, some rockin' tunes to listen to any time.  A great live album 
 Only 25 out trips; however there is a lot of information about them including when they are open and how to get there even by public transportation. It also notes how long it takes to get there and how long you have to walk from a train station. Maps of the 25 places are included, which look quite thorough. I plan to use it the next time I am in London early next year 
 Regarded by some as the essential literary representation of 1980s America, "Bonfire of the Vanities" was written during the economic boom and urban crime waves of that decade and published almost as the stock market crashed in 1987. It follows the lives of a group of characters who express New York City's ethnic, socio-economic, and political rivalries through their involvement in a highly-publicized case of hit-and-run. A car belonging to Sherman McCoy of Park Avenue, one of Wall Street's most successful bond brokers, accidentally strikes a young black man in the Bronx. With the injured man in a coma, Harlem preacher, politician, and general rabble-rouser Rev. Reginald Bacon sees an opportunity to advance his agenda -by delivering the racially charged case to ambitious District Attorney Abe Weiss and to unscrupulous tabloid journalist Peter Fallow. Prosecutor Lawrence Kramer jumps at the opportunity to bring down a wealthy WASP in the name of equality. And streetwise Irish lawyer Tommy Killian may be McCoy's only ally in a city where truth and justice take a back seat to just about everything.  "Bonfire of the Vanities"' flaw is ironically the source of its strength. The book is over 600 pages long. It follows too many characters and spends a lot of time describing the world from their point of view. The book's insights rely on its many perspectives, but at the same time, the descriptions are cumbersome. Tom Wolfe generally does not cast his characters in sympathetic light. His willingness to call it how they see it draws the reader into the story out of an almost perverse curiosity. The blunt talk and peek inside the worlds of city politics, tabloid journalism, criminal law, and Park Avenue lifestyles keep us interested. The story is found in the self-serving hostilities and interdependencies of New York's many factions more than it is in the sequence of events. And it's all thoroughly plausible, sadly 
 Those who have read Lakatos' "The methodology of Scientifical Research Programmes" know that the conservative Lakatos considered to have proven the "unscientific" nature of Marxism by the fact that it had never made any "stunning, unexpected" prediction on the basis of its "core" hypothesis. Well, here you have Trotsky predicting - in 1936 - that the USSR, as a transitional society in the transition between capitalism and socialism had to come to terms with the following disjunctive: either the toppling of the ruling bureaucracy by means of a political revolution or capitalist restoration led by the bureaucracy. If that is not a stunning prediction, what else is 
 This is a great book.  I am only about 1/4 of the way through the book and have enjoyed reading about the projects.  The photographs are fabulous and the instruction will be easy to follow.  I am anxious to get going..... 
 The truth of the matter is that although the Word says that "Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God", there are still two main obstacles for a secular world. The hurdle of intellect, and the lack of desire for change. At least in this book, Ravi uses reason and logic to show the differences between "good and bad" or "right and wrong" in the subjective mind, and how these cannot be inherently subjective collectively. There is God, or there is not. As a Christian, I found some refreshing tools for ministry, although this certainly isn't for the light reader. Then again, Ravi is not a Max Lucado-type writer anyway. Different authors bring different gifts to the pages, and this is for the intellectually elite. Perhaps that's why it took me so long to get through. Still, it was worth the long nights 
 I recorded this show when it was on tv to a vhs tape. It doesn't compare to the actual DVD. This is a show that can be loved and watched by all. It is just spectacular. The way that it is set is just wonderful. I have watched it many times. GREAT VIDEO FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY 
 I thought this salt tasted pretty good until it occurred to me I go to the bathroom everytime I take a swim 
 well if your buying this for the bonus song you better hear on the song sample first, because it sucks, this is the first time opeth has ever let me down after being a long time fan. why they chose this song i have no idea but they could have at least picked something heavy instead of some stupid oldy goldie classic song thats slower than my grandmothers speech. the only reason i gave it a 4 star was because of the dvd is excellent to watch. just buy this for the dvd only 
 I think Janis is selling herself short with the title - this is really an all-over body toner, not just a glute workout.  She does work the glutes though (really works them!) but also includes some great upper body work too. You begin with the 7 min warm-up, then into 30 min standing sculpting.  This is almost aerobic with lunges, squats, plies and deadlift "combos" - but Janis also ads in some great upper body work so you are working upper/lower at the same time.   TIP: to do the deadlifts properly place a weight plate or 1/2" plank under the ball of your foot (just under the toes) and this will force your glutes to do all the work, not your back. If you don't want to put something under your toes, make sure all your weight is IN YOUR HEELS (like when doing a squat). If you learn to place weight on your heels rather than the ball of the foot you shift the emphasis into the glutes rather than lower back and quads. After the standing work there is 18 mins of floor toning.  I love this part - and it is great for those who have bad knees. It is almost a pilates workout but does effectively tone.  I recommend newer exercisers just do this section after the warm-up then add the standing sculpting when this no longer leaves you sore.  Ends with a 5 min stretch. 
 This book thoroughly defines Depression from every angle.  It's an intensely personal book which makes the read even more gripping and important. It is clear that depression comes in many shapes and sizes.  You can be a high-functioning individual and be depressed.  Ever wonder why you're so irritated and angry all the time? Yes, you are depressed. Ever wondered why you suffer from ruminations and obsessive thinking over things you can't control? Yes, you're depressed.  Ever wonder why you long for days by gone by? Yes, you're depressed etc. The revelations gained from this book are astounding. I had no idea that depression had so many levels. Beautifully written and shatters all the negative myths about the disease and most importantly outlines the true benefits of medication.  After reading this book, I realized that probably millions of people on the planet suffer from depression and they don't even know it.  A must read 
 Sloan Wilson, to begin with, is a great writer. He is able to capture a mood, a tention and an empathy for his main character, Mr. Rath, that many authors simply can't.  I found myself able to identify with this man (who is my age, 33, though male) so closely it was creepy. He is like me in his tendency to worry so much about the "what if's" in life, that sometimes he doesn't take the risks that maybe he should. Or, if he does take the risks, he is so nervous that everything will fall apart, he can't truly enjoy it. I found myself rooting for him, and feeling his anxiety at every work conference or family incident. I was glad when the story ended, and that it ended as it did, because I don't know if I could have taken any more stress. This book DID stress me out because it is so true, then as well as now. Definitely worth reading 
 "A Room with a View" is a novel that is thoroughly enjoyable from the first page to the last. It's a heart-warming love story, and this aspect of it completely charmed me. It's also very funny in some places. It's not overlong, either, so it doesn't drag, and it's a very easy read. I simply fell in love with "A Room with a View", and it has to be one of my favorite books I've ever read. I'd recommend it to anybody 
 I'll be honest, I don't like fiction books.  But I've got to tell you, A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe has changed my mind.  Mr. Cullen adds so much detail that the reader comes away with a sense of actually being in touch with the cast of limited characters and the events taking place.  The twists and unpredictable turns make the book a truly unforgettable experience.  You don't need to be a golfer or a fan of golf to enjoy this novel.  Can lightning strike twice?  Absolutely 
 Having been involved in the care of professional and amateur baseball players for the past twenty years I have always struggled with providing my athletes,their coaches and parents,physical therapists, athletic trainers, and conditioning coaches a system of conditioning to carry them to higher performance heights. Dr.Gene Coleman has provided us the definitive text on baseball conditioning and performance enhancement. I would recommend this incredibly practical guide to anyone - player, coach, and trainer alike who wants to experience baseball succes 
 I was a little hesitant to buy this book, as I am not Christian.  My fiance is Jewish, and I was looking for a book that would help me incorporate some non-denominational aspects and work out a ceremony that included some of his traditions without causing me to say things I don't necessarily believe.  This book was excellent for that purpose.  In addition to having good, honest, discussion about how rabbis and Judaism handle interfaith marriages, it offers 8-10 different ways to handle each part of a marriage ceremony, as well as passages from poems and scripture which are suitable.  It gives several sample ceremonies as well.  The best part is, despite the subtitle, this book does not limit itself to Jewish/Christian ceremonies.  There are non-denominational suggestions, Native American passages, and passages from cultures all over the world.  While there is some focus on Christian services versus Jewish services, I found that helpful so that I knew what people were or were not expecting.  The book is definitely helpful regardless of your faith.  I read several books about creating your own wedding ceremony from multiple backgrounds, but this book was the most helpful.  Buy it, and then use the other ones as references only 
 Are you the type of person that is planning on going to college, but doesn't have the money to do it? Well this is the right book to read. This book may be written in poems but it doesn't mean it rhymes and it's boring. This book talks about a young teenage girl named Lavaughn.   Lavaughn is a 14 year old girl in her freshman year at high school. Lavaughn's character in the book is interesting because she is just like any girl at high school she is smart and a really nice girl. She likes to help people a lot and she is the type of girl that appreciates what she has since she lost her father she knows she has to become someone in life to help her mom out. She plans on going to college. But her problem is that since her mom is the only person she has and the only person that works she doesn't have enough money to do so. So she decides she wants to help in someway.  She decides on working to earn and save some money so that she will be able to go to college. Lavaughn then takes a babysitting job. She is going to take care of 2 little children, Jeremy and Jilly who are not even potty trained yet so they most likely depend on her for everything. She takes this job to help a young mother named Jolly.  Jolly is a young 17 year old mother. Jolly has many problems. First she has two kids that she has to take care of alone. Then she has been sexually abused too many times. Jolly is a young mother who works hard to feed her kids and pay the rent alone. Since she doesn't have parents and doesn't have the baby's daddy with her. When Jolly gets fired after being sexually abused by her own boss she doesn't do anything but instead tries to find another job. This is a problem for jolly because since she got pregnant at such a young age she didn't even finish school and nobody wants to hire her now.   Jolly doesn't have no where to pay Lavaughn from and Lavaughn needs the job and the money for her college. When Lavaughn's mom finds out that jolly doesn't have a job and that her daughter Lavaughn is not going to get paid she doesn't agree and she tells Lavaughn to look for another job instead. But will Lavaughn listen to her mom or will she help baby-sit the children for free while Jolly looks for another job? Find out what happens in make lemonade.  This story is really interesting because of the condition Jolly lives in and because of the way she is. She doesn't have anyone to help her and she doesn't do anything when she got sexually abused. Also the way she handles things and just goes along with them and the way she is able to barely handle them.  I felt really good reading this book because it just kept me interested in wanting to know what was going to happen next. I really liked this book because it talks about the goals that some teenage people have and the way that some people's life are. This book may not be based on a true story but it has the true story about what life is about. I really recommend this book `' Make lemonade `' to everybody, not just to certain people. I recommend it because it's not about romance or about war but it's about life. Something that everybody should be interested in. 
 Like the previous two volumes, we enjoyed SOTW Vol. 3.  It is written in an interesting and engaging style.  My younger children enjoyed it as much as my third grader.  Susan Wise Bauer does a good job handling some rather difficult and unpleasant parts of History.  She did choose to leave out a couple of topics, but explains her reasons at the beginning.  My only complaint is the lack of church history that is covered.  (There seems to be a decreasing amount of church history covered in each successive volume. 
 I'm actually building a boat and will tell you that this book is a good overview on the topic, but when it comes to finding specifics for a particular project it will usually fall short. I have had much better luck  with a specific research topic referring to the likes of Fred Bingham,  Howard Chappelle, Bud Mcintosh, and Larry Pardey. Having said that, your  library is not complete without this classic. It is another valued tool in  the toolbo 
 The Best Supergrass cd out there. The sound of this cd is like no other. It has a "pop" ish feel that captures attention. Amazin 
 Garth Ennis, Preacher: Dixie Fried (DC Comics, 1998)  After I finished Gone to Texas, I checked with the library immediately to get my hands on Pracher: Until the End of the World. But they didn't have it. In fact, I had to go all the way up to book five before I found another one at my local bibliophilic haunt. I resolved not to read it until I could read books two through four, so I'd keep going in sequence. I've forgotten a whole lot about the adventures of Jesse and co. over the intervening years.  That resolve lasted all of three hours. I cracked the cover on Preacher: Dixie Fried the next evening, and like Gone to Texas, it took two sittings to get though (one sometimes has to stop for The Shield's season finale).  Not much has changed in Preacher's world. Jesse is still looking for God. Tulip is still trying to figure out why. Cassidy is, well, still Cassidy. The book opens with a quick look back at the time just before Cassidy met Tulip, and through her Jesse, then comes back to present day, where Jesse has decided to avail a voodoo shaman, one of Cassidy's friends from the bad old days, of an offer to put him into a trace to see if he can get closer to figuring out what it is Genesis wants from him. Then, of course, you can add in old enemies, new enemies, and the usual bag of tricks thrown in their way.   Dixie Fried, like Gone to Texas, is simply superlative. The artwork and story are both fantastic, the characters are three-dimensional creatures with real lives and emotions, and everything is so well-presented that it demands to be read in one sitting-- unless he Shield's season finale comes along before you can finish. ****  
   In 1944, Polish Jew Raphael Lemkin coined the term genocide, applying it to Jews and Poles alike. In this small but thought-provoking book, Richard L. Rubenstein approaches the German Nazi exterminationist policies in much the same vein, while stressing the role of the modern state bureaucracy to make it possible.  Probably the first step in genocide is the denial of the humanity of the intended victims: "Once the victim is categorized as belonging to a different species, the task of transforming him into a thing is immensely simplified...Before the Nazis assaulted the Jews, the Poles, the Russians, and the Gypsies, they were categorized as members of sub-human races."(p. 54). Terms such as Tiermenschen ("animal people") and Untermenschen ("subhumans") were commonly used. Rubenstein (p. 83) points out that Jews were often referred to as "a surplus population", but not the fact that the Germans also used this term for Poles.  The denationalization of those intended for genocide was also significant: "Unfortunately, the Nazis clearly understood the importance of the question of statelessness. When they began to deport Jews from such occupied nations as France, Bulgaria, and Hungary, they insisted that the deportees be stripped of their citizenship by their respective governments no later than the day of deportation. There was no need to denationalize Polish and Russian Jews because the Nazis had destroyed the state apparatus as soon as they occupied the territory. The absence of a state apparatus in Poland and occupied Russia was an indication of the ultimate fate of the Poles and the Russians had the Germans won."(pp. 32-33).  While the mass shootings and gassings of Jews were already well underway, the Germans set their sights higher. Rubenstein cites an October 13, 1942 letter by Otto Thierack, the German minister of justice: "With a view of freeing the German people of Poles, Russians, Jews, and Gypsies, and with a view to making the eastern territories which have been incorporated into the Reich available for settlement by German nationals, I intend to turn over criminal jurisdiction over Poles, Russians, Jews and Gypsies to the Reichsfuhrer-SS (Himmler). In doing so, I stand on the principle that the administration of justice can make only a small contribution to the extermination of these peoples." (p. 34). Richard L. Rubenstein comments: "Soviet domination of Eastern Europe was closer to that of a classical tyranny than was the German occupation. The German aims were far more radical. They sought to create a society of total domination involving initially the enslavement and extermination of the Jews and eventually similar treatment to other subject peoples. They were determined to clear a Lebensraum, a living space, for German settlement."(p. 76).  Of course, owing at least in part to the much greater numbers of Poles than Jews, and despite the fact that 2-3 million Polish gentiles (including half of all educated Poles) were murdered before the Germans before the latter were finally driven out of Poland, the overall extermination of the Poles was more of a long-term German project. In this regard, practical methods of mass sterilization were actively being developed (p. 49), with the 3 million Russian POWs to be the first large-scale victims (p. 50). The Nazi goal was clear: "As we have noted, had the Germans won the war, mass sterilization would have been an important aspect of their program for the subject peoples. It must be remembered that with both the Nazis and the Bolsheviks, victory inevitably led to an intensification rather than a diminution of terror. Mass sterilizations of Poles, Russians and, in the more distance future, the French and the Italians, would have permitted the Germans to exploit the vanquished at their own convenience in the certain knowledge that the subject peoples' national existence was at an end. Whether extermination or killing was the means of securing absolute dominance or whether a certain number of the vanquished might be permitted to reproduce in exactly calculable quantities would have depended solely on the requirements of the German masters. The victims would have had as little control over their own destiny as cattle in a stockyard. In a society of total domination, helots could be killed, bred, or sterilized at will."(p. 52).  Richard L. Rubenstein also picks up where scholars such as Hannah Arendt and Isaiah Trunk left off in discussing the role of the Judenrate (the Jewish community councils) and its central role in the Nazi extermination of Jews (p. 3). Although the degree of Judenrate-German collaboration differed from place to place, the reader may be stunned by the degree to which the collaborationist actions of some Judenrate eliminated the need for large numbers of Germans and non-Jewish collaborators in the roundup of Jews for extermination: "In almost all of the killing operations, the German personnel were short-handed. It is estimated that only fifty SS personnel and 200 Lett and Ukrainian auxiliaries were assigned to the Warsaw Ghetto which hade a population of five hundred thousand at its peak, almost all of whom perished."(pp. 74-75).       
 This is a most wonderful novel: the author based her story on the few remaining fragments of a medieval ballad and builds a complete novel out of her imagination and competence about medieval England.  The only flaw I see in it is the use of ancient spellings to render the texts written by the characters: a most unnecessary display of erudition.  A woman wronged, an immature but kind young king, an evil sorceress: all these classical ingredients are mixed into a story which mightily differs from a classical fantasy plot.  The evil sorceress, who of course is beautiful and pityless, has her good reasons to be such a villain: not that Ms Sherman justify her conduct but she gives us reasons to understand it and even to pity her.  The young king is courageous and good natured but he was thrown too early into his responsabilities and through a painful coming of age he has to become wiser and stronger to cope with them; to become a real king he also has to give up his personal hopes of happiness and this, if believable, is nonetheless very hard to stomach.  The wronged woman has a strong personality; she can tell right from wrong and act accordingly, but she is not likeable. Even before the evil sorceress wronged her by killing her family and her hopes for a happy life she was hard, determined, even cold. We have to take sides with her without liking her.  This is perhaps the reason why an extremely well written novel is so hard to like: the orderly world of fantasy, where black is black and white spotlessly so takes unpleasant shades of grey, different from the usual device of the main hero being a former thief or rascal.  I was not able to hate the sorceress, who I looked upon as a wild animal fighting bloodily for her survival; I looked with kind of disgust upon the rise of the woman up the hierarchy of the king's court, at her gaining the king's love without being able to love him at least a little in return.  Ms Sherman has chosen the stony path to a good story: the result is bitter but the quality of her writing and the development of her characters are such as not to allow any rating below the five stars.  The sexual gender issue and the homosexuality of the king have delivered this valuable novel to a minor queer fiction publisher... A shame such a book is not distributed worldwide as it deserves 
 These only take 1 minute to make, the noodles are already expanded as in NOT DRY - They taste great and I dont feel like I just ate fast food when I finish one of them.. or two : 
 I adored this book from page one to the last.  It is such an inspiration to me and I  felt like a found in this book my "bible" and guide to life as I have created it.  
 I liked the animal stickers! It's probably better for a five year old than a three year old because the spaces to place the animals are small and hard to fit. Worth the money 
 I have a disabled child and I got this as a gift from my husband and children.  I look at it and I feel so greatful for the family I have.  
 Mark Snegg's correction about Baculus would seem incorrect-- to judge from the "Search Inside" feature.  Type in "Baculus," go to the first link, and there at 2.25 is Caesar, not Baculus, charging into the fray.  But I picked up the book in Borders last night, and the copy I looked at had Baculus, not Caesar, as Mr. Snegg found.  Where is Amazon getting the texts it's scanning?  UPDATE:  Contacted Oxford & got this reply:  The passage to which you refer did contain a significant error - the substitution of Baculus for Caesar - but it was corrected at least three years ago.  The passage on Amazon reflects the current state of the text, and the copy you saw in Borders must have been an old impression; we have reprinted several times since the correction was made 
 We know we are onto something special when the movie started with the comment that it isn't deliberately sped up.  Then, the dancers started doing their "thang", krumping and clowning.  For someone like us that are overseas, we have not seen at first hand the urban culture that is sprouting along the West Coast in the States.  It's encouraging to see someone like Tommy the Clown who actually gives a damn about the young who grows up in the ghetto part of Los Angeles and that he inspires them to stay away from the gangs and up to no good.  Naturally, krumping evolves from the young who used to follow Tommy but who would then started their own dance movements.  It's really quite an experience to see them in the showdown called the Battlezone and arguably the highlight of this documentary.  Whilst it's all about positiveness, danger seems to be lurking at the background.  After the Battlezone, some disgruntled losers arguably went to Tommy's house and ransacked his domain.  Still, this movie is all about love, support, self-belief, and triumph of human spirit.  The Director is shrewd enough to get footage from Africa of tribespeople doing their dance and then, he put that side-by-side with the dance movements and bingo, what's trendy now (including face painting) evolves around from their ancestors.  How appropriate to name this documentary after Martin Luther King Junior's saying that one day, the nation shall rise and if the young truly keeps their faith, nothing is impossible.  At the rate that hip-hop culture is spreading throughout the globe, we probably might just see this become a global phenomena at no time.  The DVD is brilliant in adding in new dance moves, extended footages that are left out, interviews with Directors and with key persons featured in the movies and so forth.  An exemplary docutainment that's well-made.  Highly recommended 
    This book was published in 2004 and is loaded with results of polls to indicate preferences of voters on all sorts of issues. It covers the issues and shows the direction that the Democrats and Republicans must take if they hope to sway voters from one party to the other. The book amplifies the miriad of issues that face both the voters and the party stratgeists.One of the difficult things is that ,while there are many issues,the voter must in his final analysis, choose one candidate over another.   Whe also see that a great number of voters have a large amount of party loyalty and will not vote against party loyalty,regardless.  So,what this means is that the center ground and voter willingless to make their vote count is really what elections are all about. Each party has agendae and pressures that divide the voter. In the book we see why and how both parties play up or play down issues in hopes go gaining the most votes at the time.   The book is written more from the standpoint of how the Democrats must change to win.Reading this book now,we see that it is obvious that the Democrats failed to move to the center and thus loss the 2004 election. As November 2006 approaches,we will again see if the shifts will occur; and again in 2008.    One thing that has often occurred to me over the years ,particularly with the election of the President, falls under personality and traits such as trust,likability  and leadership.I think these factors overide party agenda,certainly in enough numbers from swing voters to result in one candidate winning over another.   Although most party loyalists would not likely agree but I believe that,Kennedy,Roosevelt, Truman,Eisenhower, Reagan and Bush were all winners on that score. As much as the media tried to destroy George W. Bush, when you get right down to it the swing voter liked these  qualities better with him than with John Kerry...and that's why he won.   I am really surprised the author did not address this important factor in his otherwise extensive coverage of issues. This is why the Debates are so important.It's not which candidate wins on debating skills ;but which one is the one the voter trusts,likes and thinks would make the best leader. 
 One particular chapter -- "The Product Conversion" -- does a brilliant job of demolishing the theory that homosexuality is a mental illness.  It dissects every argument made to this effect, and shows that homosexuality is nothing more than a variant of human sexuality, in much the same way that being left-handed is nothing more than a variant of laterality.  Szasz does a brilliant job of showing the hypocrisy of the medico-legal establishment in terms of that establishment (1) declaring that homosexuality is a mental illness (this is no longer the official position of the American Psychological or American Psychiatric Associations) while (2) declaring that homosexuality is a crime.  It cannot be both, as Szasz points out in his analysis -- while criminals can be mentally ill, homosexual status as opposed to conduct cannot be both criminal **and** a mental illness.  The book is worth purchasing for this chapter alone, and I recommend it to any person interested in beating back efforts to remedicalize and recrimenalize the status of gay people.  This chapter also reveals the manner in which religious ideology masquerades as psychiatric doctrine, ruthlessly exposing the epistemological error made by those who cling to outdated and cruel theories in this regard.

 Wonderful soundtrack. If you've seen the movie, you can listen to these tracks and almost guess what or who they are written for in the script. I think Thomas Newman is the drummer of their composer family, because almost all of his music has the underlying ryhthms that make you tap to the beat (even though this is classically orchestrated music), with music that perfectly breathes the air of the times it was written for.     
 I think it's great that people are writing in about my husband's book. However, I'd like to know how the reader from Chapel Hill who has posted a  review, would know whether or not Pearson slanted the information of his  sources? Was he there for the book interviews? And if he's referring to the  documented sources you can look up in the endnotes, I fail to see where my  husband is misrepresenting them. Hugh Pearson simply reported his research  findings then drew his own conclusions. And as far as the charge goes that  he has no feel for the era. What does the reader mean? It's not like  Pearson came up with conclusions based only on what he thought. He  interviewed Panther veterans. There is one movement veteran in particular  in the book who talks, for instance, about the murder of Black Panther Alex  Rackley. She says that you have to put the murder of Rackley by fellow  Panthers in the context of the times, which were crazy. And that the murder  was a mistake that the authorities were using to do in the movement. The  book is filled with interviews with veterans who take the reader back to  the era. And Pearson doesn't step on any of what they have to say. So I'm  at a loss for what the Chapel Hill reviewer is referring to. Lastly, I find  it interesting that more people have said they find this negative review  helpful than the positive reivews on line. This causes me to question a lot  of the motivations of potential customers. Are they looking for reasons not  to buy the book? Are they searching for reasons to dismiss what Pearson  wrote as happened among so many people who didn't even bother to pick it up  when it first came out, and simply went on the attack against him based  purely on what reviewers said (many of whom were biased veterans of the era  who were culpable in covering up Panther atrocities?). I wonder 
 This book by Robert Liparulo is absolutely WONDERFUL!!  There are so many twists, turns and action page after page that you don't want to put it down. You have so many questions as to who is going to come out of it alive. And is there really people or things in this world like this? Scary!!!!  Picked up this book after reading GERM. Liparulos' style of writing grabs you by the throat and leaves you gasping for air. I highly recommend this book and his latest book GERM.   PRODUCT WARNING: Very addictive 
 Two months ago, I was living in chronic pain, completely debilitated and barely able to carry out the basic functions of my daily living.  I was all of 39 years old.  I had exhausted the medical system to find only a disempowering system of specialized professions with no answers for my healing - only Band-aid fixes.  I was simply in survival mode, actually wanting to die at a deep level to escape from the pain in my body.  Than a dear friend of mine gave me Dr. Martin's book.  I began reading it and immediately became glued to the information being presented to me.  I have to admit, though, as I read further, many of the ideas challenged my conventional thinking and my mainstream religious base.  I put the book away for a week but then found myself drawn to it like a magnet.  As I opened my mind to the possibility of the truth being presented in this amazing book, I began to see that the pain I was living in was all a manifestation of my mind's twisted and distorted programming that had developed from my birth and childhood experiences.  I contacted Dr. Martin and flew 2,500 miles to meet with him to "bring this book to life" within my own body.  With his assistance and expertise, I was able to truly listen to the messages my body was giving me and found myself being confronted with the reality of how bitter and resentful I had become in my life.  This buried anger and victimhood was the root of my pain.  As I connected with myself, humbled myself to be in a place of complete unconditional love, I found my true source of healing:  Me.  Our bodies truly are equipped to be well, free of disease, free of limitations, and free of pain.  It simply comes down to the art of listening and with a willingness to embrace love and forgiveness.  I have my life back because of the information presented in this book.  I highly recommend this book to you.  You're reading this review which only tells me you are seeking wellness and searching for an answer to your pain.  Look no further.  Click on the "Add To Shopping Cart" icon and get it mailed out to you today.  You have everything you need in your body to find wellness, happiness, and joy.  Stop looking to the world of doctors, therapists (and I'm a therapist!), healers, medications, etc.  You've got it in you.  This book is simply your guide to connecting with the greatest resource you have available to you on this planet - your body/mind.  
 Well, it's a little weird writing this review myself, but you out there have had 4 years to do it and have now missed the chance to be the first! Having had the past few years to reflect on the book, I am still pretty happy with it as a first effort. Despite the tongue in cheek approach there really is a bit to be learned from my book - even if it's just to marvel at how superstitious the old time sailors were. My aim is to do another book sometime soon and I hope readers will enjoy the second as much as they seemed to have enjoyed the first 
 I've known and followed Tom Moore and his work for years now, and I find this work to be of the best books he has written.  Dark Night is clear, literate, focused, and immediately useful, identifying the gnarly issues of post-modern adult life and shining beautiful bright light on the path at the places where it narrows.  Moore is at the height of his powers, incorporating what he has touched on previously, evolving it, deepening it, while making his piercing perception very accesible.  I highly recommend this book, without reservation. And, bonus, it is a good read to boot 
 Anyone who is interested in women's issues needs to read this book! To me it appears to be the best discourse on feminism ever written.            Well researched it gives a  bilogical, historical ,psychological and philosophical persective of so called feminie condition across the centuries and outlines  it with great accuracy and professionalism. It deals with various aspects of woman's life , her roles in the family and the society , her psychology and sexuality. Sure, women's condition changed since the book was written, but it's message  still seems shockingly revolutionary.            No wonder that its publication almost 60 years ago caused so much fear and hatred. 
 This movie will never be considered a classic but if you are a Bo Derek fan this will satisfy your craving for eye candy 
 This was a very practical, down to earth guide to preparing and using herbal medicines.  Seldom do you find such a straightforward easy to follow handbook on the proper preparation, storage and usage of both homegrown and  purchased herbs.  An extremely valuable tool to minister to the health of  the whole family, young and old.  Attractive full color photos and easy to  follow descriptions make for a very pleasant reading experience.  Fun and  interesting, Ms. Ody includes instructions and cautions to ensure correct  usage of these herbs, and avoid unpleasant side effects or complications of  existing health conditions.  I highly recommend this book for anyone  interested in herbal medicine for the home 
 One of the previous reviewers said " I could get everything I needed from a few beers with a few Technicians". As a consultant, he demonstrated his focus was strictly a technologist and not someone with any responsibility to develop a working plan, and explain it to the owners of the business.   This book is invaluable to business architects, systems design architects, and others who have to discuss complex challanges and develop working business plans for technology without endangering their company by going down a Rat Hole of technology for technologists. For that alone, the book is worth 10 times it's price.   No, it is not a "Geek Book". IT is a real world IT manager and IT architect book as a guideline. And the business planning and business culture changes that SOA affects are clearly outlined in this text in a way that even a novice can understand.  And what is who will really find this book valuable. Not self styled experts on coding and Coding practices, but business and IT professionals who have to work in the large scale enterprises of today.  Excellent book JJM 
 I loved this book. I don't usually like biographies (they're all the same--someone is born, becomes famous, dies, etc) but this group bio of Edna Ferber, Zelda Fitzgerald, Dorothy Parker, and Edna St. Vincent Millay totally captured my imagination. It's organized by year, and the storytelling jumps from woman to woman in a way that creates much suspense and anticipation. Meade makes each woman seem so three-dimensional, they don't just leap off the page--I could swear I even smelled Dotty Parker's Chypre perfume and taste Zelda's gin blossoms and highballs. This book would make a great gift for any one who loves biography, the Roaring 20s, or any of the writers in question. The large number of cameo appearances by other writers, bohemians, and Round Tablers give the book a wider appeal. As a recovering English major, I feel strongly that anyone who lists "The Great Gatsby" or "The Sun Also Rises" as his favorite book should get a copy as well, if only for medicinal purposes 
 These are two beautiful, comprehensive books - attractively packaged.  We opted to buy these from Amazon after returning from Florence instead of purchasing on location - we saved money as Amazon's prices are much less  and we didn't have to sacrifice precious luggage space 
 I had to give a presentation on Robert's Rules of Order, and I considered just buying the original tome and relying on my ability to figure it out.  That would have been a big mistake.  The complete Robert's Rules of Order contains extensive parliamentary procedure that is only utilized in complex governmental situations.  For an overview on only the essential rules as they relate to most applications (Board meetings, clubs, professional organizations), Robert's Rules in Plain English is tremendously valuable and time-saving.  I could not have completed my presentation without it 
 I was a young child when "Here We Go Again!" came out. My dad bought the album and I listened to it growing up. I recently bought these two albums reissued on one CD, and I love it. You will find several excellent songs, such as "San Miguel," that are not usually included on "Best of" recordings of The Kingston Trio.  Buy it. You won't be disappointed. 
 John Rich later became a TV titan and directed many of the best episodes of the best TV series, as well as taking a hand at production.  But his feature film career is even more interesting.  Like many journeyman directors, he was assigned a brace of Elvis pictures--this one and the later, hippie-themed EASY COME, EASY GO.  But he was also responsible for some of the most under-rated programmers of the 1960s, including THE NEW INTERNS and BOEING BOEING--and WIVES AND LOVERS as well.  In ROUSTABOUT he demonstrates a flair for working with actors of all stripes, from the legendary Golden Age star represented here by Barbara Stanwyck, to the neophyte starlet--in ROUSTABOUT there are plenty of them, and the most sparkling is a very young Raquel Welch, who makes her film debut in the opening scene as a college coed mesmerized by Elvis' singing.  Raquel looks great and seems quite believable.  It's no wonder her fi;lm career soared after making this film.  As Elvis' leading lady, Joan Freeman is pretty good, and for this we can thank John Rich, he brings out colors in her otherwise cut and paste performance that we would not see again in Ms. Freeman's acting until her amusing later turn as "Ellie Jackson" in the Don Knotts goof-fest THE RELUCTANT ASTRONAUT.  As for Barbara Stanwyck, what can you say?  She's great in the part and, even though at the time people say she was slumming by taking a supporting role in an Elvis picture, in hindsight she was pretty wise, for she was able to keep her name above the title and in Hollywood, that's all that matters.  She was one star who was able to keep working until the day she died.  As Maggie in ROUSTABOUT she adds new luster to the word, "Termagant."  She's bitter, she's fiery, she's curt, she's passionate and she's salty.  She's seen it all and laid down the law to bigger men than Elvis.  And yet at the end of the day, when all is said and done, she needs him to maintain her autonomy over her grand little carnival.  The two of them strike sparks together and their scenes have some of the resonance, at any rate, that Elvis brought to scenes with older women who reminded him of Gladys, his own late mother whom he adored 
 I highly recommend this book.  It really helped me to connect with my son when he was younger.  I am reading it again now that my littlest one is almost 5.  Buy this book - you won't be sorry 
 Kurt Brungardt book is exellent. He deals with diet and starts you off with reasonable exercises. Following his programs allow you to increase the strength of your abdominals, gain self esteem and see results. Once you get hooked on the exercises you can create your own rountine. I already started applying these principles with my own well-being by giving up my coffee habit. I drink a product I found on the net made from soya beans and it's not only delicious but good for you too. You can find them at www.s o y c o ff e e. c o m. I still have work to do, but I'm enjoying the results 
 This CD is just pure magic. I know that is such a cliche' thing to say, but it really is. Of course, it really won't appeal to those people who are into EXTREME LIVING...whatever the hell that means, because to me, extreme living is living close to the soul, close to the spirit, close to the Invisible Source that makes and creates all things in and out of Itself.  Debussy was a composer who lived very close to this Invisible Stream. His music reflects a gentleness and yet a strength that flows throughout each composistion. The arrangements are dreamy and mystical and allows one to go into their "inner chamber" and pray in secret to the One who knows their heart as well as their soul.  As much as I love this CD, I tend not to listen to it in the car. I once listened to it while making a routine drive to Santa Monica. The CD stopped and I had somehow missed all of my exits and ended up in Ventura...talk about being in dreamland!   It's a great CD to put in your walkman and go to an outdoor cafe' where you can sip a cafe latte and write poems to an unknown lover whose face you cannot remember, but whose gentle breath is the scent of lavendar...oh, I wax poetic...so sorry...  If you are into quiet and stillness, get this CD...it's truly a breath of fresh air in this noisy, crowded, extreme world we have to be in but not necessarily of...  Peace & Blessing 
 Sculpting Air: The Executive's Guide to Shaping Strategy by Rich Horwarth  A few months ago, I have reviewed 'Storm Rider: Becoming A Strategic Thinker', by the same author. The author is Rich Horwath, Chief Strategy Officer of his own consulting firm, Sculptura Consulting. (According to his corporate website, he has apparently renamed this firm as 'The Strategic Thinking Institute'.) To recap, the earlier book outlines five essential skill sets for managers to become strategic thinkers:  - discovering purpose; - creating differentiation; - decision making; - problem solving; - sculpting strategy;  This time, he outlines the essential skill sets for senior managers in the new book as follows:  - Discovery; - Strategic Thinking; - Strategic Planning; - Strategy Rollout; - Strategy Tune-up;  From the intellectual standpoint, there is absolutely no basic difference between the earlier book & this book. It seems the author has now put in a little more emphasis on the 'sculpting strategy' part & uses the metaphor of a sculptor in shaping a model. He writes: "Strategy is to business as air is to life - essential, yet unseen. Properly channled, air becomes wind & strategy becomes intelligent action - both unleashing unparalleled power visible to all."  I don't deny that.  Just like the earlier book, the author again takes the opportunity to promote his series of proprietary 'strategy shaping' tools, like StrategySphere, StrategyPrint systems. Nevertheless, the author has quite an impressive Fortune 100 client list.  I must add: something really stands out from the author & his consulting firm. Unlike others, his firm offers a very well-structured & systematically-configured 'Strategist Training System', from beginner to advanced level. They consist of nine different programs delivered in an interactive workshop format. The author's two books apparently form a strategic part of the curriculum.  One of the author's many observations catches my eye: "Research shows that the most important competency for a leader to possess is the ability to develop strategy. Unfortunately, only 4% of leaders at all levels of organisations are effective strategists." This is certainly very interesting.  The author issues this ultimate challenge  at the end of his book: "Will you or your competitor be holding the chisel?"  I guess all senior managers out there better shape up or else you will get beaten.  On the whole, & to end this review, I still reckon that the two books mentioned in this review are worth to be read & to be included in your 'Strategic Thinking' bookshelf.  
 I GOT THIS FOR X-MAS IN 2004. AND I WAS SO HAPPY I GOT IT!!! IT TALKS ABOUT THE WARS BETWEEN WWE AND WCW. FIRST IT STARTS OFF BY TALKING ABOUT THE EARLY YEARS OF WWE AND WCW. THEN IT GETS INTO WHEN RAW AND NITRO FIRST CAME OUT. IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT MOMENTS ON BOLTH RAW AND NITRO AND THE FACTIONS LIKE THE NWO AND DX. AND IT TALKS ABOUT MORE COOL STUFF. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS. I DONT THINK IT TALKED ENOUGH ABOUT DX BECAUSE THEY WERE A GREAT WRESTLING FACTION. BUT IT DOSENT STOP IT FROM BEING A 5 STAR DVD. I LIKE THE EXTRAS TO. IT HAS RAW AND NITRO MOMENTS, AN EPISODE FROM WWE CONFIDENTAL ABOUT THE LAST NITRO AND 4 MATCHES. THIS IS WORTH THE MONE 
 Whether you've been cooking for years and years or a beginner...this is the most educational cookbook I've ever seen. And not only do you learn a lot about the why's and wherefore's about what makes a particular recipe work, but the recipes are GREAT! If I had to go through the 250+ cookbooks I've collected over the years and only got to keep 5, this would definitely make the cut 
 I recently read Jack Uldrich's previous book, The Next Big Thing is Realy Small: How Nanotechnology Will Change the Future of Your Business, and I enjoyed it so much that I asked Amazon.com to alert me when his next book came out.  I was a little surprised when I received an email from Amazon.com telling me that his next book was about Lewis & Clark (I was expecting and hoping for another high-tech book.)  Nevertheless, I decided to give it a read (it's a quick read) and was thoroughly delighted with it.  In fact, in many ways, it was even better than his first book.  Uldrich is the rare business consultant--he understands that regardless of how good or exciting new emerging technologies are, they are worthless in the hands of businesses or organizations that don't have good, strong, capable leaders.  I strongly encourage any business leader or executive who is struggling to lead their organization through these technologicaly-challenging times to spend an evening with this book.  I guarantee you that it will be time well spent 
 The Cosmic Serpent, by Jeremy Narby  I remember my personal shift from poetic to philosophical or scientific language. That was more than twenty years ago. I then paid more attention to the things themselves through rigorous analysis rather than relying intuitively on fanciful images that have a vague, questionable, kinship with these things.  In evolving so, I increasingly showed a typical prejudice of the Western, rational mind. I turned my back on all manner of mythological narratives where intuition and imagination share the same bed and beget strange, perplexing mental creations, open to a multitude of interpretations. Admittedly, this prejudice is warranted to the extent that purely rational or factual accounts that relate clear, if limited, realities with words directly appropriate to these realities are more intelligible and reliable. Having said this, it can become a serious impediment in the study of so-called primitive cultures. Their wisdom is an indiscriminate blend of profound truths, rooted in experience (sometimes expanded by psychoactive agents found in certain plants), and quirky anthropomorphic projections or poetic assimilations.   Open-mindedness here implies a renewed tolerance toward fanciful myths to rediscover the truth hidden in them, as that of ancient mythologies.   The Cosmic Serpent by Jeremy Narby - a brilliantly written and solidly documented book that is a pleasant read into the bargain - is an invitation to reunite with our intuitive, imaginative self and conciliate it with our Western, rational mind.   Likewise, in my own intellectual journey, I have finally chosen to be not a philosopher (fond of the scientific method) instead of a poet, in the name of reason and clarity, but both a philosopher and a poet. Reality is indeed best apprehended by means of all our mental faculties: mnemonic, associative, intuitive, imaginative, conceptive or other.  Having said this, Jeremy Narby in the Cosmic Serpent goes further than other anthropologists who strive to salvage the old myths by showing their secret relevancy to the real world. In establishing a connection between intertwined cosmic serpents as the universal principle of life (which is a foundational element of the so-called primitive knowledge) and the DNA double helix (which is the prized discovery of our scientific age), he opens a door that some may never have imagined even existed. Is the world truly animistic, where everything down to the smallest thing has a spirit? Thanks to some special training or special psychoactive agents, can humans, who are preeminently spiritual beings, communicate with the spirits of such large molecules as DNA molecules and through this process learn from and about them? Shamans apparently do. This would account for their knowledge of these molecules, represented metaphorically by intertwined cosmic serpents (or such like imagery as a cosmic ladder), outside the arena of science.  Let me conclude with a recommendation: read this book. Thrilling and informative, wonderfully unsettling.  Laurent Grenier author of the book A REASON FOR LIVING - The way to fulfillment against great odds  
 The Story of Spain by Mark Williams is an excellent history summary of Spain. In less than 300 (although large) pages, he can portray the history of Spain ("Europe's Most Fascinating Country") interestingly and in-depth. All points of Spanish history are touched on. Williams fully details the stories of the Iberians, the Romans in Iberia, Moorish Spain and Al-Andalus, the Reconquest, the Inquisition, the French Century, and 20th Century Spain. If you are looking to get a good handle on the history of Spain, I would recommend this book 
 I had misplaced my copy bought in England years ago and was thrilled to find it available on Amazon. Though I'm not much of a Dahl fan, Revolting Rhymes is an absolute gem - it is hilarious and intelligent and such a wicked bit of fun. I recommend it to anyone, adults included. Don't let the school  library hide it and deny your kids the joy of these non-saccharine tales 
 This is my second Roth book, the first being The Plot Against America.  After reading other reviews I hope to read some of his older stuff.  The nice thing about this book is that it is essentially it is a novella, which allows for considerable brevity, which Roth performs expertly, with a minimum of words and maximum of emotional punch.  It is an excellent portrayal of American life - how children of immigrants start in their ethnic neighborhoods and become, for better or for worse, "Americanized" and subject to the current national trends.  As such, this book indirectly is a commentary on twentieth century American life.  Nice approach as well, where Roth starts at the end and works forward.  Throw in a few thoughts on illness and mortality, and you have yourself some great fiction.  Bravo 
 The protagonists are a lovable but geeky batch of characters.  The antagonists are a group of generally unlikable bully sorts.  The underdogs inevitably win in some symbolic battle to prove they're not losers after all.  That's the Slobs vs. Snobs picture in a nutshell.  They're generally light on character development and focus overwhelmingly on letting the audience know that it's okay to be geeky/ugly/fat/skinny/smelly/some other unpopular characteristic.  While those messages rarely reach those that could use the lesson the films can often be a bit of fun with heroes that are easy to root for and bad guys just as easy to hate.  Shelly Horman's new Guys and Balls (Mï¿½nner wie wir) is a decent one.  The slobs are a group of homosexual soccer players and the snobs are a team of rude, homophobic Fuï¿½ballspielers in this screwball comedy.  Ecki (Maximilian Brï¿½ckner) is the goalie for a small German town's soccer team.  Already in the doghouse for a controversial play at the end of the last game he's totally ostracized when he makes a drunken pass at a decidedly heterosexual teammate.  His longtime nemesis Udo (Carlo Lubjek) takes charge and get him kicked off the team and his parents are shocked by the news of their son's sexual orientation.  Parting words between the team and their ex-goalie bring a challenge; for Ecki to field a team of homosexual for a match against his old team.  He heads to the big city to find his sister in the hopes that she can help him find some gay footballers.  Wouldn't ya' know it he finds a group of unlikely heroes.  The group includes a trio of leather-clad bikers, a very feminine Turkish deli worker, an extremely masculine lesbian, a closet construction worker and a couple of Brazilian players.  The broad spectrum of gay personality types, including stereotypes, could come off as amateur caricatures in lesser hands but Horman & crew do a fine job of compensating for the characters' lack of depth.  The biker trio especially is shown with a light humor that comes at the expense of common perceptions of lifestyle leather queens rather than at the expense of the characters themselves.  The dearth of character development isn't normally that big of a problem.  Only when unnecessary melodrama is introduced does it intrude.  Scenes between Rudolf (Christian Berkel) and his son tend to ring a bit false because we don't know much about either of them and the sudden conflict between Ecki's parents seems a bit out of place.  In the city Ecki finds not only his sister (Lisa Pothoff) but also Sven (David Rott), a handsome hospital worker with looks and soccer skills to spare.  As Ecki, with the help of a drunken former soccer star for a coach, works to make the team ready for the match he also must work to put his relationship with his parents back together.  Will the team be better than everyone expected?  Will Ecki's parents be able to transcend their prejudices?  The answers are never really in doubt just as in any film of this type.  That a film is a predictable by-the-numbers formula doesn't necessarily mean it's no good.  There is a reason that formula exist, they sometimes work.  A fun, light comedy that's a bit stupid and a little romantic, Guys and Balls is an example of one that does 
 George Polti's book tells you about the inner workings of the thirty-six dramatic situations he claims to have found. According to him, the possible plots can be reduced to one of these situations or to a variation on them.  Additionally, he offers specific sub-types to each one of the plots, so  that it is easier to precise which elements will make a distinct kind of  plot. At the end of the book, you will also find useful information on how  every element of a plot can vary. The classical avenger archetypical  figure, for example, can be split into several characters for a different  effect; the object of a passion can be a man or a woman, but it can be  an  addiction too! A book that would-be writers should not miss, "The  Thirty-six Dramatic Situations" will make a good reading even for  those only interested in getting a better grasp of the plot of, say, a  movie they have seen. It is, simply, a work of art 
 Michael J. Fox, David Ogden Stiers, Woody Harrelson and all the supporting cast members are wonderful in this small, quiet story of a stranded doctor in a seemingly stagnant southern town. It's not a masterpiece, not an award winner, not an enduring example of its genre, but it is fun, and it is sweet, and it offers a nice escape from the troubles of the day. For decent folks, it's a very decent 90-minutes of movie magic 
 I'm really enjoying the reading, it has given new insight into the psychological portion of my girls 
 This is a great book.  I have twin boys who are almost two and I bought this book to help better understand sibling relationships and rivalries.  Althought I can't quite use all the techniques described just yet, I know that I will use this in the years to come.  The book has wonderful cartoons that help illustrate the techniques the authors describe.  It's a great book to keep handy.  I also recommend the authors' other book, "How to Talk so Kids Will Listen and Listen so Kids will Talk 
 THis movie is Pixar's BEST movie. Great Animation, storyline,and It's funny as hell. You'll love it. SO buy it!Don't just sit there in front of the Computer sreen and read all day, hoping for more! 
    Almost everyone I know who has read this book agrees that it is a very well-written, as the author uses a plain, easy-to-read and understand style. This is a break with the usual, post-modern jargon that is common among anthropologists today. By the way, Bourgois is NOT a sociologist. He is an anthropologist. Sociologists typically do not engage in five years of participant observation among their informants, but prefer instead to rely on quantitative data. Philippe Bourgois is a medical anthropologist at UC-San Francisco.     A lot of those who have reviewed this book do not understand Bourgois's main argument. He is arguing that answers to society's most pressing issues are a lot more than mere blame-the-system or blame-the-victim approaches. It is far too common for liberals and conservatives, respectively, to blame society or to blame pathological, flawed individuals for social problems. As Bourgois shows in this book, the truth is often a combination of the two. Even his informants admit that they blame no one else but themselves for the situations they are in.     Because Bourgois holds both individuals and larger social structures responsible for the epidemic drug crisis in America, he is bound to piss off both the left and the right with this book. Liberals will claim he is blaming the victim, portraying inner-city people as fundamentally flawed, and tarnishing the image of people living in poverty. Conservatives, on the other hand, will do a complete 180 - and claim that the author is making excuses for criminal behavior, drug abuse, and other social ills. Both the left and the right will accuse Bourgois of glorifying drug abuse and crime - which I strongly DO NOT believe he is doing. He presents his informants in THEIR OWN WORDS --- which is exactly what a good anthropologist SHOULD DO in their writings. If you think Bourgois is glorifying drug abuse, crime, or gang rapes, then you've obviously not been reading his analysis that opens and concludes each chapter.      Personally, I feel that the averse, kneejerk reactions that people get when reading this book ultimately reveals much more about the reader themselves than about the book. In Search of Respect is one of my favorite ethnographies, if for nothing else, for the fact that the author has written it in a fashion than even non-anthropologists can understand 
 Great quality, worn for wedding. shipped quickly. would buy from this seller again in a heartbeat 
 This book was written in a conversational style, and it is made clear by the author that he is writing his opinions and thoughts based on a lifetime of studying religion.  I didn't think that it slammed Christianity.  Some of the other reviewers took offense at some of his statements about Christianity, but the truth sometimes hurts.  The Rabbi certainly said things about the history of Judaism that Jews would rather not know as well.    This also was an interesting book in that it also touched on where Atheists fit in all of this - what is the role of God in both the Jewish and the Christian faiths.  I don't think this book was the be - all and end - all of books about Judaism and Christianity.  But I thought it was interesting and insightful.  The Jewish and Christian religions will be around for decades after Rabbi Kushner is dead, so people should just toughen up and enjoy what he has to say without feeling threatened 
 This book covered the true life events that unfolded during the Blizzard of 78.  It is an inspiration for all those who go down to the Sea in ships.   Charlie Bucko and Frank Quirk should be remembered for being the true heroes they were.  
 Born on a Rotten Day makes astrology so much more fun than those standards books that are found in the line at the grocery store. This book all-out unleashes every negative aspect of every sign in the most hilarious manner. It's not only good for laughs, but it offers helpful tips in dealing with a not-so-pleasant sign, and a way to gaslight a person if you want to get rid of them. Good to pull out whenever you're angry at someone. The book also includes sections under each sign for your evil co-workers, your parents, and even yourself 
 Sheer delight.  Again.  (I'm so glad that I moved east in time to be included among the addressees of Eastern Standard Time. 
 I love this book it was a very good I couldn't put it down. Their was some stuff that was like wow you know it was just a great book. I think everyone needs to read this so everyone know what it's like. The characters take you on this ride of emotions and it doesn't stop until the end that's all I have to say. I think if people read this book then they would kinda think before they act I'm not saying anything bad or anything but can we think before we judge thanks 
 Over the years, being aware of the great rivalry between Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Dubois I had grown used to Dubois followers saying Booker T. was an accommodationalist Uncle Tom, and other similar statements.  I read Up from Slavery as a teenager, and I didn't get that impression from him at the time, so I usually dismissed people's negativity about him as misunderstanding.  Having recently re-read the book, it made a far stronger impression on me as an adult and I feel compelled to give my own opinion, especially since the old "accommodationalist Uncle Tom" reviews are also on this site. The time period after the slaves were freed was known as Reconstruction.  The former slaves were both scared as to what the future held and deeply excited to experience this concept of freedom with the fire and enthusiasm of the Newly Born.  For the most part they were very ignorant of their past, of how to establish themselves as a thriving community, how to interact with their white neighbors in a way beneficial to all and how to best use their money and time to grow as individuals.  The whites were equally scared as to what the future held (change is often scary) but they were also excited for the former slaves and 100% wished them well.  Yes, this was also the time period that formed the KKK, but evil racists were always around and thankfully, then as now, are in the minority. As Booker T. explained, both the owner and the owned had been damaged by the chattel slavery institution.  Because the lowest member of society was the slave to whom all menial labor was delegated to, both races saw work/labor as something to be avoided.  The whites saw it as something that was beneath them, while the blacks felt they should rise up above it as free men.  For them, "freedom" meant `I no longer have to work hard.'  The blacks felt that if they could get an education they could "live by their wits" by teaching, being politicians, preaching or any other profession that required thinking for money, so that they would never have to perform physical work/labor with their hands again.  They suffered from many misconceptions as to what made a free person successful, such as purchasing a very expensive item that they couldn't afford as a status symbol to show that they've "made it" even going into severe debt to have it.   They felt that intensive study into Latin or Greek languages somehow made them superior to other people and that mastery in these fields also proved that they had "made it." Booker T. and Dubois created two models designed to help pull the race forward as a free and successful people.  1.)	Booker T. Washington's model involved not only a solid education in academics and Qur'anic/Biblical principles (integrity, hard work and patient perseverance) but he also felt that each member of the race should be schooled in industry and the value of Sacred Work/Labor.  As opposed to the work they were used to doing as a slave, Sacred Work was the necessary work put forward that not only made an individual indispensable to his community, but it built character, confidence, assurance, dignity and gave the valuable gift of the concept of "a job well done."  Each individual was to master a trade (or two or three) that was vital to a community's growth and do that trade to the utmost best of his/her ability so that not only would the community be successful and grow but the neighboring communities would also find that community indispensable.  This would promote both a brotherly camaraderie between communities as well as help the economy by increasing the competition in free trade.  Booker T's model would enable the average man to be a vital asset to his community which would become structurally solid and a vital asset to the nation's other communities.  It is designed to build up the entire black community as a whole while allowing for exceptional individuals (like Booker T. Washington) to excel.  This was indeed the American Dream model, that through hard work, determination, persistence and education you can achieve success.   Booker T felt that because the black and white races went through slavery together, they needed to be healed together.  Starting off with nothing, the former slaves needed help in order to get a foot hold onto their future.  His model pulls the races together for their mutual benefit; as the black race builds itself up the white race will benefit in the proper symbiotic relationship between two businesses.  Yes, Booker T. rightly saw the growing community of former slaves as a developing business and he recognized that no business achieves its ultimate success without the help of other businesses, in this case the southern and northern whites.  Just like FedEx and Kinko's or Exxon and Ford work together and thus enhance each other, Booker T. knew that in order to really be successful both races needed to work together (Didn't Up from Slavery function as a business plan for investors, after all?).  Of course for the grand scheme of things, for the sake of his race's success why would Booker T. (or any other black person) alienate whites by continuously putting in their faces the evils of slavery and colonialism?  In other words, why would a struggling start-up business alienate the banking industry and other investors by pointing out their wrong doings?  They would be cutting their own throats.  Obviously, if ever there was a time to forgive and forget Reconstruction was that time.  And once the ultimate success had been achieved both races would do whatever they needed to ensure the wellbeing of the partner.  If some racist bigots burned a cross on Kinko's lawn and threatened to lynch the manager, don't you think FedEx would also be insulted and demand the practice stop? 2.)  W. E. B. Dubois was actually the spokesman for the blacks who felt that they shouldn't have to work hard anymore, now they should be free to live the way they watched the whites live for two centuries.  In the Dubois model, the individual was encouraged to achieve the highest education he was able to.  This would guarantee that the "Talented Tenth" (the small percentage of highly gifted individuals among every people) would attain the mega-success that was the American Dream.  Dubois felt that it's the Talented Tenth among every race that furthers the goals of the community as a whole, and that the masses would benefit from a Reaganomics-like trickle down effect.  This model, encouraging a work-o-phobic attitude and a individual's pursuit of success did nothing to build the black community but gave the hope that whites would accept the blacks into their communities "because we are free like you and we demand to live equally with you because we say so" which actually was the attitude that formed the KKK in the first place.  Unlike the model of his rival, Dubois did not establish a system that would remove the slave mentality from the people so they would want to work hard in order to elevate themselves.  Consequently, the concept of the "educated fool" was born, with the black academic full of dead languages and abstract  principles with absolutely no practical way of using his education to enhance the quality of his character, dignity, morality, integrity or his community as a whole.  His community is a raggedy shambles after only a few years of his living in it, because the slave mentality that the Dubois model perpetuates won't permit him even to take pride in slapping on a new coat of paint, mowing the lawn or cleaning up the trash and beer bottles littered in front of his house.  Although the Talented Tenth's accomplishments have moved the race forward in very slow increments the average man, with the idea that work is bad and education only benefits a few, is free only to get in trouble or be used up for someone else's dream while he waits for the next minute advancement from the trickle down effect. Obviously W. E. B. Dubois won the debate.  Seeing the Dubois model as the easy route to success, they simply labeled Booker T. as an Uncle Tom and waited for their Talented Tenth to do their thing and never gave another thought about the matter.  How they felt about Booker T. was summed up by how actor Moses Gunn played him in the movie Ragtime.  Does it feel better knowing that at the end of his life, Dubois admitted that Booker T. was right?   No.  The damage has now been done.  People are fond of saying, "But we've come so far!"  But have we?  We would've come much farther much sooner if we had embraced Booker T's vision instead of Dubois' work-o-phobic, trickle down vision.  They make that statement by pointing to the kind, modern white people that live among us today.  But there have always been kind-hearted white people who've honestly wished us success!  Look where all the money that helped found Tuskegee and the Hampton Institute came from.  Look at the reality of our progress. As a community, after over a century since the Emancipation Proclamation, we have the same mentality we had as newly freed slaves.  Instead of a household sharing a single fork and wasting all of their money on an organ that we can't play, now we've replaced the organ with a Cadillac Escalade or a Coach bag or some rims.  Our communities are chaotic and scattered with no concept of leaving a legacy for our children.  We lack the business savvy to own our own community shops and stores so that corporate predators can take advantage and just take our money out of our communities. Without Booker T's life training fundamentals we still are in need of therapy for the centuries of chattel slavery we've gone through and so are the descendants of our former masters.  Just like we have made little progress past the legacy of slavery's inferiority complex so they are still suffering from the superiority complex slavery gave to them.  For the whites, they don't see anything wrong with building up vast wealth off of the blood, sweat and tears of others and giving them as little compensation as they can get away with.  They honestly don't see anything wrong with playing with the worker's minds to make them feel they are getting a good deal.  Because of this, the old wealthy white families who've built their money through slave labor and their peers actually sought how they could continue to take advantage of black slave labor without breaking the new anti-slavery laws.  I believe that Up from Slavery is an excellent model as to how the black race can pull itself together into an awesome community, but I also believe that the warped mind suffering under a superiority complex can "reverse engineer" the book and use it to prevent such a community from forming in the first place. STEP ONE Destroy all existing examples of strong black communities  STEP TWO  Pull out the wealthiest, most productive members of the community leaving the ignorant, defenseless poor STEP THREE Allow drugs and alcohol to flow freely into the ranks of the poor so that their frustrations and stress will ignite into various crimes STEP FOUR  Paint the picture in the popular media (both bluntly and subliminally) that these people are prone to criminal behavior anyway        STEP FIVE       With the public's approval, round them up and fill up the prisons with them.  Now     they are the property of the State, and can be legally contracted out as slave labor... continuing where we left off. If Dubois' model had not have been adopted, we would have been the ultimate success story, a strong and vibrant community making a major contribution to our nation's prosperity and our own people's legacy.  Of course it's not too late to fix it.  All we have to do is stop calling Booker T. Washington an "accommodating Uncle Tom" and get to work.       
 I though the book was very informative.  I really liked the history presented on portion sizes and the book gave easy to remember items to use to tell correct portion sizes without having to carry a chart with you.  Nicely researched 
 I've been an amateur breadmaker for years, but tend to bake irregularly because of the effort involved.  No more!  Mark Miller's recipes for bread both plain and exotic, healthful and richly delicious, have rekindled my enthusiasm for bread.  I'm baking almost all my own bread now and making breakfast and lunch special occasions.  From genuine sourdough, comforting cornbreads, spicy cheesey flatbreads and foccacia, to tempting quickbreads and breakfast treats (try Cream Cheese and Blueberry Bread, or Scottish Scones with honey, cream and Drambuie) No tedious copying of recipes from a library book this time: there are so many delicious recipes (and I've tried a lot of them) that I need to buy this book 
 Works beautifully, both as blower and vaccum. Minor drawback is that conversion from one mode to the other is somewhat tedious 
 I have finally finished reading this book. I found most of the information in this book very helpful. I've been developing 2D Java games on cell phones for a while. I found a lot of great infomation on OpenGL ES and EGL. There is enough here to really get started and some great insight on how to do fixed-point math. I found the sample code lacking at little and there isn't an actual 3D game from cover to cover, but the chapter on writing an OpenGL ES game was pretty good insight from a real 3D professional game developer. The audio chapter could be left out and the book still would have been good. If your looking at learning OpenGL ES gaming for cell phones you should at least consider this book as a good starter 
 I was somewhat late into the world of My Morning Jacket unfortunately, and Tennessee Fire was the last album that I listen to from them.  I started to fall in love with their other albums first and thought of Tennessee Fire as a decent first album, or a "good start," and when "Z" came out I loved that album as well.  I finally started listening to Tennessee Fire a bit more while the other albums were gaining even more of my affection.  It kept building, and building, and building, eventually "At Dawn" became the greatest thing I had ever heard, and "It Still Moves" and "Z" started to reveal their layers to me as well, and all this time, poor little "Tennessee Fire" sat there, lonely and cold, waiting for me to sit down with it and get to know it as deeply as their other albums, begging to me to give it the same shake I had given all of their other albums, trying to convince me it was more than just an okay first effort, but instead a beginning to the chain of the greatest and most soulfull music ever to be laid upon the once def ears of this world.    Finally, I felt sympathy, and after brief listens here and there, withouth my full attention, I lay there on my couch, with nothing but silence, and put on this album, with no distractions.  Wait, wait, it's clicking, yes, yes, third track in and I'm starting to realize the power of "They Ran" finally, and "The Bear" strikes me even more than before.  Every song now, clicking, sinking in; I'm getting it, "Nashville to Kentucky" means more to me now, I can feel the meaning, yes, "Evelyn Is Not Real" is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard, on and on, I start to understand that the production ISN'T WEAK, it's calculated and intense and relevant to the style Jim James had invisioned for this haunting album.  HIS VOCALS ARE EVERYWHERE, I'm not even high or tripping, and I feel like I'm freaking out by the intensity of the album; this album is arguably as powerful as anything they have done.  By the latter parts of the album, there is no let-down at all.  Possibly, the two or three most affecting songs are at the end; "By My Car, "Butch Cassidy," and "I Think I'm Going to Hell," and also the end track, which is instrumental, all are part of a cumulation that leaves you feeling emotional in so many levels, asking yourself how that was possible to capture on any type of recording device.   I listen to this album, among others from MMJ, and wonder to myself at times if it's even real; is anyone else hearing what I'm hearing?  I want to SCREAM ALOUD to people, repeatedly, "CAN YOU HEAR THE SOUL THAT I HEAR?"  If so, we should all be out on the streets screaming, howling, crying, hugging each other, revealing our newly found souls to the world, freeing our souls from the cage they have dwelled in, rejoicing in a celebratory victory dance while their music plays from the skies from a sound system echoing and drifting from galaxies far, far away 
 Excellent renditions of old, but certainly not tired, standards.  Tierney Sutton, along with several others, have breathed new life into songs that have been around for a while and, in some instances, been beaten up by lesser performers 
 This game is so creative.  It's really atypical and really exciting 
 I spent over a year convincing myself that i needed to read this book (like someone else, i was supposed to read it in class, but we didn't get to it).  Finally, I read it and I am very glad i did.  Although you can figure the secret out pretty far in advance, the fact that the narrator/investigator spends the time trying to PROVE his solution to himself shows what a marvelous work this is.  He doesn't go wildly off into the night telling anyone, he tries to get the lady to tell her husband of her own will.  the slight touch of romance, and deep sense of justice and mystery lend this book to a long weekend's worth of reading 
 Contrary to one reviewer's comments, I would like to call Fanon as an intellectual like no other. It is important to understand how difficult it is when intellectuals try to go practical. Most intellectuals would rather stay in school "prisons" or blindly follow what they have been trained to do with little or no regard for the conditions of their fellow human beings. I guess then most of us will never agree on Fanon since for a extremist (extremism is not always bad) analyst such as Fanon, one who does not go half-way in attacking what he sees as injustice or contradiction, the point of disagreement becomes philosophical, ethical and ideological. One comentator was right in pointing out the dialectical analysis that is central to Fanon. It is important to understand that and know whether you're tending towards Hegel or Marx or going out of dialectics as Sartre attempted to do. But you have to know where you stand and know what you stand for. For Fanon's was not a book about talk. It was a book about action. As for those who claim that Fanon's book is "poorly written" I guess they have to read the French version to understand how perverted some translations can be. Of course Fanon is great even in English, and to miss that, I am afraid many will have to agree with me, is to be odd! Having said that, I shall go into reviewing the book.  The book's main argument is that colonialism must be eradicated by the colonized, and that because it is inherently violent, reactionary violence is understandable and in many cases an inevitable logical flow from the violence of colonialism. Certainly many self-congratulatory Eurocentric analysts will not want any third world analyst to say things as they are, and some will go even as far as saying that Fanon did not say what I just said. Fanon is not one who presents a watered-down version of things. He deconstructs the colonialist's and liberally constructed realities to make oppression naked and winnable everytime the oppressed fights. To lose is not to fight and to fight is to win.  Fanon congratulates violence, and that he does with all powerful tools of psychoanalysis available to him. However, he does not prefer violence; he only sees it as inevitable, and a product of the system he seeks to destroy. I guess most of us should lay down to his doctor's chair and be treated of our Eurocentric view of the world which says, "Oh yes, I see that our world is not just, but TINA (There is not alternative)". When are we going to realize that "another world is possible"?   Most importantly, the book explains the difference between being given freedom and taking it away by your own efforts. The later is of course what he advocates, and his arguments are convincing. Again, as one reviewer argued, one has to remember that Fanon was writing his "present" history. That has to guide our critique of him. That is not to say that the ideas he presented are not still disturbing our minds. And this is not because they are ideological--yes he rejects "objectivity" -- but because they are real. The feminists are teaching us more and more about what it means to have a "standpoint" (one of his weakest point is that he doesn' consider women) and his standpoint was that of a suffering third-worlder who, as he said in Black Skin, White Maks,"[did] not come with timeless truths."   Yes, Gandhi was great, but let us not review a book that Fanon has not written, and review what he has written. After all, even Gandhi did not start non-violence action and many of what he said had been said already--he only contemporarized  them. And despite what one reviewer said, there is nothing that suggests that Gandhi thought violence was not useful especially when that violence was that of the aggressor. He only thought there was a better way of non-violence. In fact, one can say that Gandhi sought violence against him to stop violence! His methods were definitely violent for the masses. We see that in dictatorships where oppositions politicians lead the masses to die because they know that they themselves are protected by their fame. I guess I disagree with his philosophy. So did Fanon though Fanon was more radical than I can handle this time in history.    I once read a sentence Fanon told one world-reknown scholar which I thought can help most reviewers who just want to discard anything Marxist without even understanding who Marx was, what he fought for, what he wrote and why he wrote what he wrote. Fanon told this scholar, "Vous Americains, vous n'etes pas prets a vous dialoguer. Vous vous monologuez toujours." I know that this does not mean all Americans, and that this does not apply to only American nationalists but to all ethnonationalists, but I am afraid that this is exactly what most do here when they come to talk about a Fanon who never was. 
 So - why Jamison Green's Becoming a Visible Man? For starters, it's a good read. James writes to be read, unlike a lot of writers on trans experience or in gender theory. Since my "audience" comes mostly from the MTF end of things, I also think it's vital for us to educate ourselves as to what the experiences are from those on the other side of the fence. Having run FTM International for a million years, James has more than his own experience to rely upon for this book - he has head the stories of thousands of FTMs, from those that embrace a more genderqueer radical place, to those who wish, simply, to pass well enough so they can marry and mow their lawn on Saturdays.  Becoming a Visible Man was also a finalist for a Lambda Literary Award, and won the CLAGS book award 
 This book has many heartwarming stories. It really discribes the way veterinary work was handled years ago. Mr. Herriot is a great story teller 
 Everything's Nice about this Book as it teaches to Negotiate leading to be a winner. The Power of Nice works striking, suggestive ways to deal and negotiate the power skills of Negotiating in supportive mutual environment. The books by Ronald Shapiro and Mark has proven methods of Give n Take Dealing in business and offers a helpful guide for negotiations. The three Ps - Preparing, probing and proposing are the three factors detailed by the authors that prepares for the deal, probing i.e. what they want and is required to deliver and proposing is the stage when the deal fixes towards winning edge with the negotiating skills.The Book reveals observations and anecdotes with very good illustrations. John F. Kennedy's quote on "Let us never fear to negotiate. But let us never Negotiate out of fear" in the Negotiating chapter reveals that some people want to eat the whole cake! They fail in negotiations and refrain from being fair enough. They would raise ample questions in self interest like 'Why take a share of profit when I can take it all' Why can't I keep all commissions?' Why offer concessions?' Why negotiate when you can dictate?' and thus, the difficult Negotiater loses a second deal in future. Moreover, the authors teach negotiaters to be more Confident and possess knowledge which is power. When a person helps the other side to get what they want, automatically both the parties reach for a win win situation. The negotiating strategy here in this book gears for Niceness, the attitude to let others get what he wants in a deal and gain while in turn, the negotiater succeeds in dealing with the customer. In sectors like Insurance Business, I think 'Convincing' is also another part which the authors might have considered elaborating. However, A good book and a nice handy Guide for all people who want to reach out to their customers and strike the Deal 
 Without a doubt the very best work shorts I have ever owned. I've tried Dickies ( they were too stiff and too tight, even though I bought a size larger than I normally wear ) and Columbia ( they were WAY too expensive .)These shorts are very heavy, but not at all stiff. They wear well and hold up. After being washed several times they will take on a slightly softer color and feel. I buy these literally by the dozen, and wear them everyday. I live in a subtropical climate and even wear these in the winter. They are the perfect work short. Plenty of room, large pockets. A hammer loop, which I never use, but is there if you need one. Not too long, and certainly not too short. These are THE shorts to own. 
 I agree with the other reviewer. It's a shame not too many people realize what a gem this is. It's not just that the songs are good, it's that this type of music is so rare, which is exactly what makes gems so precious.  They don't make'em like this anymore: light, airy, breezy, upbeat & bouncy yet somehow still managing to be mid-tempo, and definitely not too funky. But at the same time soulful & tender and backed by a subtle bass note. Listen to the voice inflections, especially on "You Are My Everything" and you'll know what I mean. The thing is, even when they were makin 'em like this, this music was still rare.   If music's job & attraction is to set(or enhance) a mood then Surface's music is THE perfect complement to a perfect spring day. I never play this music at night as it begs to be the soundtrack to a gorgeous spring day when romance is in the air & when men are gentlemen and ladies can be treated like princesses. When the sun in all its splendor is out & when you're just cruisin'. If there's ever been a spring day when you were just out & about and noticed an incredibly beautiful single gal and on an impulse just bought her some flowers, then this is the music that you set that moment & feeling to 
 This is an incredible book on fibromyalgia written by an MD who actually has the disorder.  In my opinion, it is a "must have" for everybody with FMS, their health care practitioners, and their significant others.  There are so many books out there on fibromyalgia, CFID, related exercise, nutrition, etc. and it's hard to find a book as your primary reference. This is the book, along with Devin's other book "Fibromyalgia & Chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome: A survival Manual".  I was diagnosed 6 years ago after having the disorder for at least 10 years. I have also been an RN for 20 years and have the added benefit of extensive medical knowledge and references. Having Fibromyalgia has taught me that many excellent physicians and specialists are actually clueless on how to help you or point you in the right direction, and are actually poorly educated or misinformed on the disorder!  This book assists and educates both the sufferer and practitioners on the disorder, resources, and how to obtain the best possible care. The chapters are organized and easy to navigate, and include extremely helpful information on legal issues and disability.  There are sections adressed to your other caregivers, including physicians, chiropractors, dentists, physical therapists, and more. Devin actually encourages you to make copies of the pages in her book and give them to your specialists!   This book also includes 47 pages at the end of the book with extensive information on References, Bibliography, Reading Lists, and Resources. This woman has done her research and is not afraid to share her experience and resources.   
 I like that each book in the series is different -- Each book in this series has had it's own themes, and this one's is *intrigue* !  While the first book was all about discovery, and the second expanded it to others, this one everyone is plotting!  Mariam plots to change the world, Old grandmothers manipulate grandchildren, old spies exploit everyone, young men rebel, lower class foment against the rulers, one nation plans war, and the US Government may invade while they intrigue one agency against another....................................    It impressed me that I didn't see these coming though they were made obvious sense afterwards and that they are making for good story  elements, not just gratuitous plots to have plots.   I thought I could see one that Iris is keeping, but it hasn't appeared -- so either I'm wrong or it's yet to come..............................................   These books also share things that I like -- Each book has strong, deep characterization and good dialogue including internal dialogues.  They also seem to go for an intresting start and bang or cliffhanger finish.   And they all have a rich, intricate plot with unexpected paths.  Only a couple of odd bits that didn't seem to fit (in transcripts and a scene with Henryk), and an improbable letter. ...........................................  I'm going to hate waiting for book 4  
 True to the title, this book is full of everyday recipes. I'm not as strict a vegetarian as the book advocates, but I do like to eat light and still enjoy food. Many of the recipes in this book are so easy and speedy, I keep coming back to them for quick weeknight dinners. We like the Haystacks and the no-fat hummus, both a 15-minute deal. I also liked his suggestions for roasting vegetables for sauces instead of sauteing. It adds a nice depth of flavor without fat. This is not a complicated cookbook, but it is very tasty. It definitely fits into a busy person's long-range plan for eating healthfully 
 In this day and age, when there are so many cooking shows that they have their own channel, I remember my far-away youth, when you could choose between Graham Kerr and Julia Child and not much of anyone else . . .  Kerr was the one who always had a glass of wine at his elbow and looked as if he might invite a lucky member of his audience to a bottle party at the local wife-swapper's club.  Julia Child was like the big goofy aunt who got all enthusiastic about things and transmitted that to you.  Between them, I learned to love food (too much) and discovered that cooking, while undeniably work, was also a lot of fun.  And now you too can do it at home.  Lots of beef in wine and sauces with cream and dry white vermouth, many onions and scallions and mushrooms.  The occasional dish you're require to set on fire.  And always more butter.  There are also lots of patient, common-sense instructions on such sticky subjects as folding omlettes, whipping egg whites, and, horror of horrors, making hollandaise sauce from scratch.  In print, as on television, there is Child's supportive, can-do attitude--you ARE going to make mistakes along the way, but a lot of them can be corrected, and with experience, these things will become easier.  Just keep doing.  And follow the technical rules, which are there for a reason.  And after some effort, you can fold an omlette, the egg yolks in the hollandaise don't scramble, and you can even roll up a sponge cake.  The souffles even rise.  Oh, and by the way, only make POT -A-FEU if you are serving an army and have a week to cook it . .  
 Professor Mike is on to something with this book. When you follow your positive emotions, especially Flow, you are following the guidence of the Divine Intelligence that is unfolding the universe. This is a very thought provoking and inspiring book. As a life coach, I see the practical application of Mihaly's work every day. This may be the way to a happier, more harmonious and sustainable future for our planet. Thanks Mike for showing us how to follow our Flow to build a better self and a better world 
 Watching this film of how El Salvador was torn apart from 1980-1992 is something not only Salvadoreans remember, but many people from different countries.  Showing that in this particular Civil War there was really no good or bad side.  A conflict of misunderstanding.  For my parents and many Salvadoreans that migrated here to the United States, definitely the true meaning of trying to find a better life 
 "All the greatest things we know have come from neurotics. It is they and they only who have founded religious groups and created great works of art." So Marcel Proust has a character comment in "Le C?t? de Guermantes", the third novel in his seven-novel masterpiece "Remembrance of Things Past". The orginal French title "A la Recherche du Temps Perdu" is evidently impossible to translate literally, but this English title is the one preferred by the translator C.K Scott Moncrieff. That Proust himself was a neurotic or at least neurasthenic is generally accepted. A chronic invalid, he retired from the world at the age of 35. Living alone and asthmatic, he wrote and wrote and wrote this epic of the Belle Epoque, filling it with complex and contradictory characters. Many are minor, introduced and then never met again, others disappear for hundreds of pages before suddenly re-appearing. The book is written in the first person singular, and in "La Prisonni?re" Proust finally admits that the narrator's Christian name is Marcel. Relationships become complicated, and occasionally the translator will point out to the reader the mistakes that Proust has made in his cross-referencing. A long alphabetical list of characters can be found on line, but prenez garde! the list is full of spoilers. Primarily, the novels reflect the social milieu of the late 19th Century, ending after World War I, the endless matin?es, th?s, and soir?es that figured so importantly in the existence of an indolent class. (It is assumed the narrator is independently wealthy: in "Albertine Disparue" he casually mentions ordering a yacht and a Rolls Royce for Albertine.) In this class the season is spoiled if one is not invited to sit in the Duchesse's box at the theatre and a whole year is ruined if one is snubbed at the Comtesse's afternoon social. Proust descibes these atmospheres in intense and intimate detail, whether it be a quiet street in Combray or a house of ill repute in Paris. Amazingly, the narrator remarks in "Sodome et Gomorrhe": "I have not an observant mind." (Hein!?) It is beginning with "Sodome et Gomorrhe" that the narrator becomes morbidly preoccupied with the homoerotic elements of the French monde and demimonde. After he begins chasing the elusive Albertine, he suspects that she is Sapphic and torments himself that she herself is chasing other girls. (His long courtship of Albertine reflects Swann's courting of the demimondaine Odette in the earlier "Du C?t? de Chez Swann". Gilberte, the daughter of Swann and Odette, has been the narrator's childhood petite amie; and she herself marries the narrator's -- well, yes, it does become labyrinthine.) The long story's most memorable and most mysterious character is the Baron de Charlus, and it is his sudden assignation with the tailor Jupien that alerts the narrator to the Parisian nether world. Charlus becomes involved with a handsome young violinist Charles Morel, a sexual id?e fixe, even for the novel's most macho character. All this distresses the narrator exceedingly (one begins to suspect he doth protest too much) and he takes a moralistic tone. However, it is the narrator who, in "Albertine Disparue", picks up a little girl off the street and takes her home, an indiscretion which earns him a visit from the S?ret?. As for Charlus, he goes from being one of Odette's early "sponsors" to being willingly whipped by mercenary stable boys. These changes would strain the imagination except that they happen over hundreds of pages; and, of course, Proust has a strong sense of psychological development, be it a major character like Albertine or a minor character like Aim?, the headwaiter at Balbec, who serves table in a Parisian restaurant with a "modest brilliance", causing an argument between Saint-Loup and his mistress. Throughout the quiet turmoil of these various stories, the reader is fascinated. He turns page after unindented page, nothing much happens, and yet he keeps on reading. Admirers of W Somerset Maugham will realize here that I'm paraphrasing Maugham's remarks on Jane Austen in his great essay on "Pride and Prejudice", and there's a surprising resemblance between Austen and Proust. Would I read "Remembrance of Things Past" again? Not the way I did this time, but I enjoy re-reading sections here and there, a dinner at the Verdurins or the narrator's visit to Venice. "Remembrance of Things Past" is a world in itself, a world every serious reader should explore. Unfortunately, I have learned that Amazon.com cannot handle French accent marks, so we're left with lots of question marks. And I thought this was an international forum.         
 I just started reading John Grisham books and find them to be exciting and hard to put down 
  . . . as readers of my reviews have probably figured out.  I have been familiar with this book for many years, but only recently have I taken the time to sit down and read it through.  "Born Again" is an honest and forthright admission of sinfulness and forgiveness, tracing Mr. Colson's path through Watergate and prison to the freedom in Christ he now enjoys.  To the best of my recollection, this is the first book to be published by one of the "Watergate figures".  Magruder's book came out shortly afterward, and Haldeman wrote two (contradictory) books on the subject.  I wonder if the Charles Colson of 2005 would view the events of 1972-1974 as the Charles Colson of 1976 did.  I wonder if he would have made some of the same choices now as he did as a brand-new Christian (with a great deal of guilt on his conscience).  Regardless, both as an "insider's account" of the Nixon White House, and as a testimony of how Christ can change a life, "Born Again" is definitely worth a read 
 This album is very interesting because some of the songs are really good and others are either ok or not good. The songs that are good are "New Power Soul", "Freaks on this Side", "Come On", "When you love Somebody", and "I like Funky Music." These are just good funk/soul tunes that any fan of Soul and Funk would like. One more song that is good but kind of questionable is the song "Mad Sex". It's questionable because of the title. I mean the title is somewhat of a "Controversy". But, it is a good tune just heads up on the song from a lyric perspective. So Give it a listen, but if you say "I like it but the words are a little bad" Don't worry thats ok. There are still five other good songs. So this album over and out is an eight out of ten on scale of one out of ten. But perhaps the most interesting part of the album is the fact that Chaka Khan sings background vocals for the album. She does a good job. So, if you like Chaka Khan and her music, you should definantly give this album a good listen. Trust me, you'll be surprised 
 I regularly wear suits and semi-casual dress in my profession, but there were many things I learned from this little book.  The dust jacket of this volume says, "What to wear, when to wear it, how to wear it."  Those three comments pretty much summarize the contents.  This title is well-worth the price paid 
 I have the movie and just about worn it out watching it over and over. It is funny in spots as well as heart warming.  He is so shy and charming. I am a very big fan of George Strait. He is #1 in my book. I feel he should again be an academy award winner.George IS Texas!!! Texaslib, Lewisville, T 
 This novel is certainly in the top 100  ever written. James explores the nuances of thought and emotion in a way that no other writer before or since has mastered. A charming plot, that of young Isabel Archer, an American heiress, off to seek her destiny in Europe, and the romances and troules that befall her. You have to read this book to understand the depth of understanding this writer is able to reach 
 I had seen this movie a couple of years ago and I have always wanted to see it since. I bought it finally and I'd have to say that I liked it alot more the first time, and it is not a movie I can watch "over and over"   This movie is very dark, and there are alot of subtle funny parts to it. The cinematography is beautiful, and the children in the movie are superb actors. I suggest this movie if you don't mind subtitles and you have an open mind and a good sense of humor. If you like this movie you should also see Delicatessen

 This is pure Dusty Springfield - some of her best hits. It brings back those memories of carefree youth 
 Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Norte Dame is majestic in its descriptions of the medieval settings within France, albeit at times it becomes a bit lengthy and tedious when wanting to get to the next segment of the story. For instance, there is approximately a 30 page description of the interior cathedral of Notre Dame and the surrounding areas. While this introduces us to some of the background of Paris' settings, it is a bit cumbersome to get through. Overall, however, Hugo's ability to bring characters-their faults, personalities, weaknesses, and human emotions-to life certainly makes this a great work of fiction.   The main characters within the novel are Quasimodo, a deformed hunchback with only one eye: many of the people associate him with evil because of his deformities, yet he represents both good characteristics as well. Claude Frollo is the archbishop who looks over and cares for Quasimodo at the Norte Dame cathedral. Frollo is a tragic character mainly because of his fall from grace, from good to bad because of his own desires and his own resistance into temptation, he slowly fades and loses grip with humanity and goodness. Esmeralda is a gypsy dancer that captivates the attention of many of the people in the city, both for good and sinister reasons. She owns a goat, Dhali, and her and her pet become an issue to the people who view gypsies as being evil, especially because of her goat's ability to do "magic" tricks. Lastly, there is Phoebus, a man who Esmeralda becomes enchanted with after he saves her from peril. Although handsome, he is more materialistic and shallow.    For the most part the story was compelling, and the pace of the story really picks up towards the end of the novel. If you go into the novel expecting it to be like the films that have attempted to portray the story of Quasimodo, you may be surprised and/or disappointed. Hugo's knack is to write a novel with great emotion and to depict a true vision of human tendencies and behaviors, yet this novel is definitely somber in tone and many of the events in the book are different from the popular films. While some may question the coincidences within the novel's plot, this is a work that is magnified and becomes essentially bigger when you take all of its parts and put them together.

 Picture a handsome leather-bound volume with a column of attractively-set Hebrew text on the right side of each page and a superb English translation in very readable typeset on the left side. This is what you get in the two leather-bound versions of the 1999 Hebrew-English Bible published by the Jewish Publication Society. I own the large version for reading at home and a handly but vision-challenging small version for the road. I travel a lot and it goes with me on many of those trips.   If you want a less elegantly bound paperback version, you can have that too. In terms of its size, it's midway between the two leather-bound Bibles I've mentioned. Size does matter, as it is eminently more readable for most eyes than the small handbook version.  When the JPS set out to prepare this edition of the Tanakh, it assembled a cast of Jewish luminaries in biblical studies. They chose to go for pretty full disclosure with regards to the many translation difficulties that the Hebrew Bible throws at its readers. Ample footnotes draw the readers attention to these.  A well-written preface tells the story of the traditional text ('Massoretic' or 'Masoretic Text').   This reviewer is a biblical scholar, though not a Jewish one. As such, I'm well aware of the problems created by traditional and biblical literary in the Jewish community today. This version of the Tanakh should make a welcome contribution to resolution of that ailment. Meanwhile, non-Jewish readers like me will read gratefully over the shoulders of the Jewish Publication Society's intended readership 
 The elusive behavior of those golden years better known as the sweet bird of youth is depicted with a reality sense and certain melodrama touch .  The early years between Tea , Sam and Coles are frenetic rapture. And the triangle works out till the time comes for them.  Ten years pass away : Coles has found Claire ; Tea is happily married and is owner of a beautiful restaurant and Sam still has not found her bliss . From here to there she has walked in mirror circles.  Casually there will be a reencounter among Coles and Sam. And certainly they will revive their past and furious sexual meetings. But somehow this spell does not work out.  The ancient emotive memories still permeates the soul of Coles. He definitively has not grown up and still pretends to play in two stages. He like Narcissus, only loves himself and the rest of his affairs work out as a secure support for his disastrous self stem.  As you know, the domain in love falls back in whom loves less. But this last experience with Venus will define for Sam a crucial cross road. Coles still has not learned anything about the sensible difference between the sex by itself and the love as a whole.  The film bets hard but the wager did not go far beyond the door of the dark room. Somehow this film remitted me to a much more mature work in the last eighties: The woman in flames.  Something happened with this movie in which you can feel the ending is not absolutely natural. It seems after you decided to break the rules, you insisted in going back obeying the moral principles instead of walking to the tragic consequences, because I think this picture had all the basic ingredients for a moral fable but also a tragic ending: was there fear perhaps to follow this road?           Good performances specially of Mark Ruffalo. Excellent camera work and memorable angles shots with perfect illuminating. Interesting plot but it promised much more than what it offered.  
 The poem of 'Piers the Ploughman' is often considered to be anonymously composed, as the name William Langland was less an authorial designation as it was an inscription on the back of a manuscript - it would be as if I would be assigned the authorship of the O.E.D. because, in some future time, the only remaining copy was missing the title pages, but still had the hard-cover with my 'ex libris' impression on it. Be that as it may, Langland is considered at least as likely an author as any other, and becomes a sort of stand-in, an 'everyman' for his time period. A few details of this Langland are known - he was a wanderer, a constant reviser (the poem goes through several revisions that scholars have designated as texts A, B, and C (and some argue for Z). This is not a spiritual autobiography, as J.F. Goodridge states in an essay about Langland in another edition, but there are no doubt autobiographical elements in the text. That the lead character is named 'Will' helps in this identification.   This poem stands alongside Chaucer's 'Canterbury Tales' as one of the great products of Middle English; this also has the character of being a different sort of Middle English than Chaucer's more courtly, continental influenced variety. Thus, it gives breadth to the history of the English language. Langland is often ranked as a great English poet on a par with Spenser, Milton, Wordsworth and Yeats, as representative of his age both in topics as well as language facility.   This epic poem deals with themes familiar for the time - like Dante and Milton, Langland deals with the grand ideas of the meaning of life and the destiny of humankind. However, unlike Dante and Milton, Will and Piers the Ploughman do not go through a mystical, otherworldly adventure or journey, but rather stays rooted to the earth. These are dream sequences, but these too need not be otherworldly - they are things that can happen to every person. The ideas of the seven deadly sins, the virtues, the church, and the images of heaven and hell are very much rooted to regular society images of the same. The discussion of the allegorical characters, aptly named Do-Well, Do-Better, and Do-Best, does much for the moral teaching of this poem, which would have been of primary concern to the author.   Langland's text is often more Old English than Chaucerian in ways. It is far more alliterative, a strong component taken from Old English. Also, it is less metrical in rhythm than Chaucer - there is a pause in each line akin to older English poetry, but the metre is less secure.   This translation is done in alliterative verse by E. Talbot Donaldson (the 'E' stands for the very olde Englishe sounding name of Ethelbert).  There are notes, essays and other helpful material provided by Elizabeth Kirk and Judith Anderson.   There are over 50 non-related texts of the poem that have survived the Middle Ages, that vary from minor to major changes throughout. Reconciling these is rather like attempting to reconcile the gospels of the Bible, and then adding to that task the discovery of other non-canonical gospels. It leads to rich discussion, but less agreement.   The introductory material helps set the stage for reading, and the appendix gives a more thorough development of 'The Dreamer' from the C text.    Perhaps one of the reasons I like this text so much is that the persons involved were known to me, or friends of friends.  Donaldson was the founding editor of 'The Norton Anthology of English Literature', a broad, wide-ranging text.  However, it was 'Piers Plowman' that was to be a continuing favourite study for him.   This is one of the classics of English literature, perhaps the least known among them. 
 As anyone who knows me, knows that I love prison films (Escape From Alcatraz, Birdman of Alcatraz, The Shawshank Redemption) and TV shows (Oz.) This is no exception. Tom Selleck is very good as a man framed by two inept and corrupt cops (including David Rasche, in a 180-degree turn from his Sledge Hammer character.) Laila Robins is wonderful as his wife, who stands by him through thick and thin. Well worth a rental, or even a buy, as the DVD is priced very low 
 This book is a classic. I would recommend it to long-time Christians as well as new Christians or those wanting to explore the basic components of the Christian faith.   Lewis is humble, positive and writes a hopeful and uplifting book. There are a few comments that show some biases of the time in which it was written, but looking at the big picture this book is excellent.   Of course, there will always be those who criticize the logic of Lewis' book and I just do not understand the obsession with trying to prove to people of faith that they are wrong, unenlightened, uninformed. On the contrary, I think Lewis book shows that Christianity is not for blind followers but for people who are ready to be challenged each day. 
 especially if you're new to Greek, or are somewhat intimidated by Homer.  Any student studying The Iliad should have a copy of this to help them keep the families and factions in order.  However - if you're already familiar with Greek and/or Homer, this won't provide you with much info that you don't already know.  I would think the student would benefit the most from this 
 This is a real page turner, and that's really saying something considering that this book is hella long.  Clavel is a real student Hong Kong high society, and it is fascinating to watch the Anglo Ian Dunross navigate his way through the Asian way, the mini series of this book is exceptional, I saw it as a kid, and I remember how much I wanted to be Pierce Brosnan, nobody could have inbodied Dunross like Brosnan.  If you enjoy a good read and love learning about a different culture then you will love this book, but be forewarned, is is LONG, and be sure to pick up the mini series it is a wonderful compliment to the book 
 The problem with this movie and its poor reviews is tat it's being reviewed by the wrong people. This movie is absolutely not for people who watch the Academy Awards or go to arthouse film festivals. This movie is sleazy, campy and cheesy.   It's a hybrid of the classic stoner comedy and the slasher flick genres. Think Dude, Where's My Car? meets Evil Dead. The plot is expendable, but the the dialogue is well written for the characters and the humor is funny more often than not.   In addition to the humor, there is some good blood effects. Really, this is a well executed horror/comedy. If you're under the age of 25 and appreciate camp, this film is for you. 
 Wow. Eichman and Heydrich calmy discussing the fate of millions over a buffet business meeting. One could not imagine how could this be possible but it actually happened in less than 2 hours! Chilling in detail, horrifying in content, The fate of Europe's jews were decided in an almost casual, cold detached business-like manner. The acting was superb. If you are interested in the Third Reich or a serious student of History this dvd is for you 
 David Gascoyne's classsic text of 1935 was the first comprehensive work on Surrealism to be published in English. His membership of the Surrealist movement and his association with its leading members - among them Andre Breton, Paul Eluard, Mac Ernst, and Salvador Dali - placed him in an ideal position to witness and record the development and significance of its foremost writers and artists. David Gascoyne lived in France in 1937-39, 1947-8 and 1953-64, during which time he became one of the most distinguished of British poets and translators. He now lives on the Isle of Wight. --- from book's back cove 
 The best thing about Case Histories is that it is not a murder mystery. Kate Atkinson's novel has many of the characteristics of a traditional murder mystery - sympathetic gumshoe, unsolved crimes, supernumerary suspects, and cats - but the story is more a study of the confusion inherent in the innocent interactions of sisters and daughters.   I was pleased by the lifelike, sympathetic presentation of the two male characters. Unfortunately the many female characters never lifted off the page.   The plot of Case Histories consists of three unrelated cold cases. All the dramatic tension of the book consists of the promise that these cases will be connected by their resolution. But this resolution fails to materialize. The detective solves one murder, the perpetrator casually confesses to a second, and the third is disclosed only in an anonymous flashback. And the cats live happily ever after 
 I bought this book ar EMS in Boston in 1973 when I first started backpacking. the priciples he teaches this book still hold true today. I strongly recomend this book to any novice backpackers, along with Karen Berger's new Hiking and Backpacking. My grandson is learning and enjoying from this edition now. This book is timeless. It is a must read 
 This book was just wonderful.  It was a perfect addition to what has been a great series so far!  The characters are true to life and help you to better understand yourself through them 
 I love this CD! Wanda Jackson does rockabilly like no one else can! Such excitement and twang it's absolutely the best I ever heard! I cannot believe you can buy it for this price! Just get it, now! Rock on Wanda!!! You blew me away with this CD! You are Great!  
 "From These Ashes" is a collection of speculative fiction written by Fredric Brown and published between 1941 and 1965.  Fredric Brown (1906 - 1972) achieved acclaim in mystery and speculative fiction writing.  Over the course of his career he became a master of the vignette, which he was able to write in several genres including fantasy, horror, and science fiction.  This collection was published in February of 2001.  The weakness of this collection is in the editing.  The stories are supposedly grouped by year of their first publication, but there are several cases where they are incorrect, for example "The Joke" is put in the 1961 section, but it was actually first published in October of 1948 under the title "If Looks Could Kill".  They also do not include any information regarding the publishing history of the stories.  Many of the stories have had multiple titles over the course of their publishing history, but alternate titles are not listed.  Despite the subtitle "The Complete Short SF of Fredric Brown", the Editor's Notes at the back indicate that at least two stories were omitted because they were later rewritten in the form of a novel.  There is a good Introduction by Barry N. Malzberg, which would be the highlight of the added material.  The most important measure of a collection is the stories themselves, and in that regard there is no complaint.  While few of Fredric Brown's stories have received any attention in terms of awards or even in fan polls, there are many excellent stories here which have been long overlooked.  The best known story is the novelette "'Arena'", which was the basis for the Star Trek (Original Series) episode of the same name.  It was tied for 35th on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll in 1971 for short fiction, and tied for 34th on the 1999 Locus All-Time Poll for novelettes.  The short story "The Waveries" was nominated for the Retro Hugo for the year 1945 in 1996, as was the Novelette "Pi in the Sky".    Eight of the stories are collaborations with Mack Reynolds, and there is also the wonderful "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik" which he collaborated with Carl Onspaugh.  Then there are the more than 50 vignettes, which are often overlooked when it comes to awards.  All in all there are well over 100 pieces included, and on many of them the reader gets the feel of his mysteries as well as speculative fiction 
 When originally published in 1986, it was groundbreaking; it's still worth reading, though there are similar books now (Daniel Meckel & Robert Moore's "Self Liberation: The Jung-Buddhist Dialogue" & others on Western Psychology & Buddhism [See my draft listmania]).  Here the author effectively demonstrates many similarities/parallels between Jung's works & Vajrayana, but not Mahamudra/Dzogchen (MM/Dz).  She provides an introduction to each system-with interesting observations- p. 6: quoting Nancy Wilson Ross, Buddhism: A Way of Life and Thought (NY: Vintage, 1981) p. 44, "It has been said that [Hinayana] emphasizes the humanity of the Buddha; Mahayana emphasizes the Buddha nature of humanity." p. 17: "According to one author [S. B. Dasgupta, An Introduction to Tantric Buddhism, University of Calcutta, 1974, p. 54] there was no one particular person who introduced tantra into Buddhism at any particular time, but rather that it has been gradually incorporated in the course of centuries.  The same author maintains that there are no fundamental differences between Hindu and Buddhist tantras [p. 145]."  Others disagree, stating "it was crystallized into a definitive form by the 3rd century" CE & that there are fundamental differences especially in the definition of yab-yum. p. 21: "On the path toward freedom any passion and desire must be utilized and transformed into wisdom.  This is a very basic principle of any Tantric practice.  In this respect it is similar to homeopathy, working on the principle that like cures like.  The very same element that causes a disease may if applied in a proper dose act as an antidote and a cure."  She then compares the methodologies, archetypal symbols, similarities/differences including--Tara, Vajrayogini vs. Jung's Anima, Book of the Dead, bliss vs. suffering, attachment, cultural differences, dangers, Buddhahood vs. individuation, compassion, & synchronicity.  For example, she claims that Tibetans coming west was not coincidence but a synchronistic event.  I agree with the vast majority of her assertions.  However, since p. 102: "Jung claims he does not make philosophical or metaphysical statements and that his work is based on empirical evidence only," it seems likely that Jung's limitations of individuation vs. Buddhahood were due to his lack of empirical observation of a Buddha.  So, this distinction may be illusory.  Further, despite his Thinker orientation, Jung's lack of compassion may be overstated considering his guidance to therapists regarding empathy during individual dyadic relationships with clients vs. the application of theory.  Also, many (e.g. Bhikshuni Lekshe Tsomo) have commented upon the effects on Buddhism in new countries-now starting to manifest in the West.  Some psychological differences were shown in Bhikshuni Thubten Chodron's "Blossoms of the Dharma"- p. 144: "Feelings of low self-esteem and inadequacy are prevalent in Westerners...Tibetans do not have words in their language for low self-esteem or guilt, so Westerners' problems with these feelings are not readily comprehensible to them.  His Holiness had difficulty understanding how someone could not like himself.  He looked around this room of educated, successful people and asked, `Who feels low self-esteem?'  Everyone looked at each other and replied, `We all do.'  His Holiness was shocked."  Also, Bhikshuni Wendy Finster (a clinical psychologist from Australia) p. 158 "Only enlightened persons are totally mentally healthy."  She speaks to sangha dangers, responsibilities, & cultural differences and says: p. 166: [not meeting one's expectations] "causes us to judge ourselves harshly and feel guilty, and as a result our self-esteem plummets.  This surprises our Asian teachers; they do not realize the level of self-criticism and self-hatred that can arise in individuals raised in our culture."  This view does not conflict with Jung's warning about going native with Eastern religions.  Nevertheless, Moacanin argues convincingly for adoption from the East: pp. 104-5: "Eastern symbols are fresh to the Western mind and therefore possess a greater capacity to inspire and stimulate the imagination, while unfortunately for many in the West our symbols have become ossified and thus have lost their intrinsic meaning."  Since she states p. 47: "Concepts are instruments of protection from experience" which reflects deep similarities in the 2 systems (& MM/Dz), it remains to be seen how the 2 will interact in the future.  Still, archetypal symbols are universal.  Thus, the 4-sided deity mandalas of Vajrayana and their Mt. Meru surrounded by 4 continents do not significantly differ from John Weir Perry's "Lord of the 4 Quarters."  
 In this book, Heider guides the reader down the long path to enlightened  leadership. Leadership is not about manipulation or command and control,  says Heider; the leader should at most be a catalyst for what the group  should come up with themselves. Interesting stuff. The gold nuggets of  wisdom that Heider gives in this book are reason enough to buy it, even if  you are not a leader. It goes without saying that Taoism encompasses much  more than mere leadership and I finished the book wanting to know more  about Taoism. My one criticism of this book is that it is not for  everybody.  What Heider purports, essentially, is a very specific,  idealised form of leadership (in real life, you have to learn to have a  forceful presence, not just be wise and harmonious).  But if this sounds  like your type of book, then buy it, along with Max Depree's Leadership Is  An Art 
 A fine picture about life in a small Texas town. Easily a classic if they would give the added footage back to the directo 
  It's hard to imagine another book being any better than this one on the subject of the sinking of the U.S.S Indianapolis. It is very well researched and very well written. After reading this book I'll never look at "having a bad day" the same way again. What these men went thru is absolutely shocking and horrific to say the least.     If you are interested in this story look no further. This is THE book to have 
 The presumption and arrogance of Hegel's philosophical enterprise is apparent. A powerful and profound thinker he believes that he understands all. It is thesis- antithesis - synthesis and that synthesis is new thesis - antithesis - synthesis. And this logic of mind is the logic of history. And it is all coming to climax in the nineteenth century Germany  Hegel is living in.   The method of course leads to Marx. Two dialectic dummies.  The 'system' is of course opposed by Kierkegaard who wants real life in his philosophy and not ' system' and ' endless abstraction'.  The world actual history with all its surprising turns and new developments simply makes a joke of the Hegelian analysis. Technical reality gives far too much to our world to take someone like Hegel who could not possibly have understood it as its leader.  We still have the idea of development today. We still too need real and deep thinkers.  But Hegel is outmoded, gone without the tools to help us contend with what we are contending. 
 This book is a GREAT tool for making your house a home. It's loaded with tips and basic principles that will improve any room. Decorating Small Spaces teaches its reader the "rules" and then actually shows how to break them with style. For instance deep colors on the wall of a small room might actually make it seem larger because the walls appear to recede.  Starting with basic principles-color, furniture placement, storage, etc-the book then goes room-by-room showing how those principles can work. There are pictures to exemplify these principles on almost every page.   This book won't show you how to organize a kitchen drawer or books on a shelf, but it will show you how to arrange everything in a room to make the room more spacious.  I highly recommend this book. It has helped me transform my awkward small condo into a beautiful & livable home 
 Hidden Records confounded this reviewer because the book is so poorly written -- yet demands attention. The writing is full of mispelled words, lousy grammar, and poor construction. Normally I would never recommend such a book; however, I am pleased to make an exception in this case, because the content is absolutely riveting.  If Wayne Herschel's ideas about Giza, Abusir, Tikal, Teotihuacan, Angkor, and Stonehenge turn out to be correct, he will have pulled an amazing coup: proving that you don't need to own a PhD, in fact, don't even need to be able to write, in order to make an important contribution.   The author makes a persuasive case for the central role of the Pleiades, the seven sisters, to the ancient world. I was especially impressed with Herschel's discovery of a scaling rule which, if true, establishes the pyramids of Abusir as even more important than the better known pyramids of Giza. He quite convincingly shows that the leg of the Bull, the central astronomical symbol in the zodiac of Denderah, refers to the Pleiades -- rather than to the Dipper, the standard interpretation. His decipherment of a related star map at Cydonia, on Mars, is nothing less than mindboggling.  Astronomers should point their sophisticated telescopes and hardware in the direction of Herschel's mystery star to prove or disprove his theories. And let's get on with it. We need answers now! The story of human origins has languished in the dark for too long 
 I have used this product daily since 1984 and it is worth every cent.  Do not, however, mistake this for a moisturizer.  That it is not.  But it seems to seal in the moisture on your face, and creates a smooth surface for the moisturizer to stay on.  I was told it was not recommended for the eye region, however that's where I use it regularly, and I have a minimum of fine lines & crows feet for my age.  Use it drop by drop.  A little goes a long way!  Follow with a good moisturizer 
 My husband, son, and I just got back from Disney World a few weeks ago. We planned the trip in just a month's time, and WDW guides were very helpful!  The first two guides we bought were the Birnbaum's 2006 Official Guide and the Birnbaum's 2006 guide for kids. Because these are official books, no drawbacks or negatives are discussed. However, at 273 pages, there's a lot of great basic information on WDW.  For example, this particular guide features lots of colorful pictures on its glossy pages, as well as descriptions. It's an excellent guide for first timers who don't know what to expect and want to pore over the book in anticipation!  In addition to describing attractions, shows, restaurants, and hotels, the Birnbaum 2006 guide to WDW provides several charts--such as the Walt Disney Resort Finder. A picture of each resort is displayed, as well as information on location, setting/theme, what types of people favor a particular resort (e.g. honeymooners, families, conventioneers, etc.), amenities, and more.  The Disney Dining Plan is also described, as is Disney's Magical Express Service. There are directions to getting to the parks from the Orlando International Airport (MCO), the average temperatures and rainfall for every month, park hours, admission prices, new attractions, most/least crowded times and so on.  I found the maps to be especially helpful, and tore them out to use when we went to each of the parks. The WDW Birnbaum guide is a great book for first timers, but I would also get the Unofficial Guide to WDW, as well--especially if you're the type that counts pennies and enjoys strategizing. However, the Birnbaum guide is replete with solid information, great pictures, helpful maps, and feel-good enthusiasm. It's a gerat primer for getting into the Disney spirit 
 This book thoroughly covers the vast line of Matchbox Diecast from its early begiinings as Lesney and the regular wheeled vehicles up to the present just before Mattel procured Matchbox.  It is accurate,  comprehensive, and well thought out.  The photography is excellent, much  better than Charles Mack's earlier books.  Pricing is optimistic but  because this book is the foremost authority of Matchbox I believe  dealer/retail prices are based on the information herewith.  An excellent  resource for any serious collector 
 With trading book reviews, it's always easy to see who made money and who didn't based on the ratings.  Bill's book talks a lot about chaos theory and fractals but it all boils down to a simple way to enter a trend. If you look at it from that perspective, this is a great book. Personally, I use a mix of Gann and Hurst and I've added Bill's ideas to my trading as a means of adding to my positions. It's been working out great for me.  If your looking for an in depth look at the chaos theory or a holy grail trading system, this isn't the book for you. However, if you're looking for a book that presents ideas that you can add to your own personal trading strategy then this book may suit you. 
 Once she had wisely decided to stop collaborating with the odious Mr Mathers, Dido showed to the world what a great singer songwriter she is. One day I hope to go to one of her concerts and meet her backstage afterwards to tell her how good her singing is 
 This team has put together a comprehensive collection on a topic that is so hard to keep up with.  The reader can take in as little or as much as needed.  "Distributed Simulation" is a good reference and  important reading for anyone in the field 
 THis was definately one of his best, to go along with Odd series and Dragon Tears, as well as a few others.  A must read if you've even heard the man's name 
 The book is a high level one and presents the new techniques and advances in the production of advanced inorganic materials trough new routes. It has very important data. It is an important tool for chemical and materials engineers 
 The author's general hypothesis for this book is the importance of the first two years of life (including in utero) to child development, and how when a combination of factors are combined, it is easy to predict that a child will turn to violence.  A fascinating book that is well-researched.  I was able to understand the importance that the first two years of life have for a child, and how a baby deprived of love and the essentials for emotional and physical growth can be affected for the rest of their life by this time.  If you're a parent and you're interested by this book, also check out "Our Babies, Ourselves".  If you're looking for a book on how your child, raised in a happy and functional home, can avoid violence, this is probably not it.  But if you read in the papers about children who carry guns to school and wonder why it happens, you're barking up the right alley.  : 
 This is a particular spy novel. If you are looking for action you will be satisfied. Neverless I remeber Berlin in 1983 and later from two sides of the famous wall. Lot of those specific atmosphere of divided city can be  find in the trilogy. The book is really worth reading for that reason 
 Vera B. Williams is a genius at taping the wonderful world of a child and has written an excellent, gentle, and engaging book for first read-alongs. Our whole family adores this pass-along treasure, and my daughter now reads it to our little boy.  Like more and more Americans, we are a mixed race family, but we often have a hard time finding books that reflect our normalcy. Thank God we had this book for our children, which shows a white Grandmother with a black granddaughter, a white man and a white little boy, and an Asian Mommy with her little girl. For the longest time, mercifully, our children thought these were stories about the same family, since this world in miniature reflects their own in real life. Thanks you, Vera Williams.  The illustrations are a little hard to get used to, as they are mixed media and `lost wax' crayon, where surface colors are scratched away to reveal base colors below. My children and I instantly loved them, as they look like our own smeary results when we work on something together. Still, many unfamiliar with the technique would assume the art is unfinished or poor quality, but I assure you your children will love them.  The stories themselves are awkward if you are trying to read them as narrative, but you must carefully listen for the scansion, for Vera Williams has a wonderful ear for rhythm of a few simple words and the common skill of repetition that help children engage with words, and therefore their world.  The form of three is the dominant construct in this work. Three stories, three children, three adults, three relationships, and three repetitions of the actions, and three cries of "more, more, more."  This is an excellent first-words first-stories book, which will nonetheless always prove to be a memorable favorite for your older children. I cannot recommend it enough 
 Excellent group of short stories about life after WWII in Japan.  It grasps the pain, suffering, and despair of the people of Japan.  Some were all out for the war and still after the war but many were ashamed of be led astray by their leadership.  If you love short stories then this is a very good collection.  The way she descibes the scenary with vividness is extraordinary 
 This book remains pioneering and a true one and only. It is as valuable today as it was when it was first published over 100 years ago and will remain valuable for many, many, many years to come, despite the fact that some of the author's views and information is clearly dated. (What sacred work isn't?) The message is timeless and I actually find the dated quality to be part of it's charm; bringing us back to inspiring days at the forefront of modern science, technology, and modern thought, and the days when Darwin's works were still seen as quite new.  What is most unique about this book is the author's illuminating and still modern approach; psychological, analytical and scientific, -we feel we can understand him in plain English and without blind faith or obedience- yet fused with the most inspiring mysticism the world has ever known or seen. The result is simply, that he gets his magnificent point and theory across with inspiring, vivid clarity and the implications are quite astounding to the reader if not wholly awesome. Indeed, the picture that this book creates is much greater than the sum it's parts.  Don't be fooled by the fact that the title "Cosmic Consciousness"(the term the book itself coined) has been swooped up through the years by weirdo's, kooks and new age charlatans. This is NOT that. Nor is it some cold, "rational" and "scientific" look at spirituality that will leave you doubting, depressed and without meaning.  This book and what it can still teach is truly a work of divinity - or at least inspired truly by it to an educated, esteemed doctor, but altogether ordinary man. (You don't feel you are being talked down to, more like listening to your very smart friend.) The only sad thing is that the author's own experience of cosmic consciousness is mentioned only briefly in the opening notes. What else might he have been able to tell us if he had not died so soon after it was published? I believe surely he would have continued his work. Also sad, is that many of his "lesser, imperfect and doubtful" cases are named only with initials (J.B.B. etc.) -to protect their identities as they were still living. What else might we also have learned knowing more about these people? Or what contributions have they already made that we do not realize?  Once again I will say it, one feels Bucke's work should and/or could be updated, revised, or continued to the current day . . . but maybe that's not the point, because what it will give you despite all that is truly divine.  P.S. Yes, I myself have had experiences of `cosmic consciousness.' 
 This is an excellent reference book for administrative professionals in all aspects of their career.  From the simple topics of filing and typing, to refresher English and composition, how to research business software, sample correspondence for various purposes, and many, many more topics.  Very helpful publication 
 I am the father of a high school junior. This book was recommended by my son's guidance counselor. She told my wife and I that she wished she had written it, because it had great advice and a way of taking the terrifying edge off the college admissions process. This book makes you -- and your kids --  remember what is really important, and helps them express who they really are in their applications, without the kind of hype that all the admissions officers have been on to for years. It is not only wise but refreshingly funny. a must-have for any family with a college-bound kid 
 Broken English is such an inspirational compilation. I find it more cohesive than Kale's previous "Liberation" although I personally prefer the beats of Liberation for kickin it or a running mix.    Highly recommend getting both CDs and put the mix on Random.  I have kept these two CDs in my car the last month and can't get enough!  The beats and grooves work first thing in the morning, or while stuck in the traffic gridlock on the way home -- I catch other drivers smiling at me moving with the beat in bumper-to-bumper 
 Whether you are a jazz, blues, R&B or rock musician, T.O.P. has something to offer everyone.  Back when I was playing trumpet in in College and local bands, T.O.P. was more than just a music group....it was a religion! If you like a 400 Horsepower Band with the horn section as the engine, then check out this collection.  Truly one of the alltime greatest fusion bands ever.  I have several T.O.P. CDs, but if I were to buy only one, this would be it 
 I just bought this camcorder and find it so easy to use and the best feature for me is the fact that you can view your videos on your dvd player so easily!!  I am not interested in dowloading the videos on my computer or editing them as some other reviewers mentioned, so it's perfect for me.  I just want to capture my kids in motion and am not looking to create a "perfect" movie of my kids.  I strongly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great product which is very easy to use 
 This book is about the humor of taking things literally. Amelia Bedelia goes from job to job making mistakes because she does things so literally. Once, she saw a sign on a dress shop that said HELP WANTED. She went in and the store owner asked could she sew and Amelia say yes that she was handy with a needle. The owner showed her some dresses that had been marked and asked Amelia to shorten them. Amelia looked at the dresses and said "I don't need to sew to do this". She took out her scissors and shortened the dresses where they were marked. The store owner got mad and told her to leave 
 For those just getting into Jazz or just need a refresher course this is a great CD. I brought it for my husband who is a big Jazz fan and he just loves it and gets alot of use out of them. 
 In Richmond, Virginia, someone brutally slashes to death historical romance writer Beryl Madison in the woman's home.  The crime scene evidence points towards the victim knowing her killer as no forced entry appears.  In fact she seems to have let the culprit into her home though she feared an unknown assailant threatened to kill her, which is why she cut short her Key West trip.  State medical examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta also investigates other seemingly related deaths; that of writer Cary Harper and the suicide of his sister.  Meanwhile, the FBI is looking into the activities of Madison's lawyer though Scarpetta cannot see the link to her case though she believes there must be one.  As she follows the forensic clues in Virginia and Florida, someone threatens to kill Scarpetta.  However, the courageous M.E. refuses to back down from uncovering the truth behind the Madison murder and the related deaths of the Harper siblings.  This early Scarpetta thriller is one of the best forensic tales written in the past decade or two, as the heroine works a difficult case with intelligence and aplomb while the readers obtain deep insight into the working of a medical examiner.  The action-packed story line grips the audience from the moment the culprit slices and dices the writer and never slows down as Scarpetta and her team seeks clues to identify the killer.  Patricia Cornwell, who has written a myriad of terrific thrillers, may have written her best with the powerful entertaining BODY OF EVIDENCE that holds up as a top gun in spite a rash of imitators on TV and literatures.

 Brockman always comes through.  Fast-paced, action oriented stuff with some great emotion thrown in.  The characters are alive and multi-faceted.  No cardboard cutout heros or heroines here 
 1)Saliva - I Walk Alone (Batista) This song is good. It's way better than what we hear on TV. Fits Batista well. 8/10  2)Mercy Drive - Burn In My Light (Randy Orton) AWESOME!! My favorite song. It fits Randy well, and is a great song by itself. And finally we get the full version, rather than the shortened one on TV. 10/10  3)Homebwoi - Hard Hittin' (Coach) Bad, i hate it. It doesnt fit Coaches character. He is never on TV anyway. 2/10   4)Brand New Sin - Crank It Up (Big Show) Similar to his old theme- but better. It doesn't do anything for me, but I suppose it's ok, it of course fits Show. 6/10  5)Desiree Jackson - Holla (Candice)I've never even listened to the whole one- I don't want to. Its a little creepy actually! I reallly wanted Candice's current theme to be on here. Kelly Kelly used this at SNME, so maybe it's hers now- hopefully!3/10  6)Eleventh Hour - A Girl Like That (Torrie Wilson) I love this song!! It;s catchy, and fits Torrie well. I thought Need A Little Time was the best, but after listening to this, A Girl Like That is much better.This song is awesome! 10/10  7)Kaballon - Quien Soy Yo (Who I Am) (Carlito) Um, I dont think that this fits Carlito very well; other than the fact that theres spanish! I don't like it. 3/10  8)Theory Of A Deadman - Deadly Game (No Way Out 2006) I like this song! The beginning is cool; so is the rest of the song. I could see this as a superstars theme song. 8/10  9)Silkk The Shocker - I'm Comin [3:33] I dont like it. I hate the clocks in the beginng. To most, its a great rap song, but I just dont like it. 3/10  10)Shadows Fall - Fury Of The Storm (Rob Van Dam) This is worth skipping. Its kinda like his old one only Hardcore! Still sucks!4/10  11)Three 6 Mafia - Some Bodies Gonna Get It (Mark Henry) Another rap track.Doesnt fit Henry and is boring and reapeats itself. Doesnt seem like a WWE Theme song more like a rap song and just a rap song.2/10  12)Zebrahead - With Legs Like That (Maria) Doesn't seem like a Maria song, but it's still good. I expected more on this cd, there aren't much good songs! Maria should get a different song; ASAP!!All in all an ok track. 6/10  13)Killswitch Engage - This Fire Burns (Judgment Day 2006)Speedy matal [...] When Randy used this song one night on SD! I was really scared that that might be his new song. 4/10  14)P.O.D. - Booyaka 619 (Rey Mysterio)It's a little different than the TV version. This song is good. And the beat is good too. It fits him, an overall great song. i personally, like his old song, but thats just me. 7/10   15)Motï¿½rhead - King Of Kings (Triple H) This song is awesome! Motï¿½rhead never fails for the WWE. The Game song was getting old. This is new and fresh- and fabulous.lol;)Anywho, this fits HHH great, with his King of Kings thing. 9/10 
 If Darwin's revelation of natural selection is "the best idea anyone, any where, ever had", then Richard Dawkins' identification of the "selfish gene" must run a close second.  While Darwin's concept explained the workings of life, Dawkins' insight disclosed the mechanism of natural selection.  The 1976 publication of "The Selfish Gene" not only stimulated a fresh wave of thinking among biologists, it also stirred public interest and imagination.  If life was under the thrall of those strings of chemicals in our cells, how far did that influence reach?  In this set of excellent essays on the issues, Dawkins ideas and their impact are presented and discussed.  The fruit of his insights are bittersweet, and while most of these writings applaud his probity and communication skills, there is the tang of doubt about some of them.  More than two dozen essays comprise this collection.  They are topically organised, starting with the biology issues, moving through the logic Dawkins uses to his writing skills.  Today, the biology seems straightforward: genes build bodies.  Those bodies contain nervous systems and brains - the root of behaviours.  At the publication of "The Selfish Gene", it was widely thought that evolution worked at the species' level.  Dawkins moved that mechanism much deeper.  Its effect is manifested through various ways, with mate choice one of the more significant.  Andrew Read explains how evolutionary pressure forces such practices as "lekking" in certain bird species.  The mechanism can be readily projected to other creatures, and is manifested in humans, as well.  The "selfish gene" operating in humans has, of course, caused the greatest distress among many readers.  An entire section of the book is devoted to that issue.  Randolph Nesse discusses how the term "selfish" has been mindlessly condemned by many.  Adding to the furor, and fury, was the publication of Edward O. Wilson's "Sociobiology".  Although Wilson's book focussed on social species, particularly insects, the implications were clear.  If genes build bodies and guide behaviour, how many of our activities are similarly directed?  How many of our actions are "genetically determined".  Nesse notes that Dawkins had closed his book saying we are the one species capable of overriding our genes' guidance, few either read or failed to comprehend the implications.  Outside the realm of pure biology, Dawkins has made clear his position on religion and its dogmas.  No less a figure than the Bishop of Oxford takes up the challenge.  In his essay on Dawkins and humanism, Richard Harries deals with what drives a person to atheism.  Noting other powerful scholars have turned away from "faith".  He exempts science itself as a cause, instead Harries relies on Alister McGrath's recent book, "Dawkins' God" as a buttress.  Harries sympathises with Dawkins sense of awe at the wonders of the universe.  Harries, of course, wishes Dawkins' awe could be "grounded in a reality that lies beyond the visible universe".  The concluding essays focus on Dawkins' writing skills.  That talent is universally exclaimed throughout the set, but Matt Ridley and Philip Pullman go beyond merely addressing Dawkins ability to impart science.  Pullman, in particular, finds elements of Dawkins' prose that should appeal to all readers, notably "phrase-making" and humour.  Making readers smile is a rare trait among science writers, but Dawkins has managed to Pullman's satisfaction and delight.  He even compares Dawkins with Dickens, no small compliment.  It is a fitting cap to this collection - a tribute well deserved by its subject. Having read "Selfish Gene" some time ago, this collection impels me to take up its insights and delightful reading once more.  As these writers stress, Dawkins is a thought-stimulator par excellence. We need more like him. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada] 
 If you are looking for an easy to read "how to" get started with creating your own drum circles book, "Together in Rhythm: A Facilitator's Guide to Drum Circle Music" fits the bill.  The material in the book is easy to follow and the included DVD helps to re-enforce the concepts presented. In addition to the material that covers conducting a drum circle, the book also touches on practical business practices such as recommended instrumentation, drum circle set-up and what to do following a event.  Over-all I feel this book is a must have for anyone interested in taking the plunge into the world of drum circle facilitation.  Kudos to Kalani for creating such an excellent resource.  
 First, let me say that this publication will definately bring out the kid in you. It's basically a 'how to' manual for fun projects along with some great editoral. While MAKE is more geared toward the hobbyist crowd, there are plenty of projects for novices. And the whole point is to get you building, creating, and having fun--so you can move on to those bigger, more ambitious projects. And YES, buy one off the magazine rack and try it out first--what goofball buys a subscription to a magazine before reading it???   
 An absolutely fabulous book - really a "must read" for all Christian parents who want to prepare their children to effectively engage the world for Christ.  A Houston-area mom, Arrington does a great job of addressing the fundamental issues that children are facing today - a post-modern and post-Christian culture that is bombarding them with powerful messages contrary to God's revealed truth.  So what's a parent to do?  Arrington doesn't hide her head in the sand waiting for the rapture; she systematically lays out a plan to equip her family with the answers to the issues they will face in the world using Scripture as her guide.  When I was reading this book, I was constantly reminded of Psalm 127:3-5 where it states:  "Sons are a heritage from the Lord, children a reward from him.  Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are sons born in one's youth.  Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them.  They will not be put to shame when they contend with their enemies in the gate." ~ Psalm 127:3-5  I've seen this verse in countless places, but never have I seen the last sentence included.  The last sentence tells me that our children will contend with enemies in the gate and that if they are prepared, equipped, and trained, they will not be put to shame.  World Proofing Your Kids is an essential tool in the equipping process of our children!  Arrington begins with a basic worldview primer and then dives into various cultural issues from abortion to animal rights and the "right to die" movement.  She also addresses the entertainment culture and its profound effect on today's young people.  I thought her approach to this issue was the best chapter in the entire book - instead of avoiding all media or cursing TV for its filth and smut, Arrington gives alternatives to the brain-drain of TV seeking to produce depth and understanding resulting in a mind that is not easily amused and is armed to see and counter the lies of the culture.  Arrington writes with a great balance of humor and truth mixed with a healthy dose of personal experience that makes this book easy to relate to and understand as a parent.  She is not writing this from the ivory tower of perfect parenting; she reveals her own shortcomings and struggles along the way - but she also clearly communicates that equipping our children for the challenges and opportunities of this cultural crisis will take diligence and determination on our part as parents. 
 As being the biggest Oasis fan in the world, now looking back 11 years after this masterpiece was made, this in my opinion is one of the top ten albums ever made. Defitinatly Maybe was a true rock album, the loudest sound from England since " Never Mind The Bullocks" and " Be Here Now" was awesome as well in it's own right. This album was when Noel knew that he was the best songwriter in the world. He could do know wrong. They no longer wanted to be rock and roll stars, they were. "Wonderwall" "Champagne Supernova" " Morning Glory" " Roll With It" are as good as any songs you will ever here. I have to say my favorite song is " Some Might Say" . Noel at this time was the king of rock. If you are lucky enough to buy the record, you will here an artifact "Bonehead's Bank Holiday" which is hidden. It was was sad to see Bonehead and Guigsy leave during the SOTSOG  sessions and unfortunately Oasis has never been the same, although Don't Believe The Truth is showing that Noel, Liam as well as Bell, Archer are capable of making great music still. They recorded this album in the summer of 95 during the most exciting period in England's history since the sixties when the Beatles and Stones were rulers. Oasis is still my favorite band of all time. This album as well as "Definately Maybe" and "Be Here Now" only prove my point. 
 There are already tons of reviews on the EOS 300d (Digital Rebel) but I do want to share my experience with the camera, so I will keep this short. I bought this camera about 5 months ago and I am in love with. I was not new to photography or to SLR's, but new to the world of digital SLR. I had previously used an ancient Minolta x-570, a "pro-sumer" 35mm film slr with a Vivitar 35-105 standard zoom lens. First and foremost this camera takes excellent pictures, very high quality and no distortion that I have seen. This camera is particularly good as a beginner's dSLR because there are so many options to use and learn. But until you are ready to take advantage of all the featues, you can use this just like a point and shoot. Battery life has been excellent so far: thought I would suggest getting an extra to have as  a backup for long days of taking photos.  I have also been quite happy with the kit lens, which I wasn't sure I would like since it is not as versatile as the lens I had been using on my Minolta. But the kit lens has proved to be a great learning tool: I have been able to take some great shots, while also learning what kinds of other, better lenses I would like to add to my setup.   **The only issue I have had was a problem with a Sandisk 2gb CF card. After about 300 shots, the camera froze and stopped responding to that card. I was able to salvage most of the photos after the fact, but don't risk it. If you're serious enough to spend this kind of money on a camera, spend a little extra money on the Sandisk Ultra II line of high-speed cards. 
 First and foremost, this is NOT a book on Wicca.  Wicca is a religion, this just teaches MAGIC, plain and simple.  I appreciated the author's eclectic and (refeshingly) non-dogmatic approach.  What you choose to believe is up to you and your responsibility.  The introductory chapter is excellent, as it gives one of the most lucid explanations of how magic is done.  In fact, some of his stuff could have been placed in any modern book on Chaos Magic and would have fit in perfectly.  I'll admit that some of the material was not to my liking, but overall the book is very good.  Bear in mind, this was written before the whole business of Magic(k) and Wicca became commercially viable.  I recommend that the reader approaches the book with an open mind.  Take what you want, then leave what you don't want behind.  
 Recently, I needed to learn a great deal about global environmental issues and global environmental politics in a short period of time. My assistant went and bought more than two dozen books - edited volumes, easy readers, detailed analyses, text books, etc.  I surveyed them all and read most cover to cover. This is by far the best.  It gave me the essential information in a very readable and well organized format.  It was did not lecture but informed. I saw many far longer or more focused volumes but this one covered all the bases and was a pleasure to read.  It is a little strange to recommend this type of book around the office but when people ask me, this is the one I point to 
 I loved this item until it became fused to the base.  I called CS and they sent me a prepaid UPS label to ship it back and issued a full refund and send me a letter with a $50 off coupon to keep using Kitchenaid.  Very impressive 
 One of the co-authors of this book is Tim Grey, who has apparently become the publisher's utility infielder, appearing as author or co-author of a whole series of new books.  Fortunately Grey, who also publishes the daily on-line newsletter, DDQ (Digital Darkroom Questions), writes clearly and succinctly.  The publisher has apparently decided to launch a series of books that deal at a micro-level with digital photography.  For example one of Grey's other recent books is "Color Confidence, which tells the digital photographer how to match up the tones, tints and hues of his camera, monitor and printer.  Perhaps a better title would have been the Output Book, since the book is concerned with the output of the digital photography process: printed images; on-line displays; and slideshows.  The book is a strange potpourri of information, some of it easily available elsewhere and other information harder to find.  For example, the authors tell you how to use outside print services, either in the form of a local lab or an on-line service.  Most of this information is readily available by walking into a lab or going to an on-line printing site.  On the other hand, some of the information on setting up a web site was completely new to me.  Oh, I knew a little bit about coding, but I certainly didn't know that search engines were more likely to index your site if you included alternative text in the HTML "img" tag.  If your eyes glazed over after that last sentence, don't worry.  The authors don't advocate HTML coding for most people.  Instead they recommend programs like Dreamweaver and Front Page for the development of full-blown websites and even provide a little instruction, although no one should think that they could use these programs without some more study.  But they don't ignore PhotoShop's Web Photo Gallery facility that can turn out a professional web site with very little effort.  There is a companion website to the book, where one may examine more detailed examples and even download some templates.  Even though the book's subtitle says it is about selling images, that section of the book is very limited.  It really only talks about finding galleries to show your work, and selling on the Internet.  There is no mention of stock sales.  Given that John Shaw's "The Business of Nature Photography", which is probably the premier book in this field, was published in 1996, there certainly is a need for a volume that goes into more details on marketing in the digital age.  If you are looking for a book on preparing your photos digitally for output, Barry Haynes' "PhotoShop Artistry" series is one of the best, although it may require augmentation by books like Mikkel Aaland's "Shooting Digital", or Bruce Fraser's "Camera Raw with Adobe PhotoShop CS" and even Grey's "Color Confidence".  But for a book about the output of the digital photography process, while some parts of this book will seem elementary, other sections will make you reconsider your approach and probably teach you a thing or two you didn't know 
 Socrates is a true soul searcher!  When this book was assigned to me to read, I wasn't too excited, but by the end I was reading parts that weren't assigned to me.  This book is full of logical thinking that changes your whole perspective on things.  After reading about Socrates I started thinking in a new fashion.  In the book Socrates adresses such topics as the essence of piety, the form of the world, and life after death.  It is a shame that Socrates did not write any ideas down himself 
 This makes a great lunch for taking to the office.  Just water and microwave and it's actually pretty tasty.  
 My friend and I cannot stop using this book.  We are learning a ton and it is really helpful in writing music.  
 Cyclops is the one Cussler book that makes me laugh out loud every time I read it. The other books have some dry humor, but the premise of this one is so out there, I mean there is a fight between the Americans and the Soviets on THE MOON. Aside from that, the premise is actually realy cool and this one is a very interesting read 
  I was rather impressed with the first Bionicle movie "Mask of light," the animation was awesome and the plot was well-done in my opinion. That said, Bionicle II: Legends of Metru Nui was far from a disappointment. The beginning will be a bit confusing at first if you're thinking its the sequel to "Mask of Light." Legends of Metru Nui is more a prequel than a sequel; it explains some of the things that were left unexplained (if any) in the first movie and the plot is just as good as the first one only with a little more depth to it.           Basically, there's something amiss going on in Metru Nui that has to do the Metorian the smaller versions of the bionicle, and new creatures called Vahki fighters who aren't evil nor good. Six Metorian are chosen to become mighty Toa in order to figure out the strange happenings goin on in Metru Nui and the disappearance of a great Toa-fighter.           The action and animations in the movie are well done although the running animations are strange: they appear to hop when they run. Some of the scenes were downright hilarious to watch and the music was just as good, there wasn't a childish hint to it at all. Many people compare Bionicle with anime and if anything Bionicle is far from being an anime-styled movie, it certainly doesn't have to be from Japan to be a good movie last time I remember (take for example; The lord of the rings and dare I say it, Star Wars).          The extras are worth looking twice at, there are trailers and sneak peaks for future Bionicle projects and the making of the second movie. Lastly, the voice acting was great: voices for the characters were humorous and melodramatic in all the right places, there wasn't a moment of lack of talent anywhere. You can easily watch this movie without spoiling the first one since it is a prequel, though I recommend you watch the first one for a better grasp on what they talk about in this movie. 5 stars 
 This book is readable, informative and appears to be very well-documented.  As a former apologist for Bill Clinton, I have to say that this book was a revelation to me and frankly made me a little queasy.  I can't believe that I helped put this man in office.  Morris can speak with genuine admiration about many of the positive steps, but also chronicles the dark side in a way that many of my former fellows will find hard to accept.  Despite some significant accomplishments during his administration, there was confusion, ineptitude, cronyism, lack of vision, and downright corruption.  I was on the one hand proud of Clinton for things like his extension of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which lifted so many low-income families out of poverty, and on the other hand absolutely enraged by the dithering and delay and lack of action in Afganistan, Iran, Iraq, Bosnia, and Rwanda that contributed to hundreds of thousands of deaths, thereby emboldening Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda to commit acts of mass murder on our own soil.   I am left with the forlorn feeling that, with both the Clintons, there was always a lot less there than meets the eye.  Allow me to apologize if you disagree with my perspective...my advisors made me write this.. 
 Es un producto muy practico y de buen tamaño, sólo que sería excelente si fuese de acero inoxidable. 
 I love this DVD! I'm an absolute clutz, so I won't set foot in a class, but after 2-3 times trying this video, I feel pretty good about the dance routine. Paula Abdul is a positive instructor who never gets on my nerves like other videos. The dance moves make you feel pretty hip even if you fumble your way through it! Also, the moves don't feel trapped in the 80s or 90s. They continuously feel pretty "cool" and modern." The best thing is that I don't even realize that I'm working out while doing this DVD 
 Number 1 book in the charts: "The Da-Vinci code", soft cover. Number 2 book in the charts: "The Da-Vinci code", hard cover. Number 3 book in the charts: "Angels and Demons", soft cover. Number 4 book in the charts: "Angels and Demons", hard cover. So I thought I would give a try on the world's second most popular (and commercial) book. Great writing I must agree on. Extreme amount of real-life knowledge on arts, history and religion. Now I have to go to Rome and Vatican city. And then the symbolism - I suppose it's quite an unique talent for one to be able to discover multi-layered symbols in almost every twist and turn of one's novel. However some of it is so damn commercial and sometimes feels as if the author is expecting his book to be a basis for an action movie flick. Like Robert Langdon's bare-handed fall from a mile-high helicopter straight into Tiberius, not only surviving it, but managing to make love to an yoga-master the very same night... Last but not least this book spawned many of a question in my mind, from the fictional development of massive amount of anti-matter to the practical proof of existence of a Creator. Although not in exactly Christian terms, I am now more and more a believer 
 I own one of the most diversified collections of "Oldies" beginning with the 50's, but this CD contains some of my favorite songs that I couldn't find on any other compilation CD ("You're My world", "Please Don't Just Stand There", "White on White" and one of my all time favorites and one you hardly ever hear, "Village of Love".  If you're truly an oldies fan, this CD will be one you listen to over and over again.  Definitely worth owning!! 
 The opening sequence with Dwight Yokum and Rebecca De Mornay is one of the funniest in the film. The rest doesn't live quite up to it. The movie suffers from an improbability problem. I know from working weddings like some they went to, it's not easy to sneak into a wedding, especially high profile weddings with bouncers and giant men standing at the doors looking at your invite!  Besides that, I will say I enjoyed the film. It's not as funny as say, 40 Year Old Virgin, but there's some good stuff in there. Keir O'Donnell has some of the funniest moments in the film as the goth/artist/gay son of Walken. These were some of the laugh out loud moments of the film.  Owen Wilson is very likable in the film as the partier-coming-to-grips with his age and wanting more out of life. He more or less plays the straight man to Vince Vaughn's antics.  Vaughn speaks in lightening fast dialogue most of the movie. Funny, and good, but at times I was left scratching my head. He's a strong actor and makes strong choices in this movie.  The directing by Dobkin sometimes feels less than good. Desk scenes shot with 2 cameras make it look like the actors are improvising most of their lines and leaves these "buddies" looking a bit too disconnected.  Bottom Line: If you enjoy comedies, especially of this genre, see it. It is very formulatic and if you're smart, you'll know how it ends about 30 minutes into this overly long comedy. (over 2 hours)  PS: Will Ferrell turns in a very odd performance as Chazz Reinhold the ultimate wedding crasher. You might feel a little dirty after watching this near out of place character. 
 Being a L.M. Montgomery fan helps of course, but this second book in her series is a great sequel to the Anne of Green Gables which started it all.  The writing hold true to the author's form and the character development is as good as the first work in the series.  My wife and I have been reading these books for years and never tire of them.  Again, as with her first work, you have to remember the time these were written and the style and syntax used at that time.  This particlar story starts where the last left off, Anne is sixteen and her adventure continues.  I, for some reason, find these books rather comforting to read and recommend them highly. 
 I loved The War with Grandpa. In this selection, Peter has a war with his Grandpa. My  favorite  part  was  when  Grandpa  took  Peter`s  Monopoly  pieces. I know you'll like this book!      
 This is tedious reading and requires your undivided attention.  The book does however make the reader aware of the tactics used be the media to deceive the public.  You understand why some information makes the front page and some make page 15 and why some information does not get printed at all. It also makes clear that corporate profits outweigh the public's need for accurate, timely and truthful news 
 I purchased this card for my new Sony DSC-H1 digital camera and have not had a single issue with the stick. It writes fast and the storage capacity is fantastic. 
 Well, he certainly is no Parker.  And he anachronistically plays the nationality (Spain) over the citizenship (Rome); and beyond that to some organizational questions since other authorities state the legion was first raised in northern Italy. Yet, despite the arguable deficiencies, and there going beyond the 10th to a confusion over the 3rd (the three of them) and a mistake respecting the 12th, Dondo Collins has done a yeoman's job of bringing the history back to life and there with a convincing display of writing.  Thoroughly enjoyed my march with the 10th, and found his "would have"s and "probably"s refreshing and educational in themselves; an historian's way of filling in the gaps if you will.  He is to be commended for departing from the dry analysis of the academy and embracing the true art of History in the narrative, though we do not believe his work would have suffered if he had stuck with Roman classifications and nomenclature, at least respecting rank.  Not the definitive work, but a good read and highly educational for at least the novice. 
 Wow.  I asked for this CD for my birthday, and if I didn't get it I planned on having it overnighted to me.  Anyway, this band is amazing.  Musically, it's not terribly complex, but these guys jam with the best of the 60's greats.  The singers voice is probably one of the best I've heard in a long time.  I'm not sure what band in particular I'd compare them to, I guess the Kinks has been a popular comparison, but I'm not sure.  I'd say if you took all the greatest bands from the 60's (except the Beatles, I don't think they fit the bill for them), and combined them into one, you'd get this band.  The lyrics aren't deep, but they don't whine like 99.9% of other bands nowadays.  If you're into classic rock and can't stand the post-Nirvana music of today, check this one out.  You won't be dissapointed.  I understand they put on a damn good live show too 
 East of Eden is an epic, powerful book of hope, despair, suffering and permission for humanity to fulfill it's potential. This may sound dramatic but East of Eden is one of the most thoughtful books I have ever read. The level of depth that is so subtly put into the book has a profound impact on the reader: the idiosyncraties of life, which we so often take for being individual to ourselves are really vividly shown to be universal. The book isn't so much a novel but a treatise on human nature and a philosophy for life. This is a big claim so I'll try and justify it. But really, this is a book that needs to be experienced rather than read so any review is only a shallow representation.   It takes a novelist of Steinbeck's skill to pull the deep philosophising off in a non-condensending or patronising manner. Yet, he handles the book beautifully, the philosophy comes from two very strong and intriging characters, Samuel and Lee, both outsiders beloved by those close to them who are able to advise the other characters and, by proxy, the reader too. Through these characters' strong voices, the other actors are guided through their lives, the stregth of hope that they give out is the difference between life and death for some characters. The ideas of the book are obvious when read but stay with the reader and offer a simple approach to a lives beset by complications - put simply, you may do what you want in life, you learn for yourself and although help and strength may be offered by other people, ultimately you are responsible for your own life. And for whether you are satisfied when death takes you.   The book is strong in many areas, such as the depth of knowledge gained about American history and the American psyche, the deep love shown to its people and the strong, interesting characters, shown extra love in their crafting because many are based on Steinbeck's own family. However the level of detail in the book slows down the narrative tremendously: this isn't a novel that can be rushed through without missing the crux of the book; the contemplative tone means that it will always be a slow read. The plot is also quite simplistic and easily predictable. It could be reduced to a few lines but in doing so the fine details and love that is so apparent in the book would be lost. The plot is secondary to the environment, characters and, above all, to the ideas of the book.   If this type of book sounds intriging to you, please buy or borrow it quickly, as it will be a book that you won't forget for a long time and offers the reader a lot. Despite the heaviness of the topics and some of the vindictiveness shown by some characters, the book leaves the reader in hope rather than despair by the end. Even if it doesn't sound appealing and the size of the book puts you off you should try this book. It is a rare masterpiece and one which will be as relevant in 100 years as it is now with much wisdom on offer to any reader, regardless of their world experiences 
 I have both the movie, and the soundtrack, And both are good. Some of my favorites on this CD are Friday, Keep their Heads Ringin', Mary Jane, and Hoochie Mama. 
 This book had been on my "to read" list for some time--fairly low, because travelogues are not usually my cup of tea.  But after seeing the very excellent interview with the engaging Mr. Least Heat-Moon on BookTV last weekend, it hurtled to the top.  Having just finished it, I can do nothing but give the author props for a very funny, insightful (and at times, even moving) chronicle of modern America, as seen from the backroads.    What is most astonishing about this book is that every observation, every encounter, every description rings honest.  Any number of writers could have tackled this assignment, using it as an opportunity for silly or sentimental navel-gazing.  Mr. LH-M keeps it real.  He lets the people speak for themselves.  He provides enough details about his own life and personal crises to establish himself as an interesting (and interested) narrator, but he never loses sight of the country around him.  He provides vivid descriptions of the ever-changing scenery but does not get bogged down in adjective-overdrive.  Those he interviews are a fascinating mix of the poor and middle and upper-middle class:  thinkers and philosophers and laborers and "just plain folks" who live in places most of us will never visit.  Though Mr. LH-M is a restless wanderer and does not remain in any locale long, he does not miss interesting side-opportunities that present themselves.  He learns about hang-gliding in Washington, syruping in New Hampshire, joins a fishing crew for a day off the coast of Maine, and along the way hears tales of small-town America and of the gradual movement (which has grown only faster in the last 25 years) towards sweeping most of America into the net of suburban sprawl.  This book provides good evidence why the trend should be resisted.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  Calling it a "travelogue" is an injustice in many ways, because it fails to capture the deeply human aspect of the author's chronicle.  Buy and read this book.  You will be glad you did 
 It's a fun filled comedy about highschool football in a small town. Robin Williams and Kurt Russell are great as they replay the game that shaped their lives 
 Cooke's wonderful distillation of the Silver Age heroes, with a nod to the Golden Age and timely references about empty-headed patriotism deserves either the big screen treatment, or even better, a mini-series on one of the better cable stations.   The heroes here -- Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, etc. -- have a darkness that owes a lot to Frank Miller's seminal Dark Knight Returns series, but also to the tortured navel-gazing of Marvel's mutant heroes. Cooke's Dick Tracy-esque art style is warm and inviting, like a Norman Rockwell painting that captures a long forgotten America that probably didn't exist but we seem to miss anyway.  That said, his attempt to juggle so many characters means we lose out on a lot of well-needed character development, which stunts some of the story arcs. The proto-feminist Wonder Woman who encourages Vietnamese women to take revenge on their male captors is sent to the sidelines early on in the story; we are introduced to Aquaman with a great spread, but then he does nothing until the last few pages.   Ultimately, this is the story of three characters, Hal Jordan, The Flash and the Martian Manhunter, but in attempting to tell a giant story that encompasses the whole DC Universe, they too get short shrift.   By all means purchase both volumes, read them, put them in your library and, if possible, buy them repeatedly as gifts for the children of friends and relatives who read comics 
 I purchased this to be used primarily by someone who is very non-tech oriented and has a lousy sense of direction.  She warmed up to it immediately and has been able to use it quite successfully.  The screen is a nice size, with very good brightness and settings which will adjust as needed.  The female voice that provides directions is very pleasing, easily understandable, well thought out in the timing and specificity of its comments and plenty loud enough (also adjustable).  Directions are on the money and at times great routes are chosen that neither of us knew about even though we've lived in the area for many years.  The unit functions quite rapidly, whether finding the nearest gas station (a life saver late one night when very low on gas in an unfamiliar area), or calculating a route.  Battery life is surprisingly good, and the gps unit needs very little "window" to get its bearings.  The TrafficKit add-on is very helpful in its rapid and reasonable alternate route offerings when congestion is detected. I popped a memory card with photos on it into the card slot and found that the photo feature provides a nice display for which I can imagine a number of uses, both business and pleasure.  A few quibbles: the plus and minus buttons on the top and the mute button on the side are too easily activated if you are handling the unit; the shutting down routine is a bit clunky - it would be better to just have a screen option for sleep and shutdown instead of having to slowly count to 10 while holding down the power button; snapping the unit in and out of the mounting bracket could be a lot easier with guides or reference marks of some kind; the photo feature menu is not exactly intuitive, but once you get the idea it all works well.  These are all minor points which are not enough to dampen our pleasant experience with the RoadMate 3000T 
 This book clearly sets the standard for best practices in providing insights into creating equity enhancing experiences for consumers.  Based on this book, my firm has asked Dr. Schmitt to advise us how to make our  consumer (and trade) promotions more effective.  The book is without  question one of the best I have read for understanding product  differentiation 
 "I Might Need Security" might be Jamie Foxx's funniest show yet.  I laughed the entire time.  I had seen the show before, but had to buy it so I could watch it whenever I wanted to.  When I show it to friends, they agree that this is a funny video.  Jamie's comedy portion is funny, but I think the extra features are just as funny.  Jamie is sooo talented!!  If you like Jamie Foxx, this video is a must have 
 This is the sixth of Davies's books that I've read, and eight chapters in I fully expected to be rating it at five stars. A few chapters later, I was thinking more along the lines of three. First the good stuff: What Einstein did to our understanding of time has been discussed in many or Davies' books, but not as extensively as it is here. It is unlikely that the concept of time dilation can be explained any more simply and directly than it is when the author relates how the decay of a muon, a short-lived particle which functions as an "atomic clock", is dramatically slowed when in a high-energy state (i.e., moving near the speed of light as the result of so-called cosmic rays colliding with near-Earth particles, or energized in a particle accelerator). We might say that time is thus "stretched" in a way that is rather easily measured. As the world at large is indeed populated with such a variety of energy states and curved gravitational fields, of "clocks" running at different speeds, it is not difficult to understand time in terms of a 'foam' or 'froth' of quantum space-times. "Now" is relative. So far, so good, professor Davies, in fact very good.  The sketch of Einstein's life and work is interesting enough and appropriately brief; so is the treatment of the significance of the kind of "thought experiment" which was central to his work. When Davies states, "Science is based on the assumption that the world is rational, and that human reasoning reflects, albeit in a somewhat shaky way, an underlying order in nature," he presages what will (in my opinion), a few chapters later, prove to be the undermining of the first two hundred pages by the last eighty (my hardcover edition is 285 pages). Okay, now for the not-so-good stuff: Beginning in chapter nine, in which the author treats the second law of thermodynamics, it seems that science fiction is as much in order as hard physics (I permit myself to believe there is such a thing). Having earlier used the famous "twins paradox" to discuss time dilation, Davies reprises twins Ann and Betty in chapter ten, but now they are employing tachyon beams to violate special relativity (and receive messages before they are sent). The obvious problem is that the tachyon signals are 'sent' and 'received' by subluminal observers. This, on its face, is crazy, much crazier that the usual descriptions involving observers beyond the horizon of a black hole, for example (sure, they would be gravitationally obliterated but their theoretical observations themselves constitute a valid thought experiment, well, sort of). As Davies has already told us, tachyons (superluminal particles that probably don't exist) must have a minimum speed limit, Einstein's relativity does not exclude them so long as they are --always-- faster than the speed of light. The cosmic speed limit cannot be transgressed in either direction. If tachyons are to be employed by subluminal observers, they must either be a pure fiction or else special relativity is wrong! I know of no evidence that special relativity is wrong, and no credible evidence that tachyons exist. So how useful is such a thought experiment? Well, we might say that Davies is only trying to construct an illustration -- indeed he is -- but it's a rather silly one, and I suspect he might agree. Davies often tries to present all competing ideas as if he somehow finds all of them to be alternately compelling (or all uncompelling?). Obviously, he's a bright guy, he knows he must be talking nonsense part of the time. Eventually he offers his own judgment: ". . . at the end of the day I am forced to agree with Eddington and Penrose that we are missing something important from the physics of time and our perception thereof." (p276) If chapters 9-13 should start to drive you nuts, you might consider leaping to the summary questionings in chapter fourteen. Sci-fi aficionados will want to read the discussions of time-travel in chapter eleven (nothing startling here for readers conversant in the topic). Three stars? Four? Five? Well, the treatment is thorough enough (perhaps too thorough on some points), and some fuzzy [counterintuitive] concepts are lucidly explained. This is neither Davies' best or worst effort, but closer to the former 
 Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China is a book that opens the door to Chinese philosophy. Some of the writing may be familiar, such as Confucius while other lagalist writing sounds more Machiavellian.  A good book for an introduction to Chinese philosophy, much of it reads like poetry 
 We rented this movie not expecting too much.  We like this genre (moron movies).  Unlike several eggheads who reviewed this movie, we had no trouble at all following the plot.  We just thought this movie was a scream!  Lots of idiotic action and the girlfriend from hell.  What's not to like?  If you like this type of movie, you will love it!  Mac McCaule 
 I am a big fan of actor/musician Jared Leto, and I found this flick kinda by accident. It had a little bit of everything, cast wise so I snagged it. It took me about three weeks to finally check it out cause once I read the back for plot points I thought maybe it was a mistake. Wow was I wrong. I thought this movie was pretty damn good. The two main characters compliment eachother nicely and it's a classic story underlining what friendship/life can throw at you. Yes theres also an underlining message screaming..."This is what can happen if you do drugs/sleep with someone elses wife..." Overall its a good flick pick if you've still got a sense of humor about young love, consequence, sex , drugs and rock n ROLL!! 
 This reaqder is a true Anglophile and wants this new,year old magazine to survive. Judging from the amount of advertizing it receives, I'm not sure that it will. Each edition brings decorating features, some English recipies, homes for sale, and descriptions of all manner of things English. Written for North American readers, it is a delight 
 I first read HCA when I was about 8 and I remember being baffled at their deviation from the standard "fairy tale" formula. They stayed with  me however. I bought this edition because I wanted to explore more of his work and I am very glad I did. I have finished about 3/4ths of this volulme and the richness, satire, obersvation, depth, humor and relevance of the themes continue to awe me. It's not a book for children but for those adults who want to go on adventures with a master storyteller 
  I picked up this book becuase I had problems with a few control freaks in my life. Reading it gave me a new perspective on why people control and how wide the scope can be. I'm also shocked to realise that a person like myself who's struggling with control freaks also has some control issues. Ironical as it sounds, Les is right to say that "it takes one to know one".   I'll recommend this book to anyone who's dealing with controlling people in their lives. It also provides suggestions on ways to improve those relationships. 
 When I read Atlas Shrugged, I could not help feeling the novel was almost science fiction in its depiction of a world where capitalism is not allowed to flourish freely because the government tries to regulate it, and consequently, the intellectuals and inventors abandon the rest of society. And then, I read Ayn Rand's first novel, We The Living, and within the first few pages realized she was not only depicting the very world that would exist if the government controlled everything, but that such a world had existed in the Soviet Union, and she had been a first hand witness to it. Atlas Shrugged was less a fantasy than a nightmare she had already lived through without as successful an ending as her greatest novel.  The novel begins at the end of the Russian Revolution and depicts the lives of several of the younger generation trying to survive in the increasingly communist world as the state squelches individual freedom more and more. Having myself grown up during the Cold War, I foudn the novel rang true to many of the stories I heard about life in the Soviet Union--people standing in line for hours for a little bit of food for example. What is amazing is that it was written by someone who actually lived through those experiences in the early 1920s in Russia.  Ayn Rand states the novel is "as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. The plot is invented, the background is not. I was born in Russia, I was educated under the Soviets; I have seen the conditions of existence that I describe." One wishes she had written more of an autobiography because she states the main character Kira's experiences are not her own, although her ideas and convictions are.  The novel follows Kira as she attends the university where true learning is replaced by learning only about the state, communism and Marxist idealogies. Kira submits to this social pressure to survive and to help her family, but she cannot come to believe these ideologies. The living conditions of the novel are intolerable as people are crammed, entire families into one or two rooms of a compartment, as people must wear worn out clothes because there are non new, and worst of all, as people are unable to think or discuss anything except the socialist ideologies.  Saddest of all is Kira's attempts to find love. Both men she becomes involved with are unable to stand on their own because they fear the state or try to work underground to make money to survive because they cannot feed themselves in a society that does not allow free enterprise. Kira finds herself caught between these two men as she tries to survive and help them. In the end, she can help no one except herself and she makes her decision to escape abroad. Most readers I think will be disappointed by the ending, and I think Rand could have provided a stronger one to affirm life, but the final pages are dramatic and suspenseful.  The novel is not as pointed or as much of a page turner as Atlas Shrugged, but it makes one understand better the events that led Ayn Rand to develop her philosophy of objectivism. The reader is left wanting to know more about the history of the Russian Revolution and communism. The book reminds one of the more popular Dr. Zhivago, although it is questionable if that book is any more powerful. Most of all, one wants to learn more about Ayn Rand's personal life in Russia and how she escaped to America. I intend to read an autobiography of Ayn Rand next.  - Tyler R.

 The journal of Rufus Rowe brings the reader into the mind of a young 16-year boy. Rufus witness the horror of war: "I shall never forget the smell of gun power" and "broken windows, furniture in the streets, and houses on fire" and "defeat in war means loss and victory in war means loss".   Rufus patriotism and love Fredricksburg and Virginia was replaced by the burdens of carnage, death, and suffering.  Rufus felt and witness the raw carnage of war; the dead horses, the deafening boom of cannon and gun fire, the exhaustion and hunger, soldiers stripping clothes and items off dead soldiers, truces agreed upon too bury the dead, the illogical carnage that resulted from Yankees charging stonewall.  Rufus discovered Soldiers consume massive amounts of pork, beans, and gruel.   All of Rufus's chickens were stolen.   Food became scarce.  The battle of Fredricksburg favored the confederates even though the Yankees number 115,000 and the Rebels 78,000.  The Yankees were trapped into a pocket with only one direction of movement, forward.   The confederate sharpshooters shot the Yankees with deadly accuracy.   In scene, Yankee casualties reached 200 in one charge.  The battle of Fredricksburg was a serious Union defeat, but not the end too the war.  Union generals and soldiers had an endless supply of replacements.     Many Confederate Generals were involved in the battle of Fredricksburg.  The battle of Fredricksburg formed a defense formation from right to left starting with Jeb Staurt, next Gen Robert E Lee, Gen Longstreet, and Hooker too the left.   Rufus overheard on fat man brag about Jeb Staurt out whitting the Yankees with a calvery flank move to the right and predicted the war would be over in "six months".   The war would last three years.    In one scene, the Yankees played "The Star Spangled Banner" and other Yankee patriotic songs, but when the union musicians played "Dixie" a roar of cheers and shouts climaxed on the rebel side. Union General Burnside felt capturing Fredricksburg was a strategic prize.  President Lincoln lost confidence in General Burnsides lack of aggression and replace him. The delay in building the bridge had allowed the confederate armies to arrive and anchor into place.  President Lincoln was angered by the delay.  The Yankees had to cross the Rappahannock River before gaining access to the interior of the city.  The battle was delay for one week until the Pontoon bridges arrived.  The Union soldiers received Rebel gunfire while they installed the pontoon bridge necessary for crossing the Rappahannock River.   The Union army was able to cross over the Rappahannock River and march into Fredricksburg.  Confederate General Lee ordered the evacuation of Fredricksburg.  Civilians departed their homes and many walked out of the city with their possessions.  Rufus dreamed he saw a little girl carrying her doll out of the city.  The little girl struggled to carry the doll and at the same time keep pace with her party. Rufus prayed for the little girl in his dreams and hope she would be able to keep her doll and exist the city.  Rufus would return home too his mother before the battle was over.  Rufus arrived at dinnertime, Saturday dinners were large and he appreciated the food.  The prodigal son had returned home and Rufus's mother affection for him demanded she not leave his side.   The mother was not to blame.  The mother's husband ran off when Rufus was two.   Rufus was the man of the house, but when his mother remarried a businessman, whose profession was timber, the man treated Rufus both harshly and cruelly.  Rufus despised his stepfather's cruelty and ran away from home and Rufus earned money for food by purchasing merchandise for the confederate soldiers.   Upon return home Rufus told his mother about the progress of the battle and the stepfather excused his poor treatment of Rufus by blaming the ailing timber business.   Rufus agreed that amends had been given and properly received.  Peg and Evelyn noticed Rufus and provided him a place to sleep, work, and eat; however, Evelyn's father pretended that Rufus did not exists, but allowed him to stay.  Rufus friend was a George, one of the house slaves.   As the fighting commenced Peg, Evelyn, and her father departed Brompton too live in a neighboring city with a higher elevation.  George made Rufus promise he would hide during the fighting; good advice that would save Rufus's life.  Once Confederate soldiers shot at Federate Soldiers from the second floor window of the home and bullets sprayed the home and a canyon ball knocked out one of the columns too the home.    Rufus became a friend with Captain Nelson.  Captain Nelson provided information about the battle.  Captain Nelson told Rufus about causalities and updated him on the progress of the battle.  Major General William B. Franklin attacked from two small divisions - Major General George G. Meade and Major General John Gibbon. Mead's troops broke through but Jackson's men expelled the federals.  Burnside launched his attack from Fredericksburg against the Confederate left on Marye's height.  Stonewall provided the fortress of protection and allowed the Rebels to move down the Yankees with precision. Not a single Federal soldier reached longstreet's line."  Rufus explains that the confederates did not kill in cold blood, if a union soldier was trying to help a fallen comrade, the shots would go high.  "On December 15, Burnside ordered his beaten army back across the Rappahannock. The Union had lost 13,000 soldiers in a battle in which the dreadful carnage was matched only by its futility" 
 If I were stuck on a desert island and could only bring one author with me, I would definitely bring something by Joyce Carol Oates.  I've probably read about 15 of her books over the last several decades and she never fails to deliver.  Sexy is part of her young adult series.  It is every bit as good as Big Mouth and Ugly Girl, although frankly, I felt that the endings in both cases left something to be desired.  Perhaps Oates believes that adolescents need more cheer than adults and has skewed her endings to be slightly more positive for the teens.  At any rate, Sexy is about Darren, a 16-year-old pretty boy who is coming to terms with his sexual identity.  It discusses ethical issues like loyalty and betrayal and how hard it is for Darren to take the high road and do the right and decent thing when he's placed in a moral dilemma.  As always, Joyce Carol Oates writes a character driven novel with incredibly well developed and believable main characters. She also strives to address certain social issues -- for example, homosexuality and false accusations in this book and hysteria regarding school shootings or bomb threats in Big Mouth and Ugly Girl -- and never sounds preachy while doing so.  Highly recommended.  Sigrid Macdonald Author of D'Amour Roa 
 The illustrations in this book are very helpful. The language, for the most part, is understandable to an amateur but in some cases, gets rather technical and assumes one has some prior knowledge that an amateur would not have. It is pretty extensive and comprehensive and a worthwhile purchase especially if one can get a decent used copy. Safety tips are helpful, too. Overall, a good, useful and worthwhile purchase for the homeowner 
 And that's exactly what 'Midnight Marauders' is...an album for eternity!  Hundreds of years from now, this album will still resonate through the ears of its listeners.  How many groups do you know (especially hip hop) can make back to back to back classic records in a span of three - four years?  As a matter of fact, how many records do you know where you can play the whole thing without reachin' for the skip button?  The Tribe just had a way of connecting with their fanbase and they continued to uplift their legacy with their greatest offering yet.            Once again, Phife and Tip are a two headed monster tearin' the frame out of some smooth like butter beats that will keep heads bouncin'.  What makes A Tribe Called Quest's third record one of my all-time personal favorites are all the little things that real rap listeners notice.  Maybe it's the xylaphones sprinkled in on "Award Tour", Ali Shaheed Muhammods masterfully cut sample of Rakim on "We Can Get Down", or Q-Tips descriptive tale of New York nightlife on "Midnight".  Whatever the reason, the beats and rhymes effortlessly go hand in hand.  Hell, Phife is so confident in his mic skills that he boasts, "I'm Jordan with the mic/ Wanna gamble"?         You may never hear such a cohesive album like 'Midnight Marauders' again.  Even the computerized voice drops knowledge, bridging the gaps between songs.  The subject matter was diversified to keep people on their toes.  Q-Tip educates on the controversial usage of the N-word with quips such as, "You know the word dummy/ other people in the community think its crummy/ But I don't, 'cause the youth we em-brace adversity it goes right with the race/...and bein' that we use it as a term of endearment/".  Phife tells his version of freaky tales on the hypnotic "8 Million Stories".  Large Professor (the only outsider on the production tip) produced one beat which amazingly fit perfectly with the tribe vibe on "Keep It Rollin'".  Who could forget that chant of "yeah, yeah now check the method"?  In spite of the superb quality of songwriting and musicality, the unquestionable standout is "Electric Relaxation".  The song is a crowning achievement of hip hop in its purest form.  Ali hooks up a beat for the hip hop hall of fame as Tip and Phife give a monumental performance.  In conclusion, 'Midnight Marauders' was a masterpiece from the brilliant sequencing to the who' who in hip hop album cover.  There were actually three album covers of different rap stars in the background with the black cover being the rarest.  You have to wonder if ATCQ was mocking the inside of the cover, standing by the clock because of the timelessness of their music they put out.  They even teased their listeners by bringing the computerized voice in, after "The Chase" saying it concludes the program when there was still two incredible songs to follow.  Whatever the case, never say the year 'cause this one is for eternity 
 This book is a revelation of many of the important papers of the Golden Dawn of MacGregor Mathers, A. Crowley, W.B. Yeats and others.  It presents systematically the early stages of study in the Golden Dawn Tradition.  There is nothing that a Golden Dawn temple will provide in writing about the first 3 or 4 grades of advancement toward adepthood.  I took away a couple of points because of the author's terse and slightly archaic method of writing and for the fact that he wrote an entire chapter on enochian magick and enochian chess after admitting in the first sentence that he knew nothing about them.  In any case, it's a great beginner to intermediate level source book for correspondences, Golden Dawn tradition and explanation of hermetic symbology.  For the serious student, not for someone looking for light reading 
  This is the best of the Alison Weir books I have read, and the others are 5 star books as well.  The beginning part develops the characters, the later part is more reportorial.  Weir concludes with a summary of Isabella's role as a revolutionary.  Isabella clearly defied the narrow female role of her times, but her revolutionary role, in my view, was accidental.  It was not the confiscation of land of the nobles, nor the suspension of habeas corpus that motivated her, it was the suspension of her revenues and it seems to a lesser extent, her forced separation from the crown prince.   She was clever in "networking" with the many who had grievances against Edward II, and wise in her pardoning her adversaries and paying her supporters.  Weir guides us towards blaming Mortimer for the re-institution of conficatory policies.  I'm not convinced. As a woman in this time, Isabella surely needed male support and advice.  Perhaps he steered in the directions she wanted to go.  Medieval England is barbarous, in many ways.  The descriptions of the hangings anesthetize the reader to the ultimate burial of Isabella.  There are incisive descriptions of the relationships with Scotland, France and other continental courts, and the church.  These narratives contribute to making the book more than just a good read for the lay reader. 
 Anthony Gittins draws from a wealth of cultural experiences, not all his own, to produce a refreshing, challenging view of human community.  We in the Western world need to grasp the values Gittins expresses, to engage in  humble, personal ways the many-splendored cultural expressions of dignity,  value, growth, and community manifested in the peoples of the world around  us.  Many have called mankind through the ages to forego petty differences  of style and expression, and focus on the common life values; Gittins casts  this call in relevant issues of our day.  In doing so, he points the way to  what appears to be new territory, yet which evokes the memory of Home 
 Tom is like a part of your genetic makeup, you either have it or you don't, some try to suppress it like curly hair but it's always there. Anyway the symptoms are you love everything this man says or does and forgive all if ever you need to, watch down by law or listen to his interviews, I dont get to have many emotions being an office worker but the closest I came was when I found out Tom had been on tour and I missed it, worst day of my life 
 The COB DVD is a must buy....I should say this one has all the songs that had to be here except that Everytime I Die is a little bit slower here....anyway they pull of this one, Silent Night Bodom Night, Hatebreeder and Needled 24/7....Buy this and play this to your home theater player along with LOG (Killadelphia), Machine Head(Elegies), Megadeth(Rude Awakening), Arch Enemy(My Apocalypse) and Dream Theater(Live in Budokan) and its like you are in a festival...  Children of Bodom Rule 
 This is a great book for a first course in process control.  It has a very good layout that builds up concepts until the end.  I agree that this book may not be an ideal reference book because it is hard to pick up half way through.  However, I think it lays out the foundation for true understanding of the subject.  I keep this book on my shelf at all times and find myself reaching for it to refresh my memory on control concepts 
 This was a great book. For the first half of the book I found myself admiring and wishing I was like the main characters. They seemed to be able to see a truth that we could not. It was not until the second half of the book that I realized that they were all just as self important and full of crap as those they criticize.  I went from deep admiration and respect to a profound pity and almost revulsion for the two main characters. This is not just a book for college students, this is a book that anyone with a sense of humor and an hour or two to spare will enjoy. Even though it is full of witty humor, this is not a book that I would call an up lifting read 
 Anne of Avonlea was almost as good as the first Anne book. It is about Anne's life as a school teacher in Avonlea. Marilla adopts two mischievous twins and Mrs. Rachel Lynde moves in. So life is never dull for Anne at the school house or at Green Gables. You could read it on its own, but I recommend you read Anne of Green Gables first 
 This book is excellent.  Unless you're a programming genius as well as a Perl genius, this book will teach a a lot of cool Perl tricks, and a lot of cool programming techniques which can be applied to all sorts of thorny problems and even implemented in other languages (although, some of the techniques might be a real pain to  write in one of the "real" programming languages i.e. C/C++/C#/Java). I am much more of a Python programmer and I tend to avoid Perl if I can, but reading this book makes me want to write Perl code again. OK, maybe that feeling doesn't last for long, but it reminds why Python (and Ruby!) owe so much to Perl and the Perl community 
 This was a good-great book for the Apollo method but as one who has read a lot of these types of books, e.g., TQM, I found the sales pitch a little strong. The explanations were excellent with a step-by-step development, but I see nothing special here. Almost any RCA book will provide similar material. An alternative to this book could be: "Root Cause Analysis A tool for total quality management," or "Quality Improvement Toos & Techniques." The later is an excellent overview of the methods available for investigating problems --- and it is fairly inexpensive. I recommend Dean Gano's book if the Apollo RCA is your flavor 
 This is the 3rd book I used to help me pass the Exam.  First, I bought a big thick one, then a smaller one, and finally this one.  The main reason I bought this book was for the questions: 650 practice questions!  All the other training books just give you 10 questions per chapter; no way near enough to test someone.  However, my suggestion is to not even use the book.  Just use the CD that comes with it, becuase it has all the questions from the book, and you can grade your answer instantly instead of having to turn to all different pages.  I will admit though, there are some errors on questions.  I've found quite a few mistakes in this book, but at any rate, these book really helps out.  I took the test today and saw some quite a couple of similar questions from this book on the exam 
 FLOW MY TEARS, THE POLICEMAN SAID is a drug induced romp through a future that has already happened.  Or is it?    [...] dope, he thought.  You can always tell when it hits you but never when it unhits, if it ever does.  It impairs you forever or so you think so; you can't be sure.  Maybe it never leaves.  And they say, Hey man, your brain's burned out, and you say, maybe so.  You can't be sure and you can't be not sure."  I have read other Philip K. Dick works and FLOW MY TEARS had been on my "to be read" list for years.  I finally bought it just prior to a business trip that would include a half-dozen airport hours.  The main (anti-hero) character, Jason Taverner, is everyman and no-man.  As anyone familiar with Dick knows, he was ahead of his time, in the company of Heinlein, Bradbury, and Asimov.  This story, with its "Police State" setting, is suddenly current and relevant to 2006.  A quick and easy read on the surface, if consumed cerebrally, the twists and machinations that Dick works into the "two" worlds, reveal a startlingly philosophical look at what constitutes identity and reality. 
 I am teach Natural Childbirth, and, as such, have read many, many books concerning pregnancy and childbirth.  I absolutely love the tone in which this book is written!  Pregnancy is truly a special, beautiful time in a  woman's life, and birth ought to be as well.  I have enjoyed the  nourishment tea recipe the author includes, as well as the useful herbal  information.  Beware, however, of the pagan content.  It is a wonderful  book 
 This book provides a great study guide for the CPM exam.  The book is divided into the 4 sections of the exam which allows you to focus on the necessary material.  It also includes a CD with lots of sample exam questions you can use to practice 
 Written by golf club designer Tom Wishon with former golf club maker Tom Grundner, The Search for the Perfect Driver is a one-of-a-kind book especially for golf players who wonder why they can spend a small fortune on just the right driver only to see their shots worsen. The average driver length on the PGA tour of 2004-2005 was 44.5 inches, implying that the best golfers in the world felt they couldn't control a 45 or 46-inch club with optimum precision; and yet it is this size of club, unwieldy to most golfers, that is commonly presented to ordinary golfers in stores and shops. This striking detail and other nuances of why and how too many drivers are designed from the factory to be unhittable in the hands of an average golfer in The Search for the Perfect Driver, as are details concerning how to fix driver faults by looking at one's own shots, how to choose the right driver for one's swing, retrofitting, special needs for female, child, senior, and advanced golfers, and much more. Enthusiastically recommended for anyone serious about improving their golf score, as is Winshon's and Grundner's previous guide, "The Search for the Perfect Golf Club. 
 I have loved this show from the very first time it was on the air. But it has never caught on with mainstream viewers. Even introducing it right after the super bowl was not enough to get it into the mainstream. It's just to intense for most people. Most cop shows solve or at least give you some closure to the criminal acts they show in their prepackaged 1 hour. Not here.   In 'Homicide' the Adena Watson case is never solved. And the emotional weight of the dead girl is constantly around in many of these episodes to haunt the detectives as are the other "vics" whose names we see on the board in red. That's real life for you. Led by the genius detective Frank Pembleton (Andre Braugher), the acting is first rate throughout the cast. This DVD, seasons 1 & 2, is Homicide at it's gritty best. Before the later seasons when they began caving to network pressure to introduce younger more physically attractive detectives for better ratings.  
 Within the Context of No Context is a perceptive and melancholy essay (and a better read than its sequel, MY PILGRIM'S PROGRESS) about the effect of mass communication on the national psyche

 I found this book thoroughly absorbing,  a meal for the intellect and the soul.    Martha Gellhorn was a woman ahead of her time.  Carolyn Moorehead does a good job of chronicling each chapter of Gellhorn's illustrious life as a war correspondent and writer.  And what an amazing span of history Martha witnessed, from the Spanish Civil War up to the invasion of Panama.  A rather fearless woman who "ran with the wolves", Gellhorn had friendships and love affairs with legends.  Of course, she is known for having been married to Ernest Hemingway... but she was also friend and confidant of H.G. Wells, Eleanor Roosevelt, Leonard Bernstein... and she crossed paths with Diego Rivera, Colette, Adlai Stevenson, and many other notables of the 20th Century.  Marha really had two great loves in her life:  being where the action was, where the great issues of the century were being decided, and secondly , escaping to colorful places where she could find solitude. She best loved the places that afforded freedom and sun, like Mexico, Cuba and Kenya.   Of course,she was full of contradictions, personally, and unsuited for motherhood. I  wish only that this book had exposed more of her acute observations about the way that the world works, and her true courage.  This is a woman who at 85 yrs. of age, suffering from macular degeneration and other maladies, made a valiant effort to continue speaking for the oppressed.  She was sharp until the end of her days.  Moorehead has of this writing published a book of Gellhorn's letters which better illuminates Martha's character, and should serve as a good companion to this biography.  Christiane Amanpour,  Lara Logan et. al. owe a great debt to this woman, though they can hardly hope to match her  reportorial savvy and brilliance.   As Moorehead acknowledges, Martha inspires nostalgia for the days when a reporter went to the core of things, with words honestly written in simple notebooks--words that could be believed.  She believed all governments inexorably abused power.  She said of Lyndon Johnson: "Never trust a Texan further than you can throw a rhino."    Martha, you rocked.    
 I HAVE BEEN A SPIKE LEE FAN FOR A LONG TIME,I PURCHASED THIS DVD AS A XMAS PRESENT FOR SOMEONE WHO HAD NEVER SEEN "DO THE RIGHT THING".SO WHEN I SAW THIS ONE WITH 5 MOVIES,I COULD NOT GO WRONG.THEY GOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE MORE OF HIS WORK.THIS IS THE BEST DEAL I'VE EVER SEEN,ANYONE THINKING ABOUT PURCHASING ANY OF HIS MOVIES SHOULD JUST BUY THIS ONE.PEACE AND BLESSINGS  
 I became an Anne Tyler fan after reading The Homesick Restaurant and The Clock Winder. (Homesick is my favorite so far.)  Morgan's Passing was more difficult for me to "enjoy", although I still find it to be a tremendous novel.  Perhaps some part of the problem is that as a woman I can't fully relate to Morgan's experience of a kind of male "mid-life crisis" (although it really is too simplistic to call it that). Mainly, though, the characters are just so incredibly real and flawed and confused and their behavior and feelings so contradictory and disturbing at times that, like the real people in our lives, it can be hard to like them.  Anne Tyler is a master at depicting her characters in all of their many human dimensions -- no tidy little fairy tale here 
 I only want to say: if you like this novel, try to get your hands at the 'Donkere Kamer van Damocles', The Dark Room of Damocles" by the Dutch author W.F. Hermans. It's just as brilliant, even for those that don't live  in Holland and therefore, i think, must put more effort in understanding  the typical Dutch atmosphere Hermans present. About Das Parfum: it's  exciting, brilliant, brilliant and so on. What to say about a book this  good 
 Considering that three of the four of the novellas were made into major motion pictures, the pictures do capture the essence of the original text.  I saw the film, "The Shawshank Redemption" before having read the novel, and I couldn't believe that such a story line could fit into so few pages!  King touches upon many tastes in this novel.  I think that "Apt Pupil" tends to be the most "horrific", and suprisingly, is my least favorite.  As an animal lover, I object to some of the actions in this story, but it didn't stop me from reading or loving the story.    If you're not a typical King fan, this book my change your mind, at least for the length of the novel.  His "narrator" theme is always someone involved in the story, and not your omniscent or first person, either.    Give it a try, it is highly recommended. 
 What a story!   And yes, I said story because the author has taken subjects most of us take for granted (the size of the heavens, the age of the Earth, the intricacies of the atom) and turned these into a wonderful almost joyous tale of intellectual achievement.  I am still stunned at the depth of scholarship, the vast research and the almost magical manner in which Ferris manages to make what appears to be an arcane dry topic into an intriguing saga.  Ok, I admit it. I love science books written for the educated layman - from "The Singularity is Near " to "Wonderful Life" to the philosophical tomes of Pagels and Hardison.  But this is more than science - it is also a history of who we are and our physical, mental and dare I say it, spiritual evolution. In this sense it reminds one of "The Discoverers" by Boorstin with its chronological structure, emphasis upon individual genius and captivating storyline. Beginning with the ancients, we see how our ideas fashion our intellectual quests.  The overwhelming success of Western culture depended on our ability to break with age-old traditions, to absorb ideas from the outside and most importantly, to challenge the  traditional religious beliefs. Very few cultures have been able to accomplish this and their lack of scientific prowess is evidence.    The individual tales could occupy a volume themselves - mind-boggling examples of thought that are so rare we have trouble believing them. Not only are Darwin (Evolution challenged the prevailing age of the Earth) and Newton (the greatest human who ever lived?) are found but all the unknown heroes of the ages are given their due.  The author has an uncanny way of  simplifying tremendously dense concepts into language for the layman.  This was never truer than his discussion on the weird world of quantum physics with its seemingly magical and nonsensical qualities. I would say that this should be required reading for all high school graduates except that a vast number would be bewildered by the concepts presented, unaware that science has a history of more than video games and cars.  My grade - A+++  
 Sent in a timely fashion, at a good price.  Professional all the way.  Will definitely trade again 
 I didn't buy this blade from Amazon but I bought the exact same one from an Anime Convention for 30 dollars more. So this is a good price for it. The blade lives up to the gun-blade reputation Yeah some of it is a little screwed up from the exact replica but it comes damn near close. The blade is beautiful and it is easy to weild. Only sword you'd have trouble weilding out of the FF Weaponry would be the ACUTAL replica of the Buster Sword (I have that on order..should be fun). I highly recommand this blade even if you don't like final fantasy 
 This watch was a perfect buy.  I started running this summer and I needed an inexpensive stopwatch and this is a quality purchase. 
 Carl Deuker's fourth book for young adults is another winner filled with fast paced action and surprises all along the way. Night Hoops is a fantastic book for sports lovers and Mike Lupica fans. All four of his books were nominated for ALA best book for young adults. 	  Nick Abbot always thought of Trent Dawson as a punk or a thug who was always getting himself into deep trouble. But when Nick Abbot only wants to make it on the school basketball team at school. But so is Trent Dawson and Nick tries to learn more about him than his family saying that Trent is a bad influence because his brother gets into to much trouble and his mom is a bad influence. But Nick doesn't care what he hears because when the coach tells him to help Trent or sit on the bench he decides to keep his spot on the team and become friends with Trent. While trying to figure this out Nick needs to show his family the same thing. But it gets harder to do when Trent makes a big mistake and Nick needs to help Trent see his mistake.   By the end of Night Hoops you will see the friendship that Nick and Trent have becomes stronger than ever. It will keep you thinking hard about this book from front to back. 
 To the reviewer who states that Islam is not a devine religion: Islam did gie rise to a civilisation based on harmony and decency.  This is someting that Europe can not grasp.  Islamic societies never committed mass genocide (e.g Australia, the America, treatment of Jews during WW2).  Look at slavery and the Inquisition next time you decide to praise the'West'.    ISlam has shown that it can work unlike communism.  The Abbasid dynasty is an example.  Islam teaches individuals to strive to better the conditions of mankind and the environment.  Europe gave us the Industrial Revolution which has destroyed the environment and drained natural resources.    Next time you decide to write a review make sure you have done your research otherwise you will not be able to argue your point in a cogent manner.  I would be more than happy to discuss this topic with you: omarmadhloom@yahoo.co.uk.   If you want to see Islam in practice look at: Amir Abd Al Qadir, Omar Al- Mukhtar and Muhammad Asad to name but a few.   
 Growing up, there was always that one person you wanted to be.  That one person you were reminded of everyday in the media that seemed so much more glamorous than your average lifestyle.  For Donald Duk, being Chinese wasn't quite satisfying enough.  He dreamt about being Fred Astaire, his Americanized idol.  The whole novel bases its message on being happy with what you got, something I feel important growing up in a self-centered America. 	Donald is a 12 year old boy living in the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco.  His life experiences are similar to the stereotyped foreigner.    He gets made fun of by the Chinatown bullies, leaving him with no self-respect and dignity for himself.  He realizes the stereotypical aspects of American-Chinese and it drives him to unhealthily hate himself.  I think the message of this book can reach out to so many people who are in similar situations with their social life. 	The novel puts Donald in a period of life where self image starts to become an important thing.  I could really connect to this because around the same period of my life, this was also important.  He wants to just be American so bad that he has negativity for all things Chinese.  Hatred is found in several ways including food, culture, and way of life.  He hates the weird foods; he hates the embarrassing, easy to baffle names including his.  Donald is constantly being made fun of by his ridiculous link to the Walt Disney Donald Duck.  Even his mother's name is Daisy.  He even hates his uncle who performs Chinese opera seldom at him school; imagine that.  Even his best friend appreciates the culture more than he does.  Basically he would do anything to be anything but Chinese.  I know I've been so ungrateful at times.  After reading this novel, you feel much more self-assured.  You don't get that much in literature. 	This book contains good balance to imply the message with the introduction of Donald's father, King Duk.  He is the wise, old man carrying mentoring features for Donald.  If it weren't for his father, Donald would be lost in American culture.  He shows him how to adapt instead of completely transform.  He makes it important that instead of being laughed at, laugh with.  You don't gain much knowledge with out experience. 	If you're not familiar with Chinese culture, some parts of the book can be a little cloudy.  There were some parts that I could get completely lost in, but the ultimate message shined through.  The dreams that he endures about being an underground rail-road builder in the 1800's is what turns him around.  The dream sequences were my favorite, switching the story up with eccentric details.  He finds out that the Chinese are just as creditable as anyone else and have received no recognition for it.  He starts to appreciate where he has come from, becoming a happier person.  The adaptation process starts to come easy to him, making him proud of his individualism. 	Sometimes you just need the help of others to see more clearly.  For Donald, his dreams opened up the passageway for him.  Also, through the help of his family and friends, he could actually start to enjoy himself.  Chinese culture is one that holds a lot of values.  Back in China, death could even result from breaking this.  Throughout the book, the main values presented were family, respect, and righteousness.  Frank Chin did a very good job of combining freedom of choice by America with the traditional values of Chinese.  This is a book we could all learn a little from. 
 I am a guy with absolutely no talent at baking but always thought the art of pastry making was interesting.  So, i bought all the essential tools and waited for the book(after having seen most of the shows on PBS)...when the book arrived, I started with a fairly difficult pastry ...the Dainish Braid....turned out so well and tasted so delicious that I shocked myself...keep in mind, I cant cook!!!  Here is my point.  With the right tools, a good guide, and a brain, anyone can do just about anything.  So get the book,(its a great guide) watch the shows, and just go for it!  Here are some tools that helped...Kitchenaid stand mixer, a food processor, a marble pastry board and a wooden one too, a bench scrape(you really need this for any dough), s/steel measuring cups for dry ingredients, glass for liquid, parchment paper, and a baking stone.  Then just decide that nothing is going to intimidate you and start baking. There are tricks to every trade and this book shares a lot of those as a great companion book to the series 
 Her newest series ( this would be 3 in the series)is just great fun to read. The characters are so easy to like, the writing flows. Such pleasant reading here, I look forward to more 
 Seurat's,'La Grande Jatte' spelled the limits of petti-borgeoise modernity. For the previous 20 years, the Impressionists, led by the incomparably gifted, Manet, had attempted to make images describing this class, their appearance & behaviour. However,the Impressionists were bourgeoise & inevitably more aligned to their own class, and with the simultaneous rise of the dealer-critic system. Thus the steady sequence of shows, interviews & promotional literature issuing from managed,'creative' artists became the commonplace we experience in the arts today. The new class disappeared from Impressionist art when it was absorbed into the bourgeoise.Witness Monet's shrewd disavowal of the figure as he opted for his less offensive, touristy canon of landscapes. The detatchment of Manet's barmaid at the Follies, 1882,and the inanimate, even catatonic people in Degas's pictures of this period exemplify the new class. Clark argues that the emergence of this class was a product of the rebuilding of Paris by Baron von Haussmann. The old work centre of the city was guttered during the rejig, the trades & graves moved to new peripheries, and commercial entertainments, leisure & pleasure grew in their place to cater for this new white-collar mass public. The questionable role of prostitution is crucial to Clark's claims for this class and it is on this question that Manet is pre-eminent. This era announced the rise of capitalism and the spectacle society of which Clark is a major critical voice. Prodigious scholarship, marvellous insights, with fascinating, rarely reproduced 'secondary' art works to flesh out the theme; I can't think of a better way of teasing back the past to view the present 
 I've read the book due to an examination about "the new city structure - contemporary geography" and it's quite good, she has a global wiew of the new city-status and its new users, the less and less  importance the homless has for the city governament and the new power of  the corporation, all in all a good compendium if you need to improve your  knoledge about the matter 
 The lady is back. Sasha is once again up to her eyeballs in men. First there's sexy basketball star Phoenix Carter, her old flame & boss. Then there's a new interest in her life, the handsome banker Jordan Ashe. Then there's her old flame Trent, who resurfaces. And last but not least, there's the sexy Lyor Turrell, who has a plan all his own. This book has more twist & turns than a roller coaster. I really enjoyed the book, it will hold your attention, and make you wonder, "How does the lady do it? 
 The print used for the DVD transfer is bright and clear without a trace of dirt or scratches*, the best this film has looked in years or decades.  Although the slight graininess of the original 16 mm print is visible in this digital restoration, as is the slight hiss from the 37-year-old soundtrack, neither detracts from enjoyment of this classic tale of debauchery and image shifting in swinging London.  Like "Blow Up" and "Morgan!" it documents a time of endless experimentation in life and the arts, and it's fun just to revisit these old haunts in my dotage.  The extras on the disc are pretty neat too: an original trailer from Warner Bros. (who had absolutely NO IDEA how to market this film), a period hagiography of Jagger full of misinformation about him, the film and the "Moooog synthesizer" [sic], and a 24-minute featurette of recent interviews.  Included are Pallenberg (who DOES show some "dirt and scratches"...), professor/producer/movie critic Colin MacCabe, 'Performance' producer Sanford Lieberson, associate producer David Cammell (brother of the late co-director Donald Cammell), editors Antony Gibbs and Frank Mazzola, cameraman Mike Molloy, Jack Nitzsche's son and Fred Weintraub from Warner Bros.  Their reminiscences and analyses are illuminating.  In all it's been an arduous, unaccountably long wait but the result is pretty wonderful.  "You're going to look funny when you're 50..."   * - Except for the scene under the covers, which might be by design 
 ...something good comes along".  "Down The Road" got plenty of accolades upon its release, and it deserved every one of them, being the best Van Morrison album in over a decade. But "What's Wrong With This Picture?" is just as good, swinging and grooving, mixing jazz, soul, and some of Morrison's most inspired blues shouting for many a long year.  This album isn't a straight jazz record, although the sublime title track may lead you to think so, but it does contain some of the greatest horn arrangements ever on a Van Morrison record, including appearances by Acker Bilk, Matt Holland and the excellent tenor saxist Martin Winning (not to mention Morrison's own alto saxophone).  Van Morrison does a very credible Big Joe Turner on the thumping R&B of "Whining Boy Moan", and lays down a blistering cover of Sam "Lightnin'" Hopkins' "Stop Drinkin'", and he swings like you won't believe on "Too Many Myths", "Once In A Blue Moon", and "Somerset". But it's really impossible to point out the highlights on this magnificent record; it is melodic, superbly arranged, and one of those very few albums which contain no weak tracks whatsoever 
 Another great story by Danielle Steel... This time she writes a passionate love story between a pilot and a young girl. Joe is a handsome and successful pilot and businessman. He meets Kate when she is 17 years old and still in college. Even though her mother disapproves, she begins to date Joe and falls in love. They begin to live together, but eventually Kate finds out that he does not want to get married or have children. She decides to end the relationship and marry her good friend Andy, who is a stable and loving husband.   Kate soon discovers that she cannot forget Joe. Even though she is married with a child now, she realizes that she is still in love with him and will always be. Fate brings them together again one day in New York City and their lives are changed forever.   A powerful love story filled with all the sole searching and passion that makes live meaningful 
  Mark Lytle does fine justice to the legacy of Rachel Carson in this well researched summary of her early life, upbringing, education, professional experiences, evolution of her writing and publishing culminating with the struggles to write and publish her most potent and last book, "Silent Spring", a dire warning of how deadly pesticide and herbicide assaults were damaging the health of ecosystems and non-targeted life forms including humans and which many proffer, launched the modern age of  environmentalism.  Lytle continues Carson's beautiful legacy in his "Epilogue" and "Afterword".  Packed with an abundance of notes, citations and bibliography, this little book gives one a huge sense of awe and admiration for Carson's perseverance and dedication to educate the world about the interconnectedness and beauty of Nature and to cultivate a sense of responsibility and good stewardship. 
 Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) was a prodigy of imagination. He started his writer career quite late; his first work was published in 1912. From that point on a ceaseless flow of imaginary worlds & heroes poured from his pen: John Carter of Mars, Carson Napier of Venus, David Innes and Abner Perry on Pellucidar at Earth's center and the most famous of them all Tarzan of the Apes.   Tarzan's world is Africa. But an extraordinary Africa populated with apes more intelligent than any known ones and in later adventures with a plethora "lost cities", "ant-men" or whatever suit ERB in order to deliver a fast paced adventure.  As many other reviewers point out do not expect "politically correct" tales, they are the product of a society still torn by racial prejudices.  Another assumption that closely follows this is: "superior traits" are inherited directly and a Lord will always be a Lord no matter what the circumstances. The reader may assume all this adventures occurs in an "alternate reality" that have some common traits with our world such as the ones depicted by Guy Gavriel Kay for example.  Now you'll be ready to enjoy the original story of Tarzan as it was delivered by ERB, free from Hollywood changes or comic stereotypes. A couple of English nobles are abandoned by a mutinous crew in the coast of Africa where they barely survive. Adversity proves to be more than what they may endure and both die leaving an infant that is miraculously adopted by Kala an anthropoid that has lost her baby-ape. Protected by her Tarzan starts a life struggle to conquer a space among the over towering brutes. His natural intelligence combined with a strengthening body allows him to survive and in due time lead the ape tribe. ERB ability renders all this astounding fates credible: Tarzan learns to read and write all by himself; Tarzan defeats a Gorilla with his father's knife; Tarzan helps a group of marooned white people and fell in love with Jane; Tarzan...continue delivering one prowess after other... and you'll believe it.  I read "Tarzan of the Apes" at my teens and continue reading many of his 23 following adventures, borrowing volume after volume from a nearby library. When I grow up and gain economic independence I bought and kept this book and some more Tarzans.  I warmly recommend this series to any reader who is fond to read unending adventures in a magic world. If after reading Tarzan's stories you still want more from ERB try the Martian series, they are almost as good as this one. Reviewed by Max Yofre 
 IN A NUTSHELL:  Beautiful soft animation with incredible detail brings this character driven doggie-tale to life. The songs, like all great animated classics work into the plot and are a great aid in telling the story, making the film entertaining and making children of all ages happy.   BUT THERE IS MORE -- MUCH MORE: DOG'S TELL THEIR OWN TALE!  Dog's tell their own tale in this one. Unlike "101 Dalmations", which Disney also made several years after this film, the humans are basically not substancial characters. The humans' role is simply as a background setting for the tale of the Lady and the Tramp, which is completely appropriate for this kind of tale.   WHAT MAKES "THE LADY AND THE TRAMP SO DARN GOOD"?  1]- The 9 "Old Men" were really at the top of their game when they animated the major characters of the film. In the featurette, in the 50th anniversary edition, we see exactly what these very talented guys were aiming for and some of the interesting stuff they came up with for Walt Disney.  2]- The music and lyrics are well timed, entertaining and really help set up the many varying moods of the individual scenes. The soundtrack also furthers the plot, and helps us to really like who and what we are seeing on the screen. In short, the tunes help to humanize the doggies, and in that way assist in telling a multi-level tale that means something to kids, something to adults, and something collectively to everyone. "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" and "The Incredibles" also clearly illustrate that multi-level trait.  3]- The story itself is well constructed with clever while appropriate dialogue, and a very eclectic blend of characters with dogs and humans both being from a very broad and diverse background.   The small town, on the verge of the modern age, still is a special and desirable place to be in this film. Things like telephones and early automobiles are just barely hinted at in a few scenes.  4]- Cinemascope was used, for one of the first times in this film, and simply put it makes for a larger, broader world with a lot more background animation. Disney actually filmed two completely drawn versions of this film, Cinemascope [widescreen], and Full-Screen, because many theatres were not equipped to play cinemascope films in 1956.  DVD FEATURES: THIS VERSION HAS VERY FEW UNLIKE 50TH ANNIVERSARY ED.  BOTTOM LINE:   Get the 50th Anniversary Edition if you want features and a remastered Cinemascope picture. We did and we are delighted 
 I would like to purchase this book but I am challenged by all your leads off the subject 
 This movie is NOT the sequel to Dances with Wolves! It's just the same movie except that instead of indians these are samurais!!  Of course, this movie have MORE ACTION than Dances with Wolves, more warfare, more cool fights and more blood!!! I could say that Last Samurai is better than Dances but ONLY because of the action, the story is a little predictable but still interesting.  P.S: If you have seen Dances with Wolves then you obviouslly note the differences between this one and Dances, but basically they are the same.  Adios. 
 While I don't consider myself a survivalist by any stretch, this book is an excellent reference for folks who do any degree of practical camping.  By "practical camping", I mean the type of camping that has more variables than where to park the camper.  I have never been in a survival situation, but I've camped enough times know (and see) that the stuff hits the fan often enough to be prepared.  This book is a great tool for giving you a general idea of how to react to certain situations.  However, this volume is not an end-all be-all outdoor guide, as some of the information was questionable.  The parts about water purification, fire making, and primitive fishing were interesting and informative, but some of the first aid suggestions (particularly snake bites, which can be easy to get in the bush) were a bit unsound.  For that, I would suggest a book geared directly towards first aid, which was my solution.  All in all, however, I was pleased with this manual.  It gives some interesting perspectives on how to improvise when you're in a tight spot.  This book would be handy for anyone who spends time outdoors, even camper-dwellers. :- 
 Apt's introduction does an outstanding job of discussing why this is such a popular sport, reviewing critical equipment decisions, and providing logical cautions relevant to the experienced as well as novice showshoe advocate.  The trails are well defined, the information is accurate, and the writing style is casual with a sense of humor. Apt really did his homework and provides trail recommendations that are appropriate for EVERY skill level - even family outings!   Great book and "must have" reference for outdoor lovers 
 This is a very nice, impressionistic look at railroading, with a bonus:  much of the artwork is of my hometown of Norman, Oklahoma.  I used to wait  for trains at some of these places 
 Not one of Baldacci's best. The characters are not well fleshed out. But yet it does make for a fast read. 3 1/2 stars, I bumbed it up to four because of the finale.  That being said we have a whistler-blower, Faith Lockhart, who has information that will allow the FBI to put away quite a few Congressmen. Problem is the CIA has been using her boss to gather Intel on these same Congressmen for their own purposes. In steps an unsuspecting Private Investigator who just happens to do everything he can to save Faith. All the while both the FBI and the CIA are seeking them after.  This story has blackmail and plot twist that you will not see coming. But in hindsight you will see they were well developed. The ending of the book is actually pure Baldacci. It is well written and is worth the read. 
 I love doug he's absolutely incredible! more love is one of his best albums I think! there is not a song on here that I do not love love love! he's absolutely gorgeous! i've loved doug for 12yrs and I will love him forever and ever. go buy this album it so so so so rocks!!!!!!!!!! love southern hottie 
 This book starts with the fundamental aspects of a system, its life cycles and then goes into data gathering and system design. I think it is an excellent book to start with for persons in MIS/ computer related  fields.the book alos comes with a software in which various CASE tools are  featured.The hypercase experience is most interesting where actually u  interview people taking the role of a systems analyst 
 Great pictures and easy to understand text.  Fun to read at circle time. Perfect to leave in science area next to a tub of worms 
 My ears first delighted to this jewel of an album on a driftboat trip through the Rogue River valley, and it's been one of my favorites ever since. Highly recommended to anyone with an appreciation for great music 
 A contemporary of Piaget (developmental psychology)and Watson (behaviorism), Vygotsky launches a cogent critique and synthesis of these two scientific schools. His asserting that learning leads development is as fresh and valuable today as it was when he first wrote the text. Secondly, his calling for a functional analysis of language has been pursued only by the behavioral schools; a short-fall of cognitive and developmental psychology which focuses on the structure of language and hypothetical constructs of brain functioning. Vygotsky relied on observable behavior under contrived and natural conditions in developing his model of socially mediated learning. Although he does a bit of theorizing, his view of learning speech and thought--a skill taught and mediated by social forces--is an excellent bridge between the two schools of thought mentioned above. This book should be required reading for developmental psychologists, educators and behaviorists alike 
 Diamonds and Rust (D&R), is perhaps Baez's most reflective work.  Rather than rely solely on her soprano power with the obligatory Dylan tune thrown in, reaches deep into her psyche and soul in this collection of "folky" type songs.  There is the Dylan tune for sure ("Simple Twist of Fate"), where the songstress mimics Dylan's voice for a verse and hits it pretty close to dead on.  The album contains two "finger pointing songs" about Bobby.  "Wings of the Old Days" is clearly about Dylan,("I read that the prince had returned to the stage"), however the cover song could be about her ex David Harris although the lyrics seem to suggest a link to Dylan and their love affair.  She covers John Prince ("Hello in There") and provides plenty of material for the folk crowd.  The strength of D&R does not come from the individual songs but rather from the collection as a whole.  Taking us back to the early '60's, through Vietnam, then redemption and finally acceptance of what we went through.  Baez released D&R around the same time Dylan released "Blood on the Tracks", and a year or so prior to the Rolling Thunder Tour in which Baez was so prominantely featured.  The tradegy perhaps is that she will always be linked to Dylan and is trapped in the folk "protest" era.  Dylan escaped due to the force of his talent and with his artistic integrity intact.  Baez can't really rock but she can sing with the best of them and D&R proves it 
 Steppenwolf the Second may be Steppenwolf's best overall album. It entirely features original material, without any ineffective tracks. This album is known for the excellent but overplayed Magic Carpet Ride, yet there were plenty of other highlights. The opening track rocks hard, and could have been another biker anthem along the lines of Born to Be Wild. There were plenty of other highlights including the rocking Don't Step On the Grass Sam, creative ballad Spiritual Fantasy, and well structured pop songs such as None of Your Doing and 28. 28 may have been partially hindered by Edmonton's sub-par vocals, but the song itself was a quality composition in lyrics, melody, and chord selection. A successful lengthy blues suite dominated the majority of the second side, before segueing into the hangover like final track, Reflections. This album is uniformly strong, and recommended for those who buy albums, rather than best-of compilations 
 Imperial Woman describes the rise of Tzu-Hsi the last empress of China. In superior articualtion she weaves a story of a concubine's fight to be empress and to transcend a would be sealed fate. Ms. Buck is clear and her  story reads easily. There is no confusion if you pay attention. The story  has plenty of suspense to keep the reader entranced. The portrait is  largely sympathetic. A very worthwhile read 
 Spanish actor Gael Garcia Barnel, whom American audiences know from "Motorcycle Diaries" and "Y Tu Mama Tambien," turns in a credible performance as a young American just out of the Navy, who tracks down the man (William Hurt) who once fathered him out of wedlock. Now married with teenage children and pastor of a large congregation in Corpus Christi, the man is in no mood to accept a son conceived in sin, and his refusal sets in motion a kind of murderous vendetta that is played out in the rest of the film.  Once you accept the premise of the story, the unexpected and sometimes implausible turns of plot take on an unavoidable inevitability, all the way to its abrupt ending. In an age of embarrassing revelations about the personal lives of high-profile church leaders, this film has a currency for viewers both in and out of the Bible Belt. Behind the blissful appearances, this particular preacher's family is unspeakably troubled, so much so that mother and daughter seem submerged in a grim silence, ready to bristle with resistance to the man who rules their lives. Meanwhile, his son, openly admired in public, draws his rebuke by revealing something of the boy's own personal anguish during a Sunday morning service. Barnel's Elvis (the "King" of the title) becomes a sweet-faced angel of vengeance, and when he's done there is virtually nothing left undone. This film rightly got two thumbs up from Ebert and Roeper. It's worth seeing 
 This book is a beautiful edition, and serves the purpose of explaining sybolism in art quite nicely. There is, though, one flaw: Most of the large color plates are spread across the spine of the book. This is not a problem for most, but as an art student, studying the paintings with 15% lost in the spine is a problem 
 This little book is a great guide for gardeners in zones 8 and 9 and even the more temperate regions of zone 7. Chapters are divided by Ornamental Grasses, Annual Vines, Small Shrubs, Small to Medium Shrubs, Medium to Large Shrubs, and Large Shrubs and Small Patio Trees. Each chapter profiles several plants that thrive in the hot and humid regions of the south. The plant profiles are very good and detailed and provide excellent descriptions as well as sound horiticultural advice. Each plant is illustrated with one or more color photos. Also very helpful is a chart covering the various sizes and characteristics of crepe mrytles. The last section of the book lists plants by various characteristics, such as light requirements, soil types, fragrance, color, etc. This is a good book for gardeners looking to experiment with unique and exciting plants and also very good for the transplanted gardener who has just moved to the southeast 
 Just when I thought real Hip Hop was gone...De La Soul came with it again. They have never compromised themselves to be like every other cookie cutter rapper, and doing that has made them better and better as the years go by. They always have something great to say and beat that will make you break yo neck!!! I love this CD and it is in heavy rotation in my car. If you love authentic, great, creative music...buy this CD 
 I had the privilege to attend a reading from this book, given by many of its contributors. The stories are powerful and familiar, in that they bring to mind my stories of coming of age. If you know an adolescent girl, I  would recommend that you buy a copy for her. And buy one for yourself, too.  For those of us who worry about how our daughters will navigate the shoals  of adolescence, this book offers stars to steer by 
 Workforce Scorecard is an awesome addition to the Strategy collection focussed on HR.   The authors clearly drive home the message that one of the key's to Business success is the focus on HR Strategy and Execution of the same. 
 I listen twice this soundtrack and i fall in love. I found music superb and stylish. When i saw the movie the music gave me emotion as Pride and Prejudice (Marianelli) and Volver (Iglesias). Book, movie and soundtrack i think you must have in your house for understand well a movie a book. GREAT! For everyone loves soundtrack 
 They are books like those written by Stephen Ambrose which keep the flame of my interest in reading of times and events of long ago burning. Some have accused Ambrose of taking too many liberties with the facts. To those I would say, Bah Humbug! This book is well written and worthy of the readers time, unless, of course, you are a "fact-checker", in which case the original sources, to the extent they even exist, might be more to your liking.  For Orginary Joe's, like me, Mr. Ambrose has provided a good deal of reading entertainment and information. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be transported in time and place to the high plains during the Indian Wars 
 I have enjoyed every book Al Franken writes, but this is clearly the best one to date. I recommend it to all conservatives who mindlessly follow their President without question. 
 The fatigues were just what my son wanted.  The only thing wrong was that there was no inseam available to order.  I guess on fatigues you are suppose to use the drawstring at the bottom.  But my son didn't want that so I had to hem about four inches on each leg.  Other than that it was an excellent product 
 For someone who only had a moderate interest in philosophy and ethics, this is a pretty good book to get. It includes works by various well-known philosophers (Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Hume, Kant, Mill, Nietzsche, Rawls) and is arranged in order of when the particular philospher lived.  There are also essays from other authors reacting to the writing of the philosopher. For example, Plato's "The Republic" is presented, followed by an essay title "Plato's Republic and Feminism" by Julia Annas. It aids in looks at classical philosphic texts in a more critical manner 
 I stumbled upon this book doing a search in Amazon.com.  It covers multi-generational ties and conflicts of mothers and daughters, Polish-American culture, and the changes throughout the generations.  It was a delight to read and I've passed it along to my daughter to read.  I'm sure she'll find much to compare with her 3rd generation Polish-American experience.  Well done, Leslie Pietrzyk.  Keep them coming 
 Power electronics is the technology associated with the efficient conversion, control and conditioning of electric power by static means from its available input form into the desired electrical output form. This conversion is performed with semiconductor switching devices such as diodes, thyristors and transistors. In contrast to electronic systems concerned with transmission and processing of signals and data, in power electronics substantial amounts of electrical energy are processed. The authors at MIT designed this text specifically to teach the subject of power electronics. Although the coverage is broad, they develop topics in sufficient depth to expose the fundamental principles, concepts, techniques, methods, and circuits necessary for the reader to understand and design power electronic systems as diverse as a 5 Watt switching converter and a 600 MWatt high-voltage DC transmission terminal. Topics include an introduction, form and function (topology), introduction to rectifier circuits, bridge and polyphase rectifier circuits, phase-controlled converters, high-frequency switching dc/dc converters, isolated high-frequency dc/dc converters, variable-frequency dc/ac converters, resonant converters, ac/ac converters, dynamics and control, state-space models, linear and piecewise linear models, feedback control design, components, review of semiconductor devices, power diodes, power transistors, thyristors, magnetic components, ancillary issues, gate and base drives, thyristor commutation circuits, snubber circuits and clamps, and thermal modeling and heat sinking. There are plenty of instructive diagrams shown throughout the book, and the only thing I can really say against it is that part two of the book entitled "Dynamics and Control" seems out of place in this book, since it really has nothing much to do with the subject of power electronics and seems to disrupt the flow of what is otherwise an excellent book.  Also, it is very hard to cover the subject of dynamics and control adequately in just the four chapters allocated to the subject 
 Meshuggah have always held a unique niche in metal.  Their full-fledged "cyber metal" style wouldn't really begin until later in their career, but that is not to say that these Swedes weren't already churning out music with a similar technical flair.  Sure, the songs on _Contradictions Collapse_ have obvious melodies, gang shouts, and rawer vocals - all the makings of Meshuggah are here.  The huge amounts of technically-driven riffs and barrages of shifting precision polyrhythms are plentiful; even as far back as 1991, Meshuggah had all the power and intelligence that makes their style so good.  Just listen to some of the guitar solos - weird, looping notes, courtesy of a 21-year-old Fredrik Thordendal, were already far ahead in the evolutionary plain of technical metal shreds.  And although the guitars were still played with six strings then, and Mårten Hagström had yet to join the band, there was a certain extra punch to the crunch, so to speak, which was only to get even better in the years to come.  Granted, there are moments on this album that would never be played by Meshuggah again (namely the ACOUSTIC guitars on "Qualms of Reality" and "Choirs of Devastation"), but this was just Meshuggah's way of identifying what worked and didn't work for themselves.  Even though I personally like what they did here, and think it did work quite well, it was their later styles that really pushed the proverbial envelope and made their music something special.  I've heard all sorts of comparisons to Bay Area thrash when this album is brought up, and although there is a certain amount of thrash to their sound, the technicality and brutal onslaught of heaviness is prevalent, making for some seriously powerful metal.  Then the _None_ EP came out in 1994, and Meshuggah proved that they would never be the same.  Blocks of heaviness, a mechanical, droning bass in the background, stacks of increasingly unusual rhythms, and trippy tech-solos are in abundance.  Even though there are still a few uneven moments (namely in Jens Kidman's vocal performance, which still has signs of organic origins), _None_ shows Meshuggah have evolved into a very different kind of beast, segueing directly into the cyber-thrash of their mighty 1995 album _Destroy, Erase, Improve_, which would of course open entire vistas of creativity which Meshuggah are so well-known for.  And here are both releases, together on one neat CD!  So why did I only give this less than five stars?  It's because of Nuclear Blast's shoddy packaging job.  You get a tracklist on the back, a photo of the band's lineup from sometime after 1994, and lots of Scandinavian articles about the band from the time period.  Lyrics?  Nope.  Recording info?  Uh-uh.  And the fifth track from None, "Aztec Two-Step" - a great track, by the way - was omitted, but this is slightly understandable due to the 80-minute time constraints of CDs.  Why can't Nuclear Blast just reissue BOTH albums, SEPARATELY, with all lyrics, all info, all tracks, and maybe expanded liner notes?  They'd make a ton of money, because lots of fans like me would buy them in a heartbeat.  Oh well.  It's a minor complaint about an otherwise terrific chronicle of the beginnings of one of the most unique and powerful metal bands of all time 
 This is a delightful book, and in many ways:   1. It describes the life of a wonderfully interesting lady who didn't stay just home and make babies.   2. It gives a picture of Washington D.C. as it existed at the time of the Civil War. This picture is in two parts:  a. the physical aspects, the filth, smell, and how life was lived, and  b. the way Washington worked then (and now) power, money and sex.   3. It is based on new information -- her diary, originally thought to have been written in code, but in fact just very poor penmanship.   The story starts with a message sent to Gen. P.G.T Beauregard to give him an week's notice of when the Union Army would attack Manassas (Bull Run). He used this information to order reinforcements that enabled him to defeat the yankees. Through the course of the war Rose would be caught, imprisoned (without habeas corpus to even know the charges against her). She was exiled to the South, where she was sent by President Davis to France and England to try to get them to assist the South.   This is a fascinating book. All the more so because it is true. Rose was a character born long before her time 
    An outstanding gala for Andrew l. Webber. To have so many wonderful and talent performers was sheer heaven. Each performer was unique with their musical number. Glenn Close who ever thought she can sing in Sunset Boulvard production. Michael Hall can belt it out. I was surprise to see the boy band " Boy zone " perform " No Matter What", excellant performance. A gala for all ages to see.  
 Mr middleton's book is one I would highly recommend everyone  read. It not only motivates, but inspires 
 Even though this book is intended for linguists doing fieldwork, it is an absolute must for those who create languages for fun.  Why?  Well, the purpose of the book is to teach a fieldworker how to write a descriptive grammar for the language s/he's working on.  It points out everything that should be recorded, and gives examples of different phenomena from different languages.  Well, guess what?  A language creator is essentially a fieldworker working an undiscovered language: his/her own.  This book will guide a language creator in creating a grammar of his/her own language, and, when you get stuck, it's always helpful to see how natural languages do things.  As a language creator, I highly recommend this book to anyone who creates languages.  (And, as a linguist, I highly recommend this book to anyone who's doing fieldwork, of course. 
 I have almost worn this book out and was actually coming to amazon to order a new one.  This book is filled with wonderful recipes and general tips on how to make truly authentic and flavorful dishes.  This cookbook will give you a lot of creative ideas and you will soon begin to experiment with many variations of some of their classic recipes.  One of the best surprises of the book was Park's Texas Democrat Chili.  This is a wonderful and richly flavored chili that is not too spicy.  The nopalitos add a wonderful character to the dish.  Try serving it on top of a little of their Mexican rice with some freshly grated Mexican cheese.  Garnish it with a mixture of chopped green onions and cilantro.  A wonderful combination! 
 I learned so much about behind the scenes of horseracing!  The story of Kelsey and what she endured was excellent!  I want to meet Gabe Slater 
 THE OLIVE SEASON and THE OLIVE FARM are excellent as is THE OLIVE HARVEST.  When I recently saw A CELEBRATION OF OLIVES, I thought C. Drinkwater published a new book and ordered it.  I received it today and was disappointed to find it's a double volume of THE OLIVE SEASON and THE OLIVE FARM combined, both of which I have.  According to Amazon.com readers who buy A CELEBRATION OF OLIVES also buy her other books.  I feel like I was duped and cannot return the book 
 I rate this as one of the ten best books I have read in the last decade. For years I could not understand how everyday people can commit moral transgressions. Some years back, I found myself on the receiving end of  some seriously unethical behavior committed by people who were my friends  and whom I had always held in high regard. How could these good people  involve themselves in such unethical behavior? The dysjunction between  their behavior and my assessment of their characters was the source of much  grief. After reading Jacobs' book, I have come to understand just how  tricky some of these problems can be, and just how easy it is for good  people to fall into error at the junction between commericial life and  guardian life. Her book doesn't solve any problems, but it certainly makes  sense of much human perfidy 
 Although the format is a little cheesy (with the lessons presented as dialog between managers), the content, structure and organization of the book is great for new managers.  The examples are fairly realistic, and the breakdown of basic skills is appropriate for those new to supervising workers 
 I got this SPECIAL EDITION UNDERWORLD Dvd for $33 the day it was released after searching 29 stores (They were all sold out everywhere).I HAVE NO REGRETS, IT DOES NOT DISSAPPOINT.The original pleased me immensely,but it had me wanting to see more.This SPECIAL EDITION DVD gives 21 EXTRA MINUTES OF STORYLINE that made me love the movie all the more.I watch it constantly. 
      Beyond and essential read, Night speaks to the reader about fundamental questions at the heart of the human condition.  A powerfully moving autobiography, the story of this teenager's journey through the most horrific death camps of Nazi Europe, strips away discussion of anti-semitism and hatred, to present the raw suffering of individual humans, stuck in situations beyond their control.  From the establishment of a ghetto in Elie's home town of Sighet, the reader can only watch with growing horror as the young man and his family are swept up in the Holocaust.  Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Gleiwitz: some of the most infamous places in modern human history, rise around Elie, as we watch him stripped of absolutely everything.  The reader is swept along helplessly, as Hitler's "Final Solution" unfolds - death marches, starvation, selections, cattle-carts full of people, torture, floggings, mass-murder - and as Elie is gradually reduced to nothing more than a 'hungry stomach'.        What will humans do to survive?  How important is loyalty, trust, family, faith, when one is faced with the grim reaper?  If we cannot even answer these questions ourselves, what chance did a 15-year old boy stand?      Despite its horrific and heart-wrenching subject, "Night" is an essential read for absolutely everyone; something that once read will never be forgotten. 
 I used to be a good friend to Rush. I listened to his program all the time. When I first saw this book, I ignored it. Finally, after it had been in the window of our bookstore for several months, I picked it up and looked inside.  I was amazed!   However, I had to put it down because I thought it was too negative. It called Rush names. I did not need to have that. Finally, I tried getting it at the library, but they said they did not have a copy, because they said it was "too controversial."  So when the price came down, I bought a used copy for a couple of bucks, and read the whole thing.  I was amazed some more!  Rush used to have 20 million listeners to his talk show. He was a legendary, rich talk show host. This book tells you exactly how Rush became a rich, popular talk show host. And he is thinner now that he has recovered from his unfortunate drug problem. And you know, that sort of thing could happen to anybody.  But I had trusted Rush, and his VALUES, and I kind of felt he let me down. So for me, the title is not appropriate. Rush Limbaugh is a Big, Rich Talk Show Host who Cuts Corners on His Values would be a better title. Rush is no idiot, either.  Now, by some "coincidence" Al Franken is a talk show host too. And, I bet he learned how by studying how Rush did it!  If Franken can do it, YOU can do it!  Don't miss out on this GREAT opportunity!  Get a copy. Look how cheap it is now. Tell your friends 
 I was twelve [12] years old when I saw this movie on a Saturday afternoon at a neighborhood theater...It had a powerful impact on my immature grasp of things then...it is a beautiful made movie during the anxious WW2 years about the US Navy and its pilots...just listen to the inspiring/heroic musical score by Hugo W. Friedhofer [kudos to him] and the easy; yet, Naval discipline as it flows so naturally under the direction of Henry Hathaway...forget the nit-pickers that drag on in here...the United States was losing the War in early 1942, I say again, losing the war all the way down to the tip of Australia...movies like the "Wing" made morale on the home/front soar as high as our Navy flyers could take it...by 1944 when this wonderful film was released, the USA was on the threshold of victory all the way to Tokyo...it was a long dirty way to Tokyo as The Captain alluded to...everytime I see this movie, I see my dearest friend recreated in the role played by Dana Andrews aloft in his Grumman Avenger [TBF]...he was decorated with the Navy Cross and Distinguished Flying Cross for heroic actions against the Japanese Imperial Fleet..movies of this genre will stand the test of time immemorial...the studio bosses knew how to make real movies in this era...I had my WAR in Korea and I [we] know what it takes to defeat America's enemies and this movie, "Wing and a Prayer" demostrates that ever so clearly as the carrier heads for the battle of Midway in 1942....I ask you, "Where were you in 1942"??..Semper Fidelis...SSGT CHRIS SARNO-USMC FMF.

 This just may be my favorite book ever, and I read A LOT. I have read this book several times, and have given away at least 5 copies. I sold it from the shelves of my 'Angel Store' and my customers loved it too. Coelho writes with such a presence. He weaves the spritual story as the reader rides on the back of the words of the story. After writing this review, I think I will go and read it again. I think I just may be a Valkyrie. How about you 
 This movie just showed on the FX channel so I watched it after seeing it for the first time since it was first released on cable.  I had forgotten a lot of the plot but the characters are unique and maybe because a woman direct it, the Angela Basset character is very strong.  Anything with AB is a plus.  Fiennes can disappear into roles and I don't see any of his other characters in this performance.  The plot itself is a bit thin, but it unfolds through a lot of character interaction.  I prefer this type of scifi movie to one where theres just a lot of shooting and special FX (that's right SW, I'm talking to you).  
 Though James rejected this tale for inclusion in the New York Edition of his works, presumably because it was too simple and straightforward, many readers have not shared his judgment, insisting instead the work has great merit. Its theme is an intriguing one that raises the following question: Is it better to be clever or good? Even here, for James, the answer is not all that simple, his conclusion being it's probably best to be some subtle combination of both. Dr. Sloper and Morris Townsend, the central male figures, are clever men, but each is deficient in his own way. The caustically witty Doctor wants to be just, but his pride in being right about Morris as a fortune hunter ultimately overrides his fatherly concerns. For this reason, he becomes a sort of Hawthorne-like villain, a scientific, detached, almost gleeful observer of his own daughter's plight, rather than a suitably caring parent. He suffers, finally, not from an excess of cleverness, but from a defect of generous felt emotion. Morris, too, is a definitely clever character, but at the same time he's the spoiled creation of enabling women, a boy-man who's more a self-interested player at life than a vital participant in it, an early version of the fatherless "It's all about me" youth of later modern fiction. The heroine Catherine is a sorely beset young woman, pulled this way and that, now by her right-at-all-costs father, then by her fortune hunting suitor. She is a good, dutiful daughter throughout, though the novel details her growth in intelligent personhood. She finally gains the independence needed to tell her manipulative father where his parental rights end and her own moral self begins. Similarly, once her education in life is complete, she is able to avoid a final romantic capitulation, telling the shameless Morris in the novel's last scene what her mature self now requires he hear from her. Naturally, he's too self-involved to accurately understand her real character. This short novel, finally, is rich in witty literary parody. It's closing chapters read like an inverted "Odyssey," with the patiently waiting Catherine weaving embroidery in Penelope-like fashion, until the surprise return of the long wandering Morris. All in all, despite the masterly author's doubts, this is a work of considerable distinction 
 Often, when I'm reading a book or watching a movie, I'll think about the villain or the eccentric character or the wacky character - they're always so interesting, and yet, rarely are we given a privileged look at the *why* of their lives.  Why are they so different from the rest of us?  Why do they dress like that?  Why do they act the way they do?  Patrick McCabe is an author who is concerned with the why.    Patrick "Pussy" Braden, the hero(ine) of McCabe's Breakfast on Pluto, is an Irish Transvestite, who - believe it or not - is just looking for the simple life.  Sure, she likes silky jackets and false eyelashes.  But all Pussy *really* wants is a sweet little home; a strong, masculine husband; and a loving family.  Unfortunately, her desires are complicated by the deteriorating social system in her small, Irish hometown; by violent IRA attacks; by her dysfunctional childhood; and - of course - by her sexuality.  As with McCabe's The Butcher Boy, Breakfast on Pluto is a fascinating exploration of the life of a social deviant.  Once again, McCabe masterfully captures the humorous and extraordinarily idiosyncratic voice of his protagonist, and the combination of Pussy's charismatic narration and her tragic life story make for another bittersweet novel.  Breakfast on Pluto is at once hilarious and heartbreaking.    If I were to compare the 2 texts, I'd have to say that Butcher Boy is the superior; for one thing, it's more fleshed out than the very brief Breakfast on Pluto.  But, if you enjoyed Butcher Boy, chances are, you will also enjoy this work by McCabe. 
 Thought the book very informative and very revealing. Many would not agree with its content but I found it very helpful confirming my thoughts on the subjec 
 I vaguely remembered this film from cable or Network TV. At the time of release in the go-go eighties It seemed to be somewhat of an anomaly in it's highly critical view of the role of the first world in the third world's misery.  I agree somewhat with the review of "bad writing" sating the sugarcoating of the role of the US  in the murder of hundreds of thousands of leftists  just as VietNam is getting underway. Also the film reminded me somewhat of "The Quiet America", "Missing", "The Killing Fields"...in that it showcases what goes wrong in the third world when there is outside meddling.  The romance (between Sigourney Weaver and Mel Gibson) and the social political issues don't fit as well as they could, or only one plot line- preferably the social political- in my opinion may have made this more powerful. But, like the somewhat happy ending, this type of sugarcoating is, unfortunately, usual Hollywood fare. Nevertheless, this may be Gibson's and Weaver's finest roles. It definitely is their most  socially conscious.  Helen Hunt, playing Billy, in a transgendered role, is fabulous and worthy of and OSCAR and more. And the journalists, and other westerners, are also played very well and quite smarmy and, as in the case of the  British General and embassy party, are indicative of the ongoing power and the somewhat anachronistic roles of empire- particularly the British.  Finally I wish the movie could have been a bit longer and offer more depth, but as in 90% of films it couldn't exceed the two hour maximum tradition. Also the movie displays incidents of 1965 and was made in 1983, but it seemed like it could of taken place yesterday.It's too bad there isn't a movie similar to this of the current Middle Eastern debacle.  
 Just a brief statement:  I was disappointed that the Sunday comics were not as visible as when released in the original paperbacks in the 1960s. Most of the Sunday comics, in fact, are fuzzy and look like they were taken from a different source. The paperbacks in the 1960s, PEANUTS EVERY SUNDAY and WE'RE RIGHT BEHIND YOU, CHARLIE BROWN, had the Sunday comics very crisp and easily readable. Even the first collections PEANUTS TREASURY and PEANUTS CLASSICS had better quality Sunday comics reprints.   I don't mind Sunday comics not being in color. It was said that Charles Schulz preferred them published in black and white. But let's improve the quality of the next books, please. For all the effort being put into these wonderful volumes, it doesn't make sense to leave fuzzy Sunday strips. (If you can, compare them to the original reprints in the 1960s paperbacks). Mr. Schulz's incredible humor, wit, and artwork are certainly worth that, no?  Other than this one flaw, I continue to buy these and enjoy seeing the strips that weren't released back in those early paperbacks. 
 The book is slanted towards the history of battles fought over lands in the region and has only glancing information on things like the arts and culture of the region. The chapters on the French invasion of Egypt does have some interesting observations on the reactions of the various groups to being invaded and occupied that are still relevant and timely 
 This book has given me a thorough understanding of OOP. Before this book, I understood object oriented concepts but I did not feel too confident with it. After reading this book, I feel very comfortable with OOP and I can now leverage the full power of OOP. Matt Weisfeld's writing style is very easy to follow and each chapter is briliantly formulated to gradually escalate your understanding of the given subject. This book is a must read for all beginning to intermediate developers (or developers who have not migrated to OOP)  who wish to get a complete understanding of object oriented development and harness the full power of OOP 
 Reading the reviews of this book saddens me.  Claims that this book is bigoted, sexist, or anti-religion make me wonder if these people even read the book.  There is one message in this book and most people here seemed to have missed it:  Faith is a wonderful thing.  SPOILER:  You see, one of the main characters is a horrible man that almost feels moralless.  As a direct result of the visions of a drug addict, he is transformed into something great.  He begins to truly love his family.  The fact that her visions turned out to be drug induced did not matter.  Guterson was drawing a parallel to Christianity and possibly Catholicism specifically.  Despite scientific evidence to suggest that the Bible is a book of fairy tales, many people continue to believe, to have faith in this religion.  The vast majority of these people are improved based on this belief.  You could apply this to any religion or belief system (including atheism).  I am constantly astounded at statements that a book is not good because its ideas clash with the opinions of the reader.  When did we begin to judge literature in this manner?  If the author hates the town this is set in, so what?  It's literature.  If the book isn't quite as good as the last book, so what?  If you wanted a book like the other book, then reread that book.  Stop being judgemental and start enjoying literature 
 With Terra and Slade (known as Deathstroke in the comics) now gone, the plots take a new turn, with Brother Blood as the main line villain. Fans of the late 70s Teen Titans comics will be glad to see the extra Titan characters who combine to form Titans East in the two-parter which ends the season. Enjoy, and keep watching out for Season 4 and 5 releases. Pete 
 Tomorrow's Promise is a classic love story. This book is the journey of two different women from totally different worlds that share one thing in common...they are broken! They find their souls and bodies healing from their growing passion for eachother but, will it be enough? Time will heal old wounds but, how much time do they have together? This book was romantic from start to finish and I couldn't be happier! It was an easy read and a complete pleasure as always a Rad book is! I will definitely keep this classic in my collection! You will not be disappointed... 
 This is Irving Wallace at his best. In this book his is a combination of John Grisham's dramatic court scene in "A Time to Kill", Sidney Sheldon's nail-biting suspense in "Bloodline" and his own  narrative as in "The Word". Need I say more 
 Rent is my favorite musical with its rock n roll edge. This cd makes me want to sing with every song. It is recommended to Broadway buffs and music enthusiasts alike 
 Richard Sale's A COMPLETE GUIDE TO ARCTIC WILDLIFE pairs gorgeous photos by Per Michelsen and Richard Sale with sections which cover dozens of species, from birds to plants and animals, and which blend a field guide to Arctic birds and mammals with a mini-travel guide to the Arctic. Notes are quite specific, from size and confusion species to diet, breeding, and geographical variation, making this the perfect specific reference for any library strong on Arctic wildlife identification and natural history 
 Barbara Weltman and Jerry Silberman have created the perfect book for small businesses. Not only will this book encourage an awareness of survival techniques, it will give businesses the information they need to go beyond survival into the area of business success where they will thrive.   Barbara Weltman has over twenty-five years of experience in the areas of small business and is known for her books on business, taxes and finance. She has also appeared on CNN, CNBC, The Today Show and radio stations nationwide.   Jerry Silberman presents his wisdom from his extensive experience in the area of debt-restructuring. For over 15 years, he has helped thousands of businesses on the verge of bankruptcy through his company: Commercial Credit Counseling Services, Inc. This company is impressively the nation's leading debt-restructuring firm for small businesses.  Together the authors present a well-organized plan to address the most pertinent issues facing business owners today. In the first chapter they address the human side of business, then they explore the financial aspects. Lastly, they introduce an unexpected side of business that could make or break even an established business.   Topics of high interest include:   Setting Goals Writing a Business Plan Marketing Plan & Advertising Websites & Blogging Managing Your Time Reviewing Progress Monitoring Cash Flow Office Organization What to Delegate What not to Delegate Working with Independent Contractors Finding an Accountant, Banker, IT Consultant and Insurance Agent Accepting Credit Card Payments Working with Collection Agencies Maintaining Credit Repairing Credit Tax Professionals  This book also provides information on business structures as well as information on trademarks and patents. The chapter on Insurance may be the most enlightening chapter because I would have never considered all the areas of a business that should be protected. Chapter 12 is especially helpful for any business that has found itself in a major predicament like a natural disaster. The information in this chapter allows for a high level of disaster preparedness.   The Small Business Survival Book is an entrepreneur's dream resource and is essential reading for anyone who owns a company or is considering a new business.  The practical advice can be introduced into any business model and will not only help a business survive, it will help business owners market more effectively and sell more products. This is a business book you can truly love. It is enlightening, helpful and presents a strong foundation for business success. The Small Business Survival Book is truly a work of genius!    ~The Rebecca Review  
 If you love Food you will love Ruth Reichl!  This was one of her most creative and insider looks at being a food critic.  And everyone should meet Molly!  
 I have no idea what got mixed in with the other reviewers' coffee.  This DVD is ubelieveable.  First, it has enough extras to keep a fatboy fan happy (type 303 to see a half hour backstage clip) and the music is great.  He certainly mixes throughout the whole thing despite what other reviewers say.  You won't be disappointed 
  What happened to the 2-disk "ultimate" edition of this (and the other) Bond films? One day they were available, the next they're gone! There was no indication that these were a limited edition of any sort, were they pulled from shelves? I guess that I should have placed an order as soon as I saw this edition of Goldfinger (my favorite Bond flick) but I was hoping to give my battered wallet a rest for a couple of months after Christmas! I don't want to order the box set because I'm only interested in the Connery-era Bond films. Why is this 2-disk DVD already unavailable? 
 Cube is a very original and entertaining low budget horror film, and will most likely stay with you long after you watch it. What works well with Cube is that we go along the ride with the characters. They have no idea how they got there or what is going on, we learn everything with them. The acting was decent and the CGI effects were nothing special, but overall the creativity makes this more than your average horror movie. Anyway the more I watch the film the better it gets, and more ideas and meanings come to mind everytime. Its Good too see more people are viewing Cube, probably because the sequels are recently being shown on TV now. The sequels are pretty bad compared to the original but watch them yourself 
 As ground breaking as El Oso was, Irresistible bliss remains my favorite Soul Coughing album.  The Idiot Kings, Soundtrack to Mary... The music is artfully mixed. The keyboard work is fabulously expressive, someone who is new to the genre perhaps wouldn't appreciate the incredible beauty and stuttering synchronicity of these musicians, but it is there. Vocals by Mike Doughty are as always dripping with slam-like imagery.  While being expressive and engaging, it is the sheer energy, the electricity of this album that elevates it above El Oso, Though I strongly reccomend El Oso as well 
 If, like Rex Wockner recently did, you find yourself struck with the sudden realization that we aren't quite as well situated with the American public as the popularity of Will and Grace might lead one to believe and that, in the secrecy of the voting booth, the real anti-gay America is raising its ugly head past that glossy veneer of tolerance in state after state, you should read this book that a decade ago warned us against being content with simple mainstreaming into a corrupt social structure that had all the cornerstones of homohatred as its foundation and encouraged us to seek real equality instead of settling for a virtual one.  It's not a particularly easy read but you should distrust anyone who gives you easy answers to a problem so multi-layered and complex or who lets you off the hook of personal growth in the process.  Urv does neither.  She knows whereof she speaks, having learned it all in the trenches.  And it's as applicable to the middle-class and the Midwest as anyone and anywhere in the U.S.A. -- perhaps more so as this is a book for those who are willing to face the monster head-on instead of adapting to either accommodate the monster or become the monster themselves.  Nowhere is that head-on fight more pressing than in the states facing MIPAs (Marriage Inequality Protection Amendments) and DenialOMAs -- typically the southern and midwestern (and, like Oregon, New England-Midwestern extension) states.  Thus nowhere is a sound foundation in the political understanding available in this watershed book more valuable.  Urv, in short, not only 'keeps her eyes on the prize', she's astute enough to know what the prize really is 
 I loved these tips. As a full-figured woman always looking for ways to spice up my wardrobe, I found this book to be fun and practical. Especially for warm weather outfits, which I consistently find a problem with, I really enjoyed the style tips and advice. Shoes make a difference, too! And I love how the author combined her fashion sense with foot sense. It's a good reference book that you can have to use whenever you need a quick tip 
 This is a wonderful reproduction of the original World War II edition of the classic Eric Knight story. I find it appalling that many Americans do not know that the original Lassie of the story was British because I read the original "Lassie Come Home" short story (published in the December 1938 issue of the Saturday Evening Post) in school. This original story is a well-written, haunting tale of a poor Yorkshire family forced by economic times to sell their son's beloved collie (a tricolor dog, not a sable as portrayed in the movies and on TV) and of the dog's long torturous journey home during which she meets kind people--a couple who nurse her after she swims the river Tweed, a kindly peddler--and cruel--callous dogcatchers, bullying boys--as well as farmers protecting their livestock. A classic in every sense of the word 
 That basically sums up all these books.  They are absolute classics!  I love everything about every single one of these books- I read them growing up and nearly cried as a teenager when they removed them from my local library.  No matter what age you are you can enjoy these fantastic books.  James Marshall has turned out nothing but classic, wonderful and fun books.  If you've never read them, you're missing out on your childhood, and that goes for his George and Martha books too!  Get one TODAY 
 This CD really is a lot of fun. The music is great, but the banter between the musicians is even better. Just buy it and enjoy.  By the way, if you're new to the Acoustic Disc label, note that they often bury a little surprise at the end of their CD's. It won't be listed on the menu of tunes or mentioned in the liner notes. It's usually a little snippet or out-take, and it's always a treat. You can't even find it with the "fast forward" button; you have to wait for the last song to end, then there will be a rather long pause and then the trailer will start playing. So, don't be in such a rush to remove the CD from the player; there might be more to come 
 What a profound book. The thing is though, if you like The Sound And The Fury your probably going to have to read it a second time. Because of the way Faulkner wrote this book (which, by the way, is absolutely brilliant and an immense measure of his talent as a writer) it's very important to go into reading it with a little direction. The first third of the book is very difficult because it's written from the perspective and mind of a retarded man. But, once your through it you'll realize that that is what makes this such a devastating book- perspective. Faulkner was truly a modern master. This book shows the reader how varied the true perspective is of people who seem to be living every moment in step. There is so much pain in this book. It will tear at you and open you up. I highly recommend it 
 Qigong is the most widely practiced self healing and health excercise in the world. It is not as well known in the USA as Yoga but is on it's way. Ken Cohen stands out as a teacher who is clear and balanced and teaches what is considered the most important qigong practices.   The Essential Qigong Training Course is a 100 days training that gradually teaches these wonderful Qigong excercises. It is the single best introduction to Qigong practice I have found in almost 10 years and is highly recommended to a beginner.   If you already have and been practicing from Cohen's book the Way of Qigong most of the material won't be new to you. However, it is still worth getting. but if you havent read Ken's book and are new to Qigong this is the best way to learn outside of studying with a good teacher. 
 If you want to reconcile with your spouse or even other relatives, you will profit from the content in this book. As with most things, you have to actually do the work described though. Reading it once without acting on it won't help you much at all. There are no shortcuts or quick fix band-aids here. There are loving, Christ-centered principles and exercises here that will give you a good shot at healing the pain in your relationship. As part of the process, you begin with healing your relationship with yourself and with God so that you can reconnect with your partner. This isn't one of the books about finding yourself. It's about figuring out where you are and what is keeping you stuck there so you can move forward. It's also about beginning to understand and eventually forgive your estranged spouse enough that you can begin to heal together. You may find the audio form of the book helpful if you're feeling lonely or panicking over your separation. Mr. Chapman's voice is strong, gentle, and optimistic. I felt better almost right away because I felt understood and somehow reassured. :) God bless you and your broken relationship. He is our healer and the one who gives us hope when we're separated 
 This is a gripping book.  One that you will no doubt have trouble putting down.  The literary style is easy to read and well put together.  You would be hard pressed to find a book of this caliber that would EVEN COME CLOSE to giving you the extent of detail about what truly happened in the World Wide Church of God after the death of Mr. Herbert W. Armstrong.  It is the story that is finally being told 20 years later, with details and support from many official church and court documents that have never before been seen by most of the public.  I HIGHLY SUGGEST READING RAISING THE RUINS.  Whether or not you agree with the organization that Mr. Stephen Flurry belongs to will not affect THE AMAZING YET GUT WRENCHING STORY OF HOW THE WORK OF MR. ARMSTRONG WAS SO DECEITFULLY DESTROYED!! TRULY YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU READ THIS BOOK 
 Outdoor Rooms is a beautiful testament to the great outdoors.  I particularly enjoyed this volume because most of the spectacular pictures are of ourdoors rooms in the United States.  I discovered many great ideas  to incorporated in my own great outdoors and I found the resources to be  very benificial 
 Only once in a while can an author paint a picture that is so alive that you step into it and live it with them. Marquez does an amazing job at this. He brings us into his past in this autobiography and allows us to get to know him and the world of rural Columbia. The old banana plantations, the ancient railroad cars, the quirky family members.  If you ever wondered what South America is like - ready Marquez 
 Alvaro Mutis wrote several superb short novels about the travels and trials of his creation, the wandering sailor Maqroll, gathered here in one volume in an excellent translation. Adventure, friendship, obsession, loyalty, bad judgment, and hilariously (sometimes tragically) desperate situations play out in obscure and exotic locations. "Maqroll" is an excellent companion for your own world travels. 
 This is an all time classic movie!  Anyone who is a Gary Grant fan...should add this dvd to their collection! A beautiful love story 
 This book stands alone as one of the truest crossovers between sexuality, horror, darkness and literature.  I remember as a child discovering the strange ways Anne Rice was able to excite me with simply what was printed on the page.  At the age of 11, her work became the dirty little secret I hid from everyone.  Although the book was one my mother owned, I purloined it and read it cover to cover until I got up the nerve to ask my mom if there were anymore books by this talented woman.  In my later years I discovered the truly adult writings she had done with the wonderful Beauty series and East of Eden, but it was this book that first showed me that the written word could be seductive, could be exciting and could fire the imagination like nothing else.  My own writings, far from her level, could be said to have been brought to the fore simply because she gave me an appreciation I hadn't yet been able to develop.  Strange how these books have crossed over in genres that, although not far removed, are removed from the general readership she enjoys.  I have seen her and her books mentioned in comics, movies and stories, always given as the basis for why some whelpling wishes to be a vampire.  I sometimes get the feeling that her readers don't get the fact that she portrays them (vampires) romantically, but there is always this sense of loneliness, of unease.  She loves what they represent but I get the feeling that somehow she has the real sense of the sadness that would accompany hiding in the shadows for hundred and hundreds of years.  Anne Rice is an amazing writer, this an amazing book from a fantastic series, it should be read again and again 
 Reading this book, you get the impression Michael Lewis just moved in with Jim Clark for a year.  Sadly, these direct interaction stories and anecdotes are not as compelling as the more standard journalistic backstory:  the tale of Clark's rise from abject poverty, the founding of Silicon Graphics and his eventual war with management and the board there, and the story of NetScape.  The up to date stuff is less interesting, unless you are really fascinated with big sailboats.  If we were rating Lewis books on a scale of 1-5, this would only rate a 3.  But since other authors have to also fit into the scale, this gets a 4.. 
 I won't try to add much to what the Editorial Review says, because it really does cover a lot. Mr. Mahaney's book certainly does approach the cross of Christ from a God-centered viewpoint, not a man-centered one, which is exactly right (cf. Martyn Lloyd-Jones' pamphlet called The Cross: The Vindication of God). What Mahaney does so well is to walk the reader through Gethsemane and onwards to Calvary; to evoke a sense of some of the physical and spiritual pain Christ was experiencing as he took these steps towards his substitutionary death on our behalf. It's a book that demands many more re-reads than Mahaney's little book The Cross-Centered Life, as good as that one is. Christ Our Mediator must be read many times in order to soak in all the subtle nuances of our Saviour's sacrifice on the cross 
 If you think this book is about designing a site workflow, you'll be disappointed, as I was.  It's about the process of designing sites, which is still useful information. Although some of the advice is somewhat vague and generalized, they do offer questionnaire and checklist templates for download at their site. (Note that their site doesn't follow some of their own advice, especially regarding screen size and fluid layouts.)  There are some screenshots of before and after redesigns, which are helpful, but there could have been more. In the end it's mostly about outlining a process where you capture information about client and user needs, project management (costing, time tracking, etc.), and so on. It's not about smart workflow design of websites; it's about a workflow for designing websites. If this is the information you need, this book serves as a big checklist of what you should do, and also provides some useful resources, such as links to sites you will find useful as a site designer 
 Writer Jirí Hubac and Director Matej Minac have created a fine and very different approach to the Holocaust stories of WW II - its insidious origins and relentless destruction of a beautiful Czech family - in the film 'Vsichni moji blízcí' ('All My Loved Ones').  Though the subject matter has been treated in countless films, this relating of the story of a large, happy, well adjusted family in Prague and its gradual disintegration does not dwell on atrocities of the camps but instead slowly unwinds the story of how Hitler's masterplan overtook and crushed so many innocent people.  The Silbersteins include a physician and his wife and son, a brother who is a gypsy of sorts, another brother who is a concert violinist and falls in love with a non-Jew, accepted by his family but eventually rejected by her and her family because of the pogrom, and all manner of extended family circling in the warmth of the good life in 1939.  Very gradually the Nazis take over the Czech borders, not really heeded by the Silbersteins ('no one could be as mad as Hitler may seem') and gradually the evacuation and genocide of the Jews begins.  Dr Silberstein is introduced to an American Nicholas Winton (Rupert Graves) who has come to Prague to save the children by providing them safe transport to America. The Silbersteins reluctantly release their son when they see that is his only hope for survival: the remainder of the family's future is doomed.  The rest of the film deals primarily with the homage to Winton, showing the real man and the many of the 600 children he rescued.  It is deeply moving.  The color and camera work is elegant and very much in keeping with the film's emphasis on the dignity of the Silberstein family.  The acting by this Czech troupe is excellent, never cloying, always sensitive to the very human response to the black cloud of the Third Reich's Holocaust.  In every way this is a film to treasure. Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, September 0 
 As a fan of Barbara Kingsolver's nonfiction I recommend the book's Foreword, in particular, for a personal and incisive statement of the agrarian ethic and its relevance for this time.  Editor Norman Wirzba's counsel that we cannot live well if we do not attend to the human and non-human "bonds of relationship" is also of deep import in an age of mindless surfeit masquerading as self-realization 
 I have been reading this book to my now 1 year old daughter since 4 months of age. She was instantly captivated by bright pictures. Added to that are the collection of rhymes that can be played with the child. When I read out "Five little ducks..." She answers back saying "Quack Quack Quack". 
 Great characters about whom you care and wonderful dialogue that makes you laugh and can tug your heart are the hallmarks of Robb's (Nora Roberts) writing.  This is a very enjoyable series, best read in order, and this one of the better books in it.  
 What to say...it is just amazing...I just can't stop watching this opera once a time. The opera and actors are sublime, you are like surrounded in this opera and you can't do anything except watching and listening. Marvellous 
 This was the first book I learned to read all by myself, all the way through 
 though this book can get extremely confusing at some times, it is well worth both the money, and your time. a true story, and an amazing one at that, it makes it all the more of an incredible read 
 This was an appropriate conclusion to Shakespeare's career. Not only are the characters such as Henry VIII, Cranmer, and Wolsey convincing, but the poetry and images are beautiful. In addition, through the fall of several  characters such as Wolsey, we can see reflections of Shakespeare himself as  he wrote his 37th and final play. It is also poetically appropriate that  one of the greatest writers England ever knew ended his career by writing a  play about one of the greatest kings that England ever knew! I DO NOT  believe that Shakespeare only wrote parts of this play as many people do.  With the beautiful images, poetry, and captivating characters, I am very  confident in the belief that this play was written entirely by the one and  only William Shakespeare

 In Book 8 of the "Love Comes Softley" series Belinda is finding that the teachings of her parents, faith - love - family, are the cornerstones she needs to get her life back on track 
 I first picked up this book because i've always been interested in what young writers have to say. But i have to admit, even i was a little surprised. This story mind the mythicism, is a real representation of what young children's minds sometimes go through. That idea of a person you fabricated, gaining more reality than necessary. Congrats to Ms. Oyeyemi for her brilliant attempt to shine some light on this realm that few share conversations about.  She is one i'll keep in my mind for a while. If you like young writers, you should check out Charles Hedji's Fields of Discovery. I'm an avid reader once again 
 This is an amazing book, practically one of a kind! The information, illustions, and luster of the indigenous African cultures is beautiful to behold. I recommed introducing young children to cultures and peoples as varied as the come to fully portray to them the true beauty of this creation, life. There is nothing so intricate, so inveloping and powerful as life in this form. Pronounciation is given for the tribes names to bring ease of reading, which is, in fact, very enjoyable 
 A new major character is introduced. Harry Bosch is downplayed early, later is brought into the story. Fresh as if the first Harry Bosch book 
 Modern, and I use that term knowing full well what the author thinks of  it, readers may find themselves put off by terms that have been abondoned  in polite society.  My suspicion is that Waugh knew this and used them  anyway.  So as one reads one is occasionally confronted with the bald-face  epithet.  It seems to serve a purpose: one must judge on some other merit  than mere appearance.  Certainly Connolly seems to have chosen an unlikely  term of endearment for his bride but the careful reader will note that  those who take exception to it both object to the rudeness of the term and  to Connolly's mixed marriage.  Despite his coarse language Connolly does  seem to harbor genuine affection for his bride.  So it seems that the  reader must look beyond words to understand the true nature of the  characters.  The anonymous narrator also seems to use the occasional  epithet but again it seems only to set the scene.  Waugh takes great pains  to show that things are what they are --no more and no less-- and that we  as humans are highly fallible and very likely to get even the simple things  wrong.  Or so it seems when young emperor Seth remonstrates Connolly for  his impolitic speech regarding his wife not out of a sense of injustice but  because it was decidedly un-modern.  Check your PC sensibilities and enjoy  the book 
 I suspect I've read the first 200 pages of The Great American Novel more times than any other 200 pages in literature--it's that funny, and as a baseball fan, I always find a new laugh from both the adventures of the itinerant Rupert Mundys, a baseball team from the "third major league" displaced on a season-long road trip (to play the Aceldama Butchers, the Terra Incongita Rustlers, the Kakoola Reapers, and the Tri-City Greenbacks as well as a benefit game against inmates in a lunatic asylum) as their seaside stadium is commandeered by the US government as an debarkation point for soldiers during World War II.  The war has also drained talent from the Patriot League, leaving the Mundys with drunken first baseman John Baal (son of the infamous "Spit" Baal), 14-year old second baseman Nickname Damur, 50-year old third baseman "Kid" Heket, and one-legged catcher "Hot" Ptah--along with one-armed right fielder Bud Parusha (he lost the other one in a hand grenade training accident) and two battling midget relievers--O.K Ockatur and Bob "Every Inch a Man" Yamm.  Roth gets so many of the baseball details right--even in such a ridiculous context. The backstory of the Patriot League is nearly as funny--highlighted by the ongoing feud between 19-year old pitching phenom Gil Gamesh, who comes within one pitch of the ultimate perfect game--three strikes and out on 27 consecutive batters, until veteran umpire Mike "The Mouth" Masterton turns his head on the final pitch.  The story of Luke "The Loner" Gofannon and his love of triples is another that baseball fans will appreciate. 90-year old retired sportswriter and narrator "Word" Smith tells the story in spasms of alliteration, puns, allusions and other literary devices, led by the memorable first line "Call me Smitty".  The last third of the book--a product of the conceit that the Patriot League really existed, only to be erased from American history as part of the Red Scare of the '50s, bogs down a little as Smitty goes before the House Unamerican Activities Committee--no doubt a personal bit of satire by Roth.  Baseball fans will enjoy it the most, followed by fans of clever satire in any form.  Sure it's excessive, but what can you expect from a book with such a modest title 
 Finally a concise history of a procedure that should have died out in the bronze age.. revealing it to be a procedure surrounded by superstition, illogic, and twisted menatl gynastics.  The author has handled the subject in an even-handed fashion and still shown the absurdity of this procedure and the excuses, both religious and medical still being used to try to justify that which is not justifiable 
 This is the best pirate ship I've seen.  Everything about it speaks volumes of great craftsmanship and quality.  This set includes everything you need for a pirate adventure, and more.  There's quite a bit of assembly required.  Set aside a couple hours, at least.  The boat goes together extremely well.  Every part works like it's supposed to, and they all fit together easily.  The result is a great-looking ship with two masts, four sails, opening aft cabin, and working winch on an intricately designed pully system.  The aft cabin features a bed, table, and benches.  There's also some room to store some of the myriad accessories.  A staircase ascends to the main deck, and another ascends to the deck above the cabin, where the steering collumn is.  Large grates in the floor of the deck open up, offering access to the ship's hold.  Ladders ascend from the sides of the boat, offering our crew a way to get to the crow's nest.  There's also an optional weight that can be attached to the bottom of the boat so that it can float on water.  I have mixed feelings about the rigging for the sails.  There's a lot of it.  Fun with string!  Trying to tie knots with string isn't exactly my idea of fun.  The ship didn't look bad without it.  Having taken the time to assemble it, I have to say that it was probably worth the effort.  It certainly doesn't detract from the ship's appeal.  There's rigging that holds the mainsails steady, a string that connects the masts, and one for steadying the forward sail.  String is also used for the winch and anchor.  Assembling it all was time consuming, but the result is pretty impressive.  Our swashbuckling crew is three guys and a female pirate, the latter of which I find very appealing.  How many pirate sets have a woman on board?  All of the figures are top-notch in quality, although the articulation leaves a bit to be desired.  Straight arms that only move back and forth (I think it would look more natural if their arms were bent a bit at the elbows).  Stiff legs that move as one.  Heads move left and right, and so do the wrists.  The figures all look great.  Their hats stay on their heads.  They also have cowls, belts that can hold cutlasses or other items, cuff-links, and neckwear.  The detail on these guys is great.  Now, here's where this toy really sets itself apart from the rest.  I've always had a fondness for accessories.  Tools, weapons, animal friends...  Stuff for the figures to interact with.  Well, there are more accessories here than I know what to do with!  The sheer volume of cool stuff here is amazing.  Cutlasses, swords, rifles, pistols, knives, a harpoon, barrels, baskets, a serving tray, jugs of wine, goblets, a lantern, shovel and pickaxe, spyglasses, an accordion...  There's a varity of fruit!  A sack of flour.  A treasure chest (it has a nice locking mechanism).  Two manual-firing cannons with plenty of cannon balls.  There are more cannon balls here than I know what to do with!  Racks for storing the cannon balls.  A parrot.  A monkey.  A chicken coup with three hens!  Wow!  And four rats.  This is an impressive array of accessories.  My verdict:  thumbs way, way up.  They did an awesome job of designing this ship and outfitting it with a great crew and loads of accessories.  I feel like I'm looking at a toy designer's magnum opus.  Takes a while to assemble and sort out all the cool stuff, but it's more than worth the effort, and definitely worth the price of admission 
 As a Catholic trying to cope with the loss of a child, I'd say this book is 99% wonderful and 1% that I'm not in agreement with.  This is clearly biblically Protestant in which there are "missing links".  Although I completely agree that the Lord is merciful towards babies and innocent young children, I do not agree with what he states about instant Heaven with adults and older children.  If you are Catholic or Orthodox, take this into mind and discernment that this is not in junction with the teaching of our Church. Otherwise its a wonderful tool in knowing that our babies are very much alive in Heaven waiting for their families.  
 Having read this beautifully illustrated and written story for over twelve  years of teaching 2-5 year old children it has always been a  favourite.Children sit in wonder to what might happen with Hush and Grandma  poss in the story.They feel sad when at first nothing works then finally  joyfull and happy with the outcome of Hush and Grandma poss adventure for a  cure. Which often leads children asking me to re read it 
 This book, although not excellent, is very good.  One of the first things you notice is how cleanly laid out it is and how the examples are clearly written in plain English.  The graphs and tables in this book are not only  intuitive for the non-chem. background students but are also very  attractive to the eye.  This was a good book and I did learn quite a large  amount of information from it 
 I am a high school Biology teacher and every year I show this film to my students as an introduction to our study on Genetics and Heredity. This is a great film that illustrates how the Human Genome Project began and examines the potential ethical dilemmas as well as potential benefits the completion of this project may have for society. Rarely can I show a "science" film and have so many students afterwards agree that it really was fascinating. In fact given its 2 hour length we can't finish it in one sitting and they beg me each day "Can we finish that movie today?" This movie stimulates some fascinating conversations in my classroom, and as a teacher, who could ask for more 
 I really appreciate scholarly works like this book.  I've been trying to find a good book on the history of mosaics that is - in-print -  and this is it!  Excellent documentation!  Not too - dry - of a read either. A big  thanks to Roger Ling for the enlightenment. Beautiful photographs, wish  there were a-whole-lot more 
 This is one of Tracy's first albums, he just keeps getting better with each one he puts out!  Tracy can sing a love song like no other.  He can also get you up and dancing the very next song 
 This workbook provides a framework for sharing the Journey of becoming like Jesus Christ, the goal of all authentic disciples of Jesus.  It contains many wonderful thoughts and suggestions 
 I loved this book.  Ms. Feehan can write the best material that pulls you right into the story.  It was great to see and hear from all the old characters again.  The only thing I did not like was the story ended and I have to wait for the next one due later this year.  I highly recommend to anyone Ms. Feehan and the Dark series 
 How do you follow a bloody, though often slow at times, sword-fighting extravaganza? Any attempt to either recreate the magic of the first movie or go off in an entirely different direction would be very risky. It is even more risky to place the fate of your movie in the hands of David Carradine. To say that, for the most part, swords will stay sheathed and instead acting will rule the day in Volume 2 was an interesting move and had you told me ahead of time that it would be so, I would not have believed you. After the fact, I can say that David Carradine is a star.   After much deliberation, I feel that I liked Volume 2 better than Volume 1. There were no characters that I enjoyed in Volume 1, while I loved the introduction of both Pai Mei (the martial arts master) and Esteban Vihaio (Bill's Spanish-speaking father figure). The highlight, however, was Bill.  He is a charismatic man to whom it would seem everyone takes a liking. His scratchy voice, which borders on a whisper, somehow soothes and calms. No one should wonder how he, with his charm; inteligence; and martial arts ability, rose to his position of power. And yet based upon what we know about Bill's relationship with The Bride, it is no surprise that the series is titled "Kill Bill."   I never expected to be so impressed with the writing in a Quentin Tarantino film. The story, though cheesy, was well planned out and the dialogue was perfect for the feel and direction of the film. The plot of the first movie was like a bunch of boulders placed next to each other, and Volume 2 was the sand poured over them to fill in the gaps. Most of Volume 2 was the back story which was lacking from Volume 1, but not so noticeably absent that it was not entertaining. There were questions that went unanswered until the second installment, which is expected in a series.   Kill Bill Volume 2 added depth to the plot and the characters introduced in Volume 1. It featured martial-arts fighting scenes, but introduced more verbal sparring than its prequel. Uma Thurman is the headlining star of the Kill Bill series, but David Carradine stole the show when he breathed life into Bill while The Bride tried to take it away.  
 This book is an invaluable resource for those just getting into cycling.  It also makes a great reference tool for the advanced cyclist 
 This book, in conjunction with other resources, is a good introduction to Haskell.  http://www.haskell.org has a lot of guidance as well.    If you are like me and you are learning Functional Programming after many years of other styles of programming Haskell can be daunting.  Books like this explain things from the fundamental levels to more advanced levels.  If you read the introduction to the book you will see that it is natural to skip around chapter to chapter when it becomes appropriate to do so.  Deciding when it's appropriate is going to depend on your goals.  If you want to write full-blown applications in Haskell you may find yourself skipping around much earlier than someone who wants to cover the language completely.  Overall I find this to be a very good book but some of the exercises can be very difficult for someone new to Functional Programming.  Almost anything worth doing is not easy though :) 
 This book contains art by Rackstraw Downes which is more likely to be taken for photographs than the paintings that they are. Now, these are not still life or portraits of people but very common urban landscapes and waste lands. The book also has a section by the painter himself on some of the difficulties faced by artists when the vertical angle seems to change over a wider or deeper view.  Is Modern art representative of our age? What tools of our age can be used to truly stand for its time? Jackson Pollock,master of 'drip' technique feels,"The modern painter cannot express this age, the airplane, the atom bomb, the radio, in the old forms of the Renaissance or of any past culture". Downes with his technique of painting what he sees, has expressed modern age with the tall buildings,metal bridges,expressways and cars in a very realistic way like a camera would.It would be unfair to compare a painter with a camera.The book has well organized material on the differences in art by a realist and what a photo can hold.  The book also has references to the work of many other artists like Jonathan Borofsky(Molecule Man), Eva Hesse, Brice Marden and so on. 
 "... a book of that rare sort which can lay the foundations for  another man's intellectual career", wrote Jacques Barzun in his  Forward as invitation for the inquiring mind to have patience in reading  this weighty volume.  He boldly reassures the new reader that his/her  encounter will be "an opportunity for self-development, and a source  of life-long gratitude".  Who is this Jacques Barzun? and why so much  flattery for a book?  It is only after justifiably granting this book  permanent residency in our libraries that we can fully appreciate the  extent of Barzun's admiration.  It is by familiar encounters with this book  which renew our sense of history, and the history of ideas, that we see  more clearly what is in our heads.  And what more pleasant way to be  inspired by and infused with the historical spirit than to indulge in the  captivating and coherent flow of Randall's eloquence 
 This is a heartfelt and touching look at the ties that bind family and lovers in "sickness and in health"  The story of a sister who goes to live with and help care for her brother who is dying of aids, is beautiful in it's simplicity and quiet dignity.  The relationship between Todd and his partner Jacob is portrayed honestly and pulls no punches.  I especially enjoyed the inspirational "quotes" that are sprinkled throughout the novel.  This story shows us the importance of love and committment no matter what type of package it comes in 
 This is an absolutely delightful book! It is full of wonderful and ironic humor which is both hysterically funny and insightful. The honesty and  wisdom of Mr. Witte's observations (posed as a "birthday quiz")  are oddly comforting to those of us who are near to either side of   "F-Day"(Fifty!). I hope Mr. Witte continues to write in this  vein. I highly recommend this book 
 I love my curiosity Mogu pillow, its very comfortable to sleep with and it is very cute. A must buy for anyone who ever likes Mogu in the slightest. 
 There has long been a curious notion abroad that it is somehow "tacky" to criticize anyone else's religious beliefs. Structuralist critic Jonathan Culler once wrote an essay taking issue with this notion, and S. T. Joshi now takes the initiative to attack the vagaries of religion with full vigor.  Ascribing the explanation of religion's prevalence to the inability of most people to muster enough intelligence to break out of the metaphysical brainwashings they have undergone in childhood, Joshi follows an approach that allows him to examine the topic both in breadth and depth--he meticulously dissects the religious pronouncements of several leading proponents, people as varied as the astute T. S. Eliot and the absurdly comical Jerry Falwell.  Joshi argues with great cogency that organized religion has no fair claim to have promoted ethical or moral uprightness and in fact has stood in opposition to these qualities throughout history.  Joshi's logic is so incisive that the slippery claims of theism fall readily by the wayside, and I find it hard to imagine that any fair-minded and perceptive reader could work his or her way through this astonishing volume without finding the experience unsettling, but unsettling in a productive and mind-opening way. Joshi's book is an invigorating read, one that can be undertaken in a random-chapter-order fashion due to its structure as a collection of connected but essentially independent essays.  Once in a rare while, a book that makes a whole lot of sense comes along, and this is one of those times.  Read it.  Remember it 
 My wife and I picked this up at the store and were severely disappointed.  Just a remake of an already established game.  Save yourself some time and money and go look up the rules for Euchre, get a deck of regular playing cards from the junk drawer or dollar store and enjoy the same game for almost nothing 
 i loved..loved melissa's version of vampires. it comppletly blew my mind... she is a remarkable writer and this story was incredible. i am loooking forward to the sequel 
 Probably one of Wells' least known works, Little Wars has nonetheless helped to spawn an entire hobby, industry, and lifestyle.  The role-playing games of today would not exist if it were not for the efforts of mister Gygax, who decided, in the 1970s, to take his miniature games a little further. And miniature games would not exist if not for the efforts of H.G. himself, nearly a century earlier. It is fitting then, that this new printing of Little Wars (the first in a generation) should include an introduction from mist gygax along side the original text.  As a role-player, I am enternaly grateful to both of these men for midwifing the hobby into the world. As a fan of science fiction, I prostrate myself at the memory of Wells.  The book, while antiquated by today's standards, still has an enormous affection for the subject matter that cannot help be felt by the reader. Of additional note is the wonderfully naive Victorian language, not realizing that it could be read as sexist or non-politically correct by modern audiences.  Everyone should know where their hobby comes from, and this is it 
 I had heard great things about this book, but after beginning my copy I wasn't sure what to think. The first few dozen pages are very slippery. The acts are dim, the messages subtle. Halberstam uses odd language here and there, slipping between hard-nosed reporting and glossy editorializing. The first act in the book revolves around a conversation that by itself seems only one of thousands at the national governing level, a chat that gently draws us into a cloudy and cloudier picture, which Halberstam to his credit clears for us page after page after page.  Halberstam gives us characterizations that clearly define the players we are dealing with. In so many instances it feels like we are back in 1960s America, speaking with the principals, knowing their psyches and professional backgrounds and the probable reasons for their decisions. A long book indeed, but lean, actually concise, painting a picture that never fails to amaze, puzzle and anger. Halberstam roots out the subtleties and sustains a very complicated chronology in a very readable text. Of all the sustained histories I have ever read, especially one in a single volume, this has to get my vote for one of America's best examples 
 I liked LeAnn's music during this time frame even better than her current stuff.  The CD arrived well packed, in good shape and on time. I'm happy 
 This is a very useful item. It looks great and holds a lot of stuff. You can also carry it around from room to room 
 This is an important book that explains an incredibletransformation in American social policy. Sometime around themid-1960s, a new code of private values and government policies pushed their way into mainstream society.  This vision and its consequences were a radical departure from our nation's past.  From 1950 to 1965, an economy founded on free market principles, nurtured on minimal government regulation, and protected from large welfare programs, had slashed the poverty rate from one third of the population to just over one-tenth.  Eliminating poverty seemed like a real possibility to Americans as long as the wheels of capitalism continued to spin unhindered.  From 1950 to 1965, African-Americans won court battles giving them the human rights guaranteed to every citizen. These belated changes were cemented by the hallmark 1964 Civil Rights Act and accompanied by a remarkable surge in African-American incomes. This fifteen-year period was an era of immense progress.  Not only were the classes and races coming together but crime was remarkably low, families exceptionally resilient, and drug use almost non-existent.  Then around 1965 something happened.  All of a sudden the capitalist economy that made Old World immigrants into middle-class, suburban home-owners was described as a guilty, imperialist system that exploited the poor and the weak.  Government planners in Washington got right to solving this "problem." From now on, people could expect a guaranteed income for an unlimited period of time, without regard to personal behavior or the ability to work. To show what a compassionate society we are, we would destroy the work ethic that was the bedrock of Western civilization.  But that wasn't the best part.  After 1965, the principle of equal opportunity for all races that Martin Luther King martyred himself for was also described as a "guilty" system that kept blacks and women oppressed.  Suddenly, it wasn't only white supremacists who claimed that blacks couldn't thrive in American society.  It was the very black leaders themselves.  They claimed that affirmative action programs were needed to keep African-Americans functional.  Too bad if it destroyed the American ideal of merit and equal opportunity.  Tough luck if it strained relations between whites and blacks.  Those claiming that racial preferences were unjust could be dismissed as closet racists.  Only a decade later, the consequences of this change in values and government policy were beyond dispute.  Destroying merit and the work ethic did not create a "Great Society." Rather, it helped create a large underclass imprisoned by poverty.  Crime rates tripled, illegitimate births exploded, and drug use surged.  The trends have leveled off since the late 1970s but the consequences of this values shift remain with us today.  Opponents of racial quotas are still lampooned as closet racists.  Reformers of the welfare state are dismissed as "uncompassionate." What is really racist and uncompassionate is defending the government policies that created this wretched condition.  We made this happen.  And we can unmake it. The power, as always, is ours 
 This DVD is absolutely captivating. It's an adaptation Of  Choderlos de Laclos' book written in the seventeen hundreds. Directed by Josee Dayan for TV in 2003 I believe. He did an amazing job of bringing the story to modern times. If you love intrigue, deception, jealousy, sex and pure evil, you will adore this DVD with its magnificant color and scenery. It's just a wonderful film and you will love it. If I could, I would give it ten stars 
 My dog really loves this bed & I really like the idea of a 'cool side' & a 'warm side'. However, the color is not what I would call 'moss' (brownish-green), but 'teal' (blueish-green). Just FYI!  No complaints about the quality, tho 
 This work is towering punch . There is not a track disappointed . Schon made a glorious journey through the different moods of smooth jazz , working with Jonathan Cain . Caribbean blue may be one of the best and sensual tracks , but Boulevard of dreams , Big moon or Zanzibar . No matter what you choose because there is no waste . Excellent buy and relaxing and refreshing moments that will reward you so many times that you will make of this CD one of your favorites . It has such magnetism attraction and meticulous sense of the harmony that personally I consider it one of the best albums in the nineties decade . A winner album . 
 When the film first started, I have to say I was ready to write the film off. I notice a lot of films who use wild filmmaking techniques to cover up the lack of substance in the film. With this it seemed as if anything and everything was used to tell the story for wild, fast-paced editing to animated sequences to split-screen. But whereas Requiem for a Dream also had a myriad of visual tricks to make up for the lack of substance, this film is a rollercoaster and knows it and uses it because it needs it. This was not meant to be some tearjerking drama; it's just good energetic stuff.  Manni is in trouble because he lost 100,000 of a mobster's money and he isn't happy and he gives him 20 minutes to find it or else. His girlfriend Lola isn't going to just sit around and has to run all over the place in order to help find it before Manni robs a supermarket. But this 20 minutes is told a couple of times over as possible alternatives. Instead of not knowing what will happen but rather where the same story will branch off into different outcomes.  Now I should mention the opening sequence which is as kinetic and obvious MTV influenced than anything. By this time I was thinking "I don't think I'm going to be into this very much". That is until the film jettisoned that idea and it becomes more energetic and it works better. One of my favorite ideas is at times Lola will bump into someone in a scenario and a series of photographs will show you where that person's life will lead with different outcomes. Example: one guy on a bike will crash and meet a woman and get married while in a different scenario he becomes homeless. It's basically kind of like a butterfly effect and it helps the idea of unpredictability and if different actions would bring different outcomes.  Acting is spot-on and no better heroine than Franka Potente. Physically fit with big red hair, it's a good main character as anyone but I have one annoyance. At certain times (3, I think) Lola basically screams her head off and shatters glass and it just seemed unnecessary. Yeah we want to win at Roulette but screaming over recommended decibel levels. But other than that, she's as solid with everyone else pulling in respectable performances.  Don't mind the 8-year-old-on-a-placebo-kick opening and you'll find a good example to kill an hour and 20 minutes 
 The Sixth and Seventh Book of Moses speaks of religious magic, both black and white. It is insightful as far as spells and makes for a fascinating read whether you are a magician practicing spells or just curious about magic 
 I used this book for an undergraduate course on U.S. intelligence history at a very selective college and it was universally well-received.  The book presents a comprehensive treatment and assessment of FBI counter-intelligence dating back to the 1930's.  This is a shadowy subject since the crime-fighting "celebrity" cases of the 30's (See: Bryan Burroughs' _Public Enemies) have always drowned-out the birth and growth of the FBI's formidible intelligence/counterintelligence capabilities.  An aspect that has been forgotten in all this, to my mind, is that there is a reason the FBI has been deemed the "lead agency" in the current "War on Terror" - this book tracks that history.  It is a tragic history that engages Soviet Espionange, the Smith Act cases, and their politicization in the McCarthy era.  The book also addresses the revelations of the 1996 Venona Transcripts and pays attention to the latest contentions in a fluid and changing historiography.  Oh, and it keeps you wanting to turn the page.  CRG Worcester, MA    
 Eric Clapton lit a huge fire when he recorded Crossroads live at Royal Albert Hall, London, UK with Cream in the late 60's. That recording kicked ECs career into overdrive as every guitar player since has heard it if not copied licks from that stellar performance. Through-out his career Clapton has shown to be significantly influenced by Robert Johnson's music. He has gone as far as to pay royalties to Johnson's decendents for the use of his music. This new CD was recorded in the very same room of the now abandon Houston Tx, building where Robert Johnson himself recorded this music in (2 sessions)1936-37. Johnson's guitar technique was such that Clapton himself admitted to not be able to do it justice (all while singing and playing in one take) and therefore employed Doyle Bramhall to cover some of the guitar work. This effort is the sincerest form of tribute I can imagine. This is not music that Clapton recorded because of it's comercial value. This is a true labor of love. This is intrinsicly blues therefore blues fans and musicologists alike will dig it.   
 How many books about junkiehood are there out there? Let us count... Many, many, many, and I've read a majority of them. However this one was different, as it seemed to speak directly to me. That may sound slightly self-centered, but as someone who has been a heroin addict in LA, I can tell you, this book is right on the money. The glitzy, seemingly mindless Hollywood types, the dope-slinging zombies down at Sixth and Alvarado, all of it- it's all here. When I feel the need to remind myself that someone out there truly understands me, I read this book. And I most definitely reccomend it to anyone, past or present junkie or not. Those who have lived through similar experiences will nod and smile in recognition, those who haven't will hopefully be enlightened 
 Good CD, but not as melodic as I was looking for 
   There are just some movies that will always have a place in my heart and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is one of those.  I still remember when I took my children to see the original and how thrilled they were to see a car that could fly and sail the seas. As a matter of fact I think I was thrilled as well. The characters are great with Dick Van Dyke playing one crazy inventor named Caractacus Potts and our female lead Truly Scrumptious, now how can you not giggle at names like that? And to this day I can start singing one of the songs and my children will join in, proving my point that  after all these years you understand Chitty Chitty Bang Bang left an impression.  a great storyline, great music and  clean-cut family movie that everyone can enjoy 
 From the negative reviews, it looks like Derrick has upset some religious people with this book. His book is well written for a first time author, and grinds at you with its brutal honesty. It's obvious some people can't take that to well; and that's too bad, because the World needs more honest people. I guess some people don't understand how much courage it takes to put a book like this out into the publics' eye, and expose you to the strict criticism it will bring. I say good for you Derrick, and keep fighting the good fight 
 I would recommend this book, not as gripping and captivating as One Hundred Years of Solitude but still interesting 
 In this sequel to the first installment, the makers of this film takes a clear stand on who they think is guilty and who is innocent.One has to question the eagerness of Byers to participate in the movie, while most of the "other side" did not want to be associated with the project. Would a murderer come back for more attention? Even though he is a despicable common white trash human being, does that make him guilty? I firmly believe in a retrail. But I am not so sure about who is innocent or who isnt. May the truth be known in our lifetime! Apparently there is a third installment planned - I can't wait to see it 
 Stu Hackel says in the liner notes, "They stayed united for 43 years. No one in music ever did that. No one." Indeed, so true, and they're still together as an act today. It's now wonder with a great voice like Levi Stubbs leading them off, great songs from a great song-writing team, and the Motown magic provided by the Funk Brothers. "The Ultimate Collection" is an in-depth look at the Tops' years at Motown. Just about every record they released with Motown is on here with some very good B-sides like "I Got A Feeling". It's got ME rockin' and a-reelin', I must say! Don't look for "Keeper of the Castle" or "Ain't No Woman Like The One I've Got," for those were from their ABC/Dunhill years, since this is a MOTOWN collection. Personally, I feel that "Something About You" is one of their all-time best. You'll agree once you'll hear that infectious beat. The reason the sound quality might not fit your expectations is beacuse all the recordings were the original masters used on the 45 RPMs. There are many pros and cons about this. The pros would be that if anyone owned any of these 45 RPM records from back then can now hear exactly as they sounded. It sounds like remastered 45s! The cons would be that if one hears a song like "Reach Out I'll Be There," or "It's The Same Old Song" on the radio it sounds different than the 45 and may not be what you're used to hearing. Reverb may be deleted and an instrument may not be as loud. These are such details you shouldn't worry about. Other great tunes are "Ask The Lonely", "Still Water", "Shake Me, Wake Me" and "I'll Turn To Stone." They are all superior. If you're looking for a defenite worthwile compilation of the Four Tops, look no further; you hit the jackpot 
 i m french so i say it with my word : c'est trés beau  
 This is one of those books where the image you have 6 months after reading the book is not the same you have when you close it.  As stated by others, this is not a book full of sunshine. Life is messy. People work hard. They don't always like each other, or themselves. They make mistakes. They die. By rights, this should be a depressing story.   However, with the gift of Ruby Lennox as omniscient narrator, the overall memory is one of happiness.  Ruby is a survivor. She's precocious, full of imagination, and has an amazing ability to cope when all around her is falling apart. She sees that things aren't right, and often only half-understands. But she accepts that things will work out, and eventually finds her place in the world.  The structure of the book adds richness, but can be confusing if you aren't reading quickly.  The footnote chapters truly show "behind the scenes" and gives the reader better insight into what shapes a person's behavior. As someone who loves history, I found the footnote chapters fascinating...what is the story behind the black and white picture of Great Grandma? If Mom and Dad's marriage is so unhappy, why? What was is like when they first met?  However, just as footnotes in a paper can be intrusive, it's possible to lose the narrative thread. My recommendation is to try to read the narrative chapter and footnote in one sitting so you don't lose the context.   This book is definitely a keeper - and one to share. Ruby is one of the most compelling characters I've run across in a long time. Her story, and the story of her family reinforce the idea that our experiences and those of the people around us are what shape the person we become 
 Review by Mike Heath says it all. Only disagreement with his review is feeling about "No More", which is very good, not that he says it is bad.  After reading all of the reviews at this point, Heath has Seger and the CD down cold and no reason to go any further. 
 I loved the jokes and stories in the book. I thought I knew a lot about comedians, but there was an incredible amount of new information and interesting explanations in this book. It's a great pleasure to read, too. What struck me most, though, was how the emotional struggles the comedians went through and how they used humor to cope with their fear and anger seems similar to the emotional struggles we're going through as Americans right now 
 Initially, I found this book more than a little surreal, but as I continued to read, the verbal fireworks of Robbins' prose gradually won me over.  Reading this book is the verbal equivalent to a carnival ride:  fast and vibrant, it will make your head spin.  The imagery painted here is vivid and alive, and the characters are quirky and complex.  There are several seemingly divergent threads in this story, which suddenly converge in the end, though not all the questions are answered.  The numerous themes that twist through the rapid-fire prose might be contraversial to some, but thoughtful readers will find plenty of ideas to chew on.  An incredibly original book, it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I found it entertaining 
 This is a great book for the person who wants to know ALL about Pilates.  This should be the book that everyone reads first before beginning Pilates.  A really good book 
 I am a big fan of N. Sparks and enjoyed this book as I do all of his books 
       Beautiful, January 15, 2006 A Kid's Review Although i only own two cold records (YOTS and ADKOP), I've heard everything by them. ADKOP is easily their best effort to date. The piano on the title track takes cold to a whole new level with their music, and although i'm usually not one for ballads, that song touched me. God's Song finds cold experimenting again with the piano, and again, it's done to perfection. There are a couple of songs on here that sound like outakes from YOTS, but because they're coupled with more diverse music, ADKOP doesn't have that monotone sound that YOTS suffered from.   If you're looking for a record that will touch your soul with infectious music and deep, melodic vocals, you're found the right record. Anyone who says this isn't their best knows nothing about good music. 5 stars.     hmmm.... then what is this? just 6 months later, another review!     boring, July 18, 2006 A Kid's Review guitars are boring and simple ,the vocals were ok but most of the songs were bad.There is only about 4 good songs on this cd  
 No one needs a review of this at this point in life but to me, this was always Floyd's best album.  Everyone can argue darkside and wish or their earlier stuff and that's fine by me.  I personally have always thought this is one of the top 10 albums ever.  For me at least.  I wish they'd release it in SACD or DVD-audio.  I have about 4 versions of it, asian, remastered, etc 
 This book tells the story of a woman scientist who I had never heard of.  Her work on DNA is only a part of the book.  She died of ovarian cancer in her late thirties.  The book suggests that she might have married a fellow scientist, Don Caspar, had she not become ill. The science is accessible and held my interest.  Maddox by no means paints her as a saint but presents both the positive and negative.  It sounded like she may have been arrogant at times but she certainly had no picnic in making her way in science in the fifties.  Very moving story 
 When i got done with 1st to die i couldn't wait to read 2nd chance and man was this worth the wait. The characters were very well written and beleivable and the nice little twists Patterson had were great even the tragic ones when once again a main character dies but it still made me even more enthralled with this story becasue of Lindsay's determination to catch a sadistc killer who killed one of her friends/partner. Once you think the story is over not only do you still have proabaly 75 pages you find out very quickly its not who they think it is. The ending was much more intenese and very exciting and i forgot to mention the nice little sub plots with her father in which i also enjoyed immensely. I also liked the fact that there was romance but no crazy sex scenes like with Lindsay and her partner who did it almost every chance they got. But anyway this story had a solid ending with a mini question if your able to catch it that was not in the story but in the epilogue. Like with 2nd chance i can't wait to read 3rd degree. I thought SK was my favorite author but Patterson beats SK by a thousand miles. Keep up the good work Patterson. Can't wait to start Alex Cross 
 My husband is a vietnam vet so I collect war movies. This is really a great movie.  I watch it quite often.  It is one of the best in my collection.  Very exciting and wonderful 
 This book is a breath of fresh air.  It keeps you laughing and thinking positively in spite of whatever comes your way in life.  It is a GREAT book for a no good very bad day!  
 One of Jane Austen's best.  The actors could not be any more perfect.  Who can resist a young Laurence Olivier, and the beautiful Greer Garson 
 Awesome cookbook!  I borrowed my friend's copy after I tried her Cajun Shrimp recipe on page 56.  Lots of great recipes 
 If you are a teacher, or you are in a teacher education program, or a  parent and you haven't read this book you are missing out!!!  Every  teachers ed. program should require this book.  It was an amazing read.   Mem takes you to places in education you never knew existed!  Thanks Mem 
 I have always wanted to be a vegetarian, and now, after the summer I turned 30, I have started this wonderful voyage! I just wish I had had the conviction as a young teen to do this (like Pierson's daughter), and had a mom like Stephanie Pierson to back me up.   I love all of the suggestions and recommendations Pierson gives in this book, which was the springboard (literally) for my baby steps into a meat-free lifestyle. I am much happier and I feel better than I have in years, plus I really feel like I am making the world a better place, one plate at a time! Bravo, Stephanie 
 The characters are so complex espcially Peggy Shippen and Becca Syng. Ms. Rinaldi portrays a side of Peggy Shippen that we don't normally think about-or any other historical figure. She shows Peggy Shippen's effervescent personality and enlightens us to look at her in a new perspective. Also, the character developement in a turbulent plot like this is fantastic 
 This book sits quite well alongside Steinbecks "Grapes of Wrath"...similar tales of trials and tribulations. Although I would say that Buck's prose is slightly simpler. Very good story and very well told. My enjoyment of it might have been heightened as I recently returned from China and so was able to picture the scenes/characters much more readily. A quick read and flows well. Recommended. 
 This review is for the Criterion collection DVD edition of the film.  "Bicycle Thieves" released in Italy as "Ladri di biciclette" is about a bill poster who's bicycle is stolen. The film chronicles the efforts of him and his young son in recovering the bicycle.  This film won an honoary oscar for best foreign laguage film and is considered on of the greatest films ever made.   The Criterion DVD edition is a double disc set.  Disc one contains the film with an optional English dubbed track Disc two contains "Working with De Sica" with various interviews with people involved with De Sica and scenes of his other films, "Life as It Is" a docunebtary on neorealism cinema in Italy, and a documentary on longtime DeSica colleague, Cesare Zavattini.  The set also includes a booklet with other material.  This is a very good film and the best DVD release available 
 One  of  the  best  book  I  have  read  in the  past  year  has  to  be Junie  B.  Jones  and  the  Yucky  Blucky   Fruitcake  ,  by  Barbara  Park  .  It  Is  a  marvelous   book   about  a  fruitcake  she  made  for  the carnival. One of the major  reasons  I  enjoyed  this so  much  is  what  happened  when she  went  to the  carnival.  She took  the  cake  home  and  it  was  the  as  hard  as  a  rock. Another  reason  I  found  the  book   to  be  so  wonderful  is  that  is  the  way  Junie   B.  Jones talks. She talks funny.  I like the part when she tells the clown to "Back off". She does not like the clown.  Of course my favorite reason for liking this book is she throws a sponge right at the meanie boy's face and said bull's eye.  As you can see, Junie B. Jones and the Yucky Blucky Fruitcake, by  Barbara Park, was truly my favorite book 
 My three and a half year old son loves this toy. Each time we play the game is different. He likes to find the correct elephants and stack them. He's learning how to build the tower so that it stays balanced. His eight year old sister enjoys the game as well. We purchased extras to give as gifts 
 "Please Mom, just one more chapter?"  I said that line a lot while reading this book.  Downriver is an awesome book that deals with friendship, bravery, and adventure.  	No counselor, no permit, and no mile by mile guide.  Just "borrowed" equipment from their camp Discovery Unlimited or "Hoods in the Woods" (as the kids called it).  Rita (a rough New Yorker), Troy (the leader), Adam (a Ninja), Star (shy and weird), Pug (a titanic guy), Freddy (quiet and mysterious), and Jessie (the main character) all have to work together and jeopardize their lives to get through the biggest adventure of their lifetime.  	With their equipment, they think they can conquer the rapids of Granite Falls, Hermit, Crystal, and Upset.  But when a flash flood and a scorpion sting hits the group, they may be in trouble.  Follow these hassled kids as they twist, turn, and flip through the mighty red walls and rapids of the infamous Grand Canyon.  	In my opinion, this book is a must read because it just grabs on to you and won't let you go `til the end. 
 This book is a nice general introduction to the problem of evil. It is divided into four major parts: (1) classic statements of the problem, (2) versions of the problem of evil, (3) perspectives in theodicy, and (4) issues in the problem of evil.   The first section includes excerpts from Hume, the Book of Job, Dostoevsky's _The Brothers Karamazov_, and Elie Wiesel's _Night_. This is a good way to make the seriousness of the problem vivid for those who are unfamiliar with it.   The second section clarifies the problem by demonstrating that it can be thought of in (at least) three distinct ways: as a logical problem, an evidential problem, or an existential problem. As in the first section, the articles chosen for this section are quite gripping. Some of the philosophers reprinted in this section are J.L. Mackie, Alvin Plantinga, and Marilyn M. Adams.  The third section introduces three main approaches to solving the problem: Augustinian theodicy, Irenaean theodicy, and process theodicy. This is a tidy way to organize many attempts to solve the problem. Some of the philosophers reprinted in this section are Augustine, John Hick, and Lewis Ford.  The final section is a bit of a catch-all, but it seems necessary. Here we find articles directly addressing such issues as natural evil and whether it is necessary for God to have created the best possible world. Some of the philosophers reprinted in this section are Robert Adams, Richard Swinburne, and Eleonore Stump.  The main strengths of this book are (1) it includes a great deal of motivation for the problem of evil - enough to inspire real concern; (2) the articles selected are fairly well balanced between attempts to solve the problem and rejections of such attempts; and (3) it has sufficient breadth to help the newcomer understand (and categorize) any further reading he does on this subject. I highly recommend it as an introductory text for a class on the problem of evil - perhaps supplemented by some additional journal articles that are more up-to-date. I think it is also a good first book for those who are generally concerned about the problem of evil 
 Good "ole school" Winans...these brothers really know how to get you into praising the Lord and focusing on the goodness of God 
 I have worn out one earlier model Radica FreeCell, and have had several years of use from a second. I hesitated to get the new larger-screen one because I like to carry one in my purse for those waits in line or in restaurants. But I am really glad I got the new one. First, it is faster (not like playing FreeCell on a PC, but still ...). Second, the selection of cards from a stack is more intelligent. Third, the backlit screen works well for me. Fourth, the larger numbers and larger buttons are much more comfortable. Fifth, the separate scroll-up and scroll-down buttons are a great improvement over the double-use deal wheel. I wish the bulbous "head" were a little smaller; I would like to be able to manipulate the unit with one hand - when I am brushing my teeth 
 Like an American "War and Peace", albeit not quite as comprehensive in its characters as Tolstoy, but a great read shedding a lot of light on the lead-up in the U.S. to WWII 
 This was my introduction to Charles de Lint and I enjoyed the story so much, I read every other book of his I could find! Another great one: Greenmantle. Great writer. You won't go wrong with this book 
 WHY is almost everybody giving NG Kids a bad review? I LOVE NG Kids almost as much as i love Discovery Girls and i don't think it has THAT many ads. I have a 1 year subscription to NG Kids and a 2 year subscription to Discovery Girls. NG comes out once a month, DG twice a month. So i'll have twelve issues of NG in 1 year and 12 issues of DG in two years. Actually 13 because i ordered the Special Edition. 
 In "Finding Calm In Life's Chaos," Becky Harling guides the reader through some simple Biblical truths that sometimes get lost in the busyness and difficulties of day to day life. In the stories she shares, her honesty and sincerity bring to light some of the things we all struggle through. She also offers a reminder to see the bigger picture and rely on the peace and hope that can be found in Jesus Christ. It was a pleasure to read and an encouragement to me in my own life 
 I read this book to my own two kids, so when I saw it on the list from Amazon, I ordered it for the grandchildren, who enjoy it just as much 
   There are several classical books that withstood the test of time and in one way or another deserve attention. One of them is "The Prince". Why? Its applicability to the democratic state remains a question, however I'm sure politicians read it for how to make one nation the dominating force in the global community. But, if you're not interested in international relations (how to rule over a principality), read this for its uncanny insight into the darkness of the human nature. Believe it or not, it is a great psychology tool. Of course its center stage is reserved for the leader of a monarchy. But then again forget about what's obvious and focus on what's written between the lines. Take for example the following statement:  "...men are wretched creatures who would not keep their word to you, you need to keep your word to them."  Here is the perfect example of how a mid-16th century writer characterizes the eternal and unchangeable human nature. Time and again he addresses the lack of trust one should put in people and how one is to handle his enemies. Many of us have already established our own framework of how to do this, but checking this framework against such a historical artifact would be extremely beneficial.   In addition, the book possesses a wealth of historical information on the topic of political strategy and to be fair - all of us can take advantage of a political lesson (especially in this day and age).  A short and quick read, I recommend it not only for its lessons, but for the mere fact that history deemed it worthy of preservation.   -by Simon Cleveland 
 I carry this book with me too work all the time to remind me and give me inspiration to strive for more and never quit in reaching my financial goals 
 Leí este libro en español y me encanto, nunca había leido ningún libro de Arturo Pérez-Reverte, pero me gusto mucho.  Me gusto la forma en que fue escrito, escribe como un periodista estudiando la historia de la "Reina del Sur" y después cambia a contarnos  como si la estuvieramos viviendo.  Se ven las dos caras, de la persona que estudia la vida de otros y la de los que viven 
 Anyone who has sat in class and was just bored stiff with the disjointed , disconnected way of  western teaching  and rote memorization will love this one.  This is truly the Missing Link… For those of us who have seen  and read historical, allegorical and sci-fi epics such as Anthony and Cleopatra, Ben Hur, Sparticus, Julius Caesar,  Lawrence of Arabia, The Ten Commandments, the Matrix, Samson and Delilah, all of the Greek Mythology programs (Jason and the Argonauts, Hercules, Troy)  etc., etc., know that there was something missing from these shows, and that if the avoided ingredients were placed correctly into the storylines these movies/programs would have been great, because they would have been  correct…. Even today if one was to look at the new Sci-fi shows ( Star Wars, Star Trek, Deep Space Nine) and  other programs one would see ancient  architecture, names , languages and places that is not new at all but the ancient future that has been rehashed.!!!    Of special interest see page 171 and view the ancient  buildings prevalent in many of the above listed shows, the links of the ancient population with the current population in chapter VII, the ancient languages that is still used today by the descendants of the kemetic tribes, the same population found indigenous in every corner of the world.  The author is one of the great thinking persons of his time and this influential text should be part of everyone’s library….    
   A sequel as brilliant as its predecessor "Rise to Rebellion". I have not enjoyed two back to back books so thoroughly nor devoured them so quickly. It is as close to time travel as I have ever encountered in a book and it has even invaded my dreams. Characters continue to be developed and myths shattered. I have always been told Saratoga enticed the French to formalize an alliance but it was in fact Franklin's diplomatic intrigue. Greene sheds the "Quaker general" description and takes on a personality that is appealing and surprising. Young Lafayette is endearing and Washington reassumes the mythic proportions he held in my youth but now I know why. It is impossible to imagine modern pansy-a** Americans enduring what these men endured. As a living historian who is passionate about "selling" the American Revolution I will be recommending these books to everyone I encounter. Shaara has finally done the Revolution justice. 
 The Good Apprentice sucked me into reading Iris Murdoch about 20 years ago. I have since worked my way, with immense pleasure, through all her novels. I'm reading GA for the second time, and I find I have less patience now for the long philosophical soliloquies of the characters. But the novel reminds me how well Murdoch indulges her readers' love a good plot and richly imagined and deliciously flawed characters, all revolving around a Great Man, who may not be but probably is somewhat of a charlatan. Reading Murdoch is the best way I know to combine a love of philosophy--and excellent writing--with a hankering for soap opera. GA is a good place to start reading Murdoch (and come back to) 
 I found such wonderful and informative information in this book.  From general health benefits of drinking green tea to chapters dedicated to specific health problems such as different cancers, dental health, cardio,  etc.  Everything is backed-up with study and research results so you know  actual numbers. And if it's not a fact, they let you know.  I drink a lot  more green tea now 
 Very informative and well written.  Ms. Cage obviously understands the ins and outs of this industry and the information contained in this book will prepare anyone for a professional interview with a major airline 
 I bought two other "beginning" C books before I bought "Absolute Beginner's Guide to C", and now I'm happy with this latest purchase.  It starts you at the beginning, is written as though the author is talking directly to you, and is easy to follow. Cudos to Perry.   
 I've been wrestling (teaching it) for twenty years and this is the first book that ever showed all the different styles around the world.  I thought I knew pretty much everything about wrestling but I learned a lot of things I didn't know from Maberry's book.  Also, there was some very informative stuff about martial arts, boxing, fencing...all sorts of stuff.  And the First Aid section is the most complete I've seen in a sports book.  I give this guy two thumbs up 
 One of the best things about Alexander McCall Smith's entertaining No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series is that these aren't really traditional detective stories at all.  One must read between the lines to see that the amusing tales delve far deeper than solving simple mysteries and crimes. Each book provides an enchanting glimpse into the life and times of Botswana and the series really serves as a clever study of human nature.  The loveable and heavyset chief detective Mma Ramotswe is clearly large and in charge, as her unique agency helps its clients and the stories' readers themselves discover many "things they already know." This charming series is excellent light reading and especially great for planes. Take the whole series with you to make a transatlantic flight go by in the blink of an eye!  
 Wow...this was a great movie...I really enjoyed it but I wouldn't let young kids see it...but anyway it was really good...yay.. 
 I bought these books to read nightly with my 10 year old son, but ended up reading straight through them by myself over a few days, impatient to get to the end.  Pullman has brought together all the important elements  that parents think of discussing with their children, but sometimes never get around to...or can't find the words for.  And he encases all these concepts in such a rich and engrossing tapestry that it's a joy to re-read it now with my son.  In this age when our society lacks rituals for children to transition into adulthood, these books provide a tool parents can use to ease the process 
 I wanted to see this movie because I really liked Amanda Bynes in "What a Girl Wants" and I thought she would be good in this role.  I was not disappointed.  This movie was so funny and Amanda did such a good job.  Really, all of the characters were cast really well, and each person fit his/her role perfectly.  I first saw this movie on TV and since they kept playing it for several weeks, I kept watching it over and over again.  The more I watched it the more I liked it and finally I had to buy it since they stopped showing it on TV!  If you are looking for a good laugh you should definitely watch this movie 
 It helps that the author is not christian. Prepared to be depressed. You will have a better understanding than our president! 
 This little book has become a classic amongst the adoption community. Choco goes in search of a mother, finally finding himself a character who can offer him everything he's been searching for and, although his new mother doesn't look like him, he finds happiness with her and his new "assorted" siblings. Warm and fuzzy and offers gentle opportunities to open the lines of communication about adoption. Highly recommended 
 James Cagney gives one of the greatest over-the-top performances in the history of film in this dark Freudian masterpiece about a wayward lad and his mother.  Cody Jarrett is a psychopath and sociopath who can't cope with the pressures of insanity without the consolation of his gun-moll mother.  Ma Jarrett (a nice performance by Margaret Wycherly) is the real girl in Cody's life, not the devious blond bombshell (Virginia Mayo) who double-crosses him.  In fact, Cody can't trust anyone but Ma.  His big heist is thwarted by the under cover whom he befriends (Edmund O'Brien). Cody's breakup in prison when he learns of Ma's death is a delicious piece of acting by Cagney.  Yes, it's over-the-top, but who cares? And of course, the legendary ending is one of the great experiences of the Cinema. If love the movies, you have to see "White Heat" 
 I've thoroughly enjoyed listening and relistening to the songs on this CD while on the road.  It's funny to hear how Broadway-ized the memorable scenes from the movie are in these songs.  The only thing that came close to disappointment was not hearing the phrase "silly Enlish k-nig-ht" during the "Run Away" song 
 Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason was the deciding factor in my decision to reject Christianity as a truthful world-view. I struggled for years, growing up in an evangelical church, with the idea of accepting the blood of a god-man as the ultimate resolution to humanity's shortcomings. I am so thankful for the enlightenment that Paine's work introduced to me. I couldn't personally affirm the Bible's accounts of prophecy and miracles were works of fiction until I read Age of Reason.  Paine writes in such a manner that is sometimes impetuous, but always guided by common sense. This is why Paine is so fun to read! While reading (more than twice) I would frequently slam the book down and exclaim "That's so true!". This work has survived the test of time. It continues to speak to fresh generations of free-thinkers. Age of Reason is an excellent introduction into other works of higher Biblical criticism, like those of Dr. Robert M. Price, who, if you haven't heard of him, is a brilliant scholar.   If you loved Age of Reason, try The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man, by Dr. Price. It's far more researched, and provides further insight into many of Paine's arguments.   My only hesitance to the Age of Reason is that I get the sense that Paine honestly believed that the church would crumble after he wrote his book. For example, he wrote "I have now gone through the Bible, as a man would go through a wood with an axe on his shoulder, and fell trees. Here they lie; and the priests, if they can, may replant them. They may, perhaps, stick them in the ground, but they will never make them grow." and "Certain as I am that when opinions are free, either in matters of government or religion, truth will finally and powerfully prevail."  Although I vehemently agree with Paine in both cases, and I hope that TRUTH will finally prevail, it seems the world is growing more in superstition and not less. Paine's success in instigating a revolution of government certainly encouraged him in attempting a revolution of religion. No free-thinker can blame him for hoping, but for being so certain I may have to. Although the time-period in which the book was written may excuse his overconfidence.    Age of Reason is a great classic, and a work of genius. If you don't own this book you should. 
 I bought this for my 1 year old.  He sits on it, and my 3 year old pushes him around.  The different music and sounds are great.  It is one of the best parts of this toy.  My 3 year old pushes it around singing "Thomas, Thomas".  The handle does remove easily, but if pushed down, it doesn't move while being pushed around.  It won't fall off if it is pushed down properly.  Plus, it is nice that it folds, so it takes up less room in the closet 
 Stephen Prince's A New Pot Of Gold details the crisis of the 1980s in American film when Hollywood faced challenges from rising costs and stagnant ticket sales. Both are excellent histories of different eras in American filmmaking 
 I read this book after not having read Miller for about five years and I was pleasantly surprised.  I think that it is better than most of his fictional novels.  It really gives you a feel for what shaped his whole outlook on life.  And it isn't nearly as vitriolic as the Tropics, rather, it's more of a celebration of his craft.  If you are curious about his literary influences (and I was), you  will love this book.  In fact, after reading it once, I immediatley read it a second time and I was inspired by it to the point where I purchased some of the books he makes mention of.  Parts of the book also made me laugh out loud.  I highly recommend it 
 This is the most wonderful story to read to children.  My grandmother read it to me as a child. The story gives children a dreamy sense of enchantment and restful time away from today's world.  This has always been my favorite childhood book and I have read it hundreds of times to my children and grandchildren 
 I bought this fan on the recommendation of a friend. At the end of a hot day, the temperature inside of my apartment is higher than outside.; this fan takes care of removing the hot air and bringing in cool air from the outside. It barely fit the width of my window, but extender can be purchase afterwards if that`s a problem. Very easy to install and operate, there is a thermostat so the fan turns on when the temperature gets too high. Perfect for smaller rooms. Also the price is definitely right. 
 Contrary to what one of the reviewers below contends, little knowledge of the figures under discussion is required on the part of the reader. This is owing to Alexander Nehamas's skill in lucidly and masterfully conveying the key ideas of the philosophers he brings under analysis. Although "The Art of Living" is not an explicit demand for a reorientation of philosophy, and a call for its rechannelling towards abandoning the realm of pure theory in favour of a more practical end, it nevertheless attempts to draw attention to an alternative style of philosophising which enjoins that philosophy ought to make itself subservient to the practicalities of life. This trend flourished mainly in ancient Greece, particularly in the enigma of Socrates, (the preeminent exemplum of the "art of living") until it was eclipsed by the now dominant tradition that emphasises theoretical knowledge, later to be revived by such figures as Montaigne, Nietzsche and Foucault, whose aesthicist stance Nehamas chooses as a point of departure. He evaluates, in the first book of his study, the figure of Socrates, as presented in the dialogues of Plato, and how he, in his philosophical endeavour, succeeded in fashioning a work of art out of himself or, in Nehamas's words, creating himself as a unique personality. Nehamas also explains how Montaigne, Nietzsche and Foucault, sought and, succeeded in realising, similar projects for themselves, absorbing Socrates's ironic silence about himself as well as reacting against it, in their bid for "self-creation" via the medium of their texts. It is by this aestheticist turn that Nehamas designates the "art of living", a uniquely particularlist and individualist praxis of philosophising, enabling a subordination of theoretical knowledge to actual experience. Knowledge, as Nehamas seems to imply, must be lived in order to be truly understood. The major shortcoming of the book, I felt, was the chapter on Montaigne, which was extremely tedious, though, on the whole, an outstanding and fulfilling treatise 
 I just finished this book and I LOVED it! I mean, not only did Deborah expertly explain the columns, the parties, the scenesters/publicists/writers/socialites etc, and everything about New York "celeb culture" - but she explained it in a way that will be easy enough for someone to understand who lives in the middle of no-where and has never been exposed to this stuff; while not dumbing it down to a point where it was at all boring to read, even for those of us completely immersed in that world.   Her characters were likable - lovable actually, I *heart* Kate! - the story was compelling, and the whole thing was just fun to read. I sat outside last night on the balcony of my little apartment over here in Hell's Kitchen with a blanket and my puppy dog on my lap, and the book in my right hand, and I had a serious case of the "just-one-more-page-and-I'll-go-in-and-go-to-sleeps" - I was up reading until almost 4am! And I am never up till 4am these days... That's because I myself - a former publicist like the ones mentioned alongside the columnists in this book - took a step back from the party scene, and I think that's the other reason this book hit so close to home for me. Because I too came to the city with stars in my eyes (didn't we all?), and true, the parties and the job perks WERE DEFINITELY fun for a hot second....but after being a publicist for 6 or 7 years, I just do not want to be out 5-7 nights a week at 2-3 events a night. It is pretty much a fact, as discussed in the book, that if you don't want to go out that frequently - which pretty much requires that you also want to drink and do drugs endlessly all the time as well - then this might not be the industry for you. I think that's what the book also touched on so brilliantly...that struggle between getting well known...well, 4% well-known...but then getting overwhelmed by the lifestyle....but being scared to get out of it, because what if you fall off the face of the planet? What if no one remembers your name?   I've gotta say, its a hard reality, and one that the book speaks to perfectly. You may be the little social butterfly, not a celeb but famous enough to party alongside them, even occasoinally gracing the pages of magazines and the gossip columns, but many of us in the biz will get progressively more tired of all that comes along with that glam-party lifestyle with each 6am walk home from some socialites house (that you just HAD to go to, because what if you missed an opportunity to invite some B-List celeb of model to your next event?). I like this book, because it shows the rises and falls in the industry - all the fun and exciting parts of being a gossip columnist, and also the part when some realize that drinking and partying their way around New York City to pander to the egos of rich and famous idiots is exhausting and soul-sucking.  It's definitely a tough biz, and if you're not out at night at the events to catch the gossip when it goes down, you might as well not go into work the next day. Also, the characters in the book deal with the confusing paradox of "working" both in their corporate office environment during the day, but also while out partying at night. An industry that expects you to look polished during the day, but often judges your biggest successes by how many times this month you shared a bottle of grey goose with Paris Hilton or a bag of blow with Tara Reid can be...well, in a word: Gross.   But it's all in the eye of the beholder...some say that it's us, the publicists and the gossip columnists that are the problem, and we should stop parading around celebrities for the public to gawk at like trotted-out show ponies. Maybe we'd stop trotting if the public stopped looking. But it really doesn't matter, because those topics all fall away when you read the book, and remember that behind every byline there is an actual PERSON who had to do a lot to get the story. Nothing is so black and white, except the ink on the newspaper blaring the next morning's headlines.  Overall, I just want to thank Deborah for writing such a tremendously honest, fun, charming, courageous, heartwarming, awesome book. It's a literary gem, fun, truthful, and a quick read, but will stay with you long after the last page has turned 
 Leo Lionni's tale of how letters can get together to make words and then move on to even bigger things is nicely told.  He reminds us all that  the process of learning to read and write is complex and multi layered. It can  lead to a wonderful things 
 David Sedaris is absolutely the funniest author alive. All of his books make me laugh out loud & embarrass myself in public places, when I bring his books along. This one did not disappoint either.. FUNNY holidays tales that make the season brighter, or even out of season.. give you a healthy & hearty laugh. I adore this man 
 I bought this book for a vo-tech type course I'm taking in electricity/building trades.  It runs right along with the NEC and explains how to do things right.  Not a particularly easy read, but worth the effort.  Best thing is to identify the parts you need to know and read those specific chapters.  For a do-it-yourself book, I'd probably select a book with more pictures and easier explanations.  I liked the Black & Decker series for that use 
 wal-mart is having a profound effect on our world. this book is intelligent and well written. it's easy to read and very compelling. hopefully it will have a very large audience. keep an open mind. the life you save may be your own 
 This book defines every problem every fiction writer has ever had and addresses remedies. Bob Mayer knows his stuff. This book is personable, easy to read, and ought to be on every writer's bookshelf 
 'Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr.' is a hair-raising documentary about a execution equipment expert and his clumsy survery of concentration camps in Poland that led to the demise of his career.  The first thirty minutes of the film discusses Leuchter's career as an expert in "humane" executions of prisoners.  It tells of his various viewpoints and his life history.  The story takes a sudden turn when the focus of the documentary shifts to Leuchter's discoveries at German concentration camps.  His conclusions are stunning; he claims the rooms used for gassing and killing concentration camp workers were not gas chambers at all!!  This is where the film becomes really awesome and hair-raising.  Here it discusses the trial that followed after the results and people reacting to Leuchter's odd behavior.  Errol Morris does his best to give an objective viewpoint on the whole affair.  He does not try to make Leuchter look like a devil or angel.  It is surprising that a seemingly innocent and simple man like Leuchter could be caught up in such a gigantic controversy.  Morris pretty much lets the viewer decide about this man.  Worth the watch if one can find it 
 After reading Tuesday's with Morrie, I was curious to see how different Morrie in His Own Words was from Mitch Albums Tuesday's.  After reading both, I preferred the lessons straight from the horses mouth. Morrie' 
 Josh did a great job in writing about, not only Biodiesel, but also other sources of energy besides finite fuels.  He does a great job of explaining how biodiesel is not the silver bullet to end our dependency on fossil fuels, but rather one of a number of other sources of energy (including ethanol, wind, solar, hydro-electric, hydrogen, etc).  He also does a good job of giving ideas that we all could easily reduce the amount of energy we consume that will not alter our current lifestyles.  I highly recommend this book to those just learning about Biodiesel & Ethanol, as well as those who understand it, but would like more information about it 
 As LACOMBE LUCIEN begins, you assume you'll like the main character. We find him at work in a nursing home. He decides to take a break from the tedious job of washing the floors, goes to the window to get a glimpse of the sunny day and enjoy the beauty of a small yellow songbird singing in a tree. We then see him reach in his pocket, take out a slingshot, and kill the bird. Later we'll see he does the same with rabbits and chickens. It's the Lucien of the beginning of the film and the one who we still see at the end.   LACOMBE LUCIEN, directed by Louis Malle, is a film that tells the story of Lucien, a troubled young man who appears to have few friends and is not welcome at home. We learn his father is in prison and his mother has taken up with someone else. Though we never learn about the father's absence, it's likely that it has something to do with the war which may be why Lucien seems to want to be a member of the French Resistance. He tries to join, but is rebuffed by a former teacher who believes he's too young and undisciplined. Lucien has an ambivalent reaction to the rebuff and we assume he'll just continue his employment at the nursing home. The action changes when patrons at a hotel capture Lucien's attention. His curiosity gets him in trouble but ends up being an opportunity. He then becomes involved with the police who are in line with the Gestapo.  Pierre Bliase is an excellent Lucien. He's consistent throughout and never gives us a chance to see the character as a lovable ruffian who would be different if is someone cared. Holger Lowenadler plays Albert Horn, a Jewish tailor and the father of Aurore Clement's France, the woman who becomes Lucien's love interest. The Horns accommodate Lucien, but it's unclear as to whether he realizes it is out of convenience and nothing more. Other characters in the film include members of the police who seem like typical turncoats, a middle aged maid who has a brief romantic entanglement with Lucien, and the villagers of Lucien's hometown. Like Malle's AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS, we get a feeling of occupied France toward the end of the war.    At the time of its release, the film was somewhat controversial. Only French resisters with noble character made it to the screen. Lucien is anything but noble. He's a misfit who never would have been accepted as a member of the police if it had not been 1944. Anyone with even a glimmer of intelligence knew the American would be liberating France in due time and had changed their loyalties but Lucien is unaware of any reality outside his own world. Malle had originally planned on setting the film in Mexico during a revolution but was unable to film in that country, so he decided that the setting could be France and the story set in the late days of the war. No one would ever guess from viewing the film of these changes which is a testament to the strength of Lucien's character and why the film can be so haunting today as we wonder what causes young people to become terrorists, join gangs, or take the wrong side in struggles that are ultimately against their best interest.     
 If you are interested in off-the-grid living or any form of alternative energy, Home Power magazine is a must read 
 I purchased this book a case at a time to be used in an anger recovery program I started at my church.  We were doing some lay/counseling when I realized that this area had a desperate need that wasn't being fulfilled.  What I did was used the chapters like a 12 stage program, using two chapters a night, and going through the material in small groups.  It worked really well.  I repeated the process as a 13 week program, and as a four week program.  I did find even though the material is quick and easy reading some of the participants in the program didn't read the material ahead of time like they were instructed.  I found I had to summarize the chapters in two to three page handouts, and take some of the self analysis tests and have them work those during the weekly group counseling.  That worked well.  I find if the material is read, then talked about together in a small group, say an existing bible study, it really helps.  Just using the book on your own may not be as helpful, but it is better then not doing anything.  The chapters help you to get to the root of the cause of your particular anger issues.  The self tests are a insightful tool.  Not all chapters fit everybody.  There are various reasons for anger/depression.  "Anger turned inward makes depression."  
 Riefenstahl was indeed a genius, a genius with the camera and film editing. One will never know whether or not she'd eventually have been a great director, as she was pretty well blackballed by post-war political influences, and had few resources during the war (the "Tiefland" movie, filmed during wartime, was strapped for money and never finished ... as far as I know.) "Das Blau Licht" was an interesting early try at film directing for her, and while that is certainly not a great movie, it does an exceptional job of creating mood via the camera and chiaroscuro effect. The camera angles and camera lens applications she chose were definitely leading-edge. She would also let the camera dwell on the human face and body, so that one could really appreciate the uniqueness of individuals and see how interesting they were (the people used as extras in the "Blau Licht" at its location near Trento, Italy, are particularly memorable). Leni's genius was in showing us the angle, the viewpoint, the shading, and letting us see what she saw. It was at times awesome.   No doubt film makers in the US paid attention to her work. What is really astounding is that she was a woman and pioneer in a man's trade, who created photographic techniques and treatments like none seen before. In the US, we had no female equivalent to even compare to her, and this makes an interesting statement about Third Reich society, which is far different from what we are lead to believe -- women had opportunities to engage in traditionally male professions, even test piloting (the US certainly had no one comparable to Hanna Reisch, either).   Movie viewers may have seen the 1936 sports documentary, "Olympia," that she filmed, composed and edited. It is regarded as THE best such documentary ever produced. Keeping that in mind, think of the Winter Olympic coverage we just witnessed ... "will Michelle Kwan make the team? Why did she miss practice? Will she skate?, etc." It all a bunch of tasteless, dramatic hokum, IMHO. We have jumped the tracks and gone over a cliff of degeneracy compared with the high standard set by Riefenstahl. I recommend viewing her film once again, for the sake of enjoyment and appreciation.   I read her book, "Memiors," in late 1993. It was the best autobiography of a woman that I've ever read ... by far. I wrote her a letter through her publisher, St. Martin's ,and the following July, received a very warm reply and an autographed picture. I quote an interesting extract from her letter:    Quote:  "Dear Mr. (Anon), your letter from December 13, I have received only few days ago ... but even in the time you were in Murnau (poster's note: I was in Germany for a couple of months and had hoped to meet her personally, her home was in Pocking), I was diving in Africa, Kenya and in the Seychelles, and not in Germany. Even now I fly to Papua, New Guinea for diving ..."      To clarify, she didn't receive my letter until months after my having sent it, because of her travels for the purpose of underwater photography. And, let's see, she was born in 1902, so she was about ninety-two years-old at the time (We are discussing an incredible person here). We corresponded for several years after that, the last time around her 100th birthday.   In the post war years it was quite common for the US media and particularly Hollywood, to extract excerpts from her films and give her no payment, no recognition. At the same time they were carrying on this artistic theft, they would never miss an opportunity to criticize Riefenstahl for the usual specious reasons. Although she was much too gracious to think in this manner, she, in the end, had the last laugh. She outlived all of her "Hollywood Harry" detractors and carried on to accomplish great and innovative things in photography (See her photo book, "Die Nuba," it is awesome.)   She died at age 101. And would have lived much longer, had she not been severely injured in a helicopter accident a few years earlier.   A toast to Leni

 For those of you who are not big fans of serial killers and the people who catch them (or at least won't admit it publicly), Bob Ressler is the guy who invented the term "Serial Killer" and helped usher in a new understanding of repeat criminals and why they do what they do.  The citizens of the U.S. owe a lot to Bob.  So does Thomas Harris, who interviewed him extensively for Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs.  Alas, truth is stranger than fiction, and the tales Ressler tells are positively awful.  There' just one problem: we've heard all of this before.    Where?  That'd be "Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit," by John E. Douglas, a man I can only assume was Ressler's protg.   It's a bit murky as to their relationship (the two reference each other, but not often).  The parallels are unmistakable-it's interesting to read the opinions of two different people interviewing the same serial killer.    For example, Douglas has a bit of a creepy admiration for Ed Kemper.  Kemper had a diabolical mind that he put to good use, such that eventually he figured out why he was killing women: because he hated his mother.  So Kemper did what every good serial killer would do in such a situation...he killed her too.  His murders "finished," Kemper called the police and gave himself up.  That little story is from Douglas' point of view.  It almost makes Kemper out to be a sympathetic figure.  A six-foot tall, 300 pound sympathetic figure, but sympathetic nonetheless.    Ressler is not so kind.  Ressler interviews Kemper alone at one point.  Having finished the interview, Ressler rings for the guard...but nobody comes.  Sensing his discomfort, Kemper explains how he could probably screw Ressler's head off with his bare hands and nobody would be able to do anything about it.  Kemper goes on to explain how he has nothing to lose and how, by killing an FBI agent, he'd get quite a bit of "prison cred."  Fortunately, Ressler keeps a cool head (and keeps his head) by playing the little mind game right back at the massive serial killer until the guards escort him out.   "You know I was only kidding, right?" says Kemper, putting a hand on Ressler's shoulder.  Whoever Fights Monsters is a lot like that.  It simultaneously takes on tough subjects, summarizes them from a clinical perspective, and then reminds you-sometimes quite sternly-that these people are murderers.  Where Douglas tends to talk about himself and the heavy toll that dealing with serial killers took on his own personal psyche, Ressler is much more detached and observant.  Douglas advocates the death penalty, Ressler does not.  Douglas embraces the glory and publicity of being a trailblazer in his field, Ressler worries about the depersonalization of the victims and the celebrity-status of the killers themselves.  Who's right?  There are no right answers here.  Of the two books, Douglas' is more entertaining because he chooses to be more dramatic. The two books track each other very closely, such that if you've read one, you probably don't need to read the other one.   Unlike Douglas' book, Ressler admits when he makes mistakes.  He also goes into more detail as to the method and process of profiling, which is why I originally bought both books. But it's simply not as exciting a read.  Nevertheless, Ressler's tale is an important one: serial killers are mistakes.  They're the results of terrible human failings and something to be ashamed off, not celebrated.  In that respect, Ressler's story is a more socially responsible (if not as thrilling) examination of the worst humanity has to offer

 Unfortunatly I arrived at Virginia Commonwealth University's graphic design program after Phil Meggs had passed away. His legacy still lives on. Rob Carter on the other hand has been my professor. He is a great man who pushes his students into experimenting and becoming comfortable with their own styles of design. He is by no means a "stuffy" guy. I have some of their books and I don't have one problem with them at all.   By the way, this book is a good one 
 The author's learning, decency, and humanity are obvious, and the story she tells is fascinating (and horrible). (One also should mention her courage.)  Sadly, the translation appears to be the work of someone whose grasp of English idiom is flawed in the extreme. The reader is constantly having to translate the text into English from "English." It's like trying to bicycle on a mountain road covered with big cobbles and the occasional pile of boulders 
 I agree, to a point, with the reviewers who didn't find this book to have all the answers, BUT like another reviewer pointed out, this should be just one of the books in your library. I have suffered from candida for more than 20 years. If the reviewer who claimed that candida was invented by the author had suffered from it, then (s)he would know that it is very real and can be, for some people, debilitating. I suggest you check this book out of the library before you buy it. If you are well versed in this disease, then you might not want to buy it... but if you are just starting your research, you'll find a lot of answers in here 
 My daughter just *loves* these books. At first, I didn't buy in to the whole 'Baby Einstein' product line, but she started with the Babies book and has loved everything since. She is more excited and interactive with this book than most,and she's just one month shy of age two 
 It was already some time I wished to read this essay, both out of interest for the argument and because of the fame of Lowenstein as a very conscientious journalist.  I must confess I have been totally satisfied with this work and, while warmly recommending to other readers, I look forward to read some of his other books (specially the one about LTCM collapse).   The essay is compact (just 227 pages), easily readable and extremely interesting, since the author has obviously a huge in depth knowledge of the argument and his style is extremely balanced and pleasant.   Lowenstein shows a very impartial approach: there's no rhetoric, no overtones, no moralistic attitude (like usual themes of pride punished) but produces many hard data and clever evaluation arranged carefully to build a very powerful case.   Because of this approach, the book is probably the best account of the 1990s bubble I have had the chance to read.   "The Origins of the Crash" is specially a report of how the financial bubble formed and grew, to ultimately bust  at the beginning of the year 2000 in the way everyone knows.   Lowenstein traces the origins of the troubles to come in a cultural shift that occurred in the late `80s:  - the impact of LBO creating pressure on CEOs, coupled with new theories as "shareholder value" and EVA; - a shift from cash bonuses to stock options (and often  not only so) for CEOs and attitudes focused on hard competition, "creative destruction" (stressing more on change than stability) and easy profit, more than self-sustaining quality and long term growth; - governmental deregulation (specially the repeal of  Glass-Steagall Act, benign neglect on possible conflicts of interest and  globalization of financial markets); - the coming of age of the new free market economics and their easy faith in the self-correcting capacity of markets (but I would add as well theories of risk management, that gave the false belief to be able to overcome and manage financial stresses, and the distortions on stock market prices caused by the use and abuse of derivatives).    Given the frame, disaster comes to be almost inevitable:  - shareholder value is narrowly interpreted and implemented as the effort to inflate stock prices (the best - and safest - manager is not the one with best result but the one with the best track record of stock prices)  - shareholder value, with its emphasis on prices, causes a shift form long term to short term in a hectic chase for steady  and consistent business results;  - deregulation opens the way to conflicting interests: in corporate governance (internal audit, CEOs, President), outside the company in the balance of mutual checks (external auditing companies offering as well professional consulting to the same customer and pretending, while so doing, to remain "objective"), repeal of Glass Steagall and dismissal of "Chinese walls" between commercial banking and financial analysis).   To this explosive mix you just have to add a long bull market: drunken by the returns of the stock market over a 10 years span, no investor, few financial analyst and even fewer government officials complained about the many warnings of problems to come.  In every financial bubble there is an economic side of the story, as well a psychological profile.  The psychological side tells the usual story of all the former financial bubbles: easy faith, unwarranted optimism,  invention of new paradigms ("the new economy") and of new evaluative methods to account the unaccountable. But this part is the least developed by Lowenstein, since his main interest is in exposing the fundamental problems in corporate governance, and not in describing passing (or recurring) fashions.  So if you search for a story about rocketing of stock market prices, followed by their rapid sinking, I fear you'll be disappointed: this book is not involved in security analysis proper or in the evaluation of the markets, and neither tries to give advice on how, where and when you should invest  your money.  If you've been so patient and kind to follow me so far, there can be a chance you share some interest in the argument. If so, I think that these titles I had the chance to read in the past, could be of some significance to you as well: - J.K.Galbraith - "The Great Crash 1929".. The official story of the great bubble of the 1920s  -  M.Dash - "Tulipomania". A lively story of the first recorded western financial bubble: tulips in XVII century Holland.  - E,Chancellor - "The Devil Takes the Hindmost" - a colorful and well-informed essay focusing specially on the XIX century.  - Ch.P.Kindleberger - "Manias, Panics and Crashes". Very interesting, but beware the title: it is a very specific essay on management of financial crises.  - Robert Shiller - "Irrational Exuberance". Possibly one of the most interesting books published in the last years: while I don't like too much behavioral finance, yet the first 50 pages are well worth many times the book price.  - J.A Paulos - "A Mathematician plays the stock market". Avoid this book! Too cheap and sometimes silly. Not worth the money. - Burton J. Malkiel - "A Random Walk down Wall Street". Usually the first chapters of this evergreen are dedicated to financial manias.   You are most welcome if  you can suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!  Thanks for reading 
 This is one of my favorite novels of all time. It is absolutely flawless - a deranged, bizarre trip into the heart of the desert and the mind's of the characters who populate that arid climate and their own internal, personal, emotionally devastating landscapes. Joy Williams creates a world of heartlessness, beauty, insincerity, twisted motivations, utterly believable and flawed characters, and the most quotable dialogue I've found in any book. This novel was up for the Pulitzer Prize in 2001 but Michael Chabon's "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" took home the prize. Joy should have won, no question, but if she had to lose to someone I suppose I'm glad it was Mr. Chabon. Anyway, back to Joy - not only does she create a world of dazzling brilliance, she quite effectively mocks our modern culture and comes up with characters that are utterly distinct and memorable and also human - I dare anyone to read this novel and not find at least two characters they can strongly relate to and could mistake for themselves. Joy Williams, simply, is one of the best writers around, and this is one of the best things I've ever read. It's absolutely teeming with originality, genius ideas, and wonderful execution. I wish I'd written it. It's a novel that you don't so much read as experience, it's something that pulls you in with it's hooks and releases you, at the final page utterly changed. It will stick with you. I loaned out my hardback copy almost two years ago to my cousin, who is an English teacher, she's read it several times now and has yet to return it. I had to go out and buy another copy, just because I couldn't handle being without it for so long. When I first discovered this book, I carried it with me nearly everywhere I went, just wanting to keep the characters and the pages close within my reach - it's hard being away from this book, it's become a part of me, almost as vital and important as an organ. This book has a heart of it's own, and you can feel it beating below the surface, you can taste the blood and muscles and sweat when you read. It's simply impossible to describe the passion and art that are contained within these pages. I think everyone could benefit from reading this. It is the great American novel - it touches and comments upon nearly everything in our society that one can think of, it points out what is wrong, it so perfectly describes people and their personalities and actions and it even has elements of the supernatural. Yet for all of Joy William's sarcasm and harsh wit, she loves her characters and does not judge them. Ultimately, we may not be left with answers to every question, but we are left with hope, as delicious as honey from a thorn 
 I do have to say that this CD is definitly lacking the UMPH that "Tranceport 2" had.  But then again, you have to think about this for a while.  Davey Boy just decided to change his style a little bit.  If you like the "Deep Trance" or the "Dark Trance", then this is definitly the CD for you 
 I love James Patterson and am thrilled that he wrote this book for the younger generation. I bought this book for my [...] year old son and he couldn't put it down. He loved it, and it was all he talked about. Now he's reading Schools Out Forever and is glued to that one too! I hope there will more books like these to follow! I am planning to read it myswelf when I finish reading the James Patterson book I am currently reading 
 I was so disappointed on receipt of the Oklahoma DVD that it would not work outside of the USA. I am sure it is well the cost 
 From the first page of this book, I knew I would not be able to put it down.  Cassie is a young college graduate with the world on a string, a yen for screenwriting-and a staggering pile of student loans weighing her down. In lieu of the lucrative snooze-fest of a reliable consulting job, she shocks everyone she knows by opting for a sexier, more flexible job: mixing drinks.  When she accepts a summer gig bartending in the Hamptons, Cassie finds herself catapulted into a whirlwind of dazzling celebrity and over-the-top wealth unlike anything she's ever seen. Surrounded by playboys, moguls, spoiled kids, and Paris Hilton clones she soon wonders if it's more than she bargained for.  It's a fun, weekend read that is very hard to put down 
  1. Brockmeier conceptualizes a poetic afterlife, in which the dead exist in a   peaceful state of limbo, much as they did in life, until the last person who remembers them also dies.  2. In spite of the poetry of the concept, daily life in the afterlife drudges on much as it did before death - coffeeshops and newspapers, real estate, subways, homeless people asking for change.   3. This all makes me wonder if Brockmeier plays Second Life.  4. Brockmeier's book pictures a bleak but realistic future in which Coca Cola still exists but South Africa doesn't, in which biological warfare is a part of everyday life.  5. We only know this because of one character, trapped on a failed expedition in Antarctica, recalling moments of her life as she struggles to survive.  6. Although Brockmeier's novel brings up some meaningful questions - about memory, death, the afterlife - that are woven together quite compactly, it lacks an aura of beauty that these questions deserve.  7. I think this is because he tries very hard to portray these things as everyday life. The novel is peppered with brands, future colloquialisms, things-taken-for-granted - all of which illustrate the subtle banality of how we (don't) reflect upon our contexts in our memories.   8. The determination of the main character, Laura Byrd, to survive alone in the Antarctic is fairly inspiring.  9. The descriptions of the Antarctic - the ice, the cold, the penguins, the sun or the lack of it - are also beautiful and infused with awe and horror. It contrasts nicely with the banality of death, a notion that we usually treat with far more awe and horror than life.  10. All in all, this book is worth reading and worth a few days of mulling.  
 I read this book awhle back and found it to be an eye-opener.  I am a descendant of John Howland through his daughter Desire.  I was especially saddened how quickly one generation later the natives exterminated.  I bet their fathers were rolling over in their graves to see their hard work to establish peace with the natives went to naught. I used this book as a reference for genealogy.  I will definitely buy more of his books 
 "Official" is a word used to denote, in the case of price guides, an authoritative source of information, one that can be trusted above all others. In the case of David Ellis' Guide to Classic Video Games, it is exactly that. I have been collecting and playing video games, both console and arcade, since the late 1970's. Other price guides I have encountered have focused on specific areas of interest within the video game field, but none have covered consoles AND arcades AND handhelds as thoroughly as this book. Mr Ellis gives sound advice on how to get started in a hobby that has only recently moved into the mainstream. There are source lists to aid in searching for that rare find or for gathering even more information. The price guides themselves show a range of prices on each item as well as rarity and variations where applicable. There are plenty of color and black & white photos, and the history of how video gaming got started is an interesting and pleasant addition. It is clear in his writing that Mr Ellis endeavors to share his knowledge and passion for the hobby. I found the book to be accurate and helpful in my collecting, and I recommend it to both novice and experienced classic video game enthusiasts 
 The first time I began reading Little, Big I got about half way through before I lost track of the slowly twisting narrative and lost interest. Then, some years later, I started reading it again, and, somehow, the characters and plot presented themselves to me in altered perspective, as if they'd subtly shifted position within the pages since the last time I'd picked up the book. My second read-through was revelatory. Now, each year when Autumn advances and the light starts turning the watery yellow that heralds the shift into a New York winter, I pick this book up and read it cover to cover. I like to read it beneath a duvet in the late afternoon during October or have my wife read it to me while I'm in the bathtub in the early evening in November. Somehow it makes me feel incredibly melancholic in the most delightful way. For the other 51 weeks of the year I alternate between cold pragmatism, emotional and psychological discomfort, and genuine cheeriness, but while reading Little, Big I find myself thinking that life is bittersweet in all sorts of difficult-to-articulate ways, and during the week or so I'm reading it, I wander around my apartment indulging myself in prolonged, maudlin sighs. When asked "what's wrong?" I merely shake my head, then act as if making an effort to speak, then just shake my head again as if overcome. Does life get any more sweet? Does it get any more bitter? Certainly not in my limited sphere of experience. In my memory house, Little, Big occupies an entire annex 
 I have owned this book since around 1980.  No it should not be your first Chinese cookbook - too too much.  I started with Joyce Chen which has maybe 100 recipes and assumes nothing.  However when you get comfortable with the basics - and want that special recipe it is in here.  Also if you have some ingredients and want some inspiration this tells how to cook almost anything Chinese 
 Order arrived promptly, the book was in great condition like the seller said.  Would purchase again from this selle 
 My husband read this book, and recommended that I read it as I mostly confidently, though sometimes stressfully, waded through the challenges of opening my own small business.  Within the first few short chapters, Mr. Easwaran gives you a tip for remaining calm and focused, that is as easy as repeating the same few words silently to yourself.  Like most of you, I have my family, friends, church, and colleagues for support, but many times, I just want to "take care of myself," get past the hurdle immediately before me, and move on.  Using one of the mantra's suggested in this book has helped calm my mind.  With a calm mind, I'm able to get in touch with what is really important to me, and make sound, positive decisions.  The author then goes on to suggest some additional concepts which I found to be very thought provoking, including, reminding me of the part I can play in life by offering my services to society. 
 outlets are on top of case.  easy to plug in and change plug ins.  narrow case width allows backup unit to fit in the space available in my roll around computer cart.  Switch is recessed and on front with lightup controls.  No bumping switch and shuting off accidentally. 
 It's pretty good, except for one little thing:  WHY THE FU(K IS MACY GRAY AND BOOMKAT ON HERE 
 It's surprising to note that professor Carole Collier Frick's DRESSING RENAISSANCE FLORENCE: FAMILIES, FORTUNES AND FINE CLOTHING is the first in-depth study of the Renaissance fashion industry. Here are insights into the social and political meaning of clothing in Florence, with black and white photos throughout displaying changing styles and fashion innovations, visual impressions and how family fortunes were invested in wardrobes. A fascinating college-level study, recommended for any collection strong in fashion or Renaissance history.  Diane C. Donovan California Bookwatc 
 As always I'm pleased with the cd and the service I got 
 This is one of my favorite books.  It's a thought-provoking and lyrical portrayal of working class issues in America.  Di Donato's prose style is wonderful.  This book should be much more widely read than it is 
 I read Charlie & The Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl for my grade 5 LA class.  I really enjoyed this book.  Charlie is main character in this story.  He comes from an extremely poor family, his 4 grandparents live with his parents and Charlie.  The story centers around a Chocolate Factory that is giving out 5 golden tickets, which provide the lucky winners with a lifetime supply of chocolate and a tour of the factory.  The tour has no end of unexpected surprises.  The funniest character was Veruca Salt because she was going to steal a squirrel. The squirrels tackled her and then knocked her on the head (to see if she was a good or bad nut).  They decided she was a bad nut and then threw her down the garbage chute! This book is very hard to put down! There is also a movie available called Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory 
 I got this book for a present about six months ago and can't stop picking it up.  I heard this author on the radio recently and she was just as engaging and informative talking about burgers as she was about wine-and all the info she discussed is in this book, so I figure it's a darn good deal.    I've been cooking for a long time, but keep finding great info in The Food Lover's Tiptionary-whether for everyday cooking techniques (such as for subjects like corn, eggs, potatoes, tomatoes, etc.) or for tips for special event preparations (like how to handle caviar, or different ways to prepare risotto).  There's even info on kitchenware and appliances-from knives to food processors.  Love the "tidbits" at the beginning of almost every listing-little informational "bites" (history, etymology, etc.) that add so much to the subject.  In short, LOVE this handy, easy-to-read, exceedingly informative book! 
 I have, in the past two months, lost two precious 14-year old cats, who were with me from their births to their passing, and this book has comforted me in coming to terms with their loss. I treasure the memory of their lives, and I can let them go with love, knowing it is only "farewell for a while," not "good-bye forever." I am grateful to the author for the love and kindness she gives to animals and for the service she has done for those of us who will have the joy of reading this wonderful, lovingly written book by one of God's Angels on Earth 
 Kate Bush is a mythical, almost Goddess-like figure to her fans. She would no doubt blush at such an accolade, but she is truly deserving of the praise she receives. I now own all her studio albums, and "The Sensual World," has always been somewhat of a difficult one for me. I bought "Hounds Of Love" for Christmas last year, and it blew me away. I bought The Sensual World a week later, and was left disappointed. Where were the melodies? The soaring voice? The eye-popping sonics? All that I had come to love about Hounds was sorely absent. And so I kind of went 'off' Kate Bush for a few months. Until August this year when I bought four of her albums for a total of 20 in a record store. These were "The Kick Inside," "Never For Ever," "The Dreaming" and "The Red Shoes." I was in love with Bush all over again.  My faith restored, I gave The Sensual World a few more spins and found myself loving a few songs, but not all. This is still partially the case, yet the ones I'm not too fond off are growing on me. The album is definitely Kate's most mature and most sensual, believe it or not. The music is deep and lush, atmospheric and aural. Kate Bush took four years to make this album when it was released in 1989, where it charted at No.2 in the UK and No.43 in the US. It also became Kate's biggest-selling album in America to date, receiving a Gold award for sales of over 500,000.  The album opens with the title track, "The Sensual World." This song is one of Kate's most sensual, as the title suggest, with a hint of eroticism. Kate's voice is gentle and whispering, almost like a tickle on the ears. It opens with the sound of church bells, and features some very evocative Irish pipes that weave in and out of the drum beat. The video is also incredible as Kate dances around a forest. "Love And Anger" is a more upbeat song and pretty traditional in terms of comparisons to other pop songs. I love the vocals on this song, and the chorus is very powerful. It charges along powered by Kate's soaring voice as she sings about unrequited love, and how to reconcile her past with her future. "The Fog" is one of my favourite songs on the album. It's incredibly strong and very evocative. A man, credited only as Dr. Bush, speaks "Just put your feet down, child...Cause you're all grown-up now," as a celtic harp and whistles dance around. The violin used some 90 seconds into the song is incredibly atmospheric and vividly paints an image in my mind of fog drawing closer and tighter in the dead of the night, like a curtain closing.  "Reaching Out" is a soft and very fragile song. Kate's voice is thin and gentle, almost like it could shatter. The lyrics are very sensual but on a more emotional level as she sings about a child reaching out for what he cannot have. Distant wailing vocals come in after 43 seconds to add a melody to the song. Kate's voice then becomes a powerhouse in the chorus as she sings like an opera singer alongside a sweet violin solo. "Head We're Dancing" is probably the most sonically adventurous song on the whole album. It's also got the most interesting story, as Kate sings about a man who seduces her into dancing with him. It's set in 1939, and Kate soon realises that it's Hitler she's dancing with. Who is Kate though? Which figure does she represent? It could be Eva Braun, or perhaps the entire German nation. Everything is quite ambiguous, and while this song isn't as strong as "Houdini," Kate's other great song about an important historical figure sung from a female love interest perspective, it still packs quite a punch. "Deeper Understanding" is a good song about a lonely person who spends their nights with their computer, seeking solace through their sadness and longing for love. It's a very beautiful song but is quite dated since not many people even owned a computer in their homes back in 1989!  "Between A Man And A Woman" is a song about a third party trying to intervene in a relationship between a man and a woman. We suspect that Kate is the woman in this relationship, and that she's telling this third party to stay out. It could be anyone; a friend, an enemy, either male or female, a former love interest of either the man or the woman. Very interesting, and interesting because of its ambiguity. The sound of the song is also very strong, powerful and driving with a sharp bite. "Never Be Mine" is a very poignant song about the end of a relationship and the demise of love within that relationship. Kate sings so beautifully, "They're setting fire to the cornfields as you're taking me home." The song is rich in vivid imagery, and always seems to remind me of autumn. Infact the whole album does - the ripeness of berries and red/gold coloured leaves falling from trees, and of what is to come: the harsh winter where death is imminent, yet beauty can also flourish. The Uillean pipes are also used incredibly well and to great effect.  "Rocket's Tail" is a very unusual song that traces the journey of a rocket raging through the night sky. The stage is set: it's Bonfire night, November 5th, and Kate (along with the Trio Bulgarka) sings about strapping a rocket to her back and taking off into the night sky. The vocals swoop and loop in perfect harmony to emulate the ascent of a rocket with stunning guitar work by Dave Gilmour or Pink Floyd. "This Woman's Work" is probably my favourite song on the entire album. A bittersweet song about childbirth, this song talks about the division between men and women. Partially about the joys of motherhood, Kate also sees the experience as explaining the difficulties of relationships - motherhood is proof of the differences in male and female experiences that so often threaten to divide and frustrate love. Kate's voice is fragile and tender in the first minute and builds to a tear-jerking climax. The album closes with "Walk Straight Down The Middle." The song speaks about indecisiveness and uncertainty in relationships - it also concludes that uncertainty is the only certain thing about a relationship, and that the pain and pleasure deliver in equal amounts, yet both are never permanent. A great ending to a very sensual album!  OVERALL GRADE: 9/10  If you'd have asked me a week ago where this album would rank in terms of Kate's best albums, I'd put it about sixth out of all seven of her studio albums. Now I'd probably put it fourth after Hounds Of Love, The Dreaming and Never For Ever. This album has taken ten months to win me over, but now it finally has and I feel privileged to like it as much as I do. Kate Bush's new album "Aerial" is released in just over a week, and it promises to be something incredibly special. I have been waiting for it for more than two months since it was announced that Kate was making a comeback. As the days get closer, it's important for me to listen to as mch Kate as I possibly can to soak up all her genius! The Sensual World may not be her best album, but it's still a brilliant and sensual album all the same 
 It's been six long years since Frederik L Schodt updated his seminal 1983 study, Manga! Manga! World of Japanese Comics. Since then manga's unstoppable rampage across the West has become inescapable. So it's appropriate that someone took stock of this comic 'sub-genre' and updated and re-examined what has become the world's most prevalent comic art form. Paul Gravett manages not only to cover the history of manga, but in doing so explores the social and cultural evolution of Japan from its post-war reinvention to its modem-day literary imperialism. Gravett's book excels not only in discussing such, but also by displaying hundreds of examples of artwork in glorious detail. Everything is here from the crassly commercial Dragon Ball Z and Yu-Gi-Oh! to the grotesque Grand Guignol artwork of Hideshi Hino. It even made this jaded cynic get excited about Nipponese comics once more. No mean feat. Authoritatively written and exquisitely designed, this book demands space on your shelf.  
 Excellent cinematography, superb acting, and a story that is engrossing, believable, and touching. Incredibly moving- I laughed and cried... bittersweet and honest. A must-see. One of my all-time favorites 
 Eragons journey continues in this 2nd book from Christopher Paolini. Although a great deal of time is spent in the politics of the different races the storyline progresses fairly well. I have been reading this series to my boys and with the exception of having to explain quite a bit of the vocabulary, they have been enraptured by the story. We can't wait for book number three 
 I LOVED this book. It was better than the first two. Could hardly put it down. Carl gets more and more clever with each new story. Plus I love dogs, so Monte was a great addition to the story. I highly recommend this mystery series if you're looking for something to do on a rainy afternoon. If you're looking for books with a lot of depth and substance, this mystery series isn't for you. However, if you enjoy reading and chocolate, pick this up along with a big box of See's candies. I especially like all the chocolate trivia. I learned something about my favorite food group. Bon appetite! 
 just what i needed during my own job search...just moved to LA and am trying to find a job here, and this book had me cracking up the whole way! LOVED it!! recommmend it 100 
 Yeah...I have heard the joints and they tight.  I'm feelin it fa sho!  I went to school with "D" the lighter one and she has not lost a step.  She was tight then and is still bangin.  Keep hittin 'em Mami.  Later 
 I was very happy with this book.  I had only made bread once before and it was unedible.  It's only draw back is that you have to read it from the beginning.  She gives hints and tricks here and there in her introduction that aren't always given again in the later recipes.  I like to jump around a bit.  But I've now made a soymilk bread, a buttermilk bread and a fabulous cornbread. Yum! 
 Tai Chi Secrets Of The Wu Style is a selection of carefully translated wisdom concerning secrets of the ancient Tai Chi martial art of self defense, personal fitness, and balance. Passages are shown in their original Chinese characters, then rendered into English with a careful and detailed explanation of the nuances of their meaning. Highly recommended for Tai Chi devotees who seek a greater understanding of this martial art, Tai Chi Secrets Of The Wu Style is a welcome and invaluable addition to any personal martial arts reading list or reference collection 
 This is a thoughtful and comprehensive piece of work by an industry insider whose practical experience of the topic is clear. I found this helpful both for myself as head of operational risk in a financial institution, as have some of the other staff in my department 
 CMDT is "The Book" for medical doctors, including residents. It is a perfect combination of practical information and theorethical details. It contains "exactly" what you need to know. Unlike big textbooks, it doesn't have all the mumbo jumbo that you will not need for patient care. It is full of practical information about patient management, including medications. their side effects and their prices. It gets updated every year with latest evidence based data and you can be sure that you are practicing based on the latest advances in medicine. For me as a resident, this is the main source. I barely have time to read Harrison's, and even if I do, at the end I will be left with lots of unsolved practical problems. This book is excellent in every aspect. If you read it once, you can rest assure that you know what you are doing. The sections related to other specialities are also perfect for a primary care doctor. I am pretty sure that I will be reading this book for years to come. If I could, I would give 10 stars 
 Although the real roots lie with the black artists who inspired these guys, the PBBB is where the hippy generation,(this is a couple years pre-San Francisco, and before the Stones and Beatles began stretching their arrangements out on record),learned to JUST PLAY. Their next record was more representative of what they were actually doing live at time time, and is the single greatest influence on what became the San Francisco sound of the late 60's and early 70's, (REALLY long and experimental jamming), so this is in fact the "roots of the roots of the roots" of todays jam bands and guitar-heavy blues bands, mixed-race bands, and, for all practical purposes, the white-blues-man in todays' world 
 For all people professing to "know" the New Testament - Get It 
 What a wonderful collection of Johnny Mercer's music.  Many of my favorite songs, Autumn Leaves, Skylark, Days of Wine and Roses, Laura as well as being sung by fabulous singers such as Rosemary Clooney, Tony Bennett, Diana Krall, Kevin Spacey.  This music is truly " Too Marvelous For Words 
 This book is both exhaustive and exhausting to read as a lay person.  If you are an ardent fan of more poetic Christian Living writing as offered by many of our current prolific evangelical writers, this book is not for you.  If however you are looking for innovative, effective, and even orthodox ways to engage members of these spiritual movements that are moving from the fringe to the mainstream of western culture, then buy this book!  This book casts some new light on techniques and approaches to evangelism to new religious movements.  The ministry examples are insightful and present fresh ideas on contextualizing the gospel to many of the subcultures that have traditionally been bumbled by the Western Church.   Our efforts must go beyond the handing out of tracts, confrontational discussions of apologetics, and holding demonstrations.  Encountering New Religious Movements provides an in-depth history of apologetics and missions to new religious movements as well as chronicling the successes and failures their-in.  Though the book is written by several authors, there is a continuous attention brought to solid doctrine and sound missional philosophy in outreach.  The authors are each leaders in their respective areas and provide strong biblical foundations and historical data outlining the inception of the movement they represent and the methodology they recommend.    Too many of our seminary graduates are not equipped with the knowledge of how to engage our various subcultures with the Gospel.  Many of our seminaries continue to turn out pastors equipped only to perpetuate an ineffective Christendom approach to church and outreach.  If our goal is to get out of the church and to impact our culture, then we must have leadership that is prepared.  This book should be high on the list of required reading in our seminaries and our various church boards, sessions, and leadership teams.    If you live somewhere that you do not believe these subcultures are present, then either you do not live in the Western World or you are simply mistaken.    
 This case works well.  The only thing I have against it is the belt clip.  I don't like the way it attaches to the case and replacements are expensive.  It is removable and I have removed mine.  I have the [...] (which I highly recommend) skin on my iPod and this case still fits over it great.  The belt clip has a embossed "Do Not Remove" made in the silicon that ended up pressing into the bestskinsever cover thus marking it up.  It has not attracted lint like some have said in the past.  I think the latest version is treated with something to prevent this.  I considered many cases and it came down to the EVO3 and the iFrogz

 The book was in great condition for very low price paid. Thank 
 Great book. Real page turner. Keeps you hooked. One of Margaret Maron's best 
 Paul Sann's effort in bringing back a violent period in America's history is successful in his account of the life of Arthur Fregenheimer, better known to intimates as "Dutch" Schultz, The Beer Baron of the Bronx.  A detailed account of The Dutchman's demise is given and those involved in The Palace Bar and Chop House in Newark, New Jersey, in October of 1935.  Three of Schultz's cronies in addition to The Dutchman were dispatched in a gunfight in which Charlie Workman shot Schultz in the mens' room.  The book is filled with infamous names from the prohibition days in New York's underworld.  Author Paul Sann has written other books regarding the post World War I era, and this book on Dutch Schultz illustrates the stressfulness of just staying alive for gangsters during this time period 
 The need of the hour is 'Positive Parenting' and this is exactly what John Gray, the author gives a message in this book. Not only the western new age free world is facing parental problems but Indian culture is also on a shift notion to face challenges tackling parental challenges. The five messages and the wise advice of the author makes it very clear to follow by parents to get the parenting skills. Love base parenting accepts kids with their negative emotions, desires and needs, being different but setting reasonable limits and making the kids aware that they are to be respected is the message flow in the book. Children are innocent and born with a difference and needs rewarding and not punishment. They need to co-operate and both parents and kids need to build a close bond to pull out of parental stress, kids stress and the crisis hovering over parental and kids issues. A good pick by a gem author.  
 We own three Baby Faith DVD's.  Our favorite is "God Made Music", followed by "God Made Me".  "God Made Animals", while still a good video, is our least favorite.  For one, the animal puppets ranged somewhere between uninspiring and downright disturbing (but judge for yourself, I've posted some pictures).  The frog was creepy - since when do frogs have lips?  The visuals accompanying the musical sequences seemed to be less imaginative and stimulating than the other videos too.  And the undersea clips at the end looked as old as Cousteau and were thoroughly uninteresting to my one year-old son, who is entranced by the other two videos but doesn't seem to care much for this one.  My suggestion...watch before you buy, if you can.  If your kid likes it, go for it.  If not, try the other videos.  You may get a different reaction 
 12 year-old David is a thinking boy who loves to shoot hoops with his friend. One day he strikes up a conversation with an ancient, strange gentleman who seems to know exactly what David is thinking, especially about his dreams. It is what Old Moses has to tell that steers David toward a better understanding of his family & his life.  Rebeccasreads highly recommends THE DREAM BEARER as a fascinating boys' read -- both magical & down-to-earth, scary & heartwarming, despairing & hopeful; about abusive fathers, changing older brothers, life in Harlem & in your dreams.  
 I liked the book.  The text presented is appropriate for us, even at the undergraduate level.  We are able to understand the examples and theories behind advanced calculus and it has helped us in understanding calculus  better 
 Gitomer's excellent conversational writing style, wit, and depth of knowledge on the subject matter are engaging!  This man has sales nailed... period!  This quick read is a must for anyone who sells anything... and don't we all sell something 
 The Adventures of Homer Price in the quaint town of Centerburg are flat out hilarious.  Homer's uncle Hercules quickly sets the tone of disbelief by spinning some yarns that have just enough "truth" to them to be plausible.  This is a truly a story of the American Scene in a time when people entertained themselves by gabbing with one another and singing songs together instead of hiding in the basement watching videos.  Good old timey values like hucksterism, lying, and cheating face the good natured community of Centerburg and sometimes turn it upside down.  Strange things happen in Centerburg, and the curious Homer Price is going to get to the bottom of it.  Robert McClosky is also one of our finest illustrators and his lively drawings add texture and background to the story.  Highly Recommeded 
 The auther seems to be very familier with Japanese food.  I greatly appreciate for it.  Because of her knowledge, I was saved by this book a lot.  I didn't have to guess.  One of the improvement I'd like to ask is more entries in the index listings.  Often I found no entry in the index when I wanted to look in later.  I had to have an extended time to locate what I was looking for 
 This book is full of suspense, intriguing secrets and a wonderful cast of characters. There are no 'cookie cutter' characters here.   The story moves along at a perfect pace, and the end of the book is both shocking and satisfying. This book and its characters will stay with you long after you've put the book down. It's no surprise that this novel was awarded the Arthur Ellis Award for Best Crime Novel 
 What a great read! Thank you, Ann.  Can't wait to read your next book 
 This book will touch your spirit as well as provide information on how we can responsibly help others while helping ourselves.  Finished it in 2 sessions.  Highly recommend for those who utilize 'giving' as part of their personal spirituality.  Give it as a gift and share it's transformative powers 
 This book is a great book, not only on the subject of algorithms, but also on how to implement them in Perl.  A huge number of topics are covered, from Data Structures, to Searching/sorting, to cryptography, and much more.  And what I found to be among the most useful additions was that for every subject, they give you a full implementation on the subject.  I've read a few books on algorithms, but this is one of the most easy to read, and definitely one of the most practically useful.  Recommended for any Perl programmer, regardless of skill 
 Some books excite you; some bore you; some interest you.  This book embraces and engulfs you.  It is impossible to imagine anyone reading it without both raging and exhulting.  A wonderful, beautiful, searing book.  The first paragraph (which I read to my students as an example of 'The Event That Most Changed My Life') will suck you in so far you'll read it with fury, passion, and an intensity that makes both most autobiography seem limp and most writing seem pale.  Richard Rhodes is a fine writer, but this book is more than written.  It is bled 
 Ihave been waiting for this to come out on DVD forever well worth the wait 
 This book was recommended to me by Amazon; after reading a few comments I was curious as to way this book got such high marks. I've read quite a few books on attraction, and I have to say this book does a great job of synthesizing a lot of the information your likely to come across. I had the luck of just finishing The Evolution of Desire by David Buss, which happens to be in the bibliography. I saw key elements of Buss' book simplified for easier reading. I have no doubt that Irresistible Attraction simplifies other sources in the same manner. The book, though not original contains a lot of useful information about attraction and personal magnetism 
 Feldman has made art criticism easy to understand for the student and non-student layperson alike.  Throughout the book he uses clear examples from established art works to ilustrate the ideas used in identifying what  is art through the use of one's perception.  The book is clearly divided  into logically linked chapters.  The last half of the book can be used as  an outline to clearly write one's own criticism, and, with a little work,  construct a criticism comparing any two artworks from any media.  This is a  "must have" book for any graphic or performing artist 
 Look,let me get something straight.....I have heard nothing like this atleast from the Indian standpoint and Bananarama will always hold the top most position......I am so sorry that most Indian popsters cannot even sing or produce music even half of what Bananarama can! That's a FACT!! Let's face the truth......If you know what I really mean.....Try to look yourself from the rear end..........that's the way Indian.......most (especially girl bands sound)OOOOps ,not my tastes at all.....I would grade them not even a Zero................So sorry.....Bananarama are REAL STUFF and Quality music.....I LOVE them and so will Generations to come.I think if Bananarama is considered Cheesy......well I consider our own girly band totally stupid and idiotic and even cheesier..........ha ha.I don't wanna mention names.I would love to see these Banana girls come back......Wish they make a tour of India......let our Indian counterparts have a taste of them..........LIVE!!!.............ha ha ha!!!Just wait.Bananarama please teach our girls the real knack of "GIRL POWER"........they have so much to learn 
 The best thing about Hecht's book are the long and thorough discussions about every topic. This makes the book very adequate for self studying. On the other hand, it can be very incovenient if you're using to book to study for your exams (as I did). So I do recomend Hecht as a first reading in Optics, but be sure that you're not in a hurry.. 
 I recommend The Meters to anyone who likes true funk--this CD is definitely a good place to start.  I've been listening to and playing funk music for a long time now, and I can say that this album, along with some of the band's other work, is the definitive collection of funk jams in their purest form 
 Matthew Arnold, a British poet and critic, wrote on the importance of culture in this work.  He defined culture, famously, as "sweetness and light" - implying that culture represented everything good, everything  not barbaric.  The work is most important for the way it forwards the  notion of an "organic" society - that is, a society that evolves  slowly, that grows into maturity, that does not strive for sudden  "advances" led by experts working all at once to implement great  change.  For anyone wondering about the relationship between modern  conservatism and classical Liberalism, this is a decent place to start.   "I am a Liberal," Arnold writes in the introduction, "yet I  am a Liberal tempered by experience, reflection, and renouncement, and I  am, above all, a believer in culture."  If you wish to take an  intellectual journey from Burke to Bork, Arnold must make up one leg of  your trip 
 The Server has a small footprint, It was very easy to install. The installation instructions are easy to follow. After installation I was able to print to my printer from wired computers and wireless computers on my network. 
 we read this to our children's circle at Mabon.  it was a big hi 
 The slayings of four family members during the quiet hours of November 15, 1959 left a puzzling hole in the town of Holcomb, Kansas.  The Clutter family was prosperous and well-liked, esteemed in the eyes of their neighbors, the husband generous to a fault.  The townspeople and investigators were baffled by the brutal, apparently motiveless crime.  The case gripped the hearts of the investigators and of the author Truman Capote, who devoted years of his life to gaining the true story behind that fatal night.  "In Cold Blood" is a piercing examination of the two convicted killers, Perry Smith and Dick Hickock.  At the time of its writing, the story was that of a nonfiction novel, with Capote virtually inventing the category of true crime.  His chronicling of the Clutter murders is simple and straightforward, but crafted by his eye for detail and his gifted ability to bring the most unlikely characters and situations to life.  Capote covers all the bases, blending reminiscence with eyewitness accounts, threading the past details of Smith's and Hickock's lives with the investigators' hunt for the persons responsible.  "In Cold Blood" stands as a watershed in the true crime genre.  The title, while common, is perfectly suited to the crimes described; for the killing of the four family members was seemingly spontaneous, the killers' bungled burglary attempt a paltry payoff.  The narrative is spellbinding, an odd blend of unease and empathy, suspenseful even when the outcome is known 
 I tried several different bottles, including Avent and Second Nature, and this is the only one that my baby could get a good suction on and didn't flow too fast or make her gag. The nipples are the same as the pacifier given to me at the hospital (which is the only pacifier she will take as well). I am breastfeeding, and with all of the trouble I was having findnig a bottle, I was worried about what would happen when I went back to work and my baby had to be fed from a bottle. This bottle has eased my mind. Also, the wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles. The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it will leak if the top is not on really tight, but as long as I make sure it is tight I have no problems 
 It looks like Domingo has finally found his heir apparent. And Latin America is fast becoming a source of great new tenors. Apart from Villazon, there's Juan Diego Flórez, who excells in florid Rossini roles.  However, it looks like Villazon is the bright new hope for Verdi, and, as aptly demonstrated in this album, French repertoire. His voice is wonderful, beautiful dark sound, coupled with excellent technique and something that many other tenors lack: real vocal charisma and acting skills.  The highlights on this album are Werter, passionate, absolutely riveting, and heartfelt Des Grieux. Natalie Dessay joins him in Massenet - what a dream casting! It's time we had a tenor that can generate such excitement but more than live up to the hype when it comes to artistic qualities 
 Written by medical doctor and internationally recognized authority on longevity William H. Thomas, In The Arms of Elders: A Parable of Wise Leadership and Community Building is part memoir, part parable, and part fictional novel about a marooned young couple who become part of a new society organized through elders, then who must apply the wisdom they have gleaned to find their own place in life when they go home once more. A contemplative narrative about the ups and downs of life, and the leadership that comes tempered from experience, In the Arms of Elders is absorbing from cover to cover. Enthusiastically recommended 
 Over the last few years there have been many questions and conversations about Radical Orthodoxy.  For many, it is a way of thinking that is as confusing as it is insightful.  James K. A. Smith shows the promise of Radical Orthodoxy in this very accessible introduction.  Smith aims to summarize what the "theological sensibility" (most of the authors don't want to be considered a movement or school of thought) known as Radical Orthodoxy has been about.  He also intends to point out deficiencies in "RO" and suggest avenues for future research.  He does all of this from a Reformed point of view, one that is missing in much of RO's work.  The book is divided into two parts.  The first seeks to place RO within the greater theological and philosophical discussion.  It does so by discussing other ways of thinking, outlining RO's main contentions, and giving a brief account of the history of philosophy as RO reads it.  The second section more clearly articulates RO's contentions and points the way to future improvements.  Chapters deal with politics, epistemology, ontology, and ecclesiology.  Smith makes it clear that he finds RO's soteriology and understanding of sin particularly in need of repair.  If you are a student struggling with RO, this book is definately for you.  If you are theologian interested in RO, this book will help summarize RO and give a brief critique.  If you are involved in RO and want to see it move in different directions, this book is a useful part of the conversation.  I highly recommend it 
 My experience with Reiki was heresay prior to being gifted with Diane Stein's Essential Reiki book.  Upon receiving it, i read it thoroughly and then, i took 6 hours of Reiki I, II and III over two sessions to become a master with all the necessary attunements.  Had it not been for the valuable information in this particular book, i would have never made it thru the classes.  Now, let it be said...there is the LONG, EXPENSIVE journey to Reiki master and then there is Diane Stein's "Essential Reiki" ...in  this accelerated millenium you decide what's best for you.  I am actively healing and being healed as a result of this accurate, detailed and informative writing 
 Lay's book is my second favorite book on introductory level real analysis--please see my review of Elementary Analysis by Kenneth Ross.  Ross somehow covers a lot more material, and quite a bit more clearly than Lay, BUT, the first two chapters of Lay's book covering axiomatic set theory are wonderfully written.  I particularly love the clearly written coverage of the paradoxes contained in the Fraenkel-Zermalo Axioms, in Particular the Banach-Tarski paradox which states that a solid sphere of radius A < B can be cut an pasted into a sphere of radius B. Then, from chapter 3 onwards, Lay and Ross pretty much follow each other, Lay being more wordy than Ross, Ross being far more clear than Lay.  Alex Alaniz Ph.D.  1. Please see the reviews of my own strong science fiction book: Beyond Future Shock about the near-terms perils and promise of advanced bio/nano technology in a world still roiled with Middle Age religious conflict and ever growing extreme wealth gradients.  2. I have REVIEWED many books from undergraduate to graduate in: PHYSICS, MATH, ECONOMETRICS, and HISTORY among other areas.  
 Here's the deal. You put a bunch of smart guys with Western style educations in a room with the Dalai Lama and some of his buddies. You transcribe what they present and the discussions that follow.   Naturally, there's a fair amount of time spent clarifying terms. Some might find that tedious. Perhaps. But it also makes clear how language can put some bounds on your thinking. It's always interesting to discover that some term or another simply doesn't easily translate.   I'd highlight two aspects of this book. The first is that it reveals a therapeutic side to Buddhism that is seldom stressed. Second, a number of subjects are raised in the book that are worth a deeper dive. The notes section is reasonably complete and contains pointers to some things I otherwise wouldn't have found. The work of Francisco Varela is a good example.   I'd highlight two aspects of this book. The first is that it reveals a theraputic side to Buddhism that is seldom stressed. Second, the notes. A number of subjects are raised in the book that are worth a further look. The notes contain pointers to some  valuable stuff I otherwise wouldn't have found. The work of Francisco Varela is a good example 
 Huston Smith clearly loves his subject and treats each religious tradition with all the reverence and respect that any follower/lover of each tradition would provide.  His writing shows us all that is best in each tradition and is a wonderful review of the various religions.  The irony that is lost in many current followers of these traditions today is that each religion has so very much in common with the others.  If all could recognize the commonality, the use of religion as a reason for segregation, war, violance and strife could be eliminated.  It is no wonder that this book has stood the test of time, since first published decades ago.  Smith has done an outstanding job of showing us what is great about all these religions 
 This is another fantastic book from the Landau-Lifshitz series. I studied it in depth and then taught from it. I don't think there is any book of PHYSICAL quantum mechanics comparable to it, not even the classical Sommerfeld's "Mechanics of Defromable Bodies". What I like most in this book is the constant use of thermodynamics, allowing the treatment of much more real (and interesting) systems. For instance, it derives quite early conditions for the establishment of atmospheric thermal inversion, a problem of great practical importance in our days. The introduction of the Reynold's number is also superior to any other I've met. Relativistic fluid mechanics receives also a very good treatment, being an excellent preparation for relativistic cosmology. In this book Landau presents his ideas on turbulence, what is called now the Landau-Kolmogoroff turbulence theory. This is being challenged, after recent progresses on deterministic chaos, by different theories, l! ike that of Ruelle-Takens. Still, in order to really enjoy the progresses in this field, you should know both, and the perfect source of information for Landau-Kolmogoroff theory is Landau's book 
 This reference was filled with a smaller number of Gods and Goddesses than some other books that can be found, but as far as the references go, They were down to the point and yet still full of usefull information. I recomend this book to those who wish to crss reference Gods and Goddesses from many different religions and just read in general 
 I have been a big fan of Celestial Seasonings since the 1980s, when a friend drank the different blends and I tried one.  My husband drinks this faithfully every night, and I sometimes drink some of his. I do have one complaint, though small:  when I drink a full cup, it sends me to the bathroom a couple of times in the night.    I also notice that it does not interfere with my or my husband's medications; that is a big concern among alot of people and medical community.  Everyone reacts differently, I know; if you want to buy one box and try a few drinks of it each night or every other night, if you are on prescriptions like we are(we are only baby boomers,not old people), I would do it that way.    In a previous review from someone who sweetens it, I think that would ruin the whole taste and aroma of the SleepyTime.  Give it time and it will grow on you 
 Book is small, but loaded with 350 recipes!..have tried 4 already with great success..something for everyone to make in a tiny little crockpot..perfect for a small family 
 I've read countless magazines and books and watched too many forgetable instructional DVDs through the years.  So much of the instruction and tips are irrelevant, conflicting, and/or down right wrong.  Finding this book a few years ago was like finding golf's holy grail.  I haven't had a "bad" ball stricking day since I picked it up.  Knowing what I know now, I'd given thousands of dollars for this information - what it teaches is priceless.        
 A classic. Stills is in top form with the potent "Rock 'n' Roll Woman" and "Bluebird," the latter featuring a cacophony of 11,000 chiming guitars wafting from the speakers. Likewise, Richie Furay shows his strength with the beautiful "Sad Memory," a song that's as haunting as any I've ever heard. And Neil? The Stones-ish "Mr. Soul" captures the uncertainty of fame and all that that entails; the Beach Boy/Spector-esque "Expecting to Fly" glides above the squabbles then encompassing the Springfield; and "Broken Arrow" is, like Neil, layered, incomprehensible and one of a kind 
 This is a great dvd set. The best part is the recent interview with Hugh O'Brien. Except for some sun damage from probably spending too much time outdoors, Hugh looks absolutely terrific. For a recently married man of 82, he looks at least 20 years younger. Hugh discusses his career, his intense preparation for the role, his experience as the youngest drill instructor in the history of the marine corp, and other bits of information. The clarity of each episode is terrific. I only hope that other golden western dvd and detective shows are also soon released while the stars of these shows are still alive. Having them appear to introduce the dvd is a great touch 
 I don't think I have heard a more beautifully uplifting CD ever.  All tracks are wonderful but my favorite being "Magnificat". The Crouch End Festival Chorus can not be surpassed; truly an extremely talented group.  Having loved the gone and mystical Latin mass, this reminds me of how very much we Catholics miss.  Bravo to Paul Schwartz on this truly magnificent work 
     this was and still is one of the best skit comedy shows out at the time. dave's natural gift of comedy is very well suited to this outrageous and howling,profaine,and insightful show. mr. chappelle has taken some great bits and turned skit comedy on it's ear! this set isn't for everyone,but if like me the skit of the blind,black white supermacist(watch to understand) is just the funniest bit i have seen in years.      like i said this is not for all taste as the laungage is very corse and the skits are very much geared for adults(keep the kids away!!!), but for those with the sence of humor to like dave this is a great collection to have! 
 American Gothic features camp performances by both Rod Steiger and Yvonne Decarlo.  This movie is like an older version of House of 1000 Corpses. Long before Rob Zombie made House of 1000 Corpses...this obscure classic was around!! If you like the old Addams Family series...you should love this movie! 
 Night Scents:I particularly enjoy the New England settings of many of Carla Neggers books. In this one we have the roaring ocean (metaphor for sexual tension), a mystery, a handsome stranger, an eccentric aunt, and a lovely, extraordinary woman. Piper Macintosh lives on a dead end street overlooking the ocean in Cape Cod. Her new neighbor is a Tennessean who bought Piper's great Aunt's property on a whim. Something the successful business finds odd himself, because he is not a man to give in to impulse. Clate Jackson is looking for an escape to the pressures back home when he gets caught up in the whirlwind which is Piper Macintosh.Piper is caught digging in Clate's yard for some root her Aunt Hannah needs for one of her herbal cures.  Clate warns her not to dig again on his property. The sexual attraction is too much to be discarded by a word and they are drawn to each as surely as the ocean crashes in waves on the beach. Piper leads an interesting, eclectic life running classes from her home and helping her aunt. She has an old car but her choice of transportation is her bike which she rides all over town.  Her father and brothers are overprotective. As local contractors and builders, they also have the muscle to protect her. Clate has to deal with them and prove he's worthy of their precious Piper. Piper and Clate are tied to a mystery her elderly Aunt Hannah recalls of watching from her window for her parents, who never returned from the sea, and seeing a man bury something in the yard. She remembers her father telling her he saved a Russian Princess, and something about a Faberge egg but it is Clate and Piper who must unravel the old, old mystery.  Weird accidents start to happen and Piper's life is in danger. Together the Piper and Clate try to find the cause of the trouble, and save the elderly aunt from being put away in a nursing home for being looney.A wonderful, charming, delightful story. I'd tell you more but I don't want to give away more of the plot.B 
 Omar's high woman-ish but extremely awsome voice hasn't quite shown itself that much in this CD. Songs like "Mannequin Republic" and "Non-zero possibility" are probably what got him the idea for Mars Volta. If thats you'r favorite part about At the Drive-In you should definitly look into some Mars Volta. But don't think of them as an "underdeveloped Mars Volta" because they differ in many ways and have more of a EMO style 
 This book is the most racist book i have ever read.I cant wait for it to be a movie with slyvester sallone and arnold shrazanegger.This book turned me on my home dog 
 Confronting The Horror: The Aftermath Of Violence by Wilma L. Derksen combines graphic honesty with compassion and hope while serving as a practical guide through the aftermath of violence. Addressing both the personal and justice issues encountered after experiencing a violent act, Confronting The Horror takes the reader through the fifteen elements of serious crime which are intricately associated with victim's journey to recovery. With it's "reader friendly" text enhanced with personal stories, Confronting The Horror is especially recommended reading for victims of crime, as well as their friends, family, and service providers. Also highly recommended are two other relevant titles: Sue Simpson's Getting Through The Maze: A Guidebook For Survivors Of Homicide (0968838561, [$$$]) and Wilma L. Derksen's Have You Seen Candace?: A Mother's True Story Of Coping With The Murder Of Her Daughter (097315571X, [$$$]) 
 Strogatz's approach to Nonlinear Dynamics is suitable for anyone equipped with a good basic understanding of ordinary differential equations. He allows the reader to gradually build-up their understanding through a series of illustrations and examples - this is the sort of book that will be indispensable the night before a final year undergraduate Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics exam. Not excessively mathematical, contains solid explanations and encourages the reader to learn more about this fantastic area of physics 
 A companion to an exhibition taking place at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, this book presents colored panel and shroud portraits of Roman Egypt. Contributors, including R. Bagnall, M. Bierbrier, K. Gschwantler, J. Taylor and S. Walker, give a concise acccount of mummy portraits and their discovery, as well as the Fayum and its people. Extensively illustrated in color, this is a useful book covering a little-known subject. An excellent reference for everyone 
 I can't agree more with the first reviewer.  This book represents a milestone in my life.  It helped me go for being a poor student to a successful one.  (Today I have my own engineering practice.)  If the book's suggestions are taken seriously, no one who reads it can claim they haven't done their best.  While the study skills advocated are very practical, perhaps the heart of the book is its upbeat outlook.  Another outstanding book is "Effective Study" by Francis Robinson, a professor who performed amazing research on study methods and whose work (the SQ3R method) appears in various forms or acronyms in many study books today.  Like "You Can Succeed", Robinson not only gives insightful study tips, but understands that students will often fail or succeed in proportion to their ability to effectively manage their personal issues and environment.  Other sources: http://www.supermemo.com/articles/power.htm and the work of Dr. Piotr Wozniak, Harry Lorayne on memory, Mortimer Adler in "How to Read a Book", and Barry Farber in "Learn Any Language".  You won't regret it 
 Delany has one of the most penetrating minds of anyone writing in English. This book should be a first resource for anyone considering writing novels--Delany discusses it as the serious pursuit that it is. I find myself reconsidering many aspects of my own writing, and not always comfortably. I'll be a better writer for it 
 I have been waiting for so long for this film to come out on DVD.  I bought the VHS in the meantime but kept putting in requests to have it released on DVD and here it is!!  If you have never seen a Fred Astaire film, than you will fall in love with him when you see this one!  The dance numbers are supurb, and the humor delightful.  You'll learn once and for all that when Fred gets his eyes on a girl, he'll stop at nothing!  Definetly worth seeing!!   
 On my last visit to my hairdresser of 6 yrs she was floored on how healthy my hair was becoming. It was in large part due to Ms. Grays's book. She gives detailed advice on how to care for your hair and tips on various styling methods. My hair has less breakage and is in better condition since using her methods. 
 Shore Leave is one of the best episodes of the classic series. It uses all the sci fi props but also has a great story, if you don't even care about Star Trek and have to watch one, watch this one.  
 The writting is poetic making the characters real and emphasing their feelings and courage--especially moving is their suffering 
 I've had adult acne forever. I used proactiv for at least 5-7 years and do think it's a great product. However, after a while I found the fragrance was a bit too strong, and began irritating my eyes tremendously. I found acne free, and thought I'd give it a try since it was cheaper and easier to find locally too. I've been using it ever since, and have found even better results. The cost savings and convenience of finding locally, makes it a better choice for me. Plus I can buy a big bottle of cleanser separately. I always used to stack up on the toner and lotion since you never use as much as the cleanser. I love the product and would highly recommend 
 While I am a huge Steve Martini fan, I was a little concerned when I read the dust jacket blurb about this book. I'm not a big fan of military thriller style books, and from the description, it appeared that he had moved closer to that genre than to the legal mystery category. However, judging books by their covers can be very deceptive, and this proved true with this book.  This is a wonderful legal mystery with numerous twists and turns. Steve Martini provides just enough peripheral characers as to make it difficult to really figure out who did it, and why. He also keeps you hanging until the end trying to figure out how the trial will end and whether his client will go free or fry.  The characters created by Mr. Martini are fantastic, with enough detail to make them interesting and little enough detail to know them too well. I particularly liked the prosecutor, whom Mr. Martini gave the nickname of the "Death Dwarf".   Finally, his characterizations of Harry Hinds and Paul Madriani are great. Unlike many writers of legal mysteries, his attorneys do not speak as if they came from a "silk stocking" law firm, but rather from the real world they would occupy. Harry is his usual smart mouthed self, while Mr. Madriani continues to be the calmer, and smarter of the two.  I highly recommend this book, along with the others written by Mr. Martini. I am now looking forward to my next chance to catch up with Harry, Paul and the others in his next book. 
 This book is a valuable resource as my husband and I plan our "farmhouse" that we intend to build next year beginning in February.  It gives examples of restorations, new construction built to look like the old classical farmhouses across the midwest, and amazing interiors.  I love the shaded boxes of information, emphasizing the importance of features such as shape, the color white, porches, etc.  It is a lesson book for those wanting a basic education on how to talk farmhouses.  We bought three books, and this one is far superior to the others 
 This was my first introduction to Marian Keyes. Wow. WOW. I can't begin to say how much I loved this book! I laughed 'til I almost embarrassed myself in public, I cried 'til I almost embarrassed my--... you get the idea. This is deceptively simple -- a rich perspective on matters great and small, a story drawn from life, masterfully told. I've rarely seen an author so completely adept at storytelling, knowing exactly when, how and how much to reveal to the reader. You completely move with Anna Walsh through her stages of awareness, and her honest exploration of the labyrinth of the human heart. I did NOT want to finish this book -- I wanted to stay with these characters forever. This is the best of Irish wit, humor, zest for life, and a centuries-honed gift for sailing the turbulent seas of life and living to tell the story well. I loved it from first to last. 
 First off, this thing is truly the greatest toy my daughter has ever had. She got it for her first birthday, and loves it. Having said that--how about putting some kind of a brake on this thing? She's just starting to walk, and she's climbing all over it. It would be great if it could stay in one place solidly. Also, why doesn't this one have the safety straps, like the Pathfinder does?   But really, this thing is amazing. I'm more hoping that the company will read this and add some braking system, than trying to discourage parents from buying it. Heck, all I have to do is put a stick under the tire and it holds still just fine, I just think it'd be better with a simple brake. It is a safe, tough, well built wagon. I liked this one best. 
 This is a good compilation of Spanish hits from Ms. Estefan.  Even though I have heard most of these before through her original Spanish-spoken albums, and as bonus tracks on her albums, it is still nice to pop this little ditty into the CD player and enjoy them back to back.  "Santo Santo" is a really good dance song....and it has a very modern Latin feel to it.  It would be nice if Gloria would come out with some new music.  It's been a while.  She deserves respect for being one of the pioneers of Latin-flavored music in the U.S.  Hopefully, this will not be the last of her Spanish-spoken hit collections 
 I have found this book to be a very useful reference source. It covers a large number of crystals and minerals and gives great descriptions and information. A must for anyone interested in Crystals and their healing ablilities 
 This is the Bible storybook I have always hoped would be written, though I didn't realize it until I read it. I LOVE THIS BOOK! And so do my 8 year old, my 6 year old, my 5 year old, and my 3 year old.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for doing this. My favorite line so far: The Bible isn't mainly about you and what you should be doing. It's about God and what he has done. Amen. Our children are capable of hearing this and this book tells it to them in a way they can certainly understand 
 "In fact," says Dirk Gently, "everything between 'herring' and 'marmalade' seems to be missing."  Dirk Gently is an example of a breakthrough work: An attempt at something quite artistically new, which is all the more amazing because it actually succeeds.  In short, this novel is: a Science Fiction Mystery Comedy.  * DG is a quite good Science Fiction book, with elements such as strange alien technology ("The Electric Monk"), time travel, and an immortal -- if VERY absentminded -- being * DG is a quite good (and, to borrow another reviewer's term, "self-consistent") mystery/detective novel, even if the detective in question IS rather unorthodox! * DG is a very funny comedy novel, which parodies not only the detective genre, but also makes not-so-subtle jabs at ivory-tower academics, business executives, British Telecom, and computers (and the geeks that use and program them)  Dirk Gently as a character in particular is a truly original creation.  It is both very fortunate that we have him in two novels, and cruel and tragic that Douglas Adams did not live to develop him any further.  For one example, many of Dirk's college friends think he is psychic, and are always trying to get him to dream-speak upcoming exam questions.  Dirk sets out to prove them wrong by creating a complete copy of an upcoming exam, purely by researching past exams in the same course, studying the syllabus, etc., figuring that he will be only about half right on average, and everyone will see that he is just an ordinary guy and leave him alone.  Except that the exam he so produces turns out to be identical to the real one.  Oops.  (Later, in the present day, he tells a client, who is wanted for murder: "Remember that you are talking to someone who has spent time in prison for something he didn't do.")  Dirk's detective methods rely on studying "the vectors of interconnectedness of all things", which, plus the fact that he is perpetually broke, makes him look to casual observers rather more than less like a cheap con artist.  "Meet me at the pizza parlor in half an hour. And bring money." "What -- Dirk, are you trying to blackmail me?" "No, you fool, for the pizzas!"  I am reminded of a character named Gallagher who appeared in several short stories by the science fiction author Lewis Padgett.  Gallagher is a brilliant inventor, but can only do inspired work when blind drunk.  He wakes up to find that he has created astonishing gadgets, but has no idea how they work or even what they do.  This is a similar to Dirk Gently, who also has a gift bordering on the supernatural, but is more its victim than anything else because his talent is not at ALL within his control.  One theme not mentioned so much in other reviews is computers and related humor.  One of the main characters, Richard MacDuff, is a Macintosh programmer.  (Douglas Adams himself was a fanatical Mac user in real life.)  Among Richard's "creations" are a program that turns numerical, i.e. company financial, data into music; and a decision-making program that allows you to justify practically any outcome by back-tracing from the desired result (and which is promptly confiscated by the US Government!)  Unfortunately, Richard has a problem: A sofa stuck halfway up his apartment stairs that can NOT be moved -- up OR down.  So most of his computing cycles these days are spent on 3D modeling of the sofa, trying to extricate it, much to the annoyance of the boss of his software company.  "People who want their company accounts to sing to them are not interested in buying a revolving sofa!"  And I haven't even mentioned the missing cat, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Johann Sebastian Bach, or the end of life on Earth yet!  It is really hopeless to try to capture this complex, brilliant, wacky book in any kind of short review.  My suggestion is: Just try it.  Warning: Like the good mystery novel it is, it starts out nearly incomprehensible, and makes more and more sense as you go on, so be patient with it.  But, this book IS strange enough that it is probably not for everyone.  How to tell?  I would say that if you enjoy one or more of: Monty Python, Dr. Who, Woody Allen's "Zelig", computer geekdom in general, and/or the Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy (but be warned: Dirk Gently's characters are much deeper and more complex persons than Hitchhiker's are) then Dirk Gently is definitely something you should consider reading.  I will leave you with another favorite quotation, which comes very early on. In the dedication, in fact:  "To my mother, who liked the bit about the horse. 
 I first viewed this version when it came out in 1985. I was enthralled by it then and still love it today (I have a well-worn VHS copy from the tv.) It brings the story to life in a way that no other attempts have achieved.  A few friends and I have been searching for this version for ages and are thrilled to have finally found it. It's strange, but I would almost place this particular "Alice" into the cult classic category. Children and adults alike will completely fall in love with this classic, I'm sure 
 As a former drive-in manager, I look for all books about this topic. The  Sanders' book is the best I have seen. If you only want a single book about  drive-ins, this is it. The historical survey is concise and well-written,  and the photographs are dazzling. I especially appreciated the page devoted  to the classic Winston Link drive-in/train photo from the Fifties.  This  will be a great gift/coffee table book for any of your friends who ever  went to the drive-in.  Other books about the drive-in culture have been  rendered irrelevant by the Sanders' work. Congratulations to them 
 Dr. Phil: My first guest tonight is a man who has some impulse-control problems.   Raskolnikov: What do you want? When will you leave off tormenting me?   Dr. Phil: Hold it right there. Seems to me you need an attitude adjustment.   (Raskolnikov turns abruptly and stares at the wall.)   Dr. Phil: Says here you murdered an old lady for her money. You murdered her, and then you murdered her sister. What were you thinking?   Raskolnikov: (Making a violent effort to understand what it all means) I murdered myself, not them! It was the Devil that killed them. Enough, enough! I killed a noxious insect of no use to anyone, so what is the object of these senseless sufferings?   Dr. Phil: You need to get a grip on yourself, and you need to take some responsibility and make healthier choices.   (Applause from studio audience.)   Raskolnikov: (Breathing heavily, his upper lip twitching.) My choice was to be a great man dedicated to improving the lot of humanity. The vast mass of mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some mysterious process to bring into the world at last one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence.   Dr. Phil: Let's talk about the independence thing, since you brought it up. You're still receiving money from your mother, isn't that right? And you have a college degree but no job? And recently you've embarked on a life of crime?   Raskolnikov: The extraordinary man has the right to find in his own conscience a sanction for murder, if it is essential to the practical fulfillment of his idea. Our rulers destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a virtue. They are knaves and scoundrels.   Dr. Phil: Ho ho, well I'm not an expert on politics, but don't you think you have enough problems of your own to keep us busy here? I understand you're in love with a prostitute?   Raskolnikov: Sonia is a woman of the utmost purity whom I love with a Christ-like intensity that drives me to torment and humiliate her.   Dr. Phil: Be honest with me now. Don't you think she'd prefer a relationship in which two healthy people come together because they complement each other on an equal footing of respect and love?   (Applause from studio audience.)   Raskolnikov: (Grinds his teeth.) A dull animal rage boils within me.   Dr. Phil: We need to extinguish these self-defeating behavior patterns of yours.   Raskolnikov: Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart.   Dr. Phil: I one-hundred percent disagree. You can do better than that. Now I understand Sonia can't be here tonight because she's ministering to the needs of plague victims, but once you get out of prison for those murders, supposing this Sonia's still waiting for you, what do you think  you'll have to do to repair the damage you've already done to the relationship?   Raskolnikov: My mind is clouded and I am almost unconscious of my body.   Dr. Phil: I'm sending you to the green room to do some figuring.   Raskolnikov: Why must you persecute me with kindness, when I would rather boil over with a rapturous agony. (Laughs insanely.) Perhaps I am really mad, and all this happens only in my imagination.   Dr. Phil: Nope, you ain't getting you off the hook that easy. Fact is, you are accountable for your actions. What I'm asking you to do is take responsibility. Are you willing to give that a try?   Raskolnikov: (Bows down to kiss the earth.) Good God, man is a vile creature.   Dr. Phil: Do we have a deal or not?   Raskolnikov: I could strangle you at this moment. Why must you torture me? I feel a physical hatred for you, cannot bear you near me, and am becoming convinced that you are the most aggravating bully on the face of the Earth.   Dr. Phil: You see, now we're getting somewhere. Pain, once it's acknowledged, can be a powerful motivator.   Raskolnikov: Be silent, I beg of you. (Shuddering nervously, a malignant expression in his black eyes.) I am a louse, a wretch, a fool.   Dr. Phil: It's time for you to identify and confront the behaviors that are making you unhappy. I always tell people, you don't need a diploma to hose down a mule.   (Standing ovation from studio audience.)   Raskolnikov: I feel sublimely indifferent to your opinion. (Walks toward the exit.) No, I retract everything I have said, your words make perfect sense, you are a seer, a god. (Bounding out of the studio, his voice carrying from afar.) If only I had met you before I became an axe  murderer, perhaps I would now be among the saints.   Dr. Phil: Oh boy.   (Raskolnikov returns after a tumultuous inner struggle, pushing his way through a dense crowd of peasants.)   Dr. Phil: We're going to take a break now.   Raskolnikov: (Strikes Dr. Phil repeatedly on the head with the blunt side of an axe, then leaves overcome with remorse.)  
 That Nemirovsky died in Auschwitz before she could finish this novel is yet another shame to lay at the feet of the Nazis, but the books that survive are wonderful:  stories told with grace, elegance, tenderness, and a wry humor for human foibles.  This is imperative war fiction, highly recommended for readers who loved Anita Shreve's RESISTANCE and Jenna Blum's THOSE WHO SAVE US 
 I think bayesian theory will be used inevery fields of our life in the future 
   Always relevant, poetry addresses the great themes of our lives, love, loss, the modern terrors of a post 9/11 world, the scourge of war and a hope for peace. Tackling every human emotion and universal concept, poetry "puts us in touch with ourselves" as we interpret the words of the poets, personalizing and processing. This collection addresses every aspect of life, from the general to the personal perspective, our marginalized society, our place in the grand scheme of things and an ongoing dialog with history from the perspective of our own experiences. The poem is the sound of humanity, the voice of yearning and hope, restoring us to an increasingly alienating world, a private corner of the universe where we find comfort and expression.  Poet's Choice is not just another collection of great poems, but a more intimate format, the author speaking to the landscape of poetry, the language of each selection, shared anecdotes, bits of information that render each work uniquely accessible: Jorge Luis Borges' "Nightingale"; Rabindranath Tagore's "Final Poems"; Nellie Sachs' "Butterfly"; Xuan Quynh's "Summer"; Pablo Neruda's "Body of a Woman" and "Walking Around", to name but a few. This is poetry in its natural context, complex, universally appealing. Thoughtfully assembled, the poets speak the language of the world, past and present, an anthology that begs for a permanent place on a desk or bedside table, an island of personal exploration that expands souls and heals the battered heart.   "And so it has taken me all of sixty years to understand that water is the finest drink, and bread the most delicious food, and that art is worthless unless it plants a measure of splendor in people's hearts." (Taha Muhammad Ali)  To absorb the depth of these poems is to appreciate the differences inherent in the world we inhabit, elevating the consciousness and reaching for the finer self, one with the universe in human experience and the source of hope. Luan Gaines/ 2006.   
 Wow...wow wow wow wow...I've heard a LOT of albums (over 3,000), but this one is INCREDIBLE. It's true that I only have a small amount of ambient albums (The Orb, Orbital, Mouse On Mars, Biosphere, Aphex Twin, Colleen, DJ Wally, etc...), but this one is just so ridiculously good I can't even come up with the right words to praise it. It's definitely an ambient album, but it's more of an experience then anything else - it feels like you're in another world when you're listening to this. The production here is amazing - obviously I have no idea how to describe the electronic blips and bloops, but they're all very high quality, fun and interesting to pay attention to. It's an audio journey like no other. I suppose you could say it's ambient music with some house mixed in, but essentially it's just a great "chill-out" album to groove to. When it comes to this kind of music there isn't much else you can say about it, really. If you like ambient music in the slightest then "76:14" will probably be the best darn ambient album you ever get! Absolutely recommended!  Highlights include: the entire album 
 This film allows the first time Jaglom viewer access to some of the director's best work, w/o the guessing usually involved in exporing an artist for the firsts time.  A must for anyone serious about film 
 This book reviews the evidence about so-called "choice" models of education or "free market" models and their impact on education. In the end the evidence shows nothing, but it doesn't refute anything either. What Levin shows us pretty convincingly is that, at the moment anyway, this is a debate driven by ideology rather than by evidence. No matter on which side one falls, one can interpret the evidence based upon their perspective, since the evidence is inconclusive. Like so many other debates in our society we have to move beyond the "classroom effects" and investigate what the proponents or opponents really have as their agenda. This is an excellent book simply because it is one of the first systemic reviews of the evidence as opposed to the ideological journalism with which we are most often confronted. No matter one's perspective, this book is worth reading, because it will alternately challenge and support one's views 
 If you like this movie and watched it numerous times(like me) youre gonna love being able to listen to the music isolated, and getting scared even without Carpenters pictures. It simply works just as well without the movie, and therefore is also ideal for listening while reading a good scary book 
 Even though I like "Quality Control" a lot more, their follow-up, "Power In Numbers", is still a great rap album that you definitely ought to check out. It follows relatively the same formula as their debut, although the songs don't seem as inspired or creative as they did on "Quality Control". However, there are 17 tracks here, and all of them are good-if-not-great. Rappers Akil, Zaakir, Marc 7even and Chali 2na are a tad worse than they were on "Quality Control" (they feel less natural), but they're still great and extremely appealing. They still have that oldschool flow and delivery that is severaly missed in today's rap scene. Lyrically the songs are always a lot of fun to listen to, and some of the songs are even quotable. The lyrics are definitely fun to memorize and sing. Musically it's a little different sounding than "Quality Control", but the producer here still has a good eye for great hooks and beats. Though every song here is good, there are definitely several stand-out songs here which I would argue bump the album's rating up - "Sum Of Us", "High Fidelity", "Remember His Name" and "A Day At The Races", for example, are GREAT rap songs that are very very memorable. I'm pretty sure that within one or two listens that you'll either have these stuck in your head or that you'll remember them forever. Basically folks, if you like rap or Jurassic 5 then "Power In Numbers" is another classic album by this classic group. Absolutely recommended!  Highlights include: "Sum Of Us" "Remember His Name" "A Day At The Races" "High Fidelity" "Break" "If You Only Knew" "What's Golden" the rest are good or decen 
 This is one of the best cd's I've owned in a long time. I've been following Reb since Winger seperated. This is his the best Reb and Kip have sounded since Pull.  For anyone who loves in your face melodic guitar rock, this is the album for you.  Rock on Reb! 
 WOW! I really love this book. Though I would not reccomend it to a young audeince most of the time I think it is a truely amazing artwork. Everything about it is amazing. Definitly check it out 
 Robert Lansing and the rest of the cast did an excellent job.  I found the movie to be very good and I enjoyed it.  
 This is my favourite BSC book and I never get tired of reading it!  Stacey is my favourite Babysitters and I love the fact that she finds some friends outside the BSC and I love Robert.  He sounds so great!    I enjoyed the plot and was surprised by the ending!  If you're not sure which BSC books to read this is definitely one you should! 
 Where the most eloquent writers display their best prose is through passion.  And the seeds of passion thrive in sex, exploitation, and violence.  The human condition, written about by every writer but only successfully by a minority, is dissected and shaved away and exposed layer by layer until one gets to the core of what the soul is, of what separates us from our basest instincts.  To that end, boxing is the true display of the human condition and the greatest writers have recognized this and have poured forth their own souls to capture the brutality that occurs inside the squared circle.  Joyce Carol Oates at first seems like an odd choice as an expert on the sport.  A frail academic known for her moving stories of family interaction, she wouldn't at first strike you as a devotee to a sport that most academics abhor.  But she is a lifelong fan.  Her father was a fan and it seems that it runs in the blood.  She's been going to matches and watching them on film since she was a young girl, and due to her thoughtful approach and extraordinary access she manages to coax the true spirit of the athletes from a myriad of interviews.    Many spectacular authors have written about the sport.  Jack London, Ernest Hemingway, Norman Mailer, and A.J. Liebling are a few that come to mind.  None of those giants bring to the sport a cautious sensitivity that Oates does.  Her prose are so rich that when reading this book, I had to frequently set it down and digest what I'd read.  Like a rich chocolate, too much at one time would overload my senses, dulling me and causing me to miss nuance and ramble through the poetry.  Her book is a treat, slowly and steadily read.  It's a beautiful, sad, witty communique from someone who recognizes that we need the outlet, the raw power and relentless destruction that representatives of all of us can administer.  Trained to the height of physical perfection, but unrestrained by conscience, boxers show us what we are all capable of doing, what we are all capable of enduring.  Her prose?  Check this out:  "No sport is more physical, more direct, than boxing. No sport appears more powerfully homoerotic: the confrontation in the ring--the disrobing--the sweaty heated combat that is part dance, courtship, coupling--the frequent urgent pursuit by one boxer of the other in the fight's natural and violent movement toward the "knockout": surely boxing derives much of its appeal from this mimicry of a species of erotic love in which one man overcomes the other in an exhibition of superior strength and will. The heralded celibacy of the fighter-in-training is very much a part of boxing lore: instead of focusing his energies and fantasies upon a woman the boxer focuses them upon an opponent. Where Woman has been, Opponent must be."  This book, to me, is an inspirational, a prayer book, a series of thoughts meant to get me through life more positive and more in tune with my soul.    Livingstone Brambles, of whom I have acquaintance and of whom Oates writes glowingly, when told that she'd written about him in On Boxing said, "Man, she loves me."    Yes, she does, Champ.  She loves all men who've donned gloves and tested their instincts in the ring, but more than most, she loves men like you who held nothing back, who gave their entire being over to training and instinct and sacrificed everything to survive and conquer.  She loves you Livingstone, because you are who we all wish to be.  CV Ric 
 I have bought maybe 8 of these books and may buy more if I think of other people who would want it. I have a few set aside for last minute gifts. It's almost like you can't have it out on the coffee table because people pick it up and refuse to put it down or socialize until I tell them that it's a gift for them and they can take it home.  Then they relax and we can get back to socializing. It would probably be best in the guest room or as a gift.There is something about it that is addictive: being a little fly on the wall and reading people's secrets, many of which make you squirm. Guilty pleasures.  It's very unique, and the times that I have given it as birthday gifts have been huge hits. People just love it, the husbands and the wives, both. I have seen people from age 36 to age 72 love it equally. It is maybe not for the more connservtive person who might be easily shocked, but other than that, it's a pretty universally unique and fascinating book 
 This book is way more then a study tips book , it shows you how to manage your life , tips for setting up a schedule you can follow.

Its amazing how 1 tip can change a life for the better and thats what this book did for me and my Computer tech career 
 Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time is terse, yet replete with imagery; a drama and a psychological study told in 150 pages. Through four novellas, the hero, Pechorin, advances a character study that bares (not exposes) a modern Russian man wandering through an age fraught with nihilisic ideology and the devolution of traditional values.  Eschewing ubuquitous cliches that portray brash Russian officers as wastrels and "soliders of fortune," Lermontov speaks from the soul of a very real man with very real fears, passions--and, at the same time--lack thereof. We follow Pechorin and learn his character through the women he loves, or purports to love, the company he keeps (and the way he regards it), and the lives he affects.  A "superfluous" hero in a time of flux, Pechorin seems to wreak havoc everywhere he goes, tarnish everything he touches. Love he regards skeptically--thinking its ardor has been spent on him; friends mean little to him as he lives wholly within his own preoccupations and whims; travel does not excite him--he has seen it all, and continues for lack of better leisure. Reckless adventure and risk-taking seem the only rousing diversion (building upon something of a staple character trait for the Russian novel).  Without values--breaking deals, betraying friends, ignoring every ostensible code of honor, Pechorin is a potentially extraordinary individual corrupted by aimlessness and spiritual hollowness. Interestingly, Pechorin, a hero of Lermontov's time, doesn't seem to have to gone away. Hmm, wasn't there always a Pechorin lurking among us 
 This CD is AWESOME!!! Aly & AJ do such a good job on this CD. Definitely worth getting if you love Aly & AJ!!!! Also, for anyone looking for a great CD to get them into the holiday spirit this year, this is the one!! 
 On first reading this book it just seemed like a defense of playing computer games. However after reading it and thinking about it for a while it probably has a point. Traditionally there has been a distinction between what could be seen as " the arts" and what is popular entertainment. The "arts" were meant to uplift one and inspire and do good things.  Popular entertainment were seen as at best time filling but perhaps as bad as rather than being educative about the world it spread a false reality based on simple stereotypes.   Historically some novels, drama, poetry, music and perhaps a small number of films have been seen as serious "art." Most films, television and certainly computer games are seen as popular entertainment. Over time books, drama and poetry have tended to decline in market share as the new technologies of DVD, Cable television and portable sound systems have developed. This has led to some gnashing of  teeth and tearing of hair in some circles as there is a belief that there is a general dumbing down of culture. Of course if you look at the level of education of the majority of people and the changes over time of IQ rates you get a different picture.   The author makes a good case that a lot of what is now being put out as mass entertainment is different from what it used to be and that most main stream critics of popular culture have not caught up. Thirty years ago most television cop shows consisted of a half hour format with heroic police dealing with cartoon character criminals. Nowdays cable television puts out shows like The Wire or The Sopranoes which rather than being stand alone simple stories have twenty four one hour episodes which have interlinked story arks with realistic character portrayals and insightful discussion of contemporary issues. All of course to do with market change. Thirty to forty years ago there were a small number of television stations which meant that the demand for programs was limited and had to appeal to a majority of the market. This lead to bland simple programs. Nowdays with the spread of cable TV you have the development of niche markets which means that there is more ability to produce diverse programs.   What the book says is that a lot of modern culture is much more complicated and sophisticated than it used to be. That is the reason of course why programs like " The Shield", " Lost" or " The Sopranoes" are made is because people have been educated to a level so that they can understand the multi layered plot lines, the interplay of the characters and the commentary on real issues.  Whilst there points are well made, I don't think that it could be said that playing computer games is actually good for you.  
 We are each the love of someone's life. Love is what it's all about in this lyrical, magic, and moving story about a boy, Max Tivoli, beset with an affliction that has him born looking like a seventy year old man, but over time physically regressing into infancy as he matures into adulthood. Got that? Smitten with a young Jewish girl when he is a boy of seventeen who looks like a man of fifty, Max finds a way to enter her life at various satges of his development. Each meeting nurturing a different and distinct relationship. I read almost this entire book in one sitting on an airplane, and was lost in his voice. It beautifully captures San Francisco of the early twentieth century, and builds to a moving and touching conclusion with an image that stays with you long after you close the book 
 I have been reading Playboy for years and have always felt this magizine has grown with informative information,and of course the great pictures have always been top notch. I cannot think of a better magazine to subscribe to..... 
 These sheets are smooth and comfortable; however, the fabric is thick and substantial, so if you like your sheets cuddly-soft, maybe you won't care for these.  I'm one of those people who can't stand to have wrinkles and folds under my feet, so I've fallen in love with them; the fabric will hold up all week without getting stretched, loose, and tangly.  I do wish they had done an extra row of stitching on the elastic of the fitted sheet, but at this price I suppose you can't have everything--and if it becomes necessary, I do have a needle-----somewhere-----I think.  I like the café color very much--it's a rich gold, deeper and not as yellow as the golds of yesteryear.  The sheets launder well; if you take them out of the dryer promptly and iron just the top hem (Iron an entire sheet? I don't think so.), the whole set looks smooth and inviting.  So I'm very pleased.  Now if I could just get my husband to let me tuck in the sheets at the bottom of his side of the bed, life would be good. 
 These sunglasses fit perfectly, if you are second guessing if you want to get these or not don't. There great! And they look good, almost like the real thin 
 The first time I saw Hootie and the Blowfish was in 1993 when I was a freshman at USC and they played a frat party I went to - I was completely hooked!  They continue to be my favorite band! Darius has the most amazing and distinct voice - I can't get enough. The only reason this rating isn't 5 stars is because they didn't record my favorite 2 cover songs they used to do (maybe it's a copyright thing) --> "Mustang Sally" and "Love the One You're With."  But I can't complain too much - this whole album is a treat 
 The short stories about Belacqua are the most beautiful stories Beckett had ever written. They are so picturesque that you can feel the atmosphere with him. The short stories are about love, drinking and poetry. In Dante and the Lobster, Belacqua tries to roast a toast to a specific point. It takes all his energy to make the preparations for this ritual. In Fingal, Belacqua takes his girlfriend Winnie out for a ride to Poltrane. In the end he missed her and rode the way back with a stolen bike. In a wet night he walks in the rain to Alba. On his way to her, he gets controlled by an officer. In the control he pukes all over the shoes of the officer and tries to clean the shoes with a newspaper. In this moment you are all by yourself and laugh out loud. You can't hide your joy of this lyrical depiction. The connection between the ten short stories is the life of Belacqua. He dies in one of the later stories by chance in a hospital. It is so funny because in an earlier story he hasn't got the strength to kill himself and Ruby.  As you see, Belacqua needs a lot of girlfriends in the short stories. He fills it with black humour and it is a joy to read. 
 The emotions and events of this book seemed mostly believable.  I found myself sobbing on more than one occasion.  Terminal illness and loss are given realistic but hopeful treatment.  I identified with many of the characters and at the end wanted to send it to my brother because of a special loss we have shared 
 Early compilers of Shakespeare's plays classified this a comedy, but there is much tragedy in it. Later it was called a romance. Through irrational jealousy a king is apparently responsible for the deaths of his entire family -- wife, son and daughter -- by mid-play. Time is a character in the play and at his one appearance summarizes the passage of sixteen years. If you have an overy high regard for realism, you may not much enjoy this play, but that will be true of more of Shakespeare than just this one tale. I thoroughly enjoyed it.   I look forward to seeing it. I've ordered the BBC DVD and it's being performed at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2006. These Cambridge School editions have the play's text on right-hand pages; they have summary, commentary and exercises, and vocabulary on the facing left-hand pages. As I read through the play, I'd read the summary, read the play text paying attention to vocabulary, and then read the commentary and exercises. Some additional, unusual vocabulary was only explained in the commentary. I felt I got a deeper understanding of the play than if I had just read the play proper.mmary, commentary and exercises, and vocabulary on the facing left-hand pages.

 The third book in the series was the best so far!  I have read all of the books in the series to my 6 year old.  He has liked them all.  But with the Wall of Trudd, he wanted to read more and more.  It has great action in it.  My interest was also kept by watching Akiko grow as a leader and a person.  The characters continue to amuse and engage 
 True imagination and a wonderfully written tale of a tortured man. I thought Frankenstein was a powerfully depressing book of a man's loss of self, but Shelley tops herself with this gothic masterpiece (POOR VERNEY). Don't let Shelley's critics fool you. Give this book a try 
 If you're looking for a classic jack-in-the-box, like you might have had as a child, this is it! Children today seem to really like it too.  Makes a great gift as it's hard to find in stores.  
 A clever conceit -- the whole "gift bag" culture in Hollywood is something I'd never thought about -- and spit-spot writing make this my pick of the year.  De Vries could teach Tom Wolfe something about writing with economy, and she's second to none in the keen-eye department.  Fast, funny -- and oddly poignant.  I read De Vries' first book -- "So 5 Minutes Ago" -- and she just keeps getting better.  A MAJOR new talent, folks.  
 As difficult as it is to make an argument regarding the economic impact corporate governance policies and procedures may have, this book makes a compelling arguement that good governance results in more profit. The combination of real life experience provided by Ira Millstein with the academic analysis produced by Paul MacAvoy's work presents different perspectives that arrive at the same conclusion.  I enjoyed it.  Necessary reading for anyone serious about corporate governance 
 The Shackled Continent is a tour de force. Robert Guest is a writer for The Economist and the style and quality of writing is outstanding. Guest is a brave soul for bringing us the true story of Africa: a continent full of potential that has been wasted by the deeds of socialist leaders who, in casting off their colonial chains, have destroyed their people's lives and, worse, much of their hope for a better future. The root cause of these problems? Tribalism.  After reading this book, I am convinced more than ever that Africans are entrepreneurial and hard-working with a good head for business. They are let down by creaky government infrastructure, corruption, and a lack of foreign direct investment from wealthier nations. But the rest of the world pays little attention to what goes on in Africa (sub-Saharan at least) and until more scrutiny is directed at governments in countries such as Zimbabwe, nothing much is going to change and the cycle will continue as is.  Guest's book paints a frustrating picture and one does not finish reading it wholly satisfied, which I think was his point, mirroring the current situation in Africa 
 I must respectfully disagree with the previous reviewer who stated that the book was disjointed and didn't make sense.  It is a warm, wonderful story with chapters that tell different stories from the point of view of some of the main characters.  Not at all difficult to understand, and in a way it is like putting together pieces of a puzzle.  By the end of the book you will be sorry that it has ended.  A bit like Amy Tan's Joy Luck Club, with wonderful characterizations of the family and all the aunties and uncles.  The Hawaii setting is great too, but the themes are universal.  Highly recommended 
 i cannot believe this comedy classic is out of print! bring it back please. most of us cant afford the outrageous prices for out of print dvds. so funny though. love the "wonder joints" scen 
 Dude this CD is awesome!Every song is different from all the others so it NEVER gets boring.I can listen to it all day and never get bored.If you like punk rock then you have to have this CD.So STOP READING THIS REVIEW AND GO GET IT 
 If you are a serious martial artist, then this book belongs on your shelf. The information is invaluable to any Judoka/Jujutsuka 
 I first came across Ibsen's monumental work when reading 'Tropic of Capricorn' by Henry Miller.  Despite my complete lack of evolutionary and biological knowledge, I found Ibsen's eschatology mind blowing.  Several times I was forced to leave the book for days in order to fully contemplate the philosophical ramifications of his insights.  From this great stride forward into the fringes of human understanding Ibsen states: 'A conduct that is truly our own, on the contrary, is that of a will which does not try to counterfeit intellect, and which, remaining itself - that is to say, evolving - ripens gradually into acts which the intellect will be able to resolve indefinitely into intelligible elements without ever reaching its goal.  The free act is incommensurable with the idea, and its "rationality" must be defined by this very incommensurability, which admits the discovery of much intelligibility within it as we will.  Such is the character of our own evolution; and such also, without doubt, that of the evolution of life."  No one, despite their educational backgrounds or lack thereof, should feel intimidated by the possibility of transcending one's very own intellect 
 I am confused by some of the other reviews of this book. Not just by the low scores, but also with the comments therein. The majority of the complaints about the book seem to be directed at Heinlien's political views and his adamantness derived therefrom. Now this is all well and good, everybody is entitled to their opinion, but the weird this is... THERE ARE ALMOST NO POLITICS IN THIS BOOK! Okay, so what is the book about then? Well, it's exactly what you'd expect, it focuses mainly on Robert's writing career. Sure, there are a few political meanderings here and there, but they are extremely few and far between. Such off-target reviews are almost enough to make one wonder whether or not these people actually read the book. Instead, this book consists of a large body of letters that were written before and (usually) after the publication of a Heinlein opus. From his first published stories, to his juveniles, to his controversial adult novels, they're all covered here. The letters show a lot about what went into the making of his works, and also shows some other interesting things, such as the trouble that RAH seemingly always had with editors and getting his words out like he wanted to. There is also a picture and sypnosis of the original version of most of the stories and novels that RAH put out. There are also letters on various other topics (such as travel, house-building, domestic life, etc.), plus a short biography of Robert (written by his wife), and a highly convenient bibliography. My only complaint about the book is that there is almost no mention made of his books written after I Will Fear No Evil. True, this isn't his best work, but they are important, and do indeed contain some fine novels (JOB, Friday). Perhaps, due to the author's deteoriating health at this time, there weren't really any letters written. However, one wishes whatever there was was included so as to make this book complete. Thus, it's not perfect, but certainly not as bad as some other have apparently made it out to be 
 It seems that this was the standard textbook for most university opera history courses at one time (at least it was when I took the course in the early 80's).  However, it seems to have fallen out of favor because those  of us who read the earlier editions and are now teaching opera history  courses recall the writing to be confusing, if not outright dull.  In my  opinion this lastest edition, written with Hermione Weigel Williams, is an  improvement, and I think the book deserves a second reading.  After  teaching our opera history course using another text, I returned to this  one because I feel it provides a better narrative: there seems to be more  of an effort to relate the various movements in opera to one another.  This  cause and effect relationship is helpful to the student in their attempt to  retain the information, and as well as understand the significance of each  operatic movement. Give it another chance 
 A fraudulent marine biologist, whose wife is about to expose his cover-up of phosphate pollution of the Florida Everglades, tries to kill her by throwing her overboard from a cruise ship.  Unknown to him she survives and haunts him to punish him.  It's a wonderfully comic page-turner, although the plot runs out of steam towards the end and the practical jokes played on the would-be murderer become repetitious. A few ends are left loose. It challenged comparison with the Florida novels of Elmore Leonard, such as "Maximum Bob" and "Stick" but it does not quite live up to the master. Some of the humor contrasting weird and wacky Floridians with stolid Upper Midwesterners seemed to derive from David Barry (and Euripides, Ovid and Tasso used the maiden-rescued -from-sea-monster gimmick). I thought this was his best since "Striptease." The intervening ones have been too incoherently plotted and (although I'm a tree-hugging whale- lover myself) overloaded with environmentalist politics.  Incidentally, isn't releasing alien snake species into the wild an environmental no-no?  
 How do you show a millionaire playboy, swooping in by plane to pick up a socialite Hollywood actress and make it look like a coming of age story? When he shared his milk with her, it was so romantic, I didn't know what I was going to do.  Also, has that recording of that Bach fugue ever been put to better use than it was in the Hell's Angels filming scene? I'm such a *fan* of Scorsese that I could see taking my remarks about him with a grain of salt, but honestly, no one else could possibly be as good at adding music to a film.   Also, everyone's acting was just great. Alan Alda playing the mean guy...Alec Baldwin was great... I knew Jude Law was Errol Flynn even before he was introduced... Kate Blanchett was of course wonderful... I'm so glad that Scorsese has decided Leonardo DiCaprio is his new favorite actor. They make such a good team -- Dicaprio was great in this. 
 I tend to agree with a previous reviewer. Eyewitness Travel Guides are great for seeing the sights in large cities. But when on the road, they are a bit less than fantastic. My wife and I used this one a few years ago on a tour along Route 1 from Calistoga to San Diego. Most of the info was very useful. The way this guide book introduces the area and its culture is one of its strongest points. Its picture-driven approach is also a big selling point. Four stars 
 THIS PREVIEW HAS SPOILERS OF THE GAME PLEASE DON T READ IT IF YOU DIDN T PLAY IT!  I played Xenogears and when i saw Xenosaga Episode was kinda short compare xenogears in battle system but was ok because xenosaga was like an "introduction".  OK improvements: Gameplay was Longer than Episode 1 (I ended Episode 1 with everything in 42 hours) in change Ep2 (88+). Sidequest is like a plus if you want it to do it if you don t you can end the game anyways. The Idea of Epiloge after you finish the game was very cool because you could kill special bosses and get better and kill the final boss overkilled and stuff like that. Chaos Jr Momo Shion & Kosmos Looking was improved they looked more grow up. Battle system to put them up or down depending who you were using or fighting as well double Tech attacks All Characters were able to use all magic skills as long you buy them with your skillpoints and making able with the sidequests. Momo Bow was a very nice improvement and now she can be a very good Damage Dealer Recover Mp while stock was a good idea as well to use ep freely without any trouble. People complain because history was focus in Jr and URTVs but the title says itself (Jenseits von Gut und Bse) means "Beyond Good and Evil" wich means "Rubedo worring for the ladies in danger and his Red Dragon mode wich makes him go out of control (possible reason of Sakura Death), Albedo and his obssesive love for rubedo but at the same time to kill him as well, Nigredo wich refused to do a mission (involved with Rubedo) and killed his own father but he plays as good person at the moment as albedo said "Giving life from 1 hand and delivering death from the other". Honestly second episode history role was more development than first one because wasn t an introduction and we were starting to know how things were going...   What they did wrong: I don t see how they could think throw away the tech attacks was going to be a good idea... Good Thing they added the tech attacks & special attacks in ep 3  You had to do stock a lot of times to make a good combo between characters(wich made battles kinda boring) Music in battle was kinda boring compare to Ep 1 Voices of Chaos(sounded boring...) Kos-Mos (like Fake silly girl trying to play as a robot) Shion (Pushing and like "I m better than you") Momo (Very Annoying) sad thing is my main team is Chaos Kosmos & Momo thats why i got sad for that voice changes but they said they refix their voices as episode 1 in the third and last episode. Ep 1 has almost 8 hours of movies Ep 2 4:30hours (i guess for the complains of the long movies) I still don t get it movies give more motion of the storyrole of the game wich is most of the attractive things Xenosaga has over most of the games. In Episode 3 is 4hours of full motion movies but plus the speak texts with faces included while characters move and do stuff like Valkyrie Profile They cut completly the close up when they cast spells or hit lights and stuff most of the time you see characters back all the way while you are fighting. (they fix that in ep3)  In Resume as everyone know Episode 2 had bad things but as well good things (as every game) no they shouldn t did it bad when they noticed the things people like of the game itself. Good thing is they fixed most of the bad stuff of Episode 2 to Episode 3. Battle system soundtrack and characters voices all is better only thing i didn t like of episode 3 battle mode is they make it appear as an average rpg system (attack, ether, tech, special tech, and others) so forget the 4 combinations to make a tech attacks & ethers cost "ep(cp)" special attacks cost boosts. i wonder if attack will give some "ep(cp)" later. Even with all this i recommend you to buy it before you get episode 3 because you will be losing a lot of storyline if you don t and more now they cost 20 dollars each (or less)  Atte: Roy_Master 
 Although J. A. Jance's series of "Joanna Brady" mysteries has been around a while, I was just introduced to them this summer. "Desert Heat" introduces Joanna on her wedding anniversary, when she finds her barely-alive husband shot and left to die in a dry wash near their home. The story is gripping, leading the reader by the nose through a variety of suspicions while never revealing enough to show what is "really going on" until Joanna also discovers it. The characters in the story are a nice collection of small-town figures: sheriff and deputies, the minister, relatives and neighbors. The characters, even Joanna, do not develop greatly during the story; after all, it takes only about three days. But the relationships between the characters develop well, especially between Joanna and her mother. There are some coincidences in the story which strain credulity, and it felt as though Jance rushed the ending to keep the book to manageable size. Then again, I was so taken with the story that I rushed to get to the ending, needing to know that folks would be all right! I look forward to reading the rest of the series. 
 A year ago, I was forced to read this book by my english teacher... At first, looking at the cover, (it was red with a picture of a girl) I had an impression that i would not enjoy reading it...   After a couple of days, i was surprised to see myself bringing the book everywhere I go... During break times, lunch, and spend 2 full hours reading it at home...  Reading this diary, made me picture how Anne had her teenage life.. It was really different from mine. Nothing beats how a 13 year old girl manage to live a life like a prisoner in the attic. No other friends to talk too... Same people she sees every single day... In a small place called the "Secret Annexe".   Can you imagine that that kind of life? That you have no idea if you can eat or not, if you should talk or remain silent for the whole day... or if you can still get out of that Annex and live a normal life again... Can you imagine??? But still, they remained hopeful until the last air they breathe...  For me, those people are the real heroes. They never gave up. They sacrificed and united. And best of all, their faith in God reamined strong.  This book influenced millions and millions of people from all over the world. This is a real story of a real world... And the fact that this happens too to so many people. Sometimes we ask, "Why do we need to repeat History?"   Read this book and you'll realize that this is different, worth it and remarkable... 
 As I struggled to live through a divorce that I did not want I tried to find books that would comfort me and make me feel like I was not alone.  This book did just that.  It is a wonderful read and brings hope when you feel all hope is lost.  I would recommend this to any woman who is going through a divorce, especially one that they do not want.  These four women made me feel that I can survive this and one day learn to live, laugh and love again 
 Featured are reproductions even of artworks which no longer exist, and Lippard's commentary is always to the point.  I don't dwell on the fact that Eva Hesse died young -- in fact, I'm not interested in the cult of  personality which in my view only obscures the works themselves.  But in at  least three directions Hesse has given me plenty to think about and purely  enjoy, and this book documents everything...  maybe it slights the drawings  a bit, but there's another book out there with nothing but drawings,  drawings galore.  The implications of what Hesse accomplished remain  "mindblowing."  Anyone who has only heard about her or seen one  or two works needs to see what they've missed 
 It's refreshing to see a Middle East settling which is not often. I highly appreciate this story. A good read 
 In Mamoru Oshii's outstanding Ghost in the Shell (1995), the director/writer gave himself little time, at less than 90 minutes, to explore the many questions he raised in that script.  With his long-awaited sequel, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, he succeeds in answering many of these questions whilst at the same time giving us many more to ponder, in a film that, though flawed, deserves a 5 star rating.  Rather like a Disney animation, the film can be viewed on more than one level by more than one audience.  On the surface it is a sumptuously-animated film in which a fairly conventional who-done-it plot unfolds; robots are murdering humans, and a crime specialist is brought in to solve the case.  Period.  We have already seen equivalent plots in films such as Blade Runner or I, Robot and this film has nothing new to add to the basic idea.  However Oshii's world is far more disturbing and complex below the surface.  He subverts the ending of the film which, could be taken as a triumph of good over evil.  However, when distinctions between robot and human become blurred the central notions of good and evil in the film fall down.  He pulls other tricks to undermine our assumptions about humanity; at one point the main cop character puts a coat over a robot to hide its nakedness; another time a robotic character philosophises over the meaning of existence, whilst chain-smoking.  It is in the director's treatment of the paradox of what it means to be human that the film's value lies, not the superficial plot.    Characterisation is a little scimpy (with the notable exception of the depiction of Oshii's own basset hound, which is drawn with clear devotion) but visually the film is stunning.  Oshii is one of the few directors able to practice the delicate art of inactivity on screen.  He is not scared to abandon the plot for minutes on end to luxuriate in, for example, an extended arial shot of a city, or to dwell on a completely motionless face whilst we register its owner's emotional state, or to allow his main characters, motionless on the screen for what seems like ages, to quote western philosophical and religious texts.  None of these scenes moves the plot forwards and yet the film would be immeasurably poorer without them.    Too many sequels to outstanding films try to provide glib answers to the issues raised in the original and most fail by this approach; examples such as 2010 and Matrix Reloaded spring to mind.  With this film Oshii has avoided this pitfall and given us a rare sequal, that takes the theme of the original and finds something fresh to say.     In summary, the film deserves a 5 star rating, but I think that it falls short of greatness.   
 This reprint embraces two of Powers' early novels under one cover: Skies Discrowned, his first novel set on a planet where space travel is ordinary and a man seeks to avenge his father; and An Epitaph In Rust, portraying an escapee from a monastery who is set loose in a changed Los Angeles. Both are excellent stories of changed worlds and different viewpoints 
   There are just some books that fill your heart with such joys and giggles that you remember them all of your life; this is one of them.  How many people do not know the phrase, Sam-I-am? or Green eggs and ham? Make a face.........but still you know you just gotta try it at least once in your life, you grab that food coloring, give a squirt, fry up that egg with your ham and you say, " Yeah! that's good!" And for some reason for the rest of your life you are one of perhaps thousands that were convinced by one little book that green eggs and ham really are okay! Great book! Great memory! 
 We had not seen this movie but liked her other books that had been made into movies so bought this one also. Enjoyed it very much 
 Mr. Stevens, the proper English butler, is one of the great characters of contemporary literature. His voice is so affecting, so real. The first time I read this novel, I returned to page one after reading the final page because I could not deny myself the painful pleasure of reading it again.  I've read it two or three times since.  It's more like dreaming than reading, really.  A masterpiece 
 I learned so much about Islamic art from this book and the different techniques that are applied and valued in eastern versus western art. Learning about 16th century Istanbul was fascinating and entertaining, especially because of Esther, the clothier. Wonderful mystery/romance and mini-history lesson in one. 
 The story of an innocent young woman who falls in love with a mysterious older man with a dark past is tried and true.  In the hands of Ms. Bronte, it acquires a depth of feeling and sincerity of emotion that raise the story type above the maudlin.  There may have been other gothic romances similar to "Jane Eyre" before this was written, and there have certainly been many after it, but none have been quite so wonderful.  Lord Byron may have supposedly invented the Byronic hero when he wrote about "Manfred", Mr. Tortured By A Troubled Past... but Bronte's Mr. Rochester is a perfection of the type.  He's sensitive, yet abrupt.  Demanding, yet tender.  Proud, yet remorseful.  Every time I read this book, I fall in love with him all over again.  Jane Eyre herself is an even more complex character than Mr. Rochester.  She's tough and stern, yet playful.  She has a firm moral center and does not hesitate to do what she believes is right, even when it hurts herself or those around her.  And by being true to herself and what she knows is right, she ultimately triumphs over a variety of people who might do her great injury (intentionally or not).  Again, literature has seen many sturdy, spunky heroines come and go, but Jane Eyre is a perfection of the type 
 not the type of books I usually read (poetry and all) and it took me quite a while to "get into it" but it was worth it. the story is multi-layered and interesting and the whole book is wonderfully written. Highly recommended.  
 I must admit, when I saw that Paris Hilton was the star of this movie, I wasn't sure if I should bother watching it, but after seeing it, I was glad I decided to go ahead and watch.  The story goes like this.  Tim (Patrick Kennedy) has invited several of his college friends, Emma (Rosie Fellner), Lucy (Vivienne Harvey), Jo (Paris Hilton), Tom (Lex Schrapnel), Paul (David Leitch), Pete (David Nicolle), Andy (Ben Peyton), Damien (James Schleginger), Linda (Maureen Turner), and Laura( Amelia Warner) to spend the weekend in his Scottish manor house in honor of his 21st birthday.  A major snowstorm has covered the house.    After getting re-aquainted with each other and settling into their rooms, the group gathers in the parlor for drinks.  Tom leaves to go to the restroom, but something strange happens to him; he sees his reflection in the mirror only to discover that his eyes are gone.  However, he snaps out of this and soon returns to normal.  Or does he?  Many of the guests soon decide to go to bed, all except Tom and Tim.  Tom is looking through the books in the library when he stumbles upon a volume about the history of the house.  The book speaks about a man named Murray, a Scottish patriot who had his eyes cut out during the English invasion.  The spirit of Murray is contained in the book, and soon, it is unleashed.  Once the spirit enters the body of a person, that person is turned into a murderer. When the original murderer is killed, the spirit moves itself into the body of the person who killed the original murderer and so on.  A vicious circle has been unleashed in Tim's house.  Tom is the first person infected with Murray's spirit.  Who will survive?  Will the chain be broken, or will everyone end up dead?  I found this movie to be very good.  True, Paris Hilton can't act, and thank goodness she didn't try to use a fake British accent.  But the rest of the cast are actually very good in their roles.  I thought the plot was well-conceived, and the tension among the characters is evident throughout the movie as they try to figure out who is carrying Murray's spirit within them.    I feel this movie is worth watching, not for Paris Hilton (she actually dies very early in the movie), but for the unique plot twists which occur throughout the film.  If you like a lot of twists and turns, then you should watch this movie 
 I bought & read this book & totally loved it. It really has you wanting to be closer to God. Tommy Tenney is an amazing author & spiritual man 
 Took me absolutely forever to read this book - months!  But I loved it and certainly learned a lot. Stewart is to be commended for pulling so much information together in a marvelously cohesive book.  Prints and photographs are terrific.  And for those who want more on the subject, and there is more, believe it or not, there is a black history calendar, a desk calendar, also chuck full of history and info.  
 I'm a great fan of autobiography.  Granted, often it is sanitized and self-serving, but there's nothing like hearing a person tell their own life, especially if the life is as important as this one.  Without a doubt,  Duke Ellington was the century's greatest American composer and bandleader;  the only ones who even come close to him (Aaron Copland, George Gershwin,  Cole Porter) had neither his longevity nor his variety.  And none of them  also maintained a working band through six decades!  I own almost every  recording ever released by Duke Ellington; his music has become indelibly  printed on my brain.  This book may not be the most accurate account of his  life (if you can handle a little armchair psychology, the Collier biography  is the best choice for that), but this is like sitting in a room hearing  Duke talk -- and play 
 Maybe I'm too sold on what's marketed as variety.  I agree with what other reviewers have said, that these are good bathouses and the instructions are easy to follow. I just wish there were a little more variety in terms of design.  The book, by the way, over and above the houses does have some reference information on bats including where to put the houses. That was helpful.  If you're into bats, and would like to make your own houses, this is the book I would recommend. 
 What a great book this is - I bought it for my daughter who is at an age where she has lots of questions - some easy to ask, some not. This book has provided a save place for those questions along with work sheets to get her "journaling". I have and will recommend this book to my friends with daughters this age (11+) 
 I am very satisfied with this product.  These are my first gloves with extended finger length, which I find now as a big plus especially when doing wrist curls.  Wrist wrap works great for me with weak wrists.  Padding is very good as well, without it interfering with normal hand fold.  I read some reviews commenting on how uncomfortably warm they would get when used; I personally have not felt it; what I do agree with is that taking gloves off is not easy. I found that pulling fingers out first is the less difficult way.  I actually wanted to buy the newer model which allows for machine wash, but Amazon did not have L size in stock.  These minor details do not demerit the 5 star rating though 
 This little book is packed solid with valuable perspective on church history by a master theologian.  The preface alone is worth the price of the book as it provides sound reasoning why a study of church history is important to 21st century Christians 
 I love this CD, it has all the great classic songs that everybody knows and loves. I don't really care for the newer stuff, like Alphabet Street. I got this album for the fun 80s tracks. It leaves me wanting more of his 80's work. I'm going to track down the album Purple Rain and 1999. If you want a good introduction to Prince, get this album, it rocks 
 though what I think of Casteneda is another story.  All about Brown said in that review being true, this was still a fascinating read with insight to a more humble, thoughtful and grounded spirituality then all that Casteneda psychedelic pretentiousness. Brown's own shortcomings are easily separated from the message, which is simply about living as one with the earth, without ego. 
 I ordered this book based on a recommendation of a fellow chemist in my organic chemistry classes.  Once I got it, it blew my mind.  I ordered it for my advanced organic chemistry class, and it's been extremely helpful.  I've taken it to entry-level organic chemistry classes and read it while the professor lectured.  Not only did I find everything he was talking about, but it was explained better.  If anyone seeks to better themselves in chemistry, or just have it as a reference guide, this book covers both 
 This was a wonderful Christmas gift, perfect condition, fast shipping!  Thank you!  : 
 If you enjoyed Jungle or Fast Food Nation, and/or are a nutrition/health enthusiast, this book is a must-read. It is fascinating, well-paced, reasonably comprehensive and enlightening about the history of obesity research and the current state. It balances scientific biographic accounts with social events/scenarios. Should help people show more sympathy towards larger people 
 We get a lot of requests for this book in the library here in West Yellowstone, Montana. Many of the locations that qualify as "paradise" are close by.  However, I would like to ask the author  to please consider updating this book, like one of  these other reviewers  has also requested 
 This book is a great guide through reDesigning a website. Great tools and good exemple 
 Quick read that's interesting and informative about the damage disfunctional families can do to their children, and how that impacts the adult lives of those children.    Iles has quickly become a favorite author of mine, with Turning Angel being the first book I read, and this being the second.  I look forward to reading his other works 
 If you're investigating this book, chances are you can benefit greatly from the information.  What harm can come from you feeling less shame in your life?  None.  And, believe me, if you act upon the information in this incredible book, your life will change.  You will feel less bound by shame.  You will feel more connected to love and to the people around you.  
 The title accurately explains the book. The book is scholarly and difficult to follow, but with enough patience and concentration it can be understood. Ongoing attacks on the doctrine of Limited Atonment can make one wonder about its validity until introduced to such superb treatment of those Biblical passages that have often been misused and misunderstood by evil, man-centered minds 
 Brava, Faith!  There is nothing more vulnerable than agreeing to record live--and the first few numbers of the recording do show a little of the artists nerves, but by the time she hits "Hard Way," Ms. Prince  hits an amazingly powerful pace that propels her through the rest of this  magnificent performance.  Settle down with a high-ball, and you'll feel  you're right there at Joe's Pub!  Marvelous, hilarious, touching--a must  for any fan of the Broadway performe 
 We loved this movie.  Watched it with our kids ages 11 and 15.  I highly recommend it.  We gave as a gift to several people that enjoy a good movie 
 There are two things that are apt to happen upon reading The Colorado Kid, the latest outing by legendary horror writer Stephen King.  In fact, there are apt to be more than a few things that happen after reading the author's latest yarn, ayuh, and a fascinating yarn it is.  King remains an underrated contemporary master of storytelling and if there is any question as to whether his talent has waned over the years after producing nearly 50 novels, including the unforgettable Carrie, The Shining, Cujo and The Stand, that query is properly answered here.  What is often forgotten about King, despite the fact that he has singlehandedly changed and saved the direction of contemporary horror, is that sans horror he is an excellent storyteller.  In The Colorado Kid, King lends his talents to a line of hard case crime pulp fiction novels issued recently by Dorchester Publishing, which include other authors such as Richard Aleas (Little Girl Lost), Max Phillips (Fade to Blonde) and Wade Miller (Touch of Evil).  They are softcover dime store novel sized books your father probably carried in his coat pocket, and are designed to look like such with their Orbik drawn covers featuring sultry sirens and suspicious looking men in overcoats.  Kid is the story of two old newspapermen from Maine who spend one afternoon telling their intern about a mystery involving a man who was found dead on a beach back in 1980.  Nearly twenty-six years later the men tell the story in relish, but the more they explain to the inquisitive intern the less she understands.  What baffles both the intern and the reader is that nothing makes sense, including why the man was on the beach, where he was from, what he was doing in Maine, how he got to a remote region of Maine as quickly as he did, and last but not least, was he murdered.  	  The audience is apt to be confounded as King teases and rivets the reader to such an intriguing tale, all the while egging them on to solve the mystery before the end of the book.  With King's talent for relaying New England dialogue, the tale comes off as comfortably as a fireside ghost story, and the reader is likely not to get enough in turning this case six ways to Sunday in order to solve it.  What is also apt to happen is that the reader is likely to take issue with how the author resolves the matter, but that's neither here nor there as the issue is the mystery itself. 	 King's protagonists, Dave and Vince, are old fogeys we've seen in previous works by this author, in particular The Storm of the Century, and his ingenue Stephanie is a variation on his previous heroines.  All the same this short novel is a gem and King as comfortable and reliable as a favorite pair of shoes, taking us on a journey through not only an intriguing mystery but also once again the way of life of the New Englander, who keep secrets to themselves, say the word fair as fay-yuh, and the word ayuh as if a variation on the words Oh, yeah! 
 If you are looking for a good overview on the ideas of simple living, try this book. Lacking sometimes indepth information it still is a very good overview and introduction in the concepts of simple living 
 Patricia A. McKillip's first-ever collection of short fiction is a winner, every bit as rewarding as her fine novels, better in some ways. It's a showcase of small gems from an author obviously just as comfortable and accomplished in the short form as in the long.  As in her best novels--OMBRIA IN SHADOW, SONG FOR THE BASILISK, ALPHABET OF THORN--McKillip's strength lies in creating both strong, attractive characters and a sense of atmosphere that draws the reader in. The beauty of these stories is the economy and pace at which these things are accomplished; while each piece completes it's arc in a completely satisfactory (and author-ly) way, there were several times I found myself wishing I was reading a novel, and that there would be more about these people and places forthcoming.   There was not a story that I didn't like, not a one I thought wasn't among the best fantasy fiction I have read this year. Some are so good, you have to wonder why McKillip doesn't get far more attention than she does, and what this says about the exposure and attention given to short fantasy in the market today.  Highly recommended. 
 Tired of the poor remakes released today that completely butcher the originals by comparison?  Tired of some unknown director putting his own personal twisted and butchering a classic film, throwing too many new elements into it?  Were you angered by the remake for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre?  Well then you will love this remake from 1990 of Night of the Living Dead!    With only one major change and several minor ones, this movie pretty much follows the original exactly.  Why was this movie done so well?  It was directed by none other than Tom Savini!  For those of you who don't know, Tom Savini is a legend in the special effects/gore/makeup department.  He's worked with George Romero before in Dawn of the Dead.  Tom Savini is a man who knows how to do things right and knows how things should be done.  This remake is an example of it.    While I don't consider it to be better than the original, its still is very entertaining and it never angered me.  It contains more gore but I was somewhat disappointed.  I felt that there wasn't enough gore, but that's probably because my favorite zombie film Dead Alive has spoiled me.  Anyways, the one major change is that Barbara quickly turns to a traumatized expendable into a heroine wielding a shotgun.  It works rather well.    If you enjoy the original and have seen all four of Romero's Dead films (or at least the original), then go ahead and buy this because the price is only Seven Bucks!!!  I doubt that a special edition will be released anytime soon because it's a remake, but its definitely worth the price which almost make s me want to give this five stars.  Holly Wood needs to compare the originals with the remakes so they can then realize either the right way to remake a movie or to just leave them alone all together.  Alright enough with this review; just go out and buy or rent it, you won't be disappointed.  Hoped this helped.   
 As usual, Clark's shoes are the best in style, comfort and price.  I buy as many pairs as possible 
 I loved this book, I couldn't put it down, but I like the whole Eve Duncan series 
 I have the gown too and ordered the PJ's from the direct website. They are the same great quality and the bottoms are so cute, I wear them all the time out of the house 
 Are you in management or do you want to be in management?  If the answer is yes, then this book is a must for your career.  The information here is extremely powerful and the authors did an outstanding job of making it simple to understand.  If you have ever wondered why senior management would not fund a project when the company is having a record profit month, Berman will explain why this maybe the best choice.  Throughout the very palatable training there are fascinating examples from the newspaper headlines (Enron/Worldcom/...) of what these headliners did with their finances that was wrong but was overlooked for some time.  This is not just what the definitions are but that they mean.    Okay if you have a Business Degree you should know this but you need your coworkers to know this to really help your company win.  You can try to educate each of your coworkers for years or just give them a copy of this book.  Your company/team will be more unified and focused.  I presented this book to my senior management requesting that the company buy a copy for every one in leadership. I am looking forward to rereading this book and I strongly recommend you buy this book.  Financial Intelligence will help our careers 
 I love this wipe warmer. My daughter loves the warm wipes. The warmer heats the wipes to about the same temp as her bath water. My wipes are staying moist. I am filling the warmer half full on the advise from a friend, so they don't dry out. So far no problems. I am getting another one for our downstairs changing area. The nightlight is nice because you can see how many wipes are left 
 finnagans wake is not comprehensible. it is not like reading or watching a film. Mr.Joyce spoke over a dozen languages fluently and this book is in English and french and Swahili and Italian and Latin, Greek AND mostly in his own language which is kindof like English. it is not understandable because some many words are derivative of others, the characters are always changing and the story is circular. It took a quarter of a lifetime to write and may well take that or longer to grasp. it also has many meanings depending on your perspective. One-review claims it is contains the recipe for making an atomic bomb, oh well. Campbell and Robinson have done just what they say- given the reader a skeleton- you supply the body and sole. A marvelous book to read and extremely helpful bones to knaw 
 This is the second Hawke Book I have read.  The first was just titled Hawke.  Both are excellent, fun reads. Some earlier reviews criticize his writing ability.  I couldn't disagree more with these earlier reviews.  I love Bell's Prose. I have just ordered his newest Hawke Novel, Pirate.  Can not wait to get started. 
 Clive Barker leaves one good horror series and starts another good one. Candy is a great horror movie with loads or gore and violence. The plot is good and we get to learn about Candyman and what he is like. This does deserve 5/5 stars, Tony Todd was terrific. 
 Singer Paul Rodgers in his prime was arguably the best voice ever in rock. At present he is still pretty damn good. The band was productive in a time when men were not afraid to be men and rock and the keep it  simple yet up tempo power rock style is evident in the songs.  Bands today too often forget to save the drama for high school drama  class. There is too much fluff and not enough raw power and power chord structure. Bad Co. never forgot the pleasure of having a few drinks, turning the amp up to 11 and just letting the rock do the talking. The combination of a solid Bad Co. bottom end, a great drummer and Rodgers pool hall guy enthusiasm just plain works. 
 It's been noted that this sole 1968 record by the short-lived UK psych band was one of the best lp's of that era as well as it's always been highly under-rated.I would tend to agree with that opinion.This reissue of the Tomorrow record is really quite nice,with the lp's eleven tracks along with twelve bonus tunes tagged on for good measure.A total of 23 songs.Wow!A truly great psychedelic release to own.The disc's gems are easy to spot,like "My White Bicycle"(the same tune Nazareth opens some of their gigs with),the timeless "Revolution","Three Jolly Little Dwarfs" and "Hallucinations".Most of you probably,of course know about Tomorrow's line-up.That it included guitarist Steve Howe(before he joined Yes),heart-throb Keith West on vocals and drummer Twink before he joined up with the Pink Fairies.Sort of a historic record,one COULD say.The extra tunes are about as good as the actual lp.Sort of dug "Why" and the mono version of the previously mentioned "Revolution" as well as the three cuts by The Aquarian Age,a side project by Twink and the band's bassist,Junior.Thought the spoken word track,skit,whatever... "Good Wizard Meets Naughty Wizard" was a gas.To end things,there are four decent Keith West solo tracks.Comes with a beautifully-designed 12-page booklet with PLENTY of cool photos,artwork and info.A must have 
 Although Rusty Day the original lead singer for Cactus has passed away the remaining members and new addition have put out a very good C D. The music has their trademark hard edge and rocks out!!!I do not think you will be disappointed and I like the fact that they did not ressurect any of the previous material as some groups do on reunion efforts...the new material stands up 
 If you're looking for basic down to earth versions of the Pioneers most popular songs this CD is for you.  A delightful simplicity in the playing  here breathes fresh life into songs we might have heard too many times.   'I'm An Old Cowhand' with Roy on lead vocal and fine fiddling by Hugh Farr,  interestingly enough, has a 'One More Ride' style yodel harmony at the end,  and is that Lloyd Perryman or Pat Brady slappin' that bass?  Great Stuff!   For a Pioneer nut like myself the spartan 'Tumbling Tumbleweeds' on this CD  is worth the price of admission, and the haunting eerie mood of 'Blue  Prairie' couldn't be improved upon.  'A Melody From The Sky' and 'Blue  Bonnet Girl' are both tender and masterful, while the plaintive 'Empty  Saddles' never sounded better.  'Over The Santa Fe Trail' is the anomaly  here, it almost sounds like an experiment in weirdness, but the strange  phrasing and off-key sound make it something of a conversation piece, I'm  wondering if the recording might be off-speed.  I think 'Cool Water' is one  of the best songs ever written, maybe the definitive example of Bob Nolan's  poetic genius, and this take is very nice, although I think I slightly  prefer the version on 'The RCA Victor Years Vol. 1' (RCA CD (9744-2).   According to an old friend of Bob Nolan's, 'Cool Water' was written by Bob  back in the '30s, while he and his mule 'Dan' were walking the Mojave  Desert on a trek from his cabin here in Big Bear.  That story gives a  wonderful vignette of Bob talking to his mule ("Keep'a movin' Dan,  don't you listen to him Dan, he's a devil not a man, and he spreads the  burnin' sand with water.  Dan can you see that big green tree, where the  water's runnin' free, and it's waitin' there for me and you."), as  they trudged toward the cool wet shade of the Mojave Narrows almost 70  years ago.  Because MCA chose not to include any notes with this release,  the oddness of 'Santa Fe Trail', and somewhat uneven sound quality, I  considered giving it a 4-star rating, but after many listenings, the  overall content, and the sweet rarity of these selected versions begged 5  stars.  A very nice collection 
 I'm not usually a fan of books like this, but it was so quick and easy to read, and the concept was so well thought out and laid out... I didn't feel like the authors were "dumming it down" for me. 
 Paul Monette carries the reader with him through his life so smoothly you'd think he was actually happy about writing about his life.  The best book I've read in a long time, Monette's straight-to-the-point, no holds, zero restraint, brutal honesty really tugs at the hearts of those who read his wonderfully written prose.  It's what we've all felt [in the gay community] but could never put in words.  No writer ever better deserved the National Book Award than he.

Its engaging style and informative  nature will make it hard to put down.It'll help you spot the best quality  pieces and recognize those that have been tampered with. For the new  collector buying from auctions or dealers, this book is priceless. It'll  help you spot the best quality pieces and recognize those that have been  'restored'. If you want to really know what your colllecting, get this book  first 
 PC Hardware Buyer's Guide is written by the authors of Building the Perfect PC.  It provides more up-to-date recommendations on available hardware.  The fold-out guide that is part of the back cover is a very useful quick reference.  It is a nice companion to Building the Perfect PC 
 A fantastic record.  The minimal beauty of Galaxie 500, both lyrically and musically, leaves you addicted and craving more by the end.  One of my all-time favorite albums 
 This is the most precious book for heart healing and understanding available.  It makes you cry and laugh and understand the little things. Thanks 
 It's one of Seuss's later works, written in the 1980s. It presents, in kid-friendly idiom, the inane causes of war. Although presented as silliness, the conflict rapidly escalates through successively goofier armaments. The end shows the entire populace descending into underground shelters with the Big-Boy Boomeroo about to be launched by both sides at once.   The presentation is Seussish and silly, a real contrast to his hawkish WWII editorial cartoons. Still, it's grimly familiar to anyone who lived in the 1950s and 60s. Bomb shelters and the threat of mutually assured destruction were daily realities then, and their memory is still sharp. Maybe, if kids see insanity early enough, they'll learn to avoid it. At worst, they'll have yet another of Seuss's charming stories behind them.  //wiredweir 
 This book is the apotheosis of freedom. Friedman should be studied not only by economists but also by politicians. Definitely a must 
 I love every book Jeanne Ray writes...I love that she centers her stories around middle aged, "normal" people who are just trying to lead a decent life and things get crazy all around them...it is so realistic in the most positive ways.  I love that situations are worked through with love and good intentions, no matter how crazy things get...that is so spot-on for how I try to deal with life that it gives me hope it can actually be done.  I love this book! You can't go wrong with any of her books, but this and "Eat Cake" are my very favorites 
 I think the Bay City Rollers were one of the most underated groups of their time! They wrote a lot of their own material, played all the instruments, and the vocal harmonies were great! Can't wait for their new  album! Keep On Rollin' 
 I grew up in Connecticut, so all my life on the anniversary of the Circus Fire, articles would appear in the local newspaper but never seemed to tell the whole story of what happened afterwards in the lives of those who were touched by this tragedy.  Stewart O'Nan does a fantastic job of putting together many of the pieces of this disaster and does so in an interesting and informative way.  The subject of the Circus Fire was always thought-provoking, as my dad had a chance to attend the circus that day and did not go . . . .  I may never have existed if he had made the trip 
 If you are wanting to learning the principles of investing computer crime then this book is a must 
 The title of this book explains exactly the content of it.  It deliveres what it promises 
 Good collection of Moby's music, the videos really show his creative and funny side.  Some of the videos are bizarre cartoons, like the one where Moby as the man in the moon visits a Louisiana swamp and dances with an alien girl 
 Going into Chris Maraffi's Character Animation course at Full Sail, I was apprehensive about organic modeling and rigging. This book made a great companion during the experience of learning how to model bipedal characters and create their rigs. It provides a great spectrum of information on the subject, and makes a great addition to anyone's tech library. A must have for your tool kit 
 At last!  A Latin Dictionary with print big enough to read using bifocals!!!  The scholarship of this work is unquestioned, as is its comprehensive character.  No more looking in vain for some elusive term.  Others have commented fully on the substantive wonders of this magnificent dictionary.  I write only to add that this work is very accessible--even to those of us with tired old eyes.  I know it is costly, but it is well worth the price 
  I consider "The War of the Worlds" to be one of the top five science fiction stories of all time. It has been the model for two excellent movies and the driving force behind one of the greatest unintentional hoaxes of all time. The original story is set in England at around 1900 and that has not been altered in this story.   Evans does an excellent job in altering the language to fit current usage while maintaining the integrity of the original story. The abridgment retains all of the excitement of the story and the presentation is suitable for the target level of reader. The illustrations capture the action; I was particularly struck with the detail of the facial expressions.  
 Sharon Smith's Subterranean Fire: A History of Working-Class Radicalism in the United States is a critical history of the U.S. labor movement and workers' resistance from the nineteenth century to the present day. From class struggle, to the uphill battle for industrial unions, to the harsh retaliation of employers, to the dismantling of the New Deal labor laws by Neoliberal presidents and the rise of the Neocons, Subterranean Fire explores a fierce battle on both sides for power, wealth, and legitimacy. A very heavily researched history that not only chronicles worker efforts to fight back, but also warns against the uncertain future that excessive compliance can and might bring, Subterranean Fire is informative reading, especially for students of the American labor movement. 
 into the twilight zone a box set too own too add too your collection. go on and buy it. tks.  great fun for the whole family, tks 
 I write this as a Louis Armstrong fan. I respect Duke Ellington, but I haven't heard nearly as much of his output as I have of Louis Armstrong's. My judgment is more about Satchmo's performance here than about Ellington's. I consider this an example of Armstrong showing a musical colleague how much he cares about all music. At this point in Armstrong's career he had committed most of his repertoire to Long-Playing vinyl. It's easy to forget that, in 1961, many of the classic 78s of the jazz era had still not been transferred to LP, and it is easy to forget that such transfers were not necessarily cleaned up for playback. This is my roundabout way of saying that, in re-recording much of his own material, Armstrong, throughout the fifties, was playing music he'd played since the twenties. He and the All-Stars, his small combo founded in the forties, were well attuned to each other and waxed some of the greatest performances of Armstrong's career, live or in the studio. But Armstrong had only been recorded with Ellington very rarely previously. I am not certain, but I think there are literally a couple of songs he and Ellington played live on the air in the late 1930s, and I wouldn't be very surprised if they played once or twice without being recorded at other times. But they'd never really sat down and worked out a set until 1961, when they were both in New York at the same time and had the opportunity. The songs on this album were not songs Armstrong played in his stage shows and he didn't make records of them. But he was not caught short here. He knew this material, either because he learned it for this project or because he'd been listening to this music for years, and he understood it. The marvelous thing is he clearly cared for it. Armstrong sets aside his personality for THE GREAT SUMMIT, or, more to the point, he set aside everybody else's expectations and interprets the lyrics in all their somber beauty. His trumpet is earnest here. His trumpet is always full-bodied, but on this project, Louis Armstrong is not, if you will, playing the showman, but expressing, through his trumpet, the music of another genius. It may be the most giving performance of his career. And that's saying a lot, given that his career is full of high peaks. I sometimes put this CD on when I go to bed at night. It sounds like New York City. There's a breeze, some laughter in the air, and cameraderie. Two musical innovators commenting on what they see, for all to hear 
 This book lets you in all the aspects of every parrot in the world.  In this book you can find everything out on your favorite bird.  You can also learn about when they breed,  where they are from, etc..  "Parrots of the World," is an excellent book for the parrot enthusiast.  I personally recommend this book to everyone because you can learn absolutlely everything with this boo 
 Full disclosure:  I am adult reader who is a fan of "pre-teen" literature.  While the Potter series satisfies with plot, action and descriptive prose, this one satisfies at a deeper level.  It has a philosophical/theological angle that is thought provoking, and while some might say anti-church I would say more like anti-authority. There are still plenty of spiritual ideas to ponder 
 I read this book to my niece and nephew and they wanted me to read it over again rather than switching to a new book. It passes the "Uncle test" 
 When you think of crime fiction you think of cities and the writers who depict them in their books; Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, Walter Mosley-Los Angeles...Carl Hiassen-South Florida...Lawrence Block-New York....Ed McBain-a city like New York and so on. No writer does Washington DC like George Pelecanos.  He grew up there. He knows those gritty streets. This new book is a real departure for the author. Its the story of 3 cops who are trying to solve an ancient crime. one retired, one fired, the last, a veteran cop.. a family man. Years ago somebody was killing children and leaving their bodies near community gardens. Then it stopped. The three cops who were on the original cases went their separate ways.  Then it starts happening again. Pelecanos crafts a noir thriller. Well worth the read 
 Clocking in at a spare 31:36, this CD collects sixteen instrumental cuts from a small selection of Doc's output during these 25 years. This collection is a good starting point for newcomers to Doc's fine guitar (and banjo) playing, but for the avid fan it provides only highlights of his career and little more. We get a taste of flat picking, and a taste of finger picking, with a little banjo playing thrown in on the side. Still, it's hard to complain about an artist who is truly a national treasure, and whose picking is unsurpassed. It's just so good one wishes that they had included much, much more 
 I recently bought this toy for my daughter, who is, by the way, in the age range listed on the toy (8-12) and she loves it.  I didn't find anything offensive about the songs she is already hearing on the radio on almost a daily basis.  I have explained to my children that it is not appropriate to speak that way to people, and I've never had a problem.  My 5 year old even knows the difference between songs and conversation.  When the two of them play together, they listen to music that is appropriate for both.  I think its a very cute toy and fun for everyone when proper parenting is used 
 I don't mean not very good, I mean not as good as people say it is. I really don't understand why people think Zahn is so brilliant.   Zahn is an excellent storyteller, but honestly, he isn't a very good writer. The trilogy is plagued by gratuitous references back to events in the movies. "Luke reaches for his lightsaber, and recalls when he was hung upside down in a wampa cave on Hoth and had to use the Force to get his lightsaber from the snow." It's not necessary, and I groaned every time Zahn did it. James Luceno knows how to make appropriate and timely references. Zahn fails.  I personally liked the specific technical jargon, but I'm surprised that most other people did, too.   The story, though, what can I say? It's a good story. Grand Admiral Thrawn is the most awesome person I know. It was genuinely hard to be happy seeing the empire defeated this time around. I hated C'Boath, but then again, you'te supposed to.  The noghri are a fascinating creation and their story is followed all the way through.   Everyone we know from the movies are there with a role, and act appropriately, although you never get the feeling that you've learned anything more about any existing character. New characters, like Mara Jade and Talon Kaarde, are superb additions to the saga. Creating characters really is Zahn's strongest point, I feel.   The books fall victim of being written before the prequels, and being early EU novels in general but that is no one's fault, and the "errors" are reconciled easily enough.  As a trilogy, it is consistent and drives towards a consistent goal throughout.   One other thing about the story, and I think this is why so many people adore these books more than I think they deserve, is that it is epic. I have yet to read another Star Wars book or series that approaches the expanse and import of this trilogy. It really concerns a huge part of the Star Wars timeline, and as a story matches the significance of the movies themselves, unlike any other books. That doesn't make these books the best books, most interesting, or best written, but I think it is that epic feeling that makes this series so popular, despite being unspectacular in several ways. 
 Iaido Sword : Kamimoto-Ha Techniques of Muso Shinden Ryu is in itself a work of art.  In less than 250 pages it covers all aspects of Iaido ; historical, philosophical, the etiquette, description and care of the sword and clothing, the different stances and cuts, warm-up exercises, a glossary, references. The 12 katas of the Zen Nihon Kendo Renmei Iai (SeiTei Iai) and the 4 series of the Muso Shinden Ryu are precisely described in the text and abundantly illustrated with clear photos and graphics as are all the corresponding bunkais.  Even if you are a practitionner of another style of Iaido this is a must. A precious learning and teaching tool.  The best all around manual on Iaido yet 
 All the great reviews written previously say it all - Anne of Green Gables the movie is a timeless classic of the classic novel. I've been watching this movie since I've been a child, and I still watch it as an adult. A movie like this doesn't need "special features" for it to be attractive as a DVD(Although the commentary is great!). Just the fact that no matter how long I keep this and how often I watch this movie, it won't change like VHS does. 
 Elizabeth is a wandering free-spirited college student of the mid-1960's.  Though she does not wish to influence anyone, her influence is in fact enormous.  Hers is the gift of making people want to live, as though their lives were actually turned back to a past point in time when they were younger, with a natural desire to persevere.  When she accidentally convinces her employer's troubled son to commit suicide, she herself gives up on life, as though she finally understood that the past cannot be turned back.  At last, a call for her help convinces her to take command of the uncertain future.  A heartbreaker, and enthralling 
 It starts with that riff: A simple, frill-free run played on a single guitar string: Dun. Dun-da-da-da-DUN-dum... Over and over again until it beats itself into your brain, encodes itself in your DNA. And then in comes Jack White's voice, a scratchy, high pitched, throaty whisper, soaking in attitude, his vocal chords dripping piss and viniger. "I'm gonna fight 'em off," he snarles. "A Seven Nation Army couldn't hold me back." And then there's Meg's drumming, a simple thing of pure jackhammer intensity. She sounds like a drum machine that runs on human blood, pounding one simple beat into your mind. The rythem becomes your heartbeat. And that riff simply won't quit. It implants itself in your skull, becomes attached to the walls of your arteries. And Meg is making your heart beat. The Stripes have taken over. Thus, "Seven Nation Army," the first track off of Jack and Meg's fourth album, is a fist pumping, paranoid, anthemic rock and roll masterpiece. And by no means is it the only good song here: "Black Math," with its suicidal two-chord feedback barage and air-raiding drum-attack, is an all-out howler. "The Hardest Button To Button" matches the leering paranoia of the opening track, with its thudding rhythem and twisted lyrics. "I've got a backyard/ with nothing in it/ except a stick/ a dog/ and a box with something in it," spits Jack. "Ball and Biscuit" is an all-out raver, a blues rocker dripping with sexuality and machismo. On the gentler side of things, "In the Cold Cold Night" is a smokey, sensual vocal showcase from Meg. "You've Got Her in your Pocket" is a gentle accoustic number with a truly soulful vocal from Jack. "I Want to be the Boy" is a surprisingly touching celebration of childhood innocence. Here, Jack takes on the persona of a boy who has a crush on his friend's mother. "Well nothing I come up with seems to work/ It feels like everything I say is a lie/ And never have I felt like such a jerk/ I'm afraid to even open my eyes/ Because I really don't want her to judge me/ I want her to really know who I am/ And the, and only then will she love me/ Well at least that was the plan," intones jack in one of the finest articulations of young love ever comitted to tape.  Spastic Rock and Roll, sneering blues, and whispering, soft spoken ballads abound on Elephant, one of the best rock albums to come out after 2000. Buy it now and play it loud 
 wow this movie blew me away, i saw it with a mind set that i was gonna hate but i didnt it was really good, and it had some comedy in it as well. now there are a few part that are a little cheap but its a fine damn movie. besides what other movie has a giant bunny 
 As other reviewers have noted, this is a truly great soundtrack. Yes, its completely over-the-top, but nobody could listen to the first few tracks and think, "How boring." As the music swells in the opening credits music, the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, and they never go back down until the CD has finished!  If you liked this movie, or you are a fan of the fantasy genre, then you will certainly like this CD. Glorious, tacky, over-the-top fun 
 I particularly like the ease of gently inverting and coming up again with the help of the angled hand rails.  I feel safe with the stop strap so the table will not invert beyond a comfortable position.  The ankle locking bar and straps are a snap and comfortable too 
 I have a definite attachment to this book.  Of all the coming of age novels I've read, this is the only one set in the very same county where I actually came of age.  (The book is set in "Mendoza", California - to those who know the area, obviously Martinez.) The book is well observed; in the very first paragraphs she gives a response to the chestnut that California has no seasonal weather which is exactly right.  So even though I grew up in another generation born long after Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima, another gender, and a town that was a suburb set between other suburbs rather than a small town set between hills, it was easy for me to identify with Suze, the narrator of this novel.  The story starts when Suze is ten, when the distant war first impacts her through her mother's response to the invasion of Denmark, where she has relatives, running through to her teen years shortly after the war.  It ends just after the war, with Suze ready to grow out of her adolescent crush on an older college student, an exiled German Jew named Egon.  In between, the story of the trivial adventures of teenage cliques that seem so momentous and the events far away that really are, each shaping Suze's life, is nicely told.  This rather short novel is largely gentle and uneventful, a skillfully built contrast to the unimaginably violent backdrop.  The characters are beautifully realized and the vignettes, even such ordinary things as teen girls discussing their boyfriends or the current fashions in music, are written with a mastery that makes them more memorable than they might seem 
 Wow - I don't understand some of the weak reviews.  Agreed - this isn't Car Wheels....but do you really want her to continue to crank out the same album repeatedly?  This is not a "feel good" CD - rather a haunting one.  Her song "Lonely Girls" has very few words - but paints a vivdly bleak picture.  I shed a soft tear during the first listen because it was a zinger for someone I know.  "Bus to Baton Rouge" puts me right in that oppressive house she describes.  And "I Envy the Wind"....well, to me pure poetry.  If you take the time to "feel" this CD - you will be greatly rewarded.  This is a soul-stirring compilation 
 I was one of the millions that watched and supported PTL. Needless to say, I was devestated by the journalism during the time of its fall and demise.Thank you for a book that draws back the curtain and exposes what really happened to Jim Bakker and PTL. This allows you to intelligently discuss the rivalry and hypocrisy that fuels television Christianity. Graphic and well researched, we learn straying from the pure and authentic teachings of Christ Jesus, reveals the ugliness of a defiled heart, stains the banner of TRUTH, shipwreck pure motives and litters the lives of the sincere. A MUST READ for anyone desiring excellence in ministry and who dare be exposed to what happens behind the cameras in most television ministries 
 I read these books a long time ago when I was in a different stage of my own life. The review I make here is thus not based on an up-to- date fresh reading but on the impressions that have remained with me in time. The first is the beauty and sensuality of the language , a kind of poetic richness which for many readers it seems is falsely lush but once struck me as true. Secondly, the exotic and mysterious world, the whole way Durrell succeeds in creating the atmosphere of a place. This also moved me and reminded me too of the way Camus succeeds in creating a feeling of Oran in the Plague. Durrell's Alexandria was so different from any world I had known that this mysterious quality was extremely strong for me. Thirdly, and this seemed especially problematic and puzzling to me then while perhaps now years later it is more familiar and yet still morally problematic. It is what might be called ' the 'mature and sophisticated approach to love'. When I read these book I very much had in mind a clear and simple model as ideal of love( I still do) as one man loves one woman and is loved by her in return. Here ' love- means something different , with feelings being broken up and directed to more than one person, with their being lack of mutuality in love. Certain aspects of this more mature world  remain somehow strange and morally discomfiting to me. Durrell's multiple perspectives , his retelling a story in more than one way, his seeing characters from a variety of viewpoints have it seems to me their corollary in Faulkner and Joyce. However Durrell's characters seem to me less ' solid' somehow and less substantial than Faulkner's or Joyce's. I must also say that while at certain points in the long reading there is a strong desire to know what happens next, and what will turn out with the characters- at some other point it becomes clear that their histories their actual 'fates' are not really the important thing for Durrell. He is painting a picture and the picture in words he is painting shifts its shape and form as it goes on and it will never even when the last word is written take on a final shape or form. The characters are elements in the picture and seem to dissolve as if too their final reality is as part of a landscape. Durrell I believe talks at some point about some kind of new four- dimensional Einsteinian picture of human character and that picture seems to leave no place for old time three- dimensional character.  All in all there remains a me a vague sense of a strange world somehow distant and appealing , and poetically rich but forever remote .  Is this great literature? It seems to me that it might be. But I don't really know. Is it interesting writing and a way of seeing things extremely new for me and I believe for most readers? Definitely yes. Is this book for everybody? I don't think so, but many can enjoy it . Would I spend again all the hours I spent once reading it?  I don't think so -which of course does not mean that other reader should not 
 Man, where has this guy been. I hadn't heard about him until recently when his CD was being reviewed on gospelflava.com. They said he did some work with Kirk Franklin back in the day, so I made it my mandate to check him out. About 2 weeks later, I got his CD as a Christmas gift! And I haven't been able to put this CD down since!!  From the start this CD is a smash. The first 3 songs, "That Place", "I Can", and "Set Me Free", instantly became my favourite songs on the CD. After those songs, the songs are great but not like those 1st three. The beginning of "Set Me Free" also had a kind of Tye Tribbett feel to it, so I really liked that one.  There are so many leaders with chorales/choirs coming out these days it's so hard to keep up: Brent Jones & TP Mobb, Natalie Wilson & SOP, Israel & New Breed, Tye Tribbett & GA are pretty much the best of the bunch. But now you can add a new addition to that group. Myron Butler & Levi are definitely gospel excellence and don't disappoint with this CD. It was well worth the wait.  Kingdom Blessings...  'Dr 
 I bought this CD when I was 4 months pregnant with my first baby, Irene. From that time on, every single day, I would religiously listen to the music and let my baby listen to it, too(through earphones taped to my tummy.) Now that Irene is 4 months old, we both still listen to it frequently, and her response to the music is as if she knows the songs by heart! I believe it has also made my child more attentive and intelligent as a baby, even as a newborn. I love this CD, and will treasure it as one best purchases I made for my daughter and for myself 
 This book was so cool. The characters were all very realistic. It talked about the revolutionary war. All in all this book was smokin 
 This is a classic album no doubt.  One of my favs of all time.  I remember when this came out, I used to just listen to this CD over and over again... listening to Prince Po and Pharoahe's rhymes as I'd write.  It boggled my mind and made me a better writer.  Dope beats & rhymes, can't go wrong 
 This game is so much fun! It is the best trivia game I have ever played. Much better that the Trivial Pursuit, I mean, who really wants to answer questions about the making of the movies! This game is all about the books, its questions really get you thinking! Some of them are easy, but others are pretty hard. Still, I have read the books many times, and I feel that if you have read them at least twice you can do pretty good 
 As a dynamic soundtrack collector, I must say that Batman Begins is one of my all time favorite scores. With the combination of Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, how could anything go wrong? The score is dark, scary, beautiful, and full of action all at the same time. It has awesome synthetic base added to some songs which I happen to love very much.  IT SHOULD BE UP FOR SCORE OF THE YEAR, THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF HOW GOOD IT IS. WHEN I SAW THE LIST AND THIS WAS NOT ON IT I YELLED AND CURSED THE OSCAR IDIOTS. THEN I GLANCED DOWN TO NOTICE THAT NEITHER KING KONG, STAR WARS, BATMAN BEGINS, HARRY POTTER, NOR THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA WAS ON IT. I AM UTTERY AMAZED AT THE OSCAR FAILURE THIS YEAR.  I HOPE YOU BUY AND ENJOY THIS SCORE AS I KNOW YOU WIL 
 Paul Simon had wowed the world when he and his singing partner, Art Garfunkel, released a series of successful albums as the folk-singing duo Simon and Garfunkel.  This includes the soundtrack to 1967 Best Picture Oscar Nominee 'The Graduate.' After splitting with Garfunkel in 1970 to pursue a solo career, Simon worked solo for 16 years before finally coming out with a legendary hit album, the 1986 'Graceland.'  For 'Gracedland,' Simon put together a big African-style band, and they provide a big professional sound that helps paint the album.  The foundation of the album is Simon's songwriting, including fresh songs like "Graceland," "The Boy In the Bubble," "Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes," and "You Can Call Me Al" - a good helping of hits.   The other songs on the album are digestible and fill out the exotic Graceland theme. On the cusp of a concept album, 'Graceland' introduced world music into the American popular music scene. Simon, already an established folk-rock star, pursued his vision of bringing African and world elements into American pop music.  As a solo artist, Simon achieved a different sound than Simon and Garfunkel.  By experimenting with band layout and gaining experience as a solo artist, Simon created something he would not have been able to create with Garfunkel. This album is a hallmark album of the 1980's that marks the convergence of world, popular, folk, country, gospel and gospel tinges of music.  'Graceland' remains one of Simon's best and most influential albums and helps explain why comedian Steve Martin called Paul Simon (along with Randy Newman) "the greatest living American songwriter. 
 Wow, what a great book!  My kids love it.  It is set up as a series of activities that begin with a question followed by an experiment that answers the question.  Questions such as "How do you peel a raw egg?", "Does air take up space?" and "Why can't I taste medicine when I plug my nose?" are all examples of questions posed in the book.  The fun is in the experiment that answers the question.  I think I counted something like 30 different experiments from 5 main science areas (biology, chemistry, physics, planet earth, and the human body).  Following each area is a "science fair project" for the kids to use at the next science fair at school!  What a great resource it will be for our family in the years to come.  All in all a great book at a great price 
 Dr. Seuss magically takes readers on an adventure of imagination and thinking.  His nonsense words and rhyme scheme keep a reader's interest at any age level 
 Good book that captures the Trojan football history.  The author has covered Trojan football for newspapers for years. I have always enjoyed his newspaper articles.  The book captures a lot of those stories and USC history. USC is a very interesting football program for many years. They have had many ups and downs over the years and the author does a good job telling the stories.  It is always understood that once a Trojan you are a Trojan for life.  It is a great University that shines in many thing besides football.  Book is a good read 
   I found this blood pressure meter easy to use and quite accurate when checked against my doctors readings.  Keeping the readings in memory made it very easy to keep my doctor inform of the results.  The size of the cuff is very important, so be sure to order the right size for your arm as the wrong size will give inaccurate results.  This is true in the doctors office also.  My blood pressure dropped several points in the doctors office, on his machine, just by changing the size of the cuff.    This is an excellent monitor - I couldn't be happier with it.  It is nice to be able to use it with batteries too.  
 I have two Omron prroducts. the heart rate monitor and a blood pressure untit.  Both have been very satisfactory products 
 As always, this Sidney Sheldon book was excellent.  He is such an amazing writer 
 Fed up with the passive measures of achievement we have been using (which were a whole lot better than the NONE we used to use), I bought about a dozen books on the subject. I started with this one first because it is  thin, well organized, easy to read and, even though it is not sufficiently  oriented to manufacturing firms to completely satisfy my interests, gives  enough examples to stimulate development of measures specifically  applicable to my Company. I also liked the discussion of corporate mission,  corporate vision, key success factors and the development of indicators and  goals which address these factors 
 Please, please do not pass over the other fine stories in GO DOWN, MOSES and go straight to "The Bear." This gem means much more when illuminated by the other parts of the text, and only by reading the entire book can you fully understand the meaning of Ike's repudiation of the McCaslin land. I recently completed a Faulkner course, and of all of his "genius" novels--"As I Lay Dying," "Light in August," "Go Down, Moses," "The Sound and the Fury," and "Absalom! Absalom!"--I believe that this one has the strongest emotional core. Read the whole thing; your experience will be much richer 
 It is "my bad" that I haven't caught up with J.A. Jance before now. Tucson is my second home and this author had not crossed my radar screen until my wife gave me this book for my birthday. I am ordering all the sequels as this is very good writing and needs to be supported. It talks to you as you read it so if you are into this genre, go for it. It is "really good stuff. 
 Pigs, Politicians,Chickens, sheep, all have a good goin' over by the Bax.  Shows the true "Attitude" of a workin' cowpuncher, and an example of how someone can get their tie re-arranged 
 I really love this gift set..you will smell sooo yummy!!  At first when I put it on it smelled so familiar, then my husband and I decided it reminds us of sweet cotton candy..we love it!  Although now I am getting hooked on Amazing Grace...also a familiar, clean, fresh, scent. Philosophy is great 
 Dual is the best. I loved it I suggest buying or renting this just to watch it. I gave this a 5 out of 5 because I thought that this was funny and series. Please watch it 
 This book offers much to anyone interested in cultivating a grateful outlook in life through reflection. Inspiring quotes, poetry and practical exercises complement the text, which describes Naikan's Japanese roots, but is presented in a Westerner-friendly way. There's even a little section on Benjamin Franklin's efforts at self-reflection. The book's format lends itself to dipping in for a quick tidbit as well as a cover-to-cover read. Readers may find themselves thanking their socks for keeping them warm, or enjoying a pizza with mindful attention. Very inspiring 
 I'm considering auditioning for a local rendition of this play, so was a bit concerned when I read a previous very negative review.  I just want to point out that this play was nominated for a Pulitzer prize and was an Off-Broadway hit.  Search the web for the reviews of it in the New York Times and the Washington Post.  It sounds as if it's an extraordinary play and I'm just going to discount the words of the person who read it and disliked it in 2003 
 This is outstanding information - makes a huge difference in my outlook on nutrition for myself and my family 
 Ignore the dumb title because this book provides some very important context in a time of flag-waving empty-headedness.  The author does draw many conclusions of his own, but mostly he simply corrals the best investigative reporting (much of it from major media sources), public testimony, and government documents into a coherent picture of why things went down as they did.  The historical and political backstory provided is crucial to dispelling the apalling myth that we were attacked out of the blue and nothing could be done about it.  The tone is incredulous and even-handed rather partisan or ideological.  The facts presented in this book rocked me to my very core and left me mad as hell.  (Compare the facts in this book to the 9-11 Commission Report and decide for yourself. 
 Just like the author of this biography, I had read MFK Fisher's books and wondered who she was. Who were the men in her life? How did she learn to write the way she did? This book has all the answers and then some.  If you are interested in food history, cooking, family life or travel, this book will please you. MFK Fisher was a fascinating, exasperating person who had a fabulously interesting life with sojourns in France, mysterious love affairs and a zillion excellent meals.  The author does a wonderful job of never, ever boring the reader. I kept asking myself: How could she plug ahead through so much research, so many years, never rushing, never overdoing the details, getting it all just right? But she did it somehow and for that I admire her 
 Personally, I quite enjoy reading Medical Thrillers and would say that Contagion was a fun read. The plot and the characters are well built and the story moves on an interesting pace. Although at times I got a little lost due to the Medical Jargons and reference to specific bacteria, I never lost track of the plot and enjoyed the book from front to back. Would definitely recommend this book 
 Once again, Blake Nelson has blown me away with an accurate portrayal of suburbia and public high school.  A big fan of his since reading the book, Girl, I find that Nelson writes from the heart and gives each character in his stories the "breath of life".  I related to the characters in the story and found myself often replacing their names with that of my peers.  I definitely enjoyed this book and highly recommend it 
 If you are looking for a pleasurable trip down memory lane, you won't be disappointed -- and you may be suprised to find that this book is much more than that.  The author is an astute observer of modern culture, and he discerns the influence of the Beatles in places I had never thought to look, particularly gender roles.  And likewise his treatment of how the 60's continue to reverberate in today's world -- not just the conventional "sex, drugs and rock-and-roll" but some thought-provoking views on how the culture wars began.   Hardly a hagiography, the book is unflinching in its descriptions of the Beatles' backgrounds and behavior(but never sensationalized.)  Stark weaves insight and humor throughout, making it a book I found hard to put down 
 Penguin Classics provides probably the most complete introductions to Classical literature available anywhere.  All of the meaning and nuances contained in the Oresteia for its original audiences is fully explained in its 99-page introduction 
 I watched this film shortly after reading the book and I fell in love.  Anthony Andrews was PERFECT as the Scarlet Pimpernel, playing both the fop and the hero with ease.  I would have preferred if Marguerite had been written as she was in the novel, but Jane Seymour was both lovely and extremely talented in the role as it was written for the movie.  The end of the movie was changed from the book, but the way they chose to do so was wonderful and I was not disappointed.  I HIGHLY recommend this movie for both those who have and have not read the book.  It is an amazing story of heroism, true love and adventure 
 I wasn't expecting much when I picked up Charles "Tex" Watson's book Will You Die for Me, but I have to say that it turned out to be a fascinating read.  In the book, Watson traces his life from an average college student to a murderous cult member - but what makes the book unique is his unflinching candor.    Watson explains what was going through his mind while he was living in the cult and having these murderous psychotic episodes.  The book is written in such a down-to-earth tone that is hard to believe that the author actually did these things - but he did, and there are no scapegoats, not even Mason, Watson takes responsibility for his actions.  It is chilling to think that a man capable of being this introspective and articulate, can also be capable of killing strangers on a whim.  It is a very good and quick read...  and for those interested in the Manson Family crimes, it is a must have. 
 The iRiver pops easily into the holder and stays there. I like the angle at which the iRiver faces while in the holder because it allows you to easily adjust the volume or change tracks without twisting it away from your arm to see the controls 
 A practical common sense approach to motorcycle maintenance. Mr. Zimmerman has covered all important areas and added more than a few esoteric comments that make for a fast and informative read. If I had only one book in my two wheel referance library it would be this very essential maintenance guide.  
 I can say that every Sunday religously I watch the Simpsons.  I have been viewing them ever since the Tracy Ullman Show back in 1987.  It's a simple cartoon with sometimes very deep humor.  That is what trully keeps me watching this show.  It never seems to get old because the humor always seems to capture some other topic.  I have purchased every season of the Simpsons available.  And watching the episodes time after time repeat after repeat I still get a good laugh.  It never gets predictable and may be what keeps this show going for another ten years 
 Few performers had more energy as a deeper connection with their audience than Frank Sinatra. Paul McCartney, Elton John, The Rolling Stones and many other great live acts all owe their knack as concert draws to The Chairman Of The Board. Sinatra was the first live performer to turn his shows into events. Whenever Frank was in town, the entire city made it known. This lasted right up to his final performance in 1995.  Sinatra's tremendous talents as live performer are evident on the 5 disc (4 cds, 1 dvd) boxed set, "Sinatra: Vegas", which distills over 25 years of classic Sinatra in concert from the city he loved more than any place in the world. Spanning from 1961 to 1987, Sinatra bulldozes through a host of classic songs that shaped his career, including "Young At Heart", "I've Got You Under My Skin", "All Or Nothing At All" and "New York, New York" and a host of others, and mixing it in with stinging onstage banter that will surely bring chuckles to its listeners.   The dvd included here is a splendid treat for all Sinatra fans. Recorded in May of 1978, this show was scheduled to air as a tv special, but up until now it was only available on bootlegs. Now, the show hhas ben dug up, restored and remastered and looks and sounds better than ever. Frank is in top form in all areas, and the band is on fire throughout.  The booklet and promotional posters are fantastic treats for all Sinatra fans. This set may be slightly expensive, but it's worth every penny imaginable. A must have for everyone and a fantastic Easter gift 
 I really love this book and have re-read it a few times already.  It's sensual and cheery and great for the self-esteem.  It reminds me to enjoy and celebrate my femininity.  An absolute joy to read.  The recipes are great too! 
 This work sheds light on our Founding Fathers by discussing early historical events in more detail. For instance, Benjamin Franklin tried to force Congress to confront slavery- head on. Our early lawmakers were at a loss to figure out how slaves would be integrated into the economy and the broader society once freed. Alexander Hamilton foresaw a scenario; wherein, the federal government would triumph over the states.Alternatively, the Union itself could dissolve into fractious parties- each with a parochial self interest to uphold.  The 1790 census counted 3.1MM whites and a total of 3.9MM people. President George Washington pre-announced his retirement on 9-19-1796 in the American Daily Advertiser. In his Farewell, President Washington believed that individual interests should be subordinated to further a much greater common cause.   Essentially, President Washington's support for the Jay Treaty made him unelectable in 1796. Jefferson was critized for failing to prepare for the War of 1812. This book has a wealth of knowledge on our early history and civics. It will be an important enhancement to American History texts everywhere 
 From one of the guys at the FBI Behavioral Science Unit comes the results of a massive study the FBI did on sexual offenders. It does offer a lot of research data which can always be dry, but it also offers myriad of examples to personalize the data and make it more informative for everyone. I found it very enlightening since there are very few studies that have been able to do this kind of comparative research on a problem that is so prevalent 
 'The Assistant' might be a bit dated in depicting the struggling Jewish shopkeeper as universal sufferer, since time and place and circumstance change social and ethical foundations and hierachies.  Some people might see the book as too allegorical/parabolic and symbolic as well. But is that a fault of the book or of the benign neglect of many thoughtful people toward suffering and raw expression?  The characters make it above the level of stereotype, albeit not by much, and the New York of the early 1950's is not the one of today (even the Brooklyn of the 50's isn't).  Nevertheless, in creating a modern parable of suffering and redemption within a circumscribed world of a few blocks of a Brooklyn neighborhood inhabited by the local Jews, Italians, and Irish, Malamud has created a book that is accessible to anyone with a heart and interesting enough for anyone with a literary bent.  It can also give pause (to anyone who is wanting to give pause) to those caught up in the hypermaterialist world today.  John Lennon said "life if what happens what you're doing other things."  This book can help bring you down to earth in between reading brochures on M.B.A. programs. 
 This book focuses on behavioral treatments for children with autism. As the subtitle suggests, it covers the three main areas that are challenging for children affected by autism - communication, social, and academic development. While it is written with autism in mind, the techniques are certainly applicable to the spectrum of Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDDs). The techniques are rooted in Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) and are developmentally sensitive. The authors attempt to make the treatments practical and natural (i.e. reinforcers should be tailored to the child's natural environment). I found the section on academic development to be especially helpful. Several pictorial examples of homework were given, and how a parent might make the homework less intimidating (e.g. organizing information, chunking, giving hints, etc.) This book could be used by parents, professionals, and paraprofessionals. I used it in an educational setting, and have not actually tried any of the techniques. But I can say that the interventions are based on sound research, and I expect that they would be effective when applied properly. PRTs for Autism is a complete and accesible book. However, it is not necessarily a motivational book nor one that you would use for an evening of easy reading. It is basically a book that gives detailed treatment techniques. I think this is its strong suit, as I have seen other treatment books and planners that simply give general ideas on how to approach treatment. For a book that is more motivational while still having practical strategies, I recommend another book by one of the co-authors (Lynn Kern Koegel) called Overcoming Autism -- which is geared more specifically towards parents 
 The Mice of Bistro is a funny, heart warming story.  It captures the attention of its audience and keeps them anxious to see what will happen next.  The basis of the book is unique and refreshing and the illustrations are wonderful. 
 This book is fantastic for those of us who know how do code sites all day long but aren't that great at design.  I don't know that I will end up buying the book, however.  I learned what I needed to from it by borrowing it from the library and taking notes as I went.  What this book made me do was to think about what my users needed to make the page work for them.  If you're in e-commerce, you want to know what will help users click to buy.  If you're sharing opinion or fact, you want your users to click on the information you have to offer.  If they don't read it or won't click on it, you've "lost the sale."  What this book does for me is to help technical people like me be more aware of the asthetics of site design.  If my site doesn't have a site map, people who use site maps won't stick around long.  If my site doesn't have a search capability, many users will go elsewhere so they can search through a site rather than having to click to find what they want.  I could go on, but SOWPTS does its job very well - it educates users on what doesn't work.  It goes beyond it as well by helping us find alternatives to "what sucks" so our pages can reach more of our audience 
 First off, to all the jaded and grumpy punk elitists, I feel for you.  I really do.  Punk is probably the most afflicted of any music genre.  But if your sole purpose of writing a review is to "school" the ignorant and tell Rancid fans to listen to Op Ivy and The Descendants and The Ramones and Bad Religion etc, you're wasting your time.   On to the album.  It's great.  Sure it's classicist and hardly innovative, but the energy and convinction of which Rancid tears through this 19 song set  makes them easily forgiveable.  This is probably in one of the top 10 records of the decade.  The catchy songcraft and thoughtful lyrics are sure to win over any fan of punk.  Although the musicianship isn't as strong as Life Won't Wait, (my personal favorite Rancid album) it's still better than most of its peers.     The only "bad" thing about the album is that it's a bit frontloaded.  Most of the best tracks are in the front half of the album, and the second half can get a bit repetetive, with Old Friend and As Wicked being the standouts of the second half.  If you remove the stigma of being called Clash rip-offs and "selling out" and just enjoy the album for what it is, you'll find yourself listening to some truly enjoyable punk and ska tunes.   
 This is a classic. as i got older, I appreciated what this movies was saying in the 60s. i still love this movie 
 Jeff Beck has always been one of my favorite guitarists.  This disc really proves that he's still got the edge!  I highly recommend this disc.  Caution: do not order from Yodelin'Pig.  Although this is supposed to be the Japanese import version of this disc, they sent me the domestic version 
 One of my favorite books that has helped challenge and shape my spiritual and philosophical outlooks on life. Sanford goes to great length explaining and detailing Thomas Jefferson's views on controversial topics such as the right and nature of Man, nature of God, separation of church and state, religious freedom, deism, Christianity, materialism, morality, and the afterlife. Sanford provides many citations, including Jefferson's personal letters, diaries, personal Jeffersonian Bible, and other primary sources. Sanford carefully places Jefferson's views in historical and cultural context, but yet there's no sugarcoating anything here. It's a great read and I recommend it for any open-minded and mature individual interested in learning about the beliefs that motivated Jefferson and our founding Fathers to create the US Constitituion and a free society 
  I listened to the audio version of this while commuting.  Overall impression was that it was a good listen.  It was interesting and kept my attention.  However, I wouldn't use words like "the best" to describe this.  The good:  - Extremely well-written.  It makes me want to try another Sandra Brown book.  Good descriptions that make setting and actions easy to visualize.  The bad:  - About half-way through I started to realize that I never really knew what the female lead, Remi, was thinking.  It would have been nice to have gotten a glimpse into what she really thought about Pinky, and about Burke along the way.  The book really was about the male characters and what they felt.    - I never felt that Remi really became independent.  In the epilogue Brown seems to try to make it seem like she's a new, confident woman, but I don't know if I buy that.    - The thriller/mystery part of the book started sputtering out close to the end.  There was a very long build-up and the ending did not really live up to that. - Last, I agree with what some of the previous reviewers said.  The romance was flimsy at best - it seemed just based on a superficial attraction.  It was a bit hard to swallow that it was love.  So, overall, interesting though some parts were predictable; flimsy romance but still definitely readable (/worth listening to).  
 honestly, i didn't pay any attention at all in my ap euro class. but a month before the test, realizing i didn't know anything, i bought this. though it doesn't cover all the facts in enough detail, if you know this book you can still pull off a 5, and who can remember all the details anyway? the practice tests are easily the best availible too. and trust me, if i can scrape a 5 with this book, so can you 
 Director, Spike Lee, was determined to not let these girls be faceless victims; he wanted us to learn as much as possible about each of them. The girls and their ages were: Denise McNair, 11, Addie Mae Collins, 14, Cynthia Wesley, 14, and Carole Robertson, 14. Lee could have made a movie that described the events and put them in historical perspective of the civil rights movement. This is how documentaries were made in the past. It's not widely known that today's documentaries have changed. Many top directors have been experimenting with this medium, and they're revolutionizing it. Here, Lee has made a very personal film, and we get to know each participant as the person they were at the time and the person they are now.   We do so mostly through interviews. Lee talks to one person at a time, and frames them in such closeup, the tops of their heads are frequently cut from the shot. It's very intimate. As you get to know each person, you feel as if you can reach out and feel the sorrow they endured. This is not a sorrowful film, however. The tone is nostalgic, as each person wistfully remembers something different about their deceased daughter, sister, or friend. As they say, time heals all wounds, and these families have had 24 years to grieve. They cherish the memories they have, and they want to share them with us. I don't really know why Lee interviewed Bill Cosby (he doesn't say much that any of us couldn't have said), but the rest of his choices (including Wallace) are impeccable. We listen to the deep sadness of Chris McNair (father of Denise) remembering Denise's first encounter with racism, or the resigned grace of Alpha Robertson (mother of Carole) renouncing any hatred of the man who killed her daughter, and we may wonder if we would have the strength to endure what they did. And such activists as Andrew Young and Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth are living history texts illuminating the fear and loathing (and hope) of the era.  As we learn about the girls, we also learn about the events that led to the bombing. These events are critical in understanding why the church was bombed and in realizing the girls did not die in vain. They died tragically and senselessly, but their deaths were a wake-up call to America. They became martyrs. "4 Little Girls" is a movie experience that everyone should see. 
 Each time I play this CD, I'm amazed at how one group put forth so many hit records in a row: 23 Top 40 hits in 5.5 years including 12 #1's. Each hit record is reproduced here faithfully and exactly as they originally sounded as they topped the charts. That's why I scratch my head at why Motown, famed for it's greedy, shameless re-issues, wwould stoop so low as to bastardize the sound of these classics on "The 1's" - the most recent collection. This is the true sound of the group as the public snapped them up by the millions and the producer's intended. The Ultimate Collection is the ONLY way to go. You will LOVE it 
 Ellis Peters' Pilgrim Of Hate provides the tenth chronicle of Brother Cadfael, an 1100s investigator/monk. Stephen Thorne brings to life the vivid story of the monk's investigation of a medieval celebration's setting  of murder. A truly wonderful audiobook production 
 When the novel, "The Buddha of Suburbia" begins, Karim, the child of an upper-class Indian father and a working class British mother, is in his teens. Karim watches his parents' marriage disintegrate while his father becomes a minor celebrity who teaches yoga and offers platitudes to middle-class suburbanites. With British culture serving as a backdrop, author Hanif Kureishi weaves together issues such as the end of empire, racism, and the explosion of Punk Rock while charting Karim's acting career.  To describe "The Buddha of Suburbia" as a coming-of-age novel is correct, but such a description doesn't do justice to this witty, wise, sharp tale. Karim matures in the turmoil of the 70s, and his confusion deepens following his parents' divorce. Morally adrift, Karim records the progress of several of his relatives--Jamila, his radical cousin, her arranged marriage to the hapless Changez, Jamila's parents--Auntie Jetta and Uncle Anwar who operate a rundown grocery shop surrounded by hostile natives, and Eva--Karim's father's extraordinary girlfriend.  While Karim is an observer of events in these people's lives, he also struggles to discover his own identity. He's never even been to India, but he's selected to play token Indian roles--such as Mowgli from "Jungle Book", and he discovers that many chose to define him by the colour of his skin, rather than who he really is.   I loved the unforgettable, entertaining characters in this book, and Jamila and Changez deserve a book of their own. Jamila is introduced to various radical political ideas by a progressive teacher, and consequently activism defines her soul: "Under the influence of Angela Davis, Jamila had started exercising every day, learning karate and judo ... she was preparing for the guerilla war." Jamila's father begins an ill-advised hunger strike to coerce his daughter to submit to an arranged marriage. The bridegroom is the bumbling, fat, Conan Doyle addicted Changez. Could a more unlikely match exist? Changez probably couldn't manage any westernized wife--let alone the fierce Jamila. Changez's feeble attempts to exact obedience from Jamila fail miserably, and Karim begins to educate Changez to Western ways by giving him Harold Robbins' novels. Soon Changez sees "Britain as we see Sweden: as the gold mine of sexual opportunity."   Some readers may be offended by the novel's descriptions of frank sexuality, but this is a story of Karim's exposure and experimentation with life, so nothing seems overly gratuitous. Kureishi has also written many screenplays--including "My Beautiful Launderette", "Sammy and Rosie Get Laid", "Intimacy" and "The Mother." If you're familiar with those films, then you know that Kureishi doesn't shy away from sexual themes. There's also a television film of "The Buddha of Suburbia", and it's highly faithful to the novel. The film, however, does not possess the novel's power, and Karim is portrayed as an observer with less emphasis on his reactions to events. It's still well worth watching and is excellently cast, so if you enjoy the book, I'd recommend tracking down a copy of the film too--displacedhuman 
 This book was written as an introductory guide to the the world of graphic novels because graphic novels and comics have become such an intregal part of mainstream culture in recent years.  While noting the best books, I worked hard to balance the variety of types of graphic novels published for different audiences.  If you do read this book, you'll probably discover some real gems as well as plenty of good graphic novels.  You'll also get ideas on what to read next. 
 I have had no problem using these disks.  I have bought several packs and all disks seem to work and have been great in transferring home movies, doing computer backups, etc 
 Having traveled with various guide books, nothing so far beats the Lonely Planet guide books.  But you must keep in mind as a user - all recommendations are merely recommendations.  Investigate comments, take in  the facts. (However, the comments are usually funny and helpful anyway).   The cultural background information, history,  and other side notes help  make the difference to buy Lonely Planet instead of the others.  Joe  Cummins' LP books on Thailand and Bangkok & the phrasebook were superb.  I liked his insight.  LP helps you be a traveler, not just a tourist.  (Other LP books used: Israel, Turkey, Greece, Western Europe, Baltics,  Asia, Hong Kong.  They've all been worth their weight and size).  If you  can take your own luggage off the baggage carousel, you must use Lonely  Planet 
 This is my - well, second favorite book as far as human potential goes - after "Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East" by Baird T. Spalding.  This book, though, brings people who have developed some extraordinary abilities into the present tense.    As another reviewer noted, the author does repeat quite often "China is so great" tune, but it is also true that a lot of countries in the East have greater awareness and appreciation for working with energy, and have been cultivating it to a greater extent than people in the West.  In the West, these awareness begin to spread more in the recent years.  It was often put down by those who are immersed in studying the world as if nothing other than material world existed.  From this book, though, it is obvious that even in China, there are many people who, due to lack of understanding that mind influences the energy which then expresses in physical dimension, they also had conflicts with accepting the reality of what they witnessed.  The author has correctly pointed out that when you use whatever mind-power you are able to express and when you take care to develop it - it grows - when you don't use it - it diminishes.  This is true regardless of what skills any person may be using.  It is also a way of economy in nature.  While there are few quotations in this book from the Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine - as in "Be imperturbable and the true chi will come to you", this idea is not unique either to China or to Buddhism, it is a spiritual truth presented throughout all spiritual traditions. India's "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali" is yet another book that deals with development of different abilities, yet the idea is that one should not focus on development of special abilities (siddhis), but rather just focus on realizing Oneness (Self-Realization).  This state of Oneness is in Christian Bible called entering the "Kingdom of God" - the method described as loving this Infinite Loving Power and Intelligence with all one's mind, heart, soul and strength.  The goal of alchemy - either Eastern (Taoist) or Western is again realizing this state of Oneness and from this state, the powers begin to emerge spontaneously when needed.  These powers are also intended to be used in service, out of love, not for selfish goals.    The highest visible vibration of this One Power - the Source of All Energy - is Light - so appropriately the method used to unleash these powers to which every human being does have access are meditations on the Light.  With a quite a bit of children, mentioned in this book, who were helped in this process of unfolding inner power - it took only one such session to produce remarkable results.  The book mentions how there are many more women (girls) who have these "special powers" than men (boys). This is not all that surprising because it is generally considered that women's "heart centers" are more open than men's and Love is the highest feeling vibration, Love is the essential quality of this Infinite Energy.  The author then mentions how they have noticed that with most children these "special" powers begin to diminish after puberty.  This may also not be surprising because a certain leakage of energy occurs due to loss of blood (menstruation) in women and loss of semen (in men) and I might add that for this reason, there are special practices in Taoist Alchemy to prevent these leakage and to preserve the energy.  After all - all of these special abilities are based on "playing with energy" - opening the channels within to let it flow, generating it and directing it.  Focusing upon - meditating upon the Source of All of this Energy is one way to connect with it and let it express - different forms of qigong energy cultivation and manipulation exercises are another 
 My son had a great time playing with this toy. I liked the durability ( it made it through Christmas ) 
 The first Bloodsport will always be the best of the series, and probably remains as one of the best martial art movies of all time.  Bloodsport 2 does not have the classic feel that Bloodsport has, nor does Daniel Bernhardt fill Van Damme's shoes, and the villain Demon (played by Ong Soon Han) does not come close to the on-screen presence of Bolo Yeung.  What Bloodsport 2 does have over the original is the best tournament you will ever see in a movie.  For a good 30 minutes throughout the film, you get some of the best choreography ever done, well editing and camera angles, and long fights that are just enjoyable to watch and appreciate.  The story to Bloodsport 2 is nothing to write home about, but as far as fights, the beginning to the end of his film has nothing but continuous fights (both in and out of the tournament).  The final fight between Alex (Bernhardt) and Ong Soon Han is actually pretty good, maybe better than Van Damme and Chong Li in the first Bloodsport.  If you are looking for a good all around movie in the Bloodsport series, look towards the first Bloodsport.  If you don't care about story and famous actors and just want really good fights, Bloodsport 2 is the best in the series.  Check out Bloodsport 3 too - its pretty lame throughout but the tournament is pretty dang good too.  As for Bloodsport 4, ouch 
 Gives overwhelming proof that FDR provoked the Japanese attack primarily through denying access to natural resources in Indonesia via the Dutch government in exile, and also by giving support to Chinese resistance fighters.  The motive behind the provocation was to ensure that the American people would support a war against Nazi Germany, Italy and Japan that they did not wish to be involved in prior to December 7, 1941. Instead of trying to convince the American people that war would be inevitable against Fascism; condescendingly assured of their stupidity, FDR sacrificed 2500 sailors in order to mobilize the nation for war.  The intelligence services were aware of false Japanese diplomats mapping out Pearl Harbor in preparation for the bombing. They were being monitored but allowed to operate. The secret Japanese communications codes were also cracked early on, so that military and government intelligence were aware of Japanese preparations. The `purple' diplomatic code was also cracked, so that Washington was deciphering communications between Berlin and Tokyo.  Once a military attack became inevitable, Washington hid the fact from military commanders in the Pacific to ensure the attack would be more devastating, and Pearl's base commander would take the blame for being unprepared. I find it truly troubling that only warships that were outdated were left at anchor in Pearl that morning on December 7. The Navy knew that the modern aircraft carriers would be extremely useful during modern naval war, so the USS Enterprise and USS Lexington were out to sea on maneuvers and safe from the bombing. Only ships 27 years old, relics from World War I, were left at anchor and vulnerable 
 "The Best of Blondie" was originally released on vinyl in 1981 and includes songs from the band's first 5 studio albums plus the hit single "Call Me" from the film "American Gigolo". Blondie's chart-topping hits are all here: "Heart of Glass", "The Tide Is High", "Rapture", "One Way or Another" and "Call Me", which, along with the other 8 songs, encompass Blondie's eclectic rock, punk, reggae, disco, and rap influences. Some songs are featured in their album versions and some in their single version. They haven't been remixed, which I appreciate, because the songs sound as I remember them from radio airplay.   I've always thought of Blondie as "disco-punk" that brought a hyperactive dance rhythm from the 70s to a disaffected hard-edged 80s attitude. "The Best of Blondie" kicks off with the ultimate fusion of those two sensibilities: "Heart of Glass" (4:35). Blondie's recording of "The Tide is High" (4:45) is probably the most recognizable rendition of the reggae tune, which was written by John Holt for The Paragons in the 1960s. "Sunday Girl" (3:05) crosses genres, eras, and cultures. It's like a rocking version of a 1950s pop anthem, sung partly in French. "Rapture" (5:36) raps, seduces, and pushes Debbie Harry's voice to extremes. The callousness of "One Way or Another" (3:36) stood out among the feel-good hits of top-40 radio. "Call Me" (3:32) is the single version, not the extended version found on the "American Gigolo" soundtrack. It still conjures a powerful image of Richard Gere racing his stick-shift convertible on L.A.'s freeways.   "The Best of Blondie" covers the highlights of Blondie's heyday, when Debbie Harry's voice and the band's upbeat punkish style were familiar sounds on pop radio. This compilation will satisfy casual fans badly in need of a Blondie fix after all these years and demonstrates what a memorable, gutsy, and distinctive band Blondie was 
 I've been reading a chapter a day for over a yr. It's a great motivator for the day ahead. I've found this translation to be the best I've read. Other translations have been boring or too dense. This one was very powerful 
 This is a concise yet indepth treaty of all spongiform disorders.Yam has left nothing out. To fully appreciate the prion biochemistry a basic understanding of replication and genetics is needed. This is an informative book without losing the reader.I highly recommend it 
 While this disc was not a smashing commercial success, it was a superior effort by The Fixx.  I lost this disc sometime ago and thought I'd never find it again.  Thankfully, I found it on Amazon.  The Fixx always managed a sort of quirky sound, Ink seemed less odd and more radio friendly.  Then again, radio play is one of those eternal mysteries. 
 This is an incredible workout! My entire family does this and has for the past 14 years (since it came out in '91). None of us do the step aerobics anymore because we're not interested, but the abs and legs/butt/thighs sections are great. They'll make you SO sore you know it's working. A lot of my friends have started buying this video 
 Great product!  It makes your life a lot easier, not having to worry about boiling your bottles.  Please keep in mind that it is a "sterilizer", not a dishwasher nor a bottle warmer.  Somehow, a bunch of people misunderstand what this product does 
 I originally bought this book to use with a 2nd grade class, but my four year old son just loves it. The colors are bright and bold. He loves picking out all the colored crayons as I read about them in the book. This  book could be read with three year olds to help them with colors. Great  book - I hope you like it too 
 I read about Gerald Michaelson's Sun Tzu in the review section of a local daily and I promptly ordered a copy.  Reading it was a rich experience and the unique ways in which Gerald Michaelson has combined ideas from the West (which concentrates on the big battle as the way to win) and the East (which aims to win without fighting) is just brilliant.   I went a step ahead and took the book to a company meeting and read aloud a few excerpts, which I felt would be useful for my team. It was an interesting experience for all. The simplicity and various ways with which the concepts and wisdom of East and West can be combined to help you in achieving success, have been explained in a marvelous way. In fact, I have already used some of the sales tactics mentioned in the book.    I give 5 stars to Gerald Michaelson's Sun Tzu Strategies for Selling and recommend it as `A Must Read' for anyone involved with Selling 
 Engaging overview, from a post-structuralist/postmodern vantage point, of the linkage between meat-eating and patriarchy and feminism and vegetarianism. One of the purposes of the book is to emphasize the role of the "absent referent" as an essential influence on cultural and social discourse. In doing so, Adams calls attention to the ways in which acceptable modes of thinking and behaving are structured within the cultural framework. All in all, a very readable, well-researched, and  engrossing examination of the integral connections (oppression) between vegetarianism and feminism 
  Arthur Miller's play of responsibility and honor joins the ranks of The Crucible and Death of a Salesman as showcases of a master's talent. Little faults and criticisms popped into my mind throughout act two, but all the loose ends were covered in the last few pages.  The relationships seem to be the catching point, but they're only skin deep. Miller will really have you in complete sympathy with Joe until the time when his sins are completely revealed.  Although it is Joe that experiences a realization by the end of the play, Chris is the true protagonist. He's already come to terms with what Larry wanted to get across to everyone by the time the rest of the cast is even beginning to figure it out.  All My Sons may seem to be a mediocre play in acts one and two, but it will win you over if you give it a chance and really invest yourself in the themes. I would suggest reading Miller's previously mentioned masterpieces before this one, but don't allow it to be overlooked. 
 The story of an innocent young woman who falls in love with a mysterious older man with a dark past is tried and true.  In the hands of Ms. Bronte, it acquires a depth of feeling and sincerity of emotion that raise the story type above the maudlin.  There may have been other gothic romances similar to "Jane Eyre" before this was written, and there have certainly been many after it, but none have been quite so wonderful.  Lord Byron may have supposedly invented the Byronic hero when he wrote about "Manfred", Mr. Tortured By A Troubled Past... but Bronte's Mr. Rochester is a perfection of the type.  He's sensitive, yet abrupt.  Demanding, yet tender.  Proud, yet remorseful.  Every time I read this book, I fall in love with him all over again.  Jane Eyre herself is an even more complex character than Mr. Rochester.  She's tough and stern, yet playful.  She has a firm moral center and does not hesitate to do what she believes is right, even when it hurts herself or those around her.  And by being true to herself and what she knows is right, she ultimately triumphs over a variety of people who might do her great injury (intentionally or not).  Again, literature has seen many sturdy, spunky heroines come and go, but Jane Eyre is a perfection of the type 
 After watching one of these shows I was hooked. Unfortunately I discovered this after it was cancelled. Maybe bad advertising. How come I've never heard of such a fantastic show. Big mistake. I love the characters, music, special effects, plots. Everything was obviously done by a phenomenal team. Its like a great book with the last few pages missing. More Firefly please. 
 Classic Text.  Feel free to jump around chapters as you read this.  It's a compilation of Brecht's ideas andis best read in random order.  
  Hello Nasty, the Beastie Boys' fifth album, is a head-spinning listen loaded with analog synthesizers, old drum machines, call-and-response vocals, freestyle rhyming, futuristic sound effects, and virtuoso turntable scratching. The Beasties have long been notorious for their dense, multi-layered explosions, but Hello Nasty is their first record to build on the multi-ethnic junk culture breakthrough of Check Your Head, instead of merely replicating it.   Moving from electro-funk breakdowns to Latin-soul jams to spacey pop, Hello Nasty covers as much ground as Check Your Head or Ill Communication, but the flow is natural, like Paul's Boutique, even if the finish is retro-stylized. Hiring DJ Mixmaster Mike (one of the Invisibl Skratch Piklz) turned out to be a masterstroke; he and the Beasties created a sound that strongly recalls the spare electronic funk of the early '80s, but spiked with the samples and post-modern absurdist wit that have become their trademarks. On the surface, the sonic collages of Hello Nasty don't appear as dense as Paul's Boutique, nor is there a single as grabbing as "Sabotage," but given time, little details emerge, and each song forms its own identity.   A few stray from the course, and the ending is a little anticlimactic, but that doesn't erase the riches of Hello Nasty - the old-school kick of "Super Disco Breakin'" and "The Move"; Adam Yauch's crooning on "I Don't Know"; Lee "Scratch" Perry's cameo; and the recurring video game samples, to name just a few. The sonic adventures alone make the album noteworthy, but what makes it remarkable is how it looks to the future by looking to the past. There's no question that Hello Nasty is saturated in old-school sounds and styles, but by reviving the future-shock rock of the early '80s, the Beasties have shrewdly set themselves up for the new millennium.  
 Okay so lets face it, the CGI of this movie looks almost identical to Playstation 1's cinematic scenes.. infact at times it almost feels as if you're playing a PS game and you feel the need to pick up the controller! Aside from that, this is a decent anime. The story is nothing special but its carried out well. The CGI is dated seeing how this is 5 years old now but it's still worth checking out if you're a fan of the methods. A.Li.Ce shouldnt dissapoint 
 I do not know how I would have gotten through my first experience having to use the DSM as a diagnostic tool for my graduate work in psychopathology without this book. I used it to work up all my case presentations, and they were always accurate. Thank you, James Morrison 
 This is a perfect basic resource for anyone just entering the performance consulting field.  
 The emotions and events of this book seemed mostly believable.  I found myself sobbing on more than one occasion.  Terminal illness and loss are given realistic but hopeful treatment.  I identified with many of the characters and at the end wanted to send it to my brother because of a special loss we have shared 
 This pop-up seat is great for at the table or on the go. My one-year old loves it! It sits him up a lot higher at the table than if we use the high chair at the table. It is so convenient to take places where we know there won't be somewhere for him to sit. It's great for restaruants too because he is very wiggly and it keeps him seated and he's comfortable in it unlike those restaraunt highchairs 
 According to the authors, "This book tells the inside story of justhow Disney's success was achieved -- not by epiphanic flashes ofcreative insight that produced a Pinocchio or a Dumbo, but by the forceof a much-considered, carefully wrought process of managing innovationand creativity and by an adherence to a firmly system of beliefs."The material is organized within 11 chapters, followed by an Epiloguein which the authors observe that the integration and interplaybetween and among the ten principles they have examined can be ofsubstantial benefit to other companies. The "Dream, Believe, Dare,and Do Process" does indeed have all manner of potentialapplications for companies in industries wholly unrelated toentertainment. There must be dreams to believe in and courage topursue those dreams. Those who share my high regard for this book areurged to check out Warren Bennis' Organizing Genius, one of whosechapters focuses on the Disney team which produced Snow White and theSeven Dwarfs. 
 I read the Amulet of Samarkand a few years ago, and I just realized this came out shortly afterward so I picked it up. The beginning is extremely slow and it takes a while for anything to happen, its mostly bureaucratic nonsense. Midway through the book, however things begin to heat up and we are set up for a good adventure. This book is slightly better than the first, mostly due to the addition of Kitty and her story, which I liked better than Nathaniel's or Bartimaeus`. Like the first book, it stands alone as  its own story, but its clear there is to be a sequel or some sort of conclusion to the story as a whole, which I always enjoy in series books. In terms of the characters, Bartimaeus is more likeable than the first book, in which I wasn't crazy about him for some reason. Nathaniel is less likeable and really quite a jackass. Kitty is my favorite character, she is the run of the mill self-sacrificing heroine of the story, but you still love her.   I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, of appropriate age, interested in fantasy.  I don't think its appropriate for anyone under say, 11, 12 ish, but its good for all others 
 Riedel glasses are great way to give a GREAT gift! Opens the wine wonerful, and I love the feel of the glass too. It the perfect way to drink Napa Valley wine, in a fancy glass. Carry-o 
 The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis was a great children's book. The adventures of Lucy, Edmond, Susan and Peter started when they had to move to their grandfather's house due to a war going in London. As they were playing a game of hide and seek they stumbled upon the magical world of Narnia. There they joined forces with the great leader Aslan and together overthrew the evil white witch. I have read this book as a younger kid and just now and there was a big difference in the way I read it. As a kid it was a lot more magical and I couldn't put it down I just had to read it. Now it might be the fact that this is the second time I have read this but it wasn't as good this time around. I had more wonder in my eyes I guess as a kid. I would recommend this book to everyone but I do truly believe kids will enjoy this book more than adults.        
 This book is a synopsis of easyt ways to evaluate and resolve conflicts in a business environment.  To the point 
 The "Order of the Death's Head" first published in 1965, was written while the dust had not yet settled on world war two and at 40 years of age Hoehne's work is a historical classic of the Nazi Period.  As with Albert Speer's "Inside the Third Reich" and Shirer's "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich", this is one of those quintessential works of the period. Focusing on the rise and actions of the German SS, this book certainly does not glorify the SS or the Nazi party while providing a near exhaustive record.   The work, while still very useful is still quite flawed in its organization and is by no means complete.  The majority of the work focuses on the origins of the SS and the early Nazi party as well as later actions as a political entity and finally discusses the SS involvement with concentration camps. While discussed, the combat actions of the Waffen SS are but an aside to the greater focus of the work and many significant happenings within Nazi Germany are discussed quickly while others that may seem less significant are given substance.  This book is an excellent though incomplete resource that is well written and receives both benefit and disadvantage from the period in which it was written.  Building up the scene Hoehne discusses at great details the ideal and actions of the early Nazi Party and the formation of the Schutzstaffel (SS).  Filled with interesting detail and anecdote this is perhaps the richest portion of the work.  As the work progresses Hoehne discusses the interaction of the SS with the other part organizations including the SA the party itself and later the Wehrmacht, SD and Gestapo.  Here we see a central theme of Hoehne's work: The Power of the Nazi Party rested solely in Hitler and all of the party organizations were dependent on Hitler and a few of his staff.  Thus, the SS as pervasive as it had been, was always just one organization in an interdependent and often redundant network that comprised the political structure of Nazi Germany.  The work goes on with continuing sporadic detail to discuss the "night of the Long Knives" the Gestapo, Kristallnacht, The Early War/occupation of Eastern Europe and the Concentration Camps.  This last subject the author provides lucid descriptions and many grim and overwhelmingly bizarre instances.  This work is certainly among the most influential and resourceful works on the Third Reich.  Along with the other two books mentioned above, the average person can get a pretty good understanding of a most bizarre era of history. No one of these books is complete and certainly there are many things completely ignored in all three of these books.  The fact remains that "Order of the Death's Head" is still one of the finest and most complete books written about the SS.  It makes a great point of departure for studying the SS and will be a work that the historian will reference often. The book is also well researched and has a great bibliography.  Overall, I would recommend this book to college students and above and may want to be prefaced by a little basic 20th century German history if needed.  Otherwise this book is a good record however, casual readers be warned, the book may be confusing do to its lack of chronological ordering.  Considering that this book was written before the dust settled on the era and an historical consensus was just beginning to form on the Nazi Period, this is a very worth work that all interested parties ought to read.  -- Ted Murena 
 I must say i'm a die hard Trance fan and don't really care for House music, but this CD isn't bad. The guy at the record store told me it had a mix of both House and Trance and I figured a double CD for 10 bucks what the hell why not check it out. I think my 10 bucks was well spent. It has a awesome Paul Van Dyk remix of "10 in 1" which is the best track on either of the CD's. This is a good CD for fans of House music, but die hard Trance addicts won't care for this except for a few Trance tracks on this compilation which is mostly House, but still not a bad compilatio 
 I love  a window treatment design book that not only focuses on the window, but a room in its entirety.  The curtain styles in this book are appealing in that they enhance the look of the corresponding room and its  contents; they do not overpower.   Curtains: A Design Source Book offers  ideas to accomodate practically every window type and shape. Best of all,  the results do not appear overdone or contrived:  many simple looks with  natural fiber fabrics . I am forever looking for decorating books to add to  my home library and this book is a must- have.  I move quite frequently as  a military spouse and seldom find that all my window treatments adapt to my  "new" dwelling.  I look forward to creating interesting window  treatments in the near future and Caroline Clifton-Mogg's books are my  favorite references 
 Grandsons, ages 5, 6, and 7, were pleased with this book.  They are in various stages of learning to read and these books are great inspiration 
 althought i am not 18 my parents allowd me 2 watch it andi loved it. quite cool i say 
 This was the very first film made in post-World War II Germany, and it is ranked as one of the most important German films ever made. 15 million Germans saw it between 1946 and 1950.  The story begins as a concentration camp survivor, Susanne Wallner, returns to her home in Berlin.  She discovers that her apartment is occupied by a former Wehrmacht doctor, Hans Mertens. An experience during the war has seared his soul, and he is a damaged human being.  Ultimately, we find out why.  The event in question, and the callous manner in which it took place, is horrific.    This film takes on, in a hard-hitting way, the fact that many Germans walking around in 1946 had been complicit in, or even ordered, atrocities.  (Hence, the title, "The Murderers Are Among Us.")  It raises, and attempts to answer, the question of how it affected them.  According to the film, some were tormented by their actions; others refused to accept any blame for them and went right back to "normal" life.   The film does not attempt to take on, however, the Nazi plan to exterminate the Jewish people.  Susanne is a Christian, as is everyone else in the film.  The graves all have crosses.  At least in the English subtitles, the word "Jew" is not used once in this film.  One would walk out of this film without knowing that there had ever been Jews in Germany, or understanding that their annihilation was a prime effort of Nazi Germany. (However, the film's 1946 German audience surely would have been able to put the film into context.) Additionally, the film nowhere describes what Susanne went through in the concentration camps.  The focus is entirely on how the war psychologically damaged Dr. Mertens.  Susanne is there to love and support him, and enable him to achieve redemption.  But who is really the victim here?   These criticisms do not in any way diminish the power of the film, which cannot possibly cover all the ground of Nazi atrocities.  Future films, from many different countries, would explore other aspects. Given that the film was made in Germany in 1946, it is remarkable that it is as hardhitting as it is.    The backstory of this film is interesting, too.  Immediately after the war, the western Allies, concerned that German filmmakers were too steeped in Nazi propaganda to make films, did not allow moviemaking in the western sectors.  This fear was not unfounded.  According to the liner notes, the star of this film, Ernst Wilhelm Borchert, had been a member of the Nazi party and Wolfgang Staudte himself had had a small role in the film "Jud Suess," described on another site as an "Anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda film, depicting the Jew as a financier to dukes and noblemen." The Soviets, however, were interested in getting films made in German.  Thus, Staudte filmed it in the Soviet sector, using the new DEFA studios, which would later become the national studios of East Germany.  This film demonstrated to the world that Germans were capable of facing their past and moving forward toward democracy.    The fact that this film was made in 1946 enabled Wolfgang Staudte to film in the actual ruins of Berlin -- even interspersing a shot of the Trummerfrauen (rubble women) rebuilding the city.  This adds an unmatchable sense of realism to the topic. This film is a must-see. 
 I loved this book its fast paced easy to read book!! I read this book a long time ago (a year or so not very long but it sounds good).  You feel like you are the mane person, Lauren, she has a perfect older sister, fighting perents, a yonger boyfriend and life is buging her.  later she relizis that she will have to  live with it. her sister was kiked out of the house so she is now liveing with her boyfriend.  Paula Danziger is one of my favoret athors.  This is a must read!(:   (:   ( 
 N.C. WYETH is so many things: a great biography, but also an amazing  psychobiography of a family, a magisterially incisive art book, a  heartbreaking chronicle of America's passage from thumping, Teddy  Roosevelt-ian certainty to nuclear anxiety, from a pastoral Eden to a  subdivided automated monster. So many things, and yet what I keep coming  back to is how keenly David Michaelis has brought this man alive, in all  his greatness and fallibility, his humanity. Forget about the arbitrary  divisions between fiction and nonfiction -- this is an absolute literary  achievement 
 Vashti Bunyan's story is incredible.  Her music is a treasure and pure delight.  I'm lucky -- we're all lucky -- she wandered back to London and this record got made 
 Fascinating book.  It's the most accessible and clear account of new literacies that I've read.  The chapter "from Reading to New Literacy Studies" succinctly and clearly describes the social, economic, and educational factors that have influenced the evolution of the terms literacy and new literacies.  The chapter "Faking It:  The National Grid for Learning" is a useful example of what New Literacies (and good teaching) are not.    I would have liked some more connections to current work on epistemic cognition (ala books like Women's Ways of Knowing and Personal Epistemology)--there's a big opportunity to connect digital epistemology to this area of inquiry. But this 'suggestion' doesn't diminish my overall enthusiasm of the book (just add those books to your reading list if you are interested in the applications of epistemology in education).  Overall, this is an excellent book for any teacher or teacher educator who wants some guidance or food for though on using technology in literacy, humanities, or the social sciences--from Kindergarten to graduate school.     
 Mariah has never sounded so better. Her voice is amazing. With that amazing voice she could break glass.

 I thought this Melanie Travis story was the best one yet. Berenson keeps getting better and better. It's hard to review this and not give away the things that are revealed in this edition--Sam's past, to be exact. There was less "dog show" in this book, but the detailed account of the birth of Faith's puppies was wonderful and satisfied the dog lover in me. You suspect that Melanie and Sam's relationship is coming to a climax, but I'll have to admit that the ending surprised me. I was prepared for a predictable ending. It was very touching and thoughtful--leaving me eager for the next in the series. Ms. Berenson, please don't wait too long 
 Bought this to read on an airplane, but ended up plowing through it before the trip even started 
 This a great book for almost every child. I am an Education Major at Pima Community College in Tucson, Az. I work also work at a Pre-school and the childeren love this book (Childeren ages 12 months to 3 1/2 years). We read it atleast once a day. This is a great book because they don't know it but they are learning how to add and subtract, using cookies. It's great because if you read it aloud to them and then show them how many kids show up, then they start to realize how many cookies are actually there, and then it gets to how many cookies each child will get. The first time I read this book to my kids, they loved it and after the second time they stated to pick up on the subratcion part of the book and now every time we read the book they can come up with the anserws on thier own. It's really amazing to me how they will start to pick it up 
 I could not find a store that carries flannel sheets in white like color but Amazon.com Great price too 
 This beautifully illustrated book is full of fun poems that describe various animals that live in the ocean.  It has rich vocabulary and is a great read-aloud 
 Dennis Quaid ranks high in our family video night; both the Parent Trap and the Rookie are among our young children's favorites.  For my wife and I, I rented In Good Company due to Quaid, and because the film intrigued me: its trailer and synopsis do not rely on quick action or screwball comedy.... it was different from most of what I see.  In Good Company relies on its characters.  I don't know the corporate world, but as corporations seem to be today's "Resident Evil" (pun intended), I liked a story where a heart is found in the Oz less world of layoffs and cubicles.  What I liked most was the interaction between Dan Forman, played by Quaid, and Carter Duryea, played by Topher Grace.  Carter is fatherless; basically he's parentless, and the film shows a close Foreman family but has little, and little positive, reference to Carter's upbringing. Carter's world is psyche, synergy, cell phones and Sports America, where he now runs sales.  As the film progresses we are treated not just to an old school/new school, hip/over the hill tension, but see a young man learn character, in work and family, from someone who has done it right. There are limitations, as when Foreman tells Duryea that the secret to a good marriage is to find the right woman and keep your organ in your pants when you are away from home.  This is not too helpful for Carter, whose seven-month marriage to the wrong woman shows a need for more than luck. But overall he learns that life is more than suits, cars, and success... he longs for he does not have.  Throughout we see the pain of a young man all alone in the world, someone who has had no one to guide him.   In one scene, Morty, played by David Paymer, states that the right timing is important. The film could easily have dived into a happy ending where everyone has a job and  where Carter gets the girl, but it makes a good move by remaining true to that line.  When Carter hugs Foreman goodbye he squeezes him and breaks down. When we next see Carter he is jogging outside rather than on a treadmill. He may not know where his path will lead, but now, thanks for Dan Foreman, he is no longer running in circles.  
 Nice easy reading for anyone who has a cat that allows them to live in their space 
 These clippers work well on my Bichon and also the Cockapoo.  The charge lasts quite a while, and its great not to have to work around a cord.  They're quiet enough not to bother the dogs.  
 My daughter, at 21 months, is on a real Maisy kick.  She can't get enough, and particularly loves these Maisy lift-the-flap books.  Not a lot in them for the parents, but also not a terrible chore to read over and over, since they are simple enough that she can pretty much read them to herself.  She loves the silliness of this one, in particular (fish in the toilet, duck in the washing machine, etc.).  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone with a Maisy fan in mind 
 Mr. Fisk presents a point of view seldom seen in the US. He questions the wisdom of trying to spread Western-style democracy in countries that in some cases are not really countries at all (e.g., Iraq), an opinion that is a total anathema in the US. What, democracy is not the best form of government? Only if the country can really do democracy.   I also appreciated his description of the Iran-Iraq war. It is important to remember that the US supported Saddam Hussein for a long time. That's why, I think, he thought he could invade Kuwait: his "friends" wouldn't interfere. And we wouldn't have, except the Bush I administration realized that Saddam would then have control over a very large portion of Middle Eastern oil. If we had stayed out of the Iran-Iraq war, or even acknowledged that Iraq was the aggressor, then we would not be in the position we are in now, with Iran having little to lose in continuing its development of nuclear capability.   I thought Mr. Fisk's reportage on the bloody aspects of war and what war actually does to a populace was appropriate and important. Here in the US we are eager to believe that no civilians will be harmed during bombing campaigns. However, I have to admit that I decided not to read the chapter called "Betrayal," which dealt with the aftermath of the first Gulf war when we encouraged Iraqis to rise up against Saddam, and then we abandoned them. I just couldn't bear it.   Mr. Fisk does have a particular point of view that many Americans do not share, but he does an excellent job of revealing events and consequences that we in the US don't want to face. He is an eloquent writer and deserves a wide audience.  I give this book four stars instead of five because it is overwhelming. Perhaps it could have been two books. But it is nonetheless excellent 
 The black silk cord necklace was a great choice for my teenage son.  He wears it every day and thinks it's "cool! 
 This book is more of a detective mystery than the usual horror book you see from Dean Koontz. As far as writing from Dean Koontz, I place it second only to Watchers although it is very different 
 LOVE HEALS is a book for all ages.  Open to any page and the Truth will be there 
 I absolutly love this book.  The one thing I have to say against it though is the new cover.  I think they should replush another version of it with the original cover.  I would make it less clincal feelin 
 An interesting mix of singles ("I'm not in Love", "Art for Art's sake")and b-sides to singles ("Channel Swimmer"), this really isn't the place to start checking out 10cc. I'd recommend the much more generous 15 track collection which also features the pivotal Godley & Creme single "Cry" as well as essential "Wall Street Shuffle" and "Silly Love".     If you like what you hear dig a little deeper into the original foursome's finest albums "Sheet Music", "The Original Soundtrack" and "How Dare You". After that, there's two essential 10cc albums "Deceptive Bends" and "Ten Out of 10" recorded by Eric Stewart and Graham Gouldman after the departure of the other two founding members Kevin Godley & Lol (Lawrence)Creme. The former can be purchased as an import while the latter is available only from fans or occasionally at auction.     The best collection (although it's hardly complete)continues to be "10cc: The Ultimate Collection" a three disc set featuring music from every phase of the band's career with the third bonus disc devoted to six Godley & Creme classics and two less than stellar recordings by Graham Gouldman in Wax UK (a duo he formed with Andrew Gold who wrote and sang the hit single "Lonely Boy"). 
 When I was in my teens - this group was fairly popular with  the song "Cara Mia". And then they more or less disappeared from the charts here in Europe. It's a pity - this group never got the recognition they really deserved. This cd is just great.. 
 Robinson is an excellent writer and this is an excellent trilogy, but the emphasis is on science.  Those looking for light-reading action fantasy should look elsewhere.  On the other hand, if you love science fiction with meat to it and you find Mars fascinating, these are the books for you.  Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke...no other science fiction author has ever put so much real science into his writing, and that's only half the appeal.  To get the full experience, allow yourself the time to follow the musings and personal journeys of Robinson's characters as well as the main plot.  Robinson's books are better savored than read 
 Lee Ziegler has drawn upon a lifetime of experience with horses to write this book.  It is a practical guide to training and conditioning horses that possess the heredity and conformation for performing easy gaits.  She describes how this may be done without the use of shortcut gimmicks or cruelty.    The book is not organized by breed.  Many individual horses are capable of gaits that are not the signature gait of their breed.  Therefore, Mrs. Ziegler has taken each easy gait and written in detail about facilitating that particular gait including its variations by breed.  She has written in language that the novice rider can understand.  Easy gaits are comfortable gaits intermediate between the square trot and the hard pace.  These soft gaits are carefully described.  Clear drawings of five phases of support for each gait are provided.  There is a double page spread upon which the support patterns of ten gaits are shown for comparison purposes.  There is another which provides verbal descriptions of the footfalls and supports of eight gaits.  The book is copiously illustrated in every chapter with line drawings that extend and support the text.  There are enlightening chapters concerning the relationship between conformation and gait and on the importance of well-designed and properly fitted equipment, as well as correct position in the saddle.  Furthermore, Mrs. Ziegler has provided troubleshooting prescriptions for solving gait problems, figures and exercises that aid in confirming the easy gaits, suggestions for groundwork, and instructions for working with gaited foals.   This is an excellent book which ought to be in the library of every gaited horse enthusiast.  It should be read all the way through and then reread and referred to for the rest of one's riding career.  . 
 All Stephanie Winston books have sold well, primarily to a corporate market. Winston's forte is ORGANIZING, which can aid readers in achieving; however, organization per se is not synonymous with simplicity (IRS forms are organized and hopelessly complex!)   More-over, she rarely touches on the cerebral aspects of simplicity.  The books tends to be dry and matter-of-fact -- perfect for gung-ho career-achiever types. 
 I know that I've read this book at least twice, once in grade school and once again recently because I remembered how much I loved it the first time. There's something gripping in the way Buck developed her characters in this work, which allows us to grow and understand and experience life with them over the course of their lifetimes.  We see the central character and his dutiful, faithful wife age from a young married farming couple to rather wealthy land-owning seniors, and in between we experience all of their struggles, sorrows, joys, accomplishments, bad and good decisions, falures, and regrets right along with them. The central character is frought with natural desires and temptations as he builds his wealth and status in the community, and he appears to us all-too-human as he revels in many of the distractions that we know will bring him unhappiness and will leave his wife in sorrow.  Not only is the reader allowed to vividly experience life through Buck's characters, but she skillfully transports us to a time and place in early-twentieth-century China where we can taste the culture, the thinking of the times, the prejudices, the beliefs, the customs, and the struggles of both the rich and the common man.  This is really a beautiful and elegant work. Highly recommended 
 Ay Dios mio!  I don't know where to begin.  If you've seen the movie then owning this CD is a MUST!  If you are into foreign films then owning this CD is a MUST!  Trust me when I say that this CD and the soundtrack to Amores Perros is something that no self-respecting spanish speaker and movie goer can be without 
 This book gives great examples of how many companies forget the basic laws of differentiation.  Instead they try to look alike and follow each other like sheep in the wrong direction.    Big corporate thinking can affect businesses of all sizes where the true targets of sales growth and profits are overshadowed by ego and complacency.  The focuses on sales growth and profits will encourage you to synergize / leverage your marketing plan to get a stronger whole that the sum of its parts.    Entertaining read that will stimulate you to keep focused on marketing that has impact to set you apart from your competition.    
 View Camera Technique is a fantastic, all encompassing book  covering not only view cameras, but all aspects of photography. Everything you've ever wanted to know is in this book. It will be a reference book that I will pull off the shelf for years and years. Well done and well worth the price 
 I was an extra in this movie "MUSIC AND LYRICS", and we filmed it at Nassau Coliseum last summer 2006! I attended the New York premiere on February 12, 2007, Monday night, at the Ziegfeld Theatre, and was able to view the movie with the cast and director, whom I was able to converse with after the movie ended (He is a very nice guy!; he also did "Two Weeks Notice"). It was filmed at ADVENTURELAND amusement park here in Farmingdale (where I live), Long Island, New York, where it lasts 5 minutes in the movie and Hugh Grant sings!  This is a cute movie, and it is good, and I am not saying that because I am in it.  Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore make a good couple, and Grant's never been better!  I cannot see anyone else playing that role!  The inside of Nassau Coliseum is supposed to be the inside of Madison Square Garden in New York City, when the concert of Cora takes place, near the end of the movie; they did film outside Madison Square Garden though.  (I heard Drew is nice; she visited Target next door to Adventureland when they were filming)   They filmed 5 days at Nassau Coliseum (spent 14 hours at the Coliseum on the last day of filming), and the concert scene is only on screen for 10 minutes.  I love the music!  Bought CD when first came out on CD for $25!  2 1/2 months for the movie to go from theatre to DVD is very fast (February 14 to May 8th)!  And when the movie comes out on DVD, I will buy it the first day!  Anyone who has not seen it, see it!  And like the rest of the people who wrote here, I also agree with them, and what they wrote on amazon.  I, too, cannot get enough of the music (LOVE THE MUSIC!  And I hope next year, it is nominated for Best Music and Best Songs at the next Academy Awards IF Hollywood remembers this movie!), and will definitely see the movie again and again, when I buy it!   (I am writing under LIZ, I am Liz' former husband)   Thanks for reading!  ENJOY!

 "East of Eden" is a beautifully written, sprawling, three generation saga of the men and women who settled the Salinas Valley in California. The story begins far away in the East, on the farm of the unscrupulous Cyrus Trask and his two sons, Adam and Charles. Adam is an upright, honest young man who naturally draws people to him, while Charles has an angry, violent spirit. Charles tries in vain to earn the love of his father, and takes his anger at his failure out on Adam. Adam is sent by his father into the army as a sign of his love, but Cyrus keeps Charles close to home, knowing that war would release something dangerous and violent in his other son.   Adam wanders for many years across the country after his service, and some of the most lyrical passages in the book describe his life as a tramp, closely mirroring Steinbeck's own experiences during the Depression. Finally he returns to the farm and exists in uneasy partnership with Charles until the mysterious Cathy arrives. The more astute Charles quickly realizes her true nature, but innocent Adam marries her and they move to California.   Adam expects Cathy to pursue his dream of life on a ranch, but Cathy is a vicious, evil character with no redeeming qualities, and after the birth of twin sons she escapes only to re-emerge much later when her sons are grown. Adam hibernates for many years on the ranch, broken-hearted over Cathy's desertion, and convinced he must hide the secret from his sons forever, which become an impossible task. Repeating the pattern of their father's life, the twins Aron and Caleb vie for their father's love, with Aron effortlessly winning it while Caleb comes to believe there is something evil lurking in his spirit. But this time around, Caleb is redeemed in a way Charles never was.  Steinbeck's prose is masterful, and his descriptions of the Salinas Valley, lush with the rains, brutal with the drought, capture exactly why men were drawn to the west. His portrayals of character and motives--sadly lacking in the movie--are totally convincing, and his Adam is a flawed but admirable character.   Steinbeck has been a bit out of favor--at least until this was chosen as an Oprah book. As an English-as-a-second-language teacher I recently taught "The Pearl," and that book too surprised me with its gorgeous writing and subtle imagery. (We all read it in high school but I now realize it went right over my head.) Try Steinbeck again--you won't be disappointed--my book club wasn't! 
 This book together with the other two describes one of the French best history pieces.  Louis XIV was an extraordinary person despite certain criticism.  "Louise de La Valliere" shows a young king who is  eager to rule and has got a character that is still vulnerable at that  time.  He is in love with a woman who is honest to love the king for  himself and is not able to love anyone else.  I find this romance  fascinating and pure.  The story is based on the real characters and the  book brings us to the XVIIth century France which looks idyllic.  Dumas   practically showed us how the love, which led to the creation of  Versailles, began.  I researched the topic and I should say that the more I  learn about that time period the more I am surprised how Dumas' imagination  cuold do such a wonderful job of reviving his heros. I read many more  "serious" books after and should say that in my bad and good days  I would go back to the book and find it more interesting than before.  I  read it in English and my native language and hope that someday I will be  able to learn French to read it becccause I am sure that there is no  translation that could be able to come close to the culture itself.. 
 I love reading this book, although Henslin does need to do some serious updates.  I noticed little difference between the 7th and the 12th edition.  Please update 
 I have to concur with the other reviews.  This is the best presidential biography I have read.  If you are an American History buff then this is an excellent book.  It made me think of John Adams in a very different ligh 
  I have benefited from this book, thanks to its ready to use powerpoint slides and tools and forms. They were user friendly and effective. I would like to see more on the theoretical side , too. But still, it was worth the time and the money 
 Awesome video card.. Im using this with Dvi cable on my 22 inch Viewsonic lcd. I must say it installed great and looks awesome!! Great card for the money def a happy customer!! : 
 No one likes difficult conversations, but we must have them. This book guides you in dealing positively with these situations and conversations to make the best possible outcome 
 I think this is a nice board, and looks well equipped with a HD TV out (component video), network card DVI and VGA outputs and sound. Unfortunately the linux drivers provided on the CD didn't seem to work on my openSUSE 10.2 linux distro. It is possible to get the nVidia integrated video card and network working full speed but the sound is just good enough: only 2 channels. Overall I am happy with it (but it could be better). I haven't even tried to make the TV out work 
 This is a delightful collection of latin/jazz.  Even those who normally  tire of latin music will love this entire CD.  The instrumentation and  arrangements are a joy 
 God is using this book as a benchmark in my spiritual walk.  this is something that will stick with me for many years.  his views are much like what i think that Jesus would say today 
 The movie was suggested by Lytton Strachey's fine essay on Gordon that appeared in his classic EMINENT VICTORIANS, and indeed the story was brewing for a long time before a combination of international interests unleashed KHARTOUM in the English speaking world.  It was a time when Olivier, newly remarried and the surprised father of a young family, was desperate for money and wouild snatch up any job, so the film world was brightened, if that's the word, by Olivier appearing in any old movie if they gave him enough lucre.  It's as if he was saying, I did the repertory thing for thirty years, it's time for a payoff.  Thus we got extra helpings of ham in BUNNY LAKE IS MISSING, THE SHOES OF THE FISHERMAN, THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN, really any old blockbuster.  It was a rare 60s movie that didn't have room for Olivier in it.  He was never good in any of them, but in KHARTOUM his performance as the Mahdi causes enough offense nearly to justify, years later, the recent subway bombings in London.  With russet makeup smeared over his face (slightly different shade than the blackface he used in OTHELLO), Olivier bites every piece of scenery known to man, playing rhe Mahdi as a mad tyrannical prophet of Islam, like a Westerners fantasy of Al Qaeda, hollering for white men's blood and letting his strange fantasies about Allah cloud his limited intellect.  Next to him, Gordon (Charlton Heston) almost looks like a sane man.  Maybe the filmmakers were making some sort of antiwar statement.  At this distance it's hard to say.  What we see is pretty frightening, for there's over the top and then there's OVER THE TOP AS THE MAHDI 
 This is very easy to understand for kids and helpful if you want them to understand why you want them to eat certain foods, it explains food groups, carbs, protein, etc on a level they can understand.  I got very into nutrition and wanted a way for my 6 year old to understand it too 
 After having gone through several supposedly "authentic" books on the subject, I decided to take a cooking class. I was annoyed that my versions of Thai cuisine never seemed to even come close to even a typical restaurant. Chat was the one who was teaching that day, and in about one hour, I had somehow created my FAVORITE dish, Green Curry! I couldn't believe that with a few specialized ingredients, the elusive magic that I wanted was there. I made my own green curry paste first. THAT I think made all the difference. You can't duplicate something like this from a can or jar in some store. We did several other dishes that day during class, and every single ingredient somehow stayed distinct. What I'm trying to say is that Chat is an amazing cook! This book of his has all recipes you could want on the cuisine. And it really is authentic, because he grew up there! A big difference. He runs over how and why the food is different by region. He identifies the common unique ingredients in most of the dishes (like galangal root, thai bird eye chilies, kaffir lime, and fish sauce of course!). And there are many pictures that go along with each dish. Each recipe is all laid out and described in one page, because he makes it very easy. He's very good at explaining as well the reasons why one prepares an ingredient a certain way (like using a mortar and pestle instead of the blender). This is my favorite cookbook from a person who really made me feel like I can actually cook. I've since had four cooking parties with over ten people with recipes from Chat 
 Few works survive two and a half thousand years and remain a masterpiece. This is one of them.  Thucydides crisp account of the long struggle that brought disaster to his native Athens is remarkable for it's candor, despite events that must have been tragically painful. The text includes legendary personalities (Pericles, Alcibiades, Demosthenes, Nicias, etc): their actions, words, and fate. Facts license readers to decide what's important, and the events described are worthy of discerning the essence of humanity.  Who would have thought the promise of Persian defeat (told by Herodotus) would be squandered in a tedious contest that ultimately proved grave for all involved? Athens' distinction as the first democracy makes it a vital epic (given recent attempts to democratize the Middle East). Melos destiny at Athens' hands may give pause. As may the Syracuse expedition (especially Book Seven).  I read Warner's translation thirty years ago (it was 50p then), and still turn to it from time to time. Also recommended: `The Landmark Thucydides' (Robert Strassler, Victor Davis Hanson). This is a volume for those willing to spend a bit more to obtain the history matched with maps and footnotes 
 I really enjoyed this book.  It was highly entertaining with a thought provoking concept.  Basicly it is about the relationship between a woman and a man who, for unknown medical reasons, involuntarily time travels to different periods in his life, past and future.  Even after finishing this book, you will keep thinking about it for some time.  I reccomend it 
 A young boy is a pawn in a custody fight between his grandparents and his broken mother. While at first it appears that there is one victor in this case, the author draws out the complexities involved in such cases and adequately shows how no one wins when the custody of a child is at stake.  I found this story to be one of heart felt redemption. While the opening scene pulled me into the book, it is the young boy's voice that forced me to keep reading. This novel is tragic, tender, and most of all very real. The writing is artfully crafted and the plot, while sometimes predictable, does not disappoint. 
 I read this book and was hooked right away. I loved the authors' unique way of telling the story. I found b.b. parker's style of writing very refreshing and was immediately drawn into the characters lives. I couldn't put it down, I had to keep turning the page to find out what was going to happen next. I think the author was brilliant, this was his first book, I loved it and he so left me wanting more 
 The Good Good Pig by Sy Montgomery is an enchanting, homey story of the author's rollicking, frolicking and loving relationship she, her husband, their neighbors and many friends cherished with a 700-lb. pet pig for over a decade.  It is an entirely refreshing, charming and funny (I laughed aloud throughout the book) memoir 
 I have been going to and living in China for the last 26 years of my life. James Kynge's book, "China Shakes the World," is by far the clearest introduction to and explanation of the economic, political and social transformation -- with all the incumbent challenges -- occurring in China at the present time. This book should be read not only by businessmen, but also by anyone involved in China policy and anyone interested in China. It is accessible and, more important, makes complicated things understandable. It is subtle and non-ideological; and it is fair. I highly recommend it 
 Before I got this cd I never heard of Blind Guardian. Now I realize how left out I was, Blind Guardian is one of my more favored bands now. This album has awesome drumming and guitar playing. "I'm Alive", is my up most favorite song of all time, really fast, and a psychotic story. Who doesn't like Psychotic stories? If you are a BG fan, or just looking for a thrill, GET THIS CD. You will not regret it. 
 The is a tragic but very true to life depiction of the degradation caused by addiction to individuals, families, and society. The film is graphic in its depiction of addiction, but as an addiction counselor, who is an addict and alcoholic in recovery, it is very close to actual tragic events I have seen in the world of addiction. The emotionally disturbing events that take place in the lives of the main characters are exactly the very real things that addiction counselors are seeking to prevent. These events are the end of untreated or unchecked addiction for far too many. Unfortunately, even though some of the content may be offensive to some, it is a starkly true depiction of what the reality for some addicts becomes. Even though the film may leave one emotionally upset for a time, it is a worthwhile film to break through false pretenses about addiction's final results and the glossing over of the degradation addiction can and does lead to in real life. Watch and learn the truth about severe addiction 
 This lawyer ranks this along with Twelve Angry Men, Judgment at Nuremburg, and To Kill a Mockingbird as one of his favorite trial movies.  Most importantly, these Brit series do a much better job of NOT insulting their viewers' intelligence than the productions on this side of the Atlantic 
 This movie will never lose its place in movie history, a true classic with great actors that are truly missed and taken from us at their early ages, James Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo. I love this movie for its 50's style of teenage upbringing. The times have changed a bit, but the rebelness of teenagers has not. It was great to go back in time and watch the clothing and cars. James Dean, superb, Natalie Wood, innocent yet a wild teen, Sal Mineo, the shy young teen who idolizes his friend James Dean. 
 Carson's volume is an absolutely outstanding commentary that brings together the rigorous exegetical work of one of evangelicalism's most trusted and well-thought teachers with a pastoral heart (and Carson's is big).  The commentary is pitched at the level of the reasonably well-educated clergyman, but does not require proficiency in the biblical languages, and could certainly be useful to an advanced lay Bible student 
 A little gem of an album that is becoming increasingly rare as it spends further years inexplicably out of print.  Other reviewers got it spot on when commenting that this is definitely not ELO.  But it was never meant to be.  There is a very down to earth and back to basics feel to this very personal and intentionally self-indulgent project, clearly influenced and possibly inspired by recent collaborations with Tom Petty, Roy Orbison, George Harrison et al.  The sound that Lynne played such an integral part in creating on albums such as 'Full Moon Fever' and 'Cloud Nine', also runs through this work.  Beautifully crafted songs appear all over this rather too short masterpiece, interestingly most of which were recorded in various rooms in Lynne's very own mansion.  Although often accused of "over-producing" songs, this is not very apparent on this album, as most of the songs have an almost 'live' and intimate feel to them, perhaps because we're listening to Jeff as he is rocking away in his living room or kitchen! Other than his enormous producing expertise, Lynne's biggest asset is his astounding and unfailing voice that lends itself so effortlessly to multi-layer harmonies, to best effect on my personal favourite 'What Would It Take'.  The covers of a couple of standards detract a little from the overall direction of this album, leaving the listener a touch confused about what Lynne was trying to achieve. My personal feeling is that Jeff made this album and recorded all of the stylistically varied songs on it because he wanted to do it, which is not at all selfish or too much to ask from someone who has greatly inspired others over the years and more recently, resurrected the careers of some of his own musical heroes 
 With these words the Nez Perce Indians surrendered to the U.S. Army, having fled from Idaho across country, through Yellowstone and north to Montana, only to be cut off just miles from the Canadian border.  This and other spectacular stories will quicken the pulse of any red-blooded history buff.  We also visit cow ranchers down in Texas and learn the true, unvarnished story of Dodge City and other pestilences.  The real thing 
 I can't imagine anyone whose listened to this album and not thought of it as one of the best ever made.  I have always been a Door's fan, but L.A. Woman really emphisizes the true nature and quality of they're collaborative talents.  Jim's vocals are rough, yet smooth, and the music precisely matches the mood in every track. I would highly recommend this album to anyone who has gotten past the "Best of" phase and is interested in the real thing 
 I NEVER know why women aren't in the mood!! The frustration!! AAAAAAA!! I bought this book to help me in this area, and I have to say it has helped me out a lot. It's a must read for any guy. Another great book to read is The Hormone Desire; The Truth About Testosterone, Sexuality and Menopause. I know, these are books for women, but if you know why she isn't in the mood, you can take what is found in these two books and use it to put her IN the mood 
 A book of politics, and the craving for power that drives some people to do almost anything to get that power. The broad outlines of the story are well known. Joe McCarthy grandstanding in front of the microphones accusing all kinds of people of being communists. Never presenting any evidence he was able to ruin the lives of many Americans just to gain his own satisfaction.   Now reviled, these times really need to be viewed in the light of the times, and again now that we have learned more about those times. His accusations appear to have been unfounded. But this was the time of the Rosenberg executions. This was the time of the House UnAmerican Activities Commission (HUAC).   As we have learned since with the release of the Venona documents, the Rosenbergs were guilty (well there's some question about Ethel). The activities of HUAC harmed a lot of people, especially in Hollywood, but did it really make us safer? It also appears that there were a lot of communists in our Government. But there is no indication that McCarthy really knew that.   This is an accurate story of McCarthy's rapid rise, and his rapid fall 
 Dirty Shame is totally sleazy, raunchy, and without any redeeming social value whatsoever. It's great! It is a movie in the early John Waters manner, but with modern production values. If you're a prude, stay away. But, do you know what 'Tromboning' is? What if your girlfriend asks you to 'Sneeze in the Cabbage?' Get hip to all this and more in the movie! Get the NC-17 version, I haven't seen the R version but I hear it sucks (pun intended) 
 Robert Griswold's Property Management For Dummies is a wonderfully practical digest on property management covering every applicable subject both for those considering becoming a landlord and for long time landlords.  Easy to read, and easy to jump right to the subject on which one needs the most help, Mr. Griswold's years of experience and wisdom are made accessable to the reader.  Having been a property manager for over three years now, I was surprised by how much I learned from this book.  For anyone considering property management or being a landlord, this book lets one know in advance all the factors to weigh before making that leap.  I'll state it again -- you must have this book if you are in any way going to be involved in property management 
 As I look for all my faux finishing books, not one of the books could describe lovely finishes any better or any easier. My stucco and blocks have turned out marvelously...just like the book! Now that's what we like 
 The brilliant young protagonist, who has a rather uncomfortable relationship with laws, considerable financial resources, and access to a fantasy kingdom composed of fairies and others, leads his reader on a merry adventure.  It seems he has constructed a computer-like device based on pilfered technology of the fairies.  His attempt to sell it to an obnoxious and unscrupulous adult business mogul goes seriously badly.  From then on, it's Artemis and his resources working to right the problems that deal-gone-wrong has created.  This is my first taste of Colfer's Artemis, and I enjoyed it enough to look forward to reading some of the others.  The blend of fantasy, contemporary fiction, science fiction and adventure works well.  The reader can overlook Artemis' questionable choices and find an engaging young fellow, one easy to root for.  The secondary characters, the bodyguards and fairy-world folk in particular, are lots of well-made fun.  Young readers will surely enjoy it, and I must wonder if, after the final installment of Harry Potter, his readers will turn to this.  
 Wonderful book! This will make you rethink the health benefit options you select at enrollment 
 We ordered Ranger Rick for our kidergartener grandson. He loves receiving the magazine in the mail. The gorgeous photos pique his interest and encourage him to "read" through every page. We spend time reading the articles aloud to him, thus enjoying some "quality" time with each other. He remembers much of the information, which enhances his learning skills. All-in all, the Ranger Rick subscription is a plus. We figure, as time goes by, our grandson will enjoy the magazine for years to come, especially when he's able to read the articles himself 
 A most comprehensive treatment of Outlook.  Extremely well suited for an experienced Outlook user, with many details on the use in a server/business environment.  Describes the interrelationship with Windows Outlook Express.  Probably a little too comprehensive for the single system user just trying to read and write a few email messages. Subject matter is exceptionally well presented and thorough. 
 The first Shania Twain record I bought was Come On Over and although it was a #1 worldwide smash, I didn't like it except for some ballads. I thought..is this Country? And if it is so what happended to Country music during the 90's? The only thing left on most songs is the steel guitar but the rest are screaming electric guitars + lots of other noises. It seems like heavy rock to me compared to Country music from the 60's through the  80's. With the second try of a Shania Twain record it was again a flop. "Up" has some nice ballads but out of 19 songs only 3 or 4 are bearable. Since 1997 Shania Twain cannot be considered a Country artist nor a crossover artist. It's pure Pop. My last try, however, was this "Woman in me" because all the reviews said it was more country like. This is true. Shania Twain WAS Country during the first half of the 90's. On this CD at least 8 out of 12 are real nice. Instead of buying new material I will go backwards and get the first Shania's records.   
 I'll admit that any book with the work heresies in the title has an automatic advantage in peaking my interest, but this volume does so much more than merely entice. MacCoun and Reuter have done an amazing job of looking that drug prohibition from a new point of view. Frankly, despite the passage of a few years, I believe that this book is absolute essential if one hopes to really understand the controversy over the War on Drugs.  Rather than attempt a summary of the contents, let me simply point to three specifics as representative of the wealth of insight the reader will encounter. First, MacCoun and Reuter have expanded the typical dichotomous legalization v criminalization perspectives to include depenalization and commercialization. Counter the arguments of drug prohibitionists, depenalization does not seem to be inextricably intertwined with massive increases in the prevalence of drug use as is anticipated with legalization. Also, legalization may have less negative increases in prevalence without the accompaniment of commercialization. By adding these two considerations, MacCoun and Reuter enable expansion of the debate into potentially fertile areas for improving the consequences of prohibition.  Secondly, the careful analysis of the 48 negative consequences of prohibition and the related causal linkage to enforcement, illegal status, and use should be the focus of careful reflection by every reader. In many respects, the damage caused by the War on Drugs is a kind of collateral damage - unintentionally caused by the implementation of US prohibition efforts.   Thirdly, MacCoun & Reuter reconceptualize the total harmfulness of illicit drugs as the interaction of three factors: prevalence, intensity, and micro harm (i.e., user self-damage). Much of the criticism of drug prohibition deals with the extensive micro harm without equal weight being given to the total harmfulness to our society. The negative correlation between prevalence and micro harm is among the more interesting possibilities to consider.  In summary, it is quite difficult to imagine a more sensitive evaluation of drug prohibition that so carefully considers the US case in light of the European context and the historical experience with legal addictive substances (alcohol and tobacco). I cannot recommend this book more highly. 
 While this sequesl to EON clears up and tidies some aspects presented in the first book, there are some jumbled parts. I wanted more time spent with the Jarts interacting. Maybe get into the Jarts head some more? The  religious concepts and misunderstandings are as fresh today as when this was written 
 The book was in great condition, brand new, speed was ok, great overall 
 I wish more people could see that their humanity in the world rather than try to be God, or relentlessly seek answers when none exist. This is a brilliant discourse on the sadder parts of the human experience. Rather than try to alleviate pain by trying to find out why a tragedy happened, etc ... it is often more healing to also see the humanity of an event when no real explanation is possible. Bad things happen to good people and vice-versa. This world is complex and simple at the same time. But most of all, this book is a blessing against the current wave of New Age blame game mumbo jumbo...  The New Age (distinct from metaphysical teachings from ancient wisdom) is the serpent in the tree with the poison apple. It is the taking of ancient spiritual teachings and commercializing them as false prophets for profit. Allow people there humanity just like what the author of this book is doing. And perhaps authentic healing can occur 
 I enjoyed the encouragement and the practicle tips and instructions.  It's doable and just what I was looking for -  a good course in a book.  It's a fast read. The author understands what is needed and he delivers.  He delivers it well 
 A unique look at the body/mind connection that uses foods to help you feel better emotionally and physically 
 I remember reading LotR and I loved the series and the Peter Jackson version. Once I heard of the Monopoly edition of LotR, I was excited. I soon won the LotR Monopoly edition. I came home, invited some relatives and soon had a great time!  As you know, Monopoly is a game inwhich you have to be the ultimate monopoly. You buy and sell property, and if you own Mt. Doom and Bara-dur (Boardwalk and Park Place in the original Monopoly) then you get a monopoly. You can build strongholds (houses) and fortresses (hotels) and everytime a rival lands on your property, then he has to give you power (money). If you can't pay the rent then you'll become bankrupt and you are out. You also have to avoid jail.  There is some new tokens that resemble characters from LotR. If you had a look at the screenshots of this Monopoly game then you'll notice a lot of changes. But there is a new optional rule you can play with in this version; everytime you roll an "Eye of Sauron" (also counts as one) the golden ring will move to one territory per eye, where you can add strongholds. If you land on a territory with the ring, you may get it for FREE! If you land on an owned territory with the ring on it, you have to pay double the rent.  So, if you are a 100% die-hard LotR that only enjoy the books, then you can miss. But if you are looking for a Monopoly board or for LotR stuff, I recommend this game then  Note: If Tolkien lived to see this, he would have died immediatly. Infact, I think he's rolling in his grave as I am typing this review. 
 We have a 2+ year old who LOVES his Thomas the Tank stuff... and this engine is no exception. It is built well enough to handle being played with (by a 2 year old, no less) on a daily basis, carried around in a diaper bag (it's the perfect size restaurant toy), and has been dropped out of our car onto the driveway on more than one occasion and still is no worse for the wear. Highly recommended 
 Lennie, tell your dad to make sure it's an audible download!  I'm on a streak of listening to baseball books--The Summer Game, Three Days in August--and I surely want to add your father's to the list.  His interview on Imus this morning really whetted my appetite for the book. Sounds like one terrific book. 
 This little gem got me thinking, feeling, wishing, wanting, seeing, understanding and MORE! Definitely one to try out and work on it in your daily life 
 Now I know why I listed Walter Mosley as my favorite person. His books are always riveting. I never thought I would like a character as much as I love Easy Rawlins and Mouse. But I couldn't be more wrong. Socrates is now my favorite character. I love Walter Mosley style of writing he reminds me of a modern day Langston Hughes. Another great boo 
 I have watched this movie probably 20 times....consider it one of the best love movies ever along with "The Notebook", "The Wedding Date", "Sleepless in Seattle", and some of the oldies.  Keep em' coming! 
 We love this book and are purchasing a second copy so we can cut out the images and frame them.  Ashley Bryan is a master of art!  Bryan uses only portions of poems by wonderful poets, the stanzas chosen match the images  perfectly and make the reader want to find the entire poem to read! Highly  recommended by this famil 
 This is a classic teen romantic comedy from 1984. Hard to believe it is now 22 years old as of 2006! Molly Ringwald is mad for Jake whose dating the womanly Caroline while a geek pursues Molly. Sweet Sixteen is Sour Sixteen as her family forgets her birthday and her older sister's wedding eclipses everything. It still seems relevant now that we are all into the late 20's/early 30's.... and makes many of us sigh with relief that we are long gone from high school and never to return 
 Light weight, quiet, and powerful suction.  My only issues are the cord is short and the beater bar isn't that powerful (it stops on thick carpet sometimes).  Only buy this if you have a lot of hard floors to clean.  Also, buy the refurbished unit to save some cash...Most of the time it's just a returned items someone didn't like and the manufacturer repackages it.     
 Not too much of a Chick Flick.  Good Story Line with many likeable characters.  So if the wife wants a movie...this one should do for the both of you.  Antonio for her, and a few honies for you 
 First and foremost, this book is an oustanding, fantastic introduction to the world of infectious diseases. Because of two factors, however, much informatoin is lost. Firstly, the book is rather short - hardly three hundred pages. Secondly, there are thousands of years to cover in such a volume. As a result, the reader is left with a superficial - albeit insightful - look at the history of diseases throughout history.  Karlen attempts - and succeeds, as best as expected - to do three things in this book. He begins by discussing the disease, or outbreak, at hand. Syphilis, tuberculosis, legionnaire's, marberg, ebola are all covered - en brief. Then, he goes on to elaborate on the social climate of the time, to set a context for the reader. He then discusses the impact that these diseases had on thepopulace.  As a personal fiend of specific, explicit writings on the physiological results of diseases, I was somewhat disappointed: AIDs is hardly discussed, and the physical descriptions and onsets are scant, if existant. However, Karlen's adept critical thinking  - he analyzes the social impact, etc of each outbreak -  makes this book worthwhile.  Overall, a good introduction. I kept notes through this book on topics that I was interested in exploring further, and was not disappointed 
 College bookstores do a brisk "buy back" business at the end of each term. Since I started using "Naked" in my basic public speaking classes, the bookstore has to regularly order new editions because so many students want to keep this book! Hoff captures vividly the sense of public speaking as a MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP, not a one-way autocracy. His coverage of communication apprehension/speech fright is excellent as is his coverage of first impressions, delivery, and audience analysis (which includes language use and setting analysis). His coverage of organization is less developed, but it is a treat to see his use of classical Roman rhetoric in establishing a basic organizational pattern (although he is incorrect in claiming that Cicero wrote the first manual of oratory---that credit goes to the earlier Greeks, Corax and Tisias). This book moves basic public speaking out of an artificial classroom setting to the larger world in which students will spend their professional and personal lives. Hoff's enthusiasm and experience go a long way to convincing readers that they too can achieve "the perfect moment" in connecting with an audience. Bravo 
  If you plan to buy this book by all means get this edition. The novel is very readable and Greene is a real wordsmith. The thing is this edition has news articles by the author about Indochina, critical reviews (the good and the bad), interviews with Ho Chi Minh and American generals, a plot summary of the film and documents about the war. It also has topics for discussion or school papers. The text is less than 200 pages and readable so there is time to read the additional material. This book has the last chapter first such that you know the final result and the rest is leading up to the events in the first chapter. It is a gimmick but it works. I had to re-read the first chapter when I finished; couldn't help it. Find this edition, Viking Critical Library.    
 This book has everything.  It educates the reader on the various looms available and what you can make with them, discusses the different kinds of yarn you can use, and introduces knitting terms and equipment needed for loom knitting.   For the beginning loomer it assumes no previous knowledge, and explains step-by-step how to use your loom, from casting on to binding off and everything in-between, with clear illustrations throughout. For the more advanced loomer, how to do stitches other than the e-stitch are explained, and then used in projects from simple to advanced.   If you can only buy one book on loom knitting, make it this one! 
 I have to agree with another reviewer regarding the tagline, ". . . whichever side you take, you're wrong."  Well that's just not true.  Any clear thinker can see the professor thinks he is interacting with a benign entity, a student who is floundering and needs his help.  Unbeknownst to him, he is actually being visited by evil incarnate.  Whichever side you take, you're either dead wrong or dead right.    Carol has struggled to get into college, and is now struggling to stay there at all.  She is extremely frustrated.  She is obviously her own worst critic, and as such is making college much more difficult than it needs to be by demanding that someone make her understand the material RIGHT NOW, and if a teacher is presenting material that is beyond her, it means she is stupid.  Nobody likes feeling that.  But in her mind, the teacher is actively saying that she is stupid, so she is going to make him pay.  And she knows that she has no argument against him, so she does what any evil person would do:  disregard the message, and destroy the messenger.    Carol is clearly a young, confused college student.  Not uncommon.  She has an IQ that obviously average.  ("I don't understand." and "what does that mean?" about 400 times each).  Common, by definition.  She is naive to a degree that is disturbing.  Not so common, which gives me some small amount of comfort, that people like this might be few and far between.  These are her core flaws.  And then she hears her own teacher say that higher education might be a big swindle, might be a fake construct of a bygone age, might be of dubious use, and hardly anything more than a big game.  The professor thinks that by making light of higher education, he might get her to stop being so tense, lighten up, and give herself a break.  He deliberately provokes her in an attempt at a lively debate.  He wants her to take the opposite position, argue for it, and perhaps win, all to get her to stop living in her notebook and to start THINKING.    Together, with her core flaws and the unsurprisingly low grade she has received, the result is not a flawed mind opening, but a towering rage -- a rage that badly distorts her view of the world.  Her professor suddenly stops being someone who wants to help her, and morphs into:  a sexist, a classist, an elitist, a patriarch, a rotten man who would use his sex, his position, his experience, his reputation, and his own "vile" belief systems to acquire power and exert it over everyone he can for his own gain.  Her hatred is her rationale.   Great movie.  Intense.  Don't for a second believe that these two characters have opposite but equal arguments.  Two arguments:  one based on fact, motivated by a desire he help a student learn, the other based on a sick fantasy, motivated by a limitless desire to destroy the wrongly perceived source of a person's problems.  Mamet does it again.  Whew 
 The thing that impressed me most about these poems (that range in time from before the Han Dynasty up to China in the Middle Ages) is the humanity of the writers that is expressed so simply, sucinctly and eloquently.  There are several poems by women which add a greater range of perspective to this collection.  Valuable insights about that which is grave and constant in the human experience.  Emotions of lost love, unrequitted love and mourning are dealt with among other emotions. 
 The beauty and heart within this book is amazing. I don't see how anyone could read it and not walk away affected if not completely changed. The author has a way of writing that makes you feel alive. I encourage anyone, regardless of faith, to read this book. I, for one, am giving several away for Christmas presents 
 We purchased the Magellan GPs system to take on our cross country (Washington to Pennsylvania to Florida to Washington) trip in September, 2006.  It was very helpful in guiding us to motels, places to eat, shopping, etc.  I would recommend it to anyone. 
 This book is the sequel to Stroud's excellent "Engineering Mathematics", which focused on the undergraduate engineer and the math that he/she should know by graduation. This book continues on with crystal-clear discussions of numerical methods, linear algebra including the singular value decomposition and its uses, linear programming methods, multiple integration, and partial differential equations, to name a few of the topics covered. Just because the mathematics is more advanced in this book does not mean that it is any less clear than its less advanced predecessor. Stroud continues his tradition of holding your hand and leading you through every question you might have about working various types of math problems. I particularly liked his coverage of partial differential equations and numerical linear algebra topics. That is because it is hard to find advanced math books on these topics that are not written by pure mathematicians. Thus most of those books have a tendency to go overboard on proofs and not focus on the practical matters engineers must know in order to solve problems. The only negative thing I can say about the book is that it references Stroud's other book on engineering math, "Engineering Mathematics", during some of the explanations, possibly putting you at a disadvantage if you don't have it handy. I highly recommend this book as a reference every engineer should own. NOTE: For some strange reason this review of "Advanced Engineering Mathematics" is appearing under that book and also "Vector Analysis" by the same authors. This is NOT a review of "Vector Analysis", just to clear up any confusion 
 Without seeming overdramatic, this is the book we who have been in youth ministry for awhile have been waiting for.  Dean and Foster move right to the heart of the matter: youth workers are called first and foremost to be  PASTORS to their students, not simply recreation directors. Skillfully  blending scripture, theology, the social sciences, and personal experience,  these practitioners offer both rich theory and application to assist youth  workers in rethinking why we do youth ministry. In my opinion, this is the  book that will most shape youth ministry in this postmodern era 
 Because Warren Buffet has a copy of it on his shelf.  
 This is a long and very detailed book.  I knew it was not going to be easy reading when I started it.  To my surprise, the first part of the book was quite compelling and not at all difficult to read.  At about the halfway point of the book's nearly 600 pages of text, I got bogged down in the details of party politics and it was rough slogging.  It took me several weeks to get through that part, but by the time it got to the chapter, "Working Toward the Fuhrer," my attention was once again riveted to the book.  I knew very little about the personal life of Hitler and still cannot say that I know much more.  Apparently nobody knew the real Hitler.  But Kershaw's book certainly made me see him more as an individual rather than as a symbol of evil.  I got a great deal out of this book and I have a much better understanding of how Hitler came to power.  What I found most interesting about the book was the idea that everyone supposedly "knew what the Fuhrer wanted" and acted accordingly.  So much of the evil of Nazi Germany was voluntary and done without being ordered to do so.  People were encouraged to take actions that they "knew" Hitler would approve.  It was a mindset not unlike "knowing what God would want me to do."  Hitler had indeed, through propagandistic promotion, become a deity.  Kershaw's biography, in conjunction with Frederic Spotts' HITLER AND THE POWER OF AESTHETICS, gives a very good idea of what life in Germany was like during Hitler's rise and why the German people found him so appealing.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the causes of World War II.  Even though the book is extremely long, none of it is superfluous.  I would not cut any of it.  I plan to read volume II, even though it too is quite a tome.  This book is worth spending time on.  Five stars 
 "Thank God It's Friday" has the best disco soundtrack ever.. Much better than Saturday Night Fever. You have After Dark by Patti Brooks, Romeo and Juliet" Performed by Alec R. Costandinas, I'm Here again by Thelma Houston, not to mention Last dance by Donna Summer, just to name a few. The story is minimal but cute..but if you were around in the disco era and went to discos this movie will take you back and make you smile .This is another movie I can watch over and over and it only becomes more endearing. A must for disco fans or people that are curious about the late 70's early 80's club culture. 
 I read SINGULARITY before SPIRITUAL which, of course, is exactly the wrong order.  In the time since this book was published he has had an opportunity (in SINGULARITY) to reflect, confirm and gloat if you will. Unlike Drake, who promised we would receive confirmation of extraterrestrial life by the year 2000, Kurzweil is amazingly accurate. He forecast an extremely short discovery period for the Human Genome (confounding the "experts" who predicted 100s of years).  He stated that Big Blue would defeat a human - this after a devestating defeat. He correctly predicted the exponential rate of computer power and all that this implies for our future.   When he says "spiritual" - a word I am uncomfortable with - he is not assigning theological or mystical characteristics. More accurately he is describing a "human" machine, a machine with its philosophical underpinnings as human but yet it is more than human. The Age of Human Machines would be a more apt title.  The book is not straight forward (perhaps by design) making the reader browse, go back, skip, etc.   Many readers take their eye off the mark and get stuck in local or current events - starvation in Africa, war in the Mideast, ethnic cleansing, ecology, global warming, etc.  Yet none of these has had any effect on the rate of the acquisition of knowledge. We have reached a point where progress is almost self-sustaining - the more we discover, the more we know how much we don't know.  Like a boulder rolling down a hill, the rush to research, experiment and design shows no sign of slowing. I was less than impressed with the discussion about consciousness and the future of the universe. Does a machine that is aware that it is learning "conscious"?  Is consciousness simply a function of having enought nodes operating in parallel? If spiritual machines come to fruition history will veer into new directions we cannot conceive. 
 Jack Off Jill is a band from South Florida, and I believe they are considered Gothic Rock.    This album is awesome, with great music and beat and with Jessicka Fodera's amazing voice taking you through the scary, depressed, and powerful lyrics.    I recommend this album to anyone who wants music that differs from the norm, and someone that is not put off by a band that isn't afraid to say (and do, if you ever had the pleasure of seeing them live.  If you haven't, sorry, they broke up in 2000) some pretty controversial stuff.  If you can't get enough of Jessicka's voice (like me), she did a song with My Ruin (Miss Ann Thrope) and she is with another band now called "Scarling. 
 Through ethnographic research the author highlights the intersections between middle, working and lower class African Americans in Groveland, a primarily African Americans middle class community in Chicago.  Despite  arguments that the African American middle class is flourishing, Patillo  McCoy documents how racial segregation and racism confines many middle  class African Americans to neighborhoods that frequently have to battle  issues such as crime, gangs and drug use, that white middle class  neighborhoods do not.  In addition she does an excellent job of tying in  the consumer wants and desires of African American youth and adults with  the capitalist nature of American society 
 This book offers a very complete and detailed guide into conducting case study research, which is not only useful for researchers in social sciences, but also for business research. It is virtually the only book on  case study research at this level and practically helps researchers that  are planning to conduct case study research to avoid the pitfalls that are  luring for this complex and difficult research strategy/design and which  pitfalls have made the case study approach not so popular in the academic  community that deals with business research 
 Take a look at America's favorite pastime through the analytical tools of the economist.  This study is so easy to read, you don't need a background in economics to enjoy it 
 I just would like to say that this cd is the one my family has listened to forever! or it seems like that. im only 16, however, Vince Gills CD is the first one my family puts in the cd player around this time of year. it just really brings us all together! it deserves a Lot more than 5 stars!  ;- 
 Lee Frost is an extremely able photographer who also happens to be quite a practical businessman.  In Photos That Sell, he shares a good deal of what he has learned about taking and marketing photos successfully.  He begins by walking you through the main markets that are likely to be open to your work and then moves on to what types of shots you can best hope to sell.  Helping to iilustrate all of this is a collection of hundreds of Mr. Frost's photos.  The variety and quality of these photographs is worth the price of the book all by themselves.  It's fairly impressive how deftly he shifts between portraiture, landscape, and still life photography.  If this book has a shortcoming, it is that it could stand revising to bring it current.  In the digital age, things have a way of changing quickly and this book is now 5 years old.  While the book does cover digital technology, it was written in a time when digital cameras were far less capable than they currently are and many markets have opened up to them as they have improved.  Overall, I would certainly recommend the book.  If the author brings out a new edition to cover the ever-increasing role of digital photography then purchasing it will be a must for budding freelancers 
 The Gift is a chilling tale set in the south written by Billy Bob Thornton, the talented man that also wrote Sling Blade.  First off, it is IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO GIVE THIS MOVIE LESS THAN 3 STARS. Why? Because of the incredible cast. Here, you'll find probably one of the best casts ever. It has Cate Blanchett, Hilary Swank, Greg Kinnear, an actor whom I can't remeber his name but who is brilliant and Keannu Reeves. Keannu Reeves? A good actor? Damn straight. He was brilliant in this movie and deserved an oscar nomination for best supporting actor. I am not kidding. His performance was remarquable! The movie is about a widow, mother of 3, making her money as a psychic. But, she gets involved with a woman whose abusive boyfriend is ready to do anything. This psychic is a scared mother that only seems to be loved and watched over by one person. And only one. You'll find that one out on your own.  This movie is packed with suspense that had me on the edge of my seat. So, watch this brilliant movie that I will definitely add to my collection 
 In the book Hold me Close, let me Go the author, Adair Lara shares her experience in raising her daughter and the good and bad times they shared. This got you really involved in the book, it's strenghts were that it got you involved in the characters lives. You could relate to what they were ffeeling and thinking, because everyone person once in their lives has gone through and felt the same thing. One of the book's weaknesses was that the author exagerates the conflicts a bit much. This makes you think that the book is a bit too dramatical. There are some parts in the book were you could relate to the conflicts that were taking place but your reaction when it happened to you was totally differnt. It was also interesting hearing the authors opinion and how she delt with the situation. Over all I think the book was a very good book, and I would recomend it to any teenage girl who thinks they're the only ones going through difficulties with their parents and their lives 
 I am in love with Tilly and the Wall.  After hearing their first album "Wild Like Children" for the first time around a year ago, I was instantly hooked by the group's unique style and carefree sound. It's not too often that a band decides to forego the typical drumset for a drum machine, but when a band passes up both of those items for a tap dancer and trash can lids...well, it's time to have some fun! That being said, "Bottoms of Barrels" is a lot of the same, and so much more.  Mike Mogis steps in this timme around as producer, and it shows. The man famous for working with bands like Bright Eyes and The Concretes has made Tilly and the Wall sound much more well-rounded and polished. No longer does Tilly and the Wall sound like a one-trick high school gimmick band. They sound legitimate now, yet they maintain their signature sound.  The album begins with "Rainbows in the Dark," the standard Tilly and the Wall song that doesn't stray much from "Fell Down the Stairs, "the lead-off track to their previous album. What is noticably different, however, is the lyrical content. Whereas "Wild Like Children" was essentially an album about kissing, dancing, and other fun "Child-ish" things, "Bottoms of Barrels" contains more adult lyrics and even more of an adult sound. "Love Song," for example, is perhaps Tilly and the Wall's first attempt at a true acoustic guitar ballad. It is not only more mature than any Tilly and the Wall song before it, but it is also beautiful, well-written, and utterly unique. This matured Tilly and the Wall is all over the place on the album, notably on "Lost Girls" and "Coughing Colors." Despite this, the band has managed to maintain what made them so attractive in the past.  "Bottoms of Barrels" is a really fun album. The first single "Bad Education," for example, perfectly displays how the band has matured musically, yet remained true to their fans and their sound. Additionally, songs like "Sing Songs Along," "Black and Blue," and "The Freest Man" will be stuck in your head for days (and perhaps longer, but I've only had the CD for a week). Don't be mistaken. Tilly and the Wall is back, and they are louder, happier, and more fun-loving than ever before. This album completely wallops their previous efforts, and I am still obsessed with them.  By all means, "Bottoms of Barrels" is an amazing album. Tilly and the Wall is one of the most underappreciated and unnoticed bands in music today. Hopefully, this album will help get them the admiration and attention that they undoubtedly deserve. Indeed, with such attractive melodies and beautiful lyrics, there's nothing on this album that should go unloved. "Bottoms of Barrels" is one of the best albums of 2006 thus far, and from the sound of it, Tilly and the Wall has much much more in store for us!!  Recommended for fans of Tilly and the Wall, Mates of State, The Boy Least Likely To and anyone who needs music to accompany their carefree activities, like playing in the sprinkler.  Key Tracks: 1. "Rainbows in the Dark" 2. "Bad Education" 3. "Love Song: 4. "Sing Songs Along" 5. "Black and Blue"  5 out of 5 Star 
 I have to say that when I for the first time heard the song "God" I was amazed! Such a great song and such a great singer with great message! This album is like a Christian answer to Alanis Morissette's "Jagged Little Pill", only much better! This whole album is basically same kind of Christian rock and it's working for me! Rebecca has such a great voice and her voice is superb! The album has much more to give than "God" - "You're the Voice", "Go And Sin No More", "You Then Me", and "Me Without You" for exapmple. "Speak to Me", "That's Waht Matters", and "A Cold Heart Turns" are such great peaceful songs! Rebecca has proved that she has a perfect voice to sing both peaceful and heavy songs! Stars: God, You Then Me, You're the Voice, Abba (Father), Go And Sin No Mor 
 I was contemplating all sorts of $$$$ home theater controllers, and decided to give this thing a shot. I was fully prepared to have to call technical support and go through brian surgery to figure this thing out.  Well, to my pleasant surprise, the PC software installed on my laptop without a hitch, it was immeidately detected by the PC through the provided USB cable, and the software wizard walked me through everything very intuitively and the controller was managing all of my equipment (Adcom, Sony, Cable Box with DVR, 10 year old Laser Disc player, brand new TV, Sanyo Projector...etc.) without fault in less than 30 minutes from box opening to deployment.    The ability to name the buttons is great and its size and display are perfect with a very kool blue glow for the buttons that is activated when it detects being picked up.  Comes with a nice charger so you never have to replace batteries either.  Best money spent, great value, and it WORKS. I cannot imagine running my gear without it.  Very easy to use by all genders of all ages.  I have no idea why anyone would want to spend $3,000 and have custom programming done for some of the larger controllers - unless you have really bad eyes and need the larger LCD display those controllers offer or if you have a burning need to put your hometheater installers kids through college. 
 I have enjoyed all of Kathy Reichs books, but her first book is still her best.  This book introduced me to a character I have grown very fond of, and look forward to each novel she has put out since.  I recommend them all highly.  I actually tried to read Patricia Cornwell after reading Ms. Reichs' books, but found them not quite as enjoyable.  The only book I do not recommend of the Temperance Brennan novels is the one written by Max Allan Collins, Bone Buried Deep, in which he has "borrowed" the Temperance Brennan character.  It is poorly written, and poorly researched 
 This book took me back to my schooldays in the old Soviet Empire (not a capitalist one, and yet in a perpetual state of war both internally and externally).  More specifically, to my mandatory propaganda classes run by highly trained and experienced Soviet counter-intelligence officers.  This book is so smartly written it would make them proud!  Why?  Let me quote from memory "To get people to see things your way and join your cause follow few basic but very important rules:  Speak to their instincts and their hearts; not to their minds. Attempts to reason with your targets at the intellectual level are bound to trigger critical thinking, at which point you as good as lost them.  So do not engage in discussions and do not state facts to advance your cause, i.e. do not follow "there is X and there is Y therefore this is A".  This makes your targets focus on X and Y which they may question, they may add a Z, and challenge your arrival at A as manipulation of facts.  Which it needs to be - only smarter.  Therefore, present targets with statement A first and win over their hearts and instincts.  Then present facts X and Y selectively "to illustrate".  Trick is that by then your targets will have already bought A and will happily accept X and Y as "factual justification".  Of course they are only self-rationalizing why they bought your A in the first place, but this is exactly what you need to make A stick.  Always use short simple sentences, big numbers, bigh words, bright colors, make sweeping statements...  It may be counter-intuitive, but your targets will always have a propensity to believe big lies than small facts.  And once they belive, they will be able to explain away anything that does not fit into their belief.  This is how you set in motion self-sustaining process and know that you have succeeded."  And so it goes.  And this is what this book does, and this is why it is so effective.  Have fun reading it!  And remember Fox Mulder - "I want to believe" : 
 I just want to say that this material is as valuable for the male as it is for the female.  Just as the stories are timeless and archetypal, so are the messages contained within.  I'd recommend WWRWW to anyone interested in  inner work and understanding, and also the Theatre of the Imagination (two  volumes) audio series, which doesn't suffer from the perception that it is  for women (only) 
 I loved the parts of the movie with Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle.  The Victorian romance was more interesting than the modern one.  I particularly liked knowing more about the romance of Ash and Cristobal than they knew.  I rented this film and afterwards bought one for my collection.  It is a keeper 
 The mark of a successful coming of age story is that you, the reader, can see yourself reflected in the protagonist.  For me, this book worked very well.  Will McLean, the main character and first-person narrator, a second generation Irish boy, son of a Marine, a mongrel outsider in the pedigreed Carolina Military Institute searches for himself, the man within the boy who is being molded by a system of discipline and honor that doesn't match his internal morality.  He's an English major in a college of warriors.  He's a basketball player, a finesse guard, in a school of brute force.  He's fighting against systems he doesn't understand within a life choiceless in it's inequality.    Pat Conroy, himself a graduate of the model for the fictional Institute, The Citadel, weaves a compelling tension-filled story while eloquent in his setting, Charleston, South Carolina.  Employing gracious proper Southern dialect filled with flowers, antiques, and tradition, he describes brutality, racism, sexism, and betrayal.  The language works well because it provides within its description the biting irony of the scenes.  Will McLean fights through every taboo the South has to offer in the 1960's:  a black cadet in the all-white tradition of the military college, an unwed pregnant girl shunned by society for her shame while the father of her baby remains blameless, the brutal plebe system that crushes individuality while remaking young men as soulless military automatons, the classed society of high south old money and it's cruelty to those not born within the circle, and the fact that military honor doesn't equate to individual morality.    Fighting through this maze of pitfalls, McLean has only his closest and dearest friends to rely on, roommates Dante "Pig" Pignetti and Mark Santoro, two brawny, Northern boys of Italian descent and Tradd St. Croix, an "old Charlestonian" (from a very rich and respected family).  His moral guide through the story is the epitomy of hard military men, Colonel "Bear" Berrineau, a vulgar battle-scarred man whose character is unimpeachable and whose idea of duty includes awful repercussions.    I loved this story and I couldn't put it down.  If I had one criticism to give, it's that Conroy tried to put too much into the novel - too many problems and taboos and tried to fix hundreds of years worth of problems in one book.  But, that's not really a criticism because he did it and did it well.  Bravo.  CV Ric 
 While this was a faster paced book than usual for Dickens, and expertly written, the marked darkness of this piece is hard to avoid. Dickens is known for tackling the serious issues of his time and this is no different. He paints a scathing portrait of industrialism and a world only big enough for cold hard facts. The novel takes place in Coketown, a place laden with serpentine smoke and oppressed by the heavy burden of industry; a place where intelligence is to be fostered, but the imagination quashed. I suppose my only complaint is that this book is totally devoid of comic characters. Dickens' ability to caricaturize is amazing and he deprives his readers of that comic relief here. It really could have used a "Uriah Heep" or "Fagin." Sure, these characers are villainous, but also darkly comic...characters one loves to hate. Without this element, Hard Times leaves one a bit depressed. Don't get me wrong, it is a good read, I just cannot put it into the same category with David Copperfield and Dombey and Son 
 My son received this cook book when he was five and has enjoyed making the recipes.  Of all of the kids' cookbooks we have, this is the most kid-friendly.  Simple, step-by-step instructions with drawings to show them exactly how to do it. And, it is great at stating when an adult helper needs to be involved.  The recipes are easy enough for 5-7 year olds (or 41 year olds!) and gives a great sense of accomplishment when finished.  Although not a lot of variety (3-4 recipes per section), it's got enough to warrant the purchase 
 This device was as advertised. Arrived in new box and was as promised. 
 It was what I needed for my high school public speaking class.  The students are able to listen to great speeches. This way they had a reference to what makes an excellent speech.  
 Good guidebook to have with you. Lots of hints and good places to eat 
 This book was very well written and so much fun to read.    Frank Abagnale tells his story with the same flare and finesse that he pulled off the cons of his criminal career.    Entertaining from start to finish 
 Frank Abagnale Jr. stands as one of the greatest con artists of all time. The story is inflated at times (in the introduction he claims to turn on the autopilot of a commercial jet liner, a task that in fact requires the actual ability to fly the plane to begin with). Still, the Catch Me If You Can is engaging, and Abignale's scams combine inventiveness and good humor. Enjoy 
 This book should be read by anyone the least bit interested in breeding better dogs. Not light reading but extremely valuable to the serious breeder. The Author gives a basic course on genetics and backs up her facts. She applies these principles easily to dogs and makes it easy to understand. The photos and graphs are very helpful.The section on color inheritance is fascinating!If you are not interested in improving your breed do not bother but if you dedicated to your breed this book is invaluable 
 I agree with the other reviews here, a very special movie and one that will be of special interest to amateur filmmakers, budding actors, etc for its humourous yet realistic portrayal of 'the scene'.  Worth special mention is then-unknown Chris Walken's performance as a small-time Lothario. I remember watching this film when it was first released in theaters, and was very impressed by this newcomer to the screen. Alas, after playing the psycho GI in The Deer Hunter the following year, he became forever typecast for 'weird' roles. You can really see Walken's largely untapped potential to play complete unrelated roles here. Hence if you're a Walken fan, you have to see this one.  Would love to see this one come out on DVD. C'mon guys, do it 
 I like to give books like this (ie, "Getting Old Sucks"; Dave Barry Turns 50) to all my friends when they hit the "Big 5-oh"! It makes getting older a little less painful when you laugh... 
 I fell in love with Deanna Durbin when I was about ten years old watching her movies on television. Viewing this colletion of her work confirmed that 40 years later I'm still in love with her! This collection begins with her second film in 1936 and ends with her second last film in 1947 and it is wonderful to watch the cute faced headstrong young girl mature into a beautiful woman. Deanna's ability to sing from opera to popular songs of the era is clearly illustrated in this collection and it is also interesting to hear her voice change from the bubbling sounds of youth in "Three Smart Girls" to the richer mature quality in "Can't Help Singing". Along with Deanna Durbin there are great appearances by other stars such as Donald O'Connor, Charles Laughton, Robert Cummings, Edward Everett Horton and Robert Stack not to mention a cameo appearance by opera star Jan Peerce. If you want to enjoy one of the most beautiful voices ever to be recorded on film then this Deanna Durbin anthology is a must 
 this is a complete guide for the novice in bred making, very valuable and easy to comprehend, full of details and very clear procedures, a really good invest!  
 It must have been good sales of the Japanese release of this magnificent CD that convinced Scaggs' record company that Fade Into Light would sell here. Personally, I can't imagine why "the suits" ever thought otherwise! I noticed that some of Boz' older albums previously unremastered and unavailable are now remastered and available as Japanese imports. Hopefully sales there will spur re-release here! I first bought Fade Into Light on this site about five years ago when it was available only as a Japanese import and at a very high price. Then recently when I was out CD shopping, I noticed that it was now issued here as a CD/DVD and at a very good sale price, so I bought it again. Let me tell you, urbanity unplugged is now affordable. What once was tempting only to the most hard core Boz Scaggs fans is now priced for the masses. The intimacy and romance of this recording is incredible! Most of the songs here are from Scaggs' middle period that began with Lowdown, but there are a couple from his modern period as well after he had broken away from his flirtation with disco and lachrymose pop ballads. The songs are mostly well-chosen. There are some other songs I'd like to have heard "unplugged", and some I'd like to have seen left off, but that is usually the case. The CD side is very nearly perfect, but the real treat comes when you flip it over and slip it into your DVD player and listen in enhanced stereo. The crystalline sound is astounding. Then there are the high-definition videos in surround sound that will just knock you out! My favorites here are the title cut, Harbor Lights, Sierra, We're All Alone, and a stunning rendition of Simone. So order Fade Into Light today. Then, set aside some time to kick back with a good bottle of wine and a loved one and be prepared for whatever the music might inspire. This one gets my highest recommendation 
 Well, after attempting to write a review on a purchase I made through Amazon itself, my review was removed. Why I ask....who knows!?!  This is a wonderfully balanced book. Don't listen to the non-sense about it being biased. Both Joey and Mike have appeared with the author of this book. Apparently, somebody trying to create some sort of "Cheap Heat" to sell a little more copies.  Bottom line....awesome story of a Band which was done over, abused and a band who made some music that many people missed out on and were not able to listen to....a darn SHAME!!  If you like this Book.......please be sure to listen to Wish You Were Here LP (not to be confused with Pink Floyd) and watch the VH1 and the DVD release. Not to be missed...brilliant over-views!! 
 One of the most pleasant experiences in life, if you are a fan of movies, is to run across a film you cannot categorize, yet enjoy immensely, in fact all the more, for this quirk.  Such a flick is "A Life Less Ordinary."  The first time I saw it, I couldn't decide if I loved it or hated it. The second time I fell in love with it.  The more times I see it, the more head over heels I become.  Like the film itself, I would have to term this serendipity.  Oh, that Hollywood, and everywhere films are made, would make more films that leave a smile on my face and wonderment at the serendipitousness (how's that for a word?) of life itself.  How clever is God and His angels in their execution of imagination.  Bravo 
 My sister had just had her first baby and was feeling overwhelmed.  After reading some reviews, I purchased this book for her.  My sister said she read the book while baby was sleeping in her arms, but was laughing so hard at times she'd have to put the book down to keep from awakening or frightening the baby.  My sister was very thankful for the comic relief and has since looked at her overwhelming moments with humor.  Definitely a great gift 
 Frankly, I feel that some reviewers misunderstand the purpose of this book. In my opinion, for a SOA focussed professional who needs to know the role of SOA, this book is a gem! Any of us who have had the challenge of explaining messaging technology should be grateful about reading this book.  As technologists, we forget just how much intimidating jargon we use and how many underlying assumptions we make when we explain things. As a software architect once said to me, "if I had more time, I'd make it simple." Clearly Mr.Chappell has taken on the challenge of making it simple and made it in such a way even an idiot can understand, and such efforts are incredibly valuable 
 This book is extremely useful to find what happened in a given period across many cultures.  It's a great starting point for any investigation of what happened.  However, important occurrences (such as Woodrow Wilson having a stroke) are sometimes left out and there is no differentiation of history-changing events from a fashion change (bold type for history-changing events would be nice -- of course, that is a decision each historian has to make, but on many there is general agreement).  But, I invariably go to this book to find what other books (British history, German history, Japanese history) I should consult as a starting point.  Also, sometimes it is very useful to find that certain personalities have the same birth date or birth year 
 Preface: I'm a huge QOTSA fan and I love Kyuss and PJ Harvey.  Review:  I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but this cd suffers from underproduction.  The sound quality on some of tracks is just horrid.  The two best songs on the CD are featured on the live DVD and CD in perfect form with a lot more energy.  Don't get me wrong, I like this CD- it just wasn't what I was expecting and as such I didn't enjoy it as much as the live CD/DVD.  Cheers 
 I initially read this book about three years ago and thought it was a great book.  I am now going through the book again but this time with a group of guys in a study.  The study questions are great to help you apply the reading.  R. Kent Hughes holds no punches and bases all of his information on Scripture.  If you desire to be a Godly man, I HIGHLY recommend reading this book and completing the study questions 
 I thoroughly enjoyed Sisterchicks on the Loose!!  It was more than just a "fun" book - it brought out issues about friends, spouses, in-laws and just getting along.  I so much enjoyed reading about other 40ish women and their insights.  It was hard to believe that it was a work of fiction - seemed like it really could have happened!  I loved it and would highly recommend it 
 The Sony Cybershot is a great camera. The colors and the features are amazing. Is very easy to use. The only thing I dont like about the camera is the zoom in and out button. If you zoomed in you wont be able to zoom out. 
 Of all of Nora Roberts' books--and yes, I've read them all--this is my favorite.  It is undoubtedly her funniest.  I first read it six years ago.  I loaned it to a friend who forgot to return it, so I had to buy it again.  I'm on my fourth copy now, I've read it probably ten times, but I keep on loaning it out and reordering and re-reading.    The characters are lovingly developed, and the dialogue quick and genuine.    Dora, our heroine, is a gutsy gal who takes no gruff off anyone, especially her new tenant, ex-cop Jeb Skimmerhorn.  They're a recipe for great romantic sparks and hot sexual tension.    This is truly Nora at her very finest.  I wish she'd write another just like it.  Or almost like it 
 This cube is awesome! After I bought a sticker Rubik's Cube, I was very disappointed with how the stickers peeled off after a week of using it. But the inventors of this cube are clever by choosing to use tiles instead. As long as you're careful with this cube (make sure the cube is aligned before turning), you should have a blast trying to solve the different sides. It's definitely a toy fun for the whole family 
 The purpose of fantasy is to enable children (and adults) to experience what they never could in reality.  Every child knows that no adult would send him to the vicinity of a rumbling volcano--which is exactly why they love stories in which things like that happen.  Seeing make-believe heroes in danger and seeing them get out of it is one of the ways children learn to be brave and optimistic. If a 4-year-old loves these books, then he's getting something useful out of them.  My 8-year-old loves them, and I will happily keep reading them to him as long as he wants 
 Who is Patrick Bateman?  A valid question for those reading this review.  One must wonder if he is the socially elite of the New York business world, the prime example of an obsessive compulsive, or the face of evil itself with an endless expense account and an unquenched need to kill - kill - and kill again.  Just like the illusive Tootsie-Roll Pop, the world may never know.  Bret Easton Ellis penned him, director Mary Harron gave him the paved road, while Christian Bale gave us the face, the mannerisms, and the world of the unknown Bateman.  For those unfamiliar, Bateman is a new sort of serial killer.  Not quite the BTK or Bundy, but the terror certainly ranges from within.  Living in a posh apartment, eating at the fanciest of restaurants, and enjoying all the pleasures of 1980s New York, Bateman struggles with himself and the need to kill time and time again.  His victims, mostly prostitutes and business cohorts, suffer the worst (far worse in the book) punishments alive either from ax, nail gun, hanger, or the ever popular chainsaw.  Pulling from pop culture, dark obsessions, and eerily our own desires, Bateman shows no conscious, no compassion, no rational thought for these crimes, he just kills and kills and kills.  Where this film takes a different element than you a-typical slasher film or horror genre is that midway through you begin to question the sanity of our anti-hero.  Events transpire that catch both Bateman as well as the viewers off-guard.  The biggest question is Paul Allen.  The phenomenally understated Jared Leto delivers a mirror performance to Bale's as another suit in the business world.  Due to accounts and business cards, Bateman dissolves the friendship - yet, everyone continues to see Allen walking the streets and having lunch with him.  Even the detective hired for the case, one Donald Kimball (played by Willem Dafoe) seems to prove otherwise.  Yet, something nags at our belief.  This is only confirmed with an ending that will make you stop, rewind, and watch again.  Questing everything from the mouth of Bateman, as well as his surroundings.  Slasher film?  Um, this reviewer would rather place it into the genre of self-discovery.  There was a film entitled "What the Bleep Do We Know" that attempts to understand the meaning of life, but for me, "American Psycho" can do it like no other.  For anyone looking for that film that contains an amazing score, an ensemble of known actors giving us performances of a lifetime, and direction that both mimics and mocks the lifestyle in New York during the 80s - than "American Psycho" is the film for you.  For me, I don't understand why it isn't further a staple of the film community.  Christian Bale could not have been a better choice for the face of Bateman, his ability to transform himself into the character was outstanding.  His character wasn't over the top, nor was it Bale being a character - he was Patrick Bateman.  What is it with Bale - there hasn't been one underscored performance yet.  "Batman Begins", "The Prestige", "Velvet Goldmine", and the "Machinist" are all within my top films of all time.  "American Psycho" ranks above them all.  Scenes, for me, that stand out are (2) major ones.  The first, which proves that Mary Harron was the perfect choice to direct and that her decision to cast Jared Leto was directly on target is the scene with Leto and Bale as he prepares the ax and explains the lyrical juxtaposition of Huey Lewis.  The language, the motions, and the choreography of the scene remains in my eyes, one of the strongest in cinema history.  The second scene, while less cinematically inclined, is that of Bale running naked through the halls of his apartment, dawning only his tennis shoes (naked to the bone), with chain a-blazin' as he chases one of the escaping prostitutes.  Again, maybe not the best in history, but a scene that constantly makes me laugh, shiver in terror, and remain in awe of the skill  known as Christian Bale.  I would go so far as to say that this is a flawless film.  As I watch this film for the dozenth time, I cannot find errors in the filmmaking.  Perhaps there errors with continuity, but I don't pay attention.  I look at the overall value of the film, and this is a cult film, hands down.  I must admit, the only issue that I have trouble with is the ever lacking bonus features on this disc.  I have the original version released and it only has a handful of extras which are not anything to overly write about, but what ergs me is the ever lacking audio commentary that would have been great to hear about this story.  Perhaps it would have included a bit more about the ending, less fog surrounding it, but not to worry - there is a newer version, the "Uncut Killer's Collector's Edition" that should remedy all of these missing elements.    Overall, "American Psycho" ranks among one of my favorite films of all time.  While my list constantly grows, this remain a constant.  I cannot speak any higher of Bale, or of Harron's direction which continues to impress me during each viewing.  The music is what stood out in my eyes.  There is a scene where someone laughs half-heartedly at a comment made by Bateman about liking Whitney Houston.   I loved his interpretation of a Phil Collins song.  It was these small elements that all came together perfectly for this film.  "American Psycho" is a look within the business soul.  As I watched this film, I thought of it as an extension to the "Wall Street" arm, could  Gordon Gekko be Patrick's father?  The insanity of New York, the pressures of working in a constantly obliterating corporate world, the standards of humanity - all blend together just far enough to make you question the existence of the man sitting next to you.  For anyone who has ever worked for Corporate America - this is the film for you.    Now, I gotta go return some videos.  Grade: ***** out of **** 
 Natural Atheism covers almost every aspect of atheism in a compendious and lucid manner. The chapters of the book are presented in a logical order and address a variety of issues such as what exactly is atheism and why it is the logical conclusion of the critically thinking person, so-called different types of atheism, agnosticism, the relationship between science and religion, an atheistic spirituality, and the complex history of separation between church and state. The author doesn't delve as deeply as possible into the variety of philosophical and scientific reasoning's that might point to the existence of a  Creator, but then again, he doesn't have to. There are other books on the market dedicated to discussing these issues from an atheistic perspective. The objective that Natural Atheism focuses on is  the conclusion that atheism is the conclusion of the rational individual and the book does this extremely well.  Eller uses his erudition to demolish a panoply of reasons that a theist might have for believing in a god ( or more accurately, gods) . An atheist will find that this book reaffirms their reasons for becoming (or staying) an atheist in the first place. The theist will have their opinions, beliefs, and conclusions thoroughly challenged. This is not a book that attempts to turn a theist into an atheist by denigrating religion; the author shows how religion, every religion, practically begs the believer to question its veracity by simply studying the very idea of religion objectively. This book should be read by theists and atheists alike. 
 Ms. Duncan-Jones' Introduction is an extraordinary example of scholarship.  To say that the Sonnets have been controversial throughout the time since their publication is a mild understatement.  Ms. Duncan-Jones casts a brilliant and unwavering spotlight on these controversies and resolves them.  Any serious student of Shakespeare must read this Introduction.  If there is a failing in the book, it is in the actual footnotes to the Sonnets themselves.  But in the context of Booth's footnotes, for example, this failing is insignificant.  Anyone who wants a line-by-line exegesis of the Sonnets has many resources available.  Go get this book and read the Introduction 
 Today from one of my favorite long-term look-outs ... HIGH ON A HILL, IN ELDORADO))))))))   Don't laugh, this is one of the most magic-filled, melodic & memorable albums of the 70's in my opinion ("I CAN'T get it out of my head", damn that song for being overly infectious).  Music like this does repel evil!  This guy has such an ear for bridges, choruses, hooks, tie-ins and hopelessly dreamy anthems that you are left at the end gazing at your ruby red slippers in an unshakeable golden-glow trance.  What a perfect blending of the technology (i.e., lots of Moogs, etc.), instrumentation, emotion and songcraft of the era.    The (30 piece) atmospheric orchestra  with resonating cellos and booming lower register contrasting with the electric guitars (I enjoy his focused, structured playing), violins and Lynne's oddly soothing singing (and falsetto choruses with 20 piece choir in spots) ... "THE LOVE OF AGES FILLS THE HEAD" (Overture).  The tradition of great music craft is respectfully channeled, albeit more simply for the pop song structure.  Eldorado WILL take you on a journey if you let it,  and messages shared lyrically (yes they are included with notes from lynne on meaning) add depth and timelessness that can't be ignored:   "The city boys and the country boys, They come from miles around.  To defy their King and country, Save the poor folks from the hand, Of thieving dukes and abbots, And the gentry of the land" (Poor Boy - One of my favorites by ELO).   "One thing I have learned through these years, Is that no man should be stricken with fear -  It should be that he walks with no care in the world.  So my friends that are gathered here today, HEAR THIS CLEAR, for I'll not further say, That NO MAN shall cause me to take up arms again" (Boy Blue, a catchy and brilliant song with a good message).   "...IN BETWEEN THEIR LIES, THE PLACE TO CLOSE YOUR EYES" (Instead of the North & South, a recent parallel presents itself???  We shall always dwell in Eldorado it seems, the Earth spins round @ and never slows down).  This was my first ELO album and helped ignite a lifelong musical love affair with prog-rock for me (I did love the Beatles, Moodies and Elton when I was younger, which leads naturally to ELO) and got me thinking more about picking up the guitar (after I bought the album myself in the mid 70's around 6th grade - I was soon to delve into YES a few months later which kicked it into higher gear), which has turned into an ongoing and permanent passion thankfully, as luck would have it.    The nice package on this 2001 remaster makes the time spent (about 48 min.) all the more worthwhile.  The sound quality is beautiful to me and far better than my ancient record.  You will be pleased I'm sure (Some good pictures, notes and two excellent extras to close the album with a welcome extra dose of swirling magic). Put aside all prejudices and go on a Laredo Tornado ride with Jeff Lynne & ELO (FEEL IT, DON'T ANALYZE IT) ... enjoy when the world closes in!

 Although you will know these key Web players well when finished reading, Architects of the Web is not just about personalities.  It's about the Web, how it was created, how it is changing, and how it will impact us.  Since each chapter focuses on a different profile and a different aspect of the Web, from software to content to service, Reid is able to survey these perspectives to extract the important themes.  The book is well written, and written in a way that both industry professionals and web newcomers will enjo 
 As a member of H-Net, I regularly receive their reviews of the latest books in my field of interest which is World War II.  This is an excellent review which prompted me to purchase this book for my personal library on Nazi Germany.  H-NET BOOK REVIEW Published by H-German@h-net.msu.edu (July 2006)  David F. Crew. "Hitler and the Nazis: A History in Documents". Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. 176 pp. Illustrations, index. $36.95 (cloth), ISBN 0-19-515285-9.  Reviewed by James Konecke, Teacher Education Department, College Misericordia  A Fresh, Concise History of Nazi Germany Told by Its Key Characters  "If a prisoner attempts to escape, he is to be shot without warning.... If a unit of prisoners mutinies or revolts, it is too be shot at by all supervising guards. Warning shots are forbidden on principle" (p. 97). This directive, taken from the SS Service Regulations for Prisoner Escorts and Guards in 1933, encapsulates the attitude of National Socialism and its leader. From the moment he entered the political arena to the moment he thrust his nation into war, Adolf Hitler increasingly fired verbal warning shots alerting the world of his desires for territory, ethnic "cleansing" and war. But the horrors of World War I still reverberated throughout Eurasia, drowning out Hitler's warning cries. Consequently, when Hitler repeatedly violated the Treaty of Versailles' sanctions, rather than confront him, the Allies sought to appease him in hopes of averting a repeat of the First World War. By the time they realized Hitler's true intentions, it was too late. Germany had grown far too strong during the interwar years to be defeated quickly or easily. The result: a global conflict responsible for claiming the lives of nearly sixty million individuals begun by a racist regime that ruthlessly repressed, incarcerated and eliminated communists, Sinti and Roma, Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, POWs, the "biologically" unfit and Jews.   In his most recent work, "Hitler and the Nazis", David Crew provides a concise and vivid history of this ruthless regime from its origins in German defeat in World War I and in the failure of Weimar democracy to its downfall in World War II and its evaluation by the world in the post-Nazi era.  Seven short chapters make up "Hitler and the Nazis". Chapter 1 lists and describes the events that allowed National Socialists to come into power in Germany: German defeat in World War I; the failure of Weimar democracy; the economic troubles of the Great Depression; the Nazis' ability to garner the favor of citizens unhappy with the chaotic political situation; and the overwhelming desire of leaders in business, agriculture, the military, and the government (as well as ordinary voters) for a strong authoritarian leader. These factors all contributed to Hitler's meteoric rise to power.  Chapter 2 details this ascent, focusing on Hitler's oratorical gifts, the strength of the SA and the youthful, forceful image of the Nazi Party. And as soon as they came to power, the Nazis wasted no time in attacking their enemies. In February, a Dutch anarchist with ties to German communism set fire to the Reichstag. The Nazis deemed this event the start of a communist uprising and used it as an excuse for the SA to round up political enemies (communists and socialists). Within a year and a half, however, the power of the SA was making army leaders (upon whose support Hitler relied) very nervous. Hitler chose to purge the SA of nearly two hundred of its leaders during the "Night of the Long Knives."  Once firmly settled into power, the Nazis sought to cement their image in the public mind. They saturated the Reich with propaganda, much of which used Hitler as its focus. Chapter 3 describes (and gives several visual examples) of how Goebbels and the Propaganda Ministry flooded Germany with images to create the myth of Hitler as a statesman, a champion of justice, a military hero and a guardian against political and racial enemies.  Once the Nazis silenced their political enemies, they set to work eliminating their "racial" and "biological" foes as well. This effort is the focus of chapter 4. Realizing that the public would not immediately condone full-blown extermination of such peoples, Hitler set out to alienate such groups, particularly Jews, in the minds of the people. However, the Jews were not the only targets of Nazi oppression. They also singled out Afro-Germans, Sinti and Roma ("gypsies"), homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and anyone else not considered "Aryan." Even "full-blooded" Germans were not safe from the Nazi regime. Many of the "biologically unworthy" (the blind, deaf, schizophrenic, mentally deficient along with epileptics and others) were forced to undergo mass sterilization so as not to spread, from the Nazi viewpoint, their "deficient" genes to future generations.  Chapter 5 details the events of the Second World War from the German perspective, hitting on the early successes in the Blitzkrieg operations against Poland, Denmark, Norway and France; the Battle of Britain; the invasion of Russia; America's entry into the war; the slowdown and turnaround (Kursk and Stalingrad) in the East; and the war in the air. In the next chapter, Crew traces the evolution of the Holocaust from the two million Jews murdered by the SS Einsatzgruppen (special killing squads who followed the Wehrmacht into the East) and the detention of Jews in filthy, overcrowded ghettos to their transport to the concentration camps and the killing centers of Chelmno, Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor and Madjanek. Crew rounds out the chapter by highlighting the voices of rescuers, survivors and resisters.  The final chapter focuses on postwar Germany and describes how the Allies tried to erase all remnants of the Nazi regime (denazification) and to force the Nazi criminals to pay for their crimes (the Nuremberg trials), as well as how both sections of a divided Germany dealt with their dark past. "Hitler and the Nazis" also contains an introduction, an index, lists of suggestions for further reading and of pertinent websites, and a brief timeline of major events in National Socialist history from the birth of Hitler in 1889 to his suicide in 1945. Oddly, Crew neglected to include a concluding chapter, allowing the work to end rather abruptly, thus leaving an unfinished feeling to the book overall.  There are literally thousands upon thousands of books which make Nazism their main focus. So what sets this short, 176-page volume apart? Unlike most histories of the Third Reich, whose authors comb through thousands of primary documents to turn out their own narrow (albeit unique) take on the regime, this one allows those primary works to speak for themselves. In each chapter, Crew introduces the topic with a few short paragraphs. He fills the remaining pages of each section with primary entries related to that particular topic separated by his own remarks (bold-faced), which provide both an historical overview and background information on that specific entry. The result is a lively, first-person account of the entire history of National-Socialism told from a myriad of perspectives: the speeches and writings of Nazi leaders like Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels and Speer; testimonies, interviews and memoirs of SA and SS members, German soldiers and officers and the victims (both male and female) of Nazi terror; foreign newspaper reports (American and British); laws and government documents from Germany and occupied countries; and an impressive collection of visual evidence (propaganda posters, cartoons and pictures). In short, what this volume lacks in length it more than makes for in scope. In such a short work, Crew could not have possibly delved into any facet of the Third Reich in any great detail. However, he makes sure to allow almost every major group or player in that history to be heard, leading to a= well-balanced, objective and concise history of the Nazi regime.  Countless illustrations also help bring this short history of the Third Reich to life. Black and white maps, propaganda posters, battle scenes, copies of orders and government papers, paintings, models and scores of photos (all with individual captions) appear on no less than every other page of this work. Chapter 3, in particular, consists of little else. The written and visual primary evidence presented throughout the work makes "Hitler and the Nazis" a unique addition to the literature.  Students of history need to be wary of primary documents, however, particularly those from the Nazi era. The state's widespread use of distorted propaganda and euphemisms ("Final Solution" and "special treatment") requires a critical eye. The author's point of view and reasons for writing always need to be taken into account, as well as the place and time in which he or she was writing, as Crew points out in the opening pages of the book. However, Crew includes a number of primary entries written or recounted decades (sometimes even half a century) after the events in question. That is not to say the authors of such words were deliberately untruthful or misleading. However, the passage of time alone can often fade, distort or even change memories. So, as a word of caution for all students reading Crew's work, one must not accept every entry literally merely because an accomplished and respected historian included them in his book--as Crew himself is quick to point out.  Because Crew seeks to provide merely a short history of Nazism as told through the eyes of all its key players, he does not contribute any new arguments or evidence to the field. However, by making such a rich assortment of primary sources readily available, Crew provides instructors of courses on Nazi Germany, the Holocaust, genocide, World War II, or simply world or even American history with the tools needed to craft attention-grabbing assignments, lectures, projects, reports and classroom discussion questions. (snip)   The words "Gestapo" and "Auschwitz" and symbols like the swastika and the lightning bolts of the SS still strike fear into the hearts and minds of people today. In short, Nazism was, is, and may well forever be the defining example of terror and destruction in world history. It has, still does and will continue "to live on in our imaginations" (p. 11), thanks in no small part to David F. Crew's condensed, illustrated history of the National Socialist era as told through the eyes of those who experienced it. Crew helps bring this chaotic, shocking, and often gruesome page of history to life, making the volume a necessary resource for anyone teaching on the topics of modern Germany, the Holocaust, the World Wars, race or genocide.

 I love this product!  We use it mainly for grinding chicken breasts.  I find it very easy to use and extremely easy to clean up 
 Oooh, I loved this one!  Of course, I seldom have found a Patterson book I haven't enjoyed.  Jack and Jill was an exceptional thriller and kept me on edge to the very end.  Good reading or listening via audio 
 The inspiration and ideas offered in this slim volume are practical and easy to implement, and no doubt they will work to help one live a more stress-free, enjoyable life.  But the reader needs to remember that, as with most books of this type, the key to success is ACTION.  Just reading about what you should be doing won't change your life. DOING what you should be doing will change your life.  That may seem painfully obvious, but often, I think readers buy this type of book hoping their lives will somehow magically change just by reading the book.  Read the book, then take ACTION, and you'll have made a worthwhile purchase.  Reviewer: Linda Painchaud-Steinman, PARK EDGE BOOK 
 Blew through this one in a few days - highly entertaining, excellent read.  Fun fun book.  Such a great story and great characters.  This should be a movie but they'd probably screw it up.  It's a great read - sad to finish it really.  But glad to discover another writer I like.  Can't wait to see what else he's done and see if it's as good.  Or better!  Read this book it's GREAT 
 What a pleasure to see the soul of bamboo portrayed with such insight! Many examples of bamboo in use, a feast for the eyes. This book is a treasure of bamboo knowledge 
 Rick Jemmett's work "The Athlete's Ball" is a must-have purchase for anyone that currently works out (or, *ought* to work out) with an exercise ball (aka, fitness ball, Swiss ball, etc.).  I've got a couple of books on this subject already on my shelf - "Bounce Your Body Beautiful" is nutritionist's take; "Get on the Ball" is from a fitness instructor.  Now comes Jemmett's take as a licensed Physical Therapist.  While I find all three books helpful in designing a workout, Jemmett's book stands alone as an impressive piece of scholarship, the source material from the book having been drawn from published research in anatomy, biomechanics, motor control, orthopedics, sports medicine and exercise physiology.  Jemmett credits no less than 70 works in his bibliography.    The challenge here is to synthesize that wide body of work and boil it down into a presentation that doesn't perplex or put off the lay reader.  Jemmett is up to the challenge and you see that right away as he explains the concept of core muscles in the opening pages of the book.  Other works, in defining "the core," either employ the term as a buzzword or give it some tautological definition like "the core is important in maintaining core stability." By contrast, Jemmett gives us a very readable six-page intro to core muscles, their three primary functions (fascinating) and an explanation of why the core's complexities call for what he calls the 'specifity principle of training.'    That solid beginning sets the stage for Jemmett's introduction to Integrative Training, which is the main thrust of "The Athlete's Ball."  A quick flip through the book at the photos gives you a clue as to what that training entails - doing exercises that are specific to one's chosen sport - so, we see hockey players doing hockey-oriented exercises, dancers doing dancing-related things, etc.  But, what we *don't* see are the usual 'single muscle' exercises like crunches, oblique twists, etc.  What the reader gets as a result is a book that is both a fresh take and an important complement to other books on the subject.  In my mind, designing an exercise ball workout that meets your goals is all about synthesizing advice passed down from others who have been successful with making the ball a key part of their exercise regimens.  From that perspective, "The Athlete's Ball" ought to be on your bookshelf today 
 The Good Soldier is a book not of our time, perhaps in that it requires you to read it discerningly, and in so reading it yields the wisdom to be gained, as well as the pleasure of the reading experience. Starting with the unforgettable line, "this is the saddest story I have ever heard" requires that the reader consider every part of that sentence: the story itself, the perspective of the speaker (the listener, the unreliable narrator), and more importantly that the element of the listener, though apparently inert, is one of 4 main reagents, and several catalysts, in the story itself.  This is not a novel that lays out the facts. It is not a police report. And despite the subject matter, it is not even a Dr. Phil expose. It is the account of a man who does not even tell you that his first name is John until Part II (of 4). His companions are his wife, Florence, and the Ashburnhams, Leonara and Edward. You will learn of what they did and how he came to know of it, although the question of how much he is actually conscious of it is never directly answered. But it is masterful and delightful by putting facts forward, in a way a report would not.  And while the topics of adultery we imagine to be not spoken of (in polite society), nearly every social circle has a tangent to an impolite one. Though things may not have been spoken of in the circle, they were nonetheless done, with or without conversation.   It's dated as a story that assumes an upper class, in a way that may be difficult to relate to for those in the active, modern, busy, workaday world. To criticize it for being thus, is like criticizing War and Peace for being too long, or Joyce Ulysses for being disjointed. But it provides insight to us because we do not live lives of leisure and privilege, and it's a window to a world that, whether you think it deserves preservation or not, reflects back into our own. 
 I had Collected works in tape format and it made me a fan of Simon & Garfunkel's music. It has been quite some time I was thinking of upgrading my Simon & garfunkel collection to CD format. I had the following options :-  1) Getting 3 CD Collected Works which has all 5 albums entirely and tracks are ordered like original albums. 2) Getting each album separately or getting best 3 of their 5 studio albums. 3) Getting Old friends which have most of the studio album tracks (42 out of 57 or something) but the tracks are not in order, but with some previously unreleased tracks. 4) Getting Complete Columbia Recordings, which has all 5 studio albums with bonus tracks.  None of the above options are bad really. I do not think "Collected works" will be available except from used music store. If you want some tracks which were not there in their studio albums then get "Old Friends" or "Complete Columbia Recordings". Even the single albums are now available with bonus tracks, so you can individually get them too but if you want most of the tracks from the albums but also want to hear some bonus tracks but do not want to spend much, get this.  There is nothing new that can be said about the music, its great music as you expect from world's best folk-rock duo. The collection starts wonderfully with a demo version of "Bleaker Street", the version is better than the original version to me. After that you get the remastered version of the known studio tracks and good live or demo or alternate versions of tracks. I like the 5 subsequent tracks from a live show in CD #2.   To sum up...evergreen music with remastered sound and the package also comes with a good booklet. Still if you a pure album collector you have to go for the other options. I am quite strictly album listener but still I do not regret buying this because I have all the albums in tape format and it is still good to listen the tracks in some other order than usual. This is one of the few compilation in my Cd collection. Essential buy!!! 
 everything looks great with this monster...power power...i cant wait to overclok it a bit to squeeze it. 
 I saw Leahy in concert at Milwaukee's Irish Cultural Center.  The experience is beyond words.  We were clapping, yelling, and dancing in our seats!  That prompted me to buy their first album and I was not disappointed.  The musicianship is terrific and the selection unbeatable.  I've listened to it many, many times and it never grows old.  Thanks Leahy! 
 So I decided to take someone who does not ever watch martial arts movies to see this and with Tony Jaa coming in with that flying double knee, this was insane for my friend to get up right away and start makign noises during the first seconds of action in the movie.  It really sets the tone for the entire film.  I didn't time this movie, but it had to come in at like 70-80 minutes. Along with the fact that the story made absolutely no sense, I am sure I saw the cut version. Like when Jaa gets handled by the big guy and the next scene he is saved by a woman. Then by the time the end of the movie comes around, Jaa and the girl that saved him didn't even speak a word to each other! Also the directorial job left a lot to be desired, I don't know wtf happened at the end,  But who cares, ACTION IS ALL THAT MATTERS!!!!!    We are talking fight after fight.  They should have named this  the Bone Cruncher.  That was my favorite scene and you will see what I mean.  Tony Jaa's moves are so complex and so outrageous, it would be a serious crime for him to not show off on screen.  The action is SOOOO awesome Jaa actually makes Bruce Lee look like he was only average.  Remember in Way of the Dragon where Bruce takes out everybody and he has on white guy left to deal with?  The guy looks all scared and Bruce just kicks the light bulb out of the cieling and the guy runs away.  Similiar moment in the Protector where Jaa does the same with with a light pole!  He only had to jumop like twice as high as Bruce, that isn't too bad.  I could really talk about the action for a few pages because EVERY move was so complex.  This is truly one of the top 10 greatest action movies ever right up there with Fist of Legend, Gladiator, Iron Monkey, 7 Grandmasters, Braveheart...  I would even put it ahead of Ong Bak.  In Tom Yum Goong(the Protector) he faces actual opponents.  After making himself the front runner in the Oscar's for best one man army(I wish), Jaa has to go up  against a capoeira stylist.  Capoeira is a brazilian style that looks like dancing and involves a lot of handstands for kicking.  It is a perfect contrast for Jaa's thai style and makes for one of the best looking matches I have ever seen on screen.  After fighting a wushu stylist with a sword he has to go up against a giant of a man.  I really don't want to describe any of these fight scenes because they are all so original and could have been done any better.  So the story blows but the movie is one of the greatest thrill rides that you will ever experience.  Hopefully when this movie gets released for American audiences we will get the uncut version.  If it doesn't I know I won't buy it.  Even with describing how good it was, I really need emotions involved with the fights so I can feel SOMETHING.  The movie didn't seem like anythign more than one long fight scene, but with Tarantino's new company Dragon Dynasty cutting it down, I can't even make that decision for myself.       
 here's the way to go - if you already think the band is killer, or if you are into punk music with less clean cut voices and more sketchy voices, or if you have a thing for good guitars, vocals and lyrics, then buy this cd.  not true punk, close... but not - no matter what anyone wants to say.  songs sound the same on the first run thru the disc, but thats the same with every cd.  maybe if you've never heard this type of music before it will all blend, otherwise there are good variations. if you still aren't sold on it - it's just a catchy sound... bass guitar, electric guitar, drums, and a calm yelling from herrara for the vocals... pretty sick

 Yes, some Jimi Hendrix fans might think, what, Axis, Bold as Love is superior to the guitar meistro's groundbreaking lp??  Yes! I say that because if you compare the two albums, you actually hear superior song, lyric and guitar playing on the second album. The first lp does have the mindblowing Are You Experienced? and Third Stone from the Sun psychedelic extravangas. But the second lp has much better defined tunes which also percolate with psychedelic abandon. If you listen very closely to the first lp, there are recording shotcomings that were not edited out because of a "rush to market" and "cut down on recording expenses" mentality driven by manager, Chas Chandler. On the second lp, even though Hendrix lost the original masters for the second half of the lp, you hear no production mistakes at all. And you have Hendrix's writing much more poignant lyrics about the importance of individuality and self-expression. Jimi, if anything, is much more political on this album than on his first and its reflected in the lyrics. But the quality of the "pop songs" I like even more than on the first album. The trio is extremely tight on the second album, almost tighter than on the first. Mitch's drumming is lock, stock and barrel with Jimi's superlative rhythm guitar playing and Noel provides the solid bass lines. This second album packs a powerful punch! Little Wing lives on into eternity with the most beatific guitar intro of any rock/pop song ever recorded! The Axis track is so powerful! If anything, this album is guilty of being too short!  And you can blame this again on the frugal mentality of Chas Chandler who always kept a tight leash on Hendrix, preventing him from really stretching out on songs. Several of the songs on Axis could have been longer and did not have to fade out as quickly as they did. Axis itself should have continued for at least several more minutes. I thank Chas for discovering Hendrix and I also blame him for keeping Hendrix inside too small of a box. Hendrix himself hated the 2 or 3 minute pop song, hence his hugely successful rejection of that format with the titanic Electric Ladlyland lp featuring several long, extended forays into blues/psychedelia.....But enjoy Axis. It ranks as one of the BEST rock/blues/psychedelic lps produced in the late sixties period 
 I have to admit, before reading this book I was totally clueless about the "big year". I'd heard about life lists and scoffed. I watch birds because its interesting, I feed them because I feel guilty living on what used to be bird habitat. But I care not a whit whether or not I've seen all 600+ native species. I really enjoyed this story though. It's light reading, and very well written. I had no idea that those hummingbirds at my feeder had crossed the gulf of Mexico. I'm even more impressed. (by the birds, not the birders...)  But that Autu Alaska is now closed to birders who could at one time get to see non native species blown over by a storm, well I don't really care. It is great though that some people remember to live their passion. And that part is what makes this book a fun read 
 This is a great mystery, set in 18th century England.  The protagonist is perhaps the most likeable I've seen in years.  
 Dr. Konner is just an awesome professor, with a great hilarious sense of humor and an intriguing way of wording things. Just like he told my NBB 201 class, you're going to learn very important things from him...wink wink. Not only does it cover a highly scientific array of information, it's also presented in a fun-to-read fashion. It won't put you to sleep 
 EXELENT ALL I CAN SAY IS BUY IT YOU WONT BE SORRY EXELENT SOUND QUALITY 
 Going to Russia? Buy it. Interested in reading about contemporary Russia beyond what the newspapers tell you? Buy it. Taking a class on Russian culture? Buy it. I really can't recommend this book enough for specialists and novices alike. There's something to please everybody here 
 I brought this as a gift for a friend.  He was suprised by the gift and really enjoyed the books 
 John Paul Vann was deceitful, manipulative, selfishly ambitious, driven by inferiority to crave leadership positions, selfish, a sex addict, a serial adulterer, a horrible husband, a lousy father.  But, John Paul Vann was also courageous, resourceful, a natural leader, a shrewd judge of others, intelligent, an original thinker, a warrior for freedom, tireless, energetic, and confident.    The author uses John Vann as a metaphor, or type to illustrate America's deepening involvement in the Vietnam war.  The metaphor seems to fit well and the result is a good overview of the war and our involvement in it.    The book is well researched and it answered most of the unanswered questions I had about this time in my life (I registered for the draft in 1973).  Some of the questions it answered for me were: How did Ngo Diem come to power in South Vietnam?   Was he a good leader or a "anti-communist dictator"?   Was the South Vietnamese government and armed forces corrupt?   "Corruption" is hard to define, so what are examples of their corruption?    Why did our bombing of North Vietnam not tharwt the communist forces in the South?   Why were we unable to cut the Ho Chi Minh trail?  Were Thieu & Ky good leaders?   Why did the Buddhist monks set themselves on fire in protest?   Was General Westmoreland a good combat leader?   Why did the Marines set up the base at Khe Sahn?   Whose ideas was it to rotate the US miliary through Vietnam on one year terms?   Did the South Vietnamese really want our help?    My main conclusion from this book is summed up in the old country proverb, "You can't make a silk purse from a sows ear."  
 Travis is best known for being one of the most downbeat Britpop bands in existance, but their debut "Good Feeling" is Brit-rock -- happy rock, depressed rock, evenly divided between melancholy and joy. It doesn't have the musical polish of their later efforts, but it does have the infectious exuberance of a young band.    "Hey/I would really like to talk to you/girl/all I want to do is rock!" Fran Healy announces happily at the start of the album. That sentiment carries through the first half of the album, full of uptempo powerpop that ranges from the fuzzy "Good Day To Die" to the swirling melody of the title track. What they lack in experience, they make up in gung-hoety.    When it hits the midway mark, "Good Feeling" changes in tone -- it becomes less about wanting to rock, and more poignant and plaintive. Despite the bouncy poppiness of "Happy," the second half is overwhelmingly melancholy ballads, usually about the fragility of love. While not as much fun as the powerpop, these piano-led ballads are extremely beautiful.    Most bands sound awkward when they're still figuring out what kind of music they want to do. Travis wasn't one of those bands -- they sound equally good when they do sad ballads, and upbeat catchy pop. And though Travis later decided to do the melancholy music, if you listen to "Good Feeling" it's hard not to wish that they could include a few uptempo numbers too.    For a beginner band they were remarkably polished -- the piano melodies are exquisite, and they do some remarkable things with crunchy guitar riffs and some reverbing basslines. The songwriting is one of the few stumbling blocks -- the downtempo numbers are prettily written ("I think you should be framed/in some fine art gallery/I know you'd disagree with me/but I love you anyways"), but the pop numbers contain some real groaners ("I'm a foot without a sock").    Those groaners are admittedly hard to notice, though -- Fran Healy sings these as if he's been doing it all his life, and he adds some extra life to an already solid album. One minute he's purring along and happily yelling along to the riffs, then he's softly murmuring along to the piano.    The style of "Good Feeling" got left behind by Travis, but their debut remains a solid Britpop album that mixes solid powerpop with exquisite ballads. Definitely worth checking out. 
 This film is without a doubt one of my favorites. I'll never give it up.  Fine acting throughout, even the kids'.  And the message is clear:  One person CAN make a difference in the lives of others. As "Sir", as his class calls him, takes over the class (as a temporary job) in their last few months before graduation, these teenagers are loud, rude, crude, with little respect for each other or for themselves.  They come from the slums. "Sir" helps them to realize that they will soon be out there in the world, on their own, and in order to be successful in society and business, they will have to be "with it".  He teaches them, not without resistance, how to behave like ladies and gentlemen, he teaches them manners, how to respect and care about each other, etc., in addition to literature, math, et al.  He takes them on tours of museums & galleries.  He teaches them to cook.  By the end of the semester, they have acquired a sense of self-worth and dignity.  They have learned to love him, and they let him know.  He had applied for a permanent job in some other field, his major, and just before graduation day, he receives an offer of a job at a salary much higher than a school teacher's.  He is elated.  Then comes the graduation party, and a gift from his students, and he is exposed to the antics of the next class coming in next semester, which are a duplication of his graduating class as they were when he took over.  He sees their possibilities, realizing the good that his influence could have on them too, so what does he do???   Aha!  See the movie to find out!  You'll love it.  This movie has optional English sub-titles 
 the item Nike B2.9 Gymsack  arrived in foreseen time and it is the great usefulness for my because it is comfortable 
 I guess it isn't an easy thing to compose an illustrative guide on such complicated and multilayered portion of Architecture as American domestic styles, but all are included here: easily recognizable types, details, even construction methods! Special thanks to the Illustrator: the pictures are neither "overillustrated" nor of too "academic" appearance - just restrained professional still artistic graphic. As an international Architect often working for an American architectural firm I will surely make use of it 
 I definitely liked this sarcastic but warm book about solitary travels thru Europe, interlaced with fragments of a journey taken years earlier with a certain weirdo named Katz.    The glimpses into European culture are just great- how movie tickets are sold here, how food is served with attitude there.  Also, there is great comedy in the scenes of being an odd duck in places like Lichtenstein and MIlan, but also rewarding beauty in Capri and Paris.    I wish two things:  that there had been more about Katz, who is one of the most misanthropic figures I have come across in a while and that generally makes for good comedy; also, that the last three chapters hadn't felt quite so tired. I suspect that that is just a realistic impression of how the author did feel towards the end of his journey  but it was anti-climactic.  
 First read this some 20 years ago and reread it recently.Was more enthralled the 2nd time.I liked that the author appears to have inside knowledge of the Vatican.He impresses us with it as he slowly unravels the  story of Kiril Lakota,a cardinal from behind the iron curtain(when there  was a curtain)who unexpectedly and reluctantly is elected Supreme  Pontiff.Not being of the faith it was all a mystery to me and this story  managed in a little way to de-mystify a few things.How they elect a pope  for one! It dawns on the reader that even persons that high up have foibles  and prejudices like us mere mortals.A comforting and worrying thought at  the same time. A must for all Morris West fans 
 if they taught this kind of history in school, I don't think i would have ever been bored enough to draw stupid comics of stick figures running about the pages of my notes and classwork.... a truly inspiring journey into the  souls of some truly brave people in their journey to break on through.... 
 Articulate story of the great 40s and 50s Czech distance runner Emil Zatopek that astounded the world with his three gold medals in the 52 Olympics that included a  thrilling 5000 final with Zatopek, with ungainly arms flailing, pulls away with a desperate surge in the final straight from three runners in hot pursuit with a one crashing dramatically against the curb. The author captures the career of the man who broke all the Finnish distance running records from 5000 meters up to 20,000 and the one hour run. Zatopek was known for spending long periods on the track doing long sets of intervals, as many as 40x 400 meters. The author notes fantastically, and perhaps naively, that Emil even ran 80 quarters in a single workout but as Emil was qouted elsewhere,  they didn't mention his pace, which may have been relatively modest for the longer sessions. But aside from his records, Zatopek was known for his dominance in the Olympics and his warm and ever friendly heart that extended even to competitors. Phillips, a track statistician as you will recognized from his series of lists and knowledge of the top times of the world past, current and present, writes a compact book that covers the essentials of Zatopek's career with particular focus on his development, record breaking races and Olympic performances. Amazingly, Zatopek wins a gold medal and a silver in his first Olympics just missing the gold in the 5,000 in the 48 Olympics and of course his incredible triple in the 52 Olympics wining the 5,000, 10,000 and the marathon. Quite a story about Emil running his first marathon in the Olympics after winning the 5K and 10K races. In the late stages of the marathon, the author states that Emil troted up to the leader and favorite, Peters from England, and asks if the pace is fast enough! He later takes the lead, crushing all his competitors including the unfortunate Peters. Emil's training revolutionized distance running and his performances inspired a whole league of young world class runners like Valdimer Kuts, Gordon Pirie, Chris Chataway, and Alan Mimoun all who eventually chipped away at his records. The book is written in somewhat abbreviated format but I do wish there was more personal information about Zatopek particularly how he was able train and compete in German occupied Czechoslovakia and more detail about his family, career in the military but there are references to his punishment for supporting the anti-communist movement in 1968. The book also has short bio on his gold medalist wife Dana who had a remarkable career as a world ranked javelin thrower and multiple Olympic medalist. The racing pictures are also fantastic that even include the fantastic and shocking finish of the 1952 Olympic 5000 meter final. But besides his athletic accomplishments, Emil will always be remembered for his good sportsmanship and kindness to people such as his pacing a young Australian to a national record to his secretly giving his 1952 10,000 meter gold medal to the great multiple world record holder and hard luck Ron Clarke (bronze 10,000 in 64). Clarke said it best about Emil Zapotek after receiving this highly personable gift, "I do know no-one cherishes any gift more than I do, my only Olympic gold medal, and not because of what it is, but because of the man whose spirit it represents".   
 One of the greatest screen personalities of the 1930s, Joan Blondell found herself being edged out of films by the decade's end.  Soon she would be reduced to playing the Shelley Winters parts before Shelley Winters found her niche, and then actually competing with Shelley Winters for the same roles, which must have been terribly frustrating for a talented actress like Blondell.  Here she is and you can just see a hint of desperation as she "jumps the shark" into a sort of limbo of "being a star" and "no longer a star."  I can picture her face when handed the script, "And you get killed on page 15."  What?  And this is long before Janet Leigh's brave decision to let her character get killed off in Hitchcock's PSYCHO!  But leave it to Joan, she took the part and really ran with it.  All the way up to the end she was a classy actress and the definition of "star."  TOPPER RETURNS has a lot of fun with the idea of Joan Blondell as a "ghost of her former self."  Roland Young, Billie Burke, and winsome Carole Landis offer suitable support.  Eddie Anderson tries varying his Rochester persona here--he's great, but the script doesn't give him enough to do--or when it does (like playing with the trained seal) it's the wrong kind of thing.  However, like Joan Blondell, he rises above it with style 
 Very reasonable cost, less than half that in the stores. Delivered on time and good quality 
 Great for first time parents. Very informative for the modern parent and the only book that made sence to us. Excellent for yourself or for a baby shower gift. Even the new Dads will read this one! 
 I found Built to Last to be an analytical look at the intangibles of success.  Core development and maintenance, personal growth, employee development and more, highlight the "outside the bottom line" look into an organization lasting longer than any one leader's tenure of influence.  Although I don't agree with every aspect of the book I still rate this high due to its ability to stimulate positive thinking 
 I met Col Fox in the summer of 2002 and purchased my copy of his book directly from him, it was both a pleasure meeting and talking with him and enjoying his writing for the second time.  Col. Fox is an inspiration to all of us who love the Corps.  This work should be required reading for every soldier and Marine, it puts the rubber on the road and is frank with its descriptions of the good and bad of the service in both war and peace.  If we had more leaders cut in the mold of Col Fox our military would be alot better off and the people who serve there would be alot better taken care of. Thank god for men the caliber of Col Fox.  "What do you say One/Six?"  "ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK Sir&quot 
 I couldn't put this book down for two weeks.  The characters and battles all came roaring back to life, as Shaara puts all the people and battles into proper context.  Franklin's delicate negotiations and frustrations with the French, Robert Morris' thankless role as financier for the Continental Army, Washington's seemingly endless patience with Congress and his own generals, all of it is beautifully rendered by putting the reader into the battle tents, long marches, and nerve wracking doubt that plagues the commanders.  Daniel Morgan's victory over Tarleton at Cowpens had me weepy 
 this book was rele good!! we read it in our literature class not too long ago and now we're doing a project on the dates... we're making a timeline and we're also watching the movie!! it has robin williams in it!! I hope i'm encouraging everyone to read this great book. it's a good book if your interested in the war or jews!! Great book! 
 Once again, Kushner brings his deep pastoral sensitivity to bear on poetry, literary structure and theology in this much loved psalm. His writing style is gentle and accessible to all, as he reflects on the Twenty-Third Psalm.     
 Christa?  You really did it well! This is a comprehensive, funny, well-researched resource book on the fabrics, markers of quality clothing, labels, and flaws in secondhand finds.  It is the best single source of information for secondhand shoppers that I have ever come across!  Cheers 
 I replaced my 1GB and 512MB Corsair Value Ram sticks with these Crucial 1GB sticks in my HP ZD7188cl notebook.  With my previous RAM, my system would shutdown randomly and without warning. The sticks were the same brand, just different capacities. It was infuriating when in the middle of working on a document, or on the web. I even swapped the sticks in the slots, but I still had the same problem. I just never knew when the shutdown problem would strike next. Even when I wasn't running any applications, or if I was out of the room, it would shut down. It wasn't a system stress issue.  I had to pull the 512MB stick out and live with 1GB of RAM to have a stable system. This has worked flawlessly for the six months since I tried it. The 512MB worked fine with the HP 256MB RAM that came with the system, but 768MB just wasn't enough for what I do. Something was going on, but I could not duplicate the problem or pinpoint the flaw.  Now I have 2GB of Crucial RAM and it hasn't tripped once. I also upgraded the 4200 RPM 80GB Toshiba HD with a Seagate 7200 RPM 100GB HD (see my review). The 3.2GHz P4 has always been a trooper, but the RAM and HD held it back. Now it's like having a new system 
 Many of the people who reviewed the dvds said that the cutoffs were a horrible detraction but it didnt factor in as much as they say.  Sure it is not perfect but nothing is and I have been waiting a long goddamn time for this box set and am very fricking pleased with it....so there all you nay sayers in your eye 
 I have been useing the book of doors for 3 years now, and I have found that this is the easyist, and most acurate set of cards I have ever used 
 If you are only going to buy one book--this is the one!!  It covers everything, yet is not complicated or overwhelming.  It's directions are very clear and has lots of wonderful pictures.  I can't think of anything that it doesn't cover.  It also has a nice section of recipes to use all those wonderful foods that you've dried. A definite winner 
 At a certain young age, maybe eleven or twelve, I decided that God, as presented by the Catholic Church, did not match my idea of how a god should behave. I asked myself, "How could people, who were unfortunate enough to be born in places where there was no opportunity to know about `my' God, be damned?" At that time I decided that I needed to know a lot more about what others had to say about God and how the world works. I realized that I was too young to figure this all out, so I promised myself that I would study these things when I was older and better educated.  Here it is many decades later and I'm still educating myself. How fortunate I am to have come across The Inner West, which provides information on many aspects of our western esoteric traditions that I was unaware of.  I have studied esoteric traditions from cultures other than my own for many years and I feel reasonably conversant in the teachings of Eastern and Middle Eastern mysticism. What I discovered by reading The Inner West was how little I knew about the esoteric traditions so close to home. There is a wealth of knowledge contained in this highly readable anthology. I consider it a valuable reference book to have available whenever I want to refresh my understanding about a range of subjects that have not been readily accessible to the general public until now. 
 Very easy to read and to understand, every concept is given with statistic/scientific demonstrations. No mystery behind the subject. This book is especially good for people interested in going deeper in the subject from every different point of view. This in not for people who simply want to be told how to gain health and fitness, but it's for people who also want to know why.. 
 This is a great book for a graduation gift, that's why I bought it.  It has easy instructions, and all done in the microwave 
 Stephen King steps off into the woods and gives us Trisha McFarland. She's out for a day of hiking with her mom and brother (who don't get along) when after a quick step off the trail, she becomes lost in the wilderness. This book does not have the same supernatural theme that King normally uses, but this story is uneasy nonetheless. Getting lost in the wilderness is much more real than vampires and werewolves, and King does an excellent job giving us real insight into Trisha's thoughts. This book is one of my favorite Stephen King books. 
 Brilliantly constructed work that uses a combination of biblical exegesis and gripping, relevant examples from the counseling realm to expose how we are led astray by the 'science' and subtleties of psychology. While genuinely acknowledging that organic mental illnesses do exist and require treatment, Bulkley explains clearly why counseling never seems to end! By inventing labels, sinful behaviors that have existed since the beginning of time have now become a diagnosis that requires psychological treatment and counseling. This of course absolves us from any wrongdoing and makes us all victims.  "When we accept the doctrine that we need more information than God has given in His Word, we open the doors of our hearts and minds to the god of this age, who is at work filling us with his lies."  Either Christ is all sufficient, or he is not. God has either given us everything we need for life and godliness, or he has not 
 I love the music on this CD. Harvest Moon is supposed to be a sequel to Harvest, but it really isn't - it stands in its own, even though the musicians and most of the backup singers  are the same as Harvest. This is a great one to listen to anytime, with even the sound of Neil's fingers on the guitar strings which are heard very clearly. Nicolette Larson (a fine singer who was too young when she left us) has some great harmony work here as well, on You and Me and War of Man. You really can't go wrong with this one - check it out.  
 A friend loaned this to me to try on my multichannel surround/home theater setup. Wow! This is one of the most LIVE sounding receodings I've tried. The percussion is precisely placed in space and theI've just ordered one for myself. Highly reconmmended!  
 I have a 6month old son and a 4 year old daughter and these blocks get them playing together.  My daughter loves to build them up and my son loves to knock them down.  He also likes them when she is not around, they are small enough he can grip them just fine in his hands and pass them from one hand to the other. 
 This book is my favourite book of all time. I know that my personal opinion probably doesn't count when compared to someone who has perhaps studied a Masters in English, but I really think anyone should read this book. My favourite of the three stories in this collection, is "Lorraine goes to Livingstone". This story, has the usual shock value characteristic of Welsh, but to the literary buffs out there, it can be analysed on many levels. I found it to be an hilarious satire of the media, as well as being accurate at pinpointing the true motives to the characters behaviour. I think that this collection of short stories will be loved by the most discerning readers, not only because it's funny, deep etc, but also because it forces the reader to see the part of the human psyche that we  don't want to admit is present. In short buy this book 
 This extravegant tale of England's oft-married king and his reign is portrayed breathtakingly on screen by Mr. Charles Laughton. This story highlights Henry the Eigths' uneven relations towards his spouses and his  above-average lifestyle. I don't agree with the viewer rating this a  two-star movie. It is informative, realistic, candid, and marvelous. Hooray  for C.L. and his won at the 1933 Academy Awards for Best Actor 
 I ordered this book for a number of my employees because it is geared to our philosophy of doing business.  His message of building relationships and bringing value to customers rather than high pressure selling is a good lesson for anyone in sales 
 Keeping it simple: Buy these cards!  Zondervan's Greek vocabulary cards are dramatically superior to the VisEd cards.  The printing is in a large easy to read font and the card size is just right. For those familiar with the VisEd vocab cards, these are about 1/4 of an inch higher and about 1/4 of an inch narrower.  This makes the cards much easier to hold and flip through.  Mastering the vocabulary on these cards is absolutely essential to reading the Greek NT.  One of the "lies" I was told in Seminary was that you only needed to learn those words used 50 times or more.  If you follow that advice, you will need to carry a dictionary with you everywhere you take your Greek NT.  The joy and usefulness of NT Greek depends on your memorising all the words used 10 or more times in the NT - and these cards from Zondervan make it easier than ever to do just that 
 Excellent GPS Unit for the most part. What's lame is the Garmin people. I notified them of a major new Highway in SE Massachusetts, that I helped build, that does not show up on the mapping software. The higway has been open for more than 2 years. All I got back was a generic email, insulting. Anyway, love the unit but the mp3 player is also weak. You cant set up folders like an ipod or any other player and the transmitter is not powerful enough. I read this complaint before I purchased the unit, bought it anyway. The ability to "grab" the map is very cool. You have to decide if the price is worth it 
 Based on Pushkin's poem Eugen Onegin inspired Tchaikovsky to write some of his best music and certainly his best opera,his own personal life became affected by his passion for this work leading him into a disastrous marriage and further depression. In Levine's glorious version the Dresden Staatskapelle play with wild Slavonic abandon,passionate and exciting,more so than in any other ,while it's true there are too few Russian singers on this recording which to my ears gives some cause for concern,the quality of singing is excellent,Thomas Allen's dark,virile baritone captures magnificently the cadishness of Onegin while Mirella Freni late in her career sings  yearningly with beautiful golden tone,credibly girlish and passionate,Shicoff conveys admirably the nervous dreamy quality of Lenski and its good to hear the firm dark voice of the Georgian bass Paata Burchuladze in the part of Prince Gremin,all the other singers give great performances on this superlative CD.Very recommendable! 
 I love the convenience that the Melitta 0ne:one offers! It makes a fabulous cup of tea. All the teas are delicious but the coffees are terribly strong to me.I enjoy your average espresso drink often, but was blown away by the strength of the coffee pods! The portions, 8oz or 4oz, alone are too small for my large cups, so I just run it twice with the same pod (I know it says not to, but I have not had any problems). If you like coffee or tea, but just not a whole pot, this is for you.. 
 Any body that knows David Benoits music will definately want to add this one to their collection.The first half is pretty lively, and it mellows for the second half....just as it should be !  Buy it...you won`t be disapointed  
 This book is a good resource for teachers!  It is full of fun, interesting, and relatively simple activities that make abstract mathematical concepts come to life.  Math is made less intimidating, because the mystery behind it is revealed by a curious cat with whom children can relate.  The book takes mathematical concepts that might otherwise be too complex for children to grasp and simplifies them, making them more "kid friendly."  Younger children, who are more likely to enjoy the cat's stories, may not fully appreciate the mathematical content.  They will, however, benefit from the books pleasant introduction to mathematical concepts. Similarly, older children, who are more likely to fully appreciate the mathematical content, may not enjoy Penrose as much (or at least they might not admit that they do). However, learning with Penrose will still make the experience less intimidating.  The book is clever and a great tool for teaching math, while easing and/or preventing math phobia.  I will definitely use this book in my own classroom 
 I thought it was a great book. At first really wasn't sure I would like it but once I got it, it was really great. It defiantly is good for teenagers and to learn a way to get out of high school problems. I would recommend this book to anybody. This book can put you in different shoes to teach other people what it is like for other people or it can just teach you that there can be a story behind everyone. I really learned that it is not good to keep things in and once you get them out life can be much easier 
 This is an outstanding primer on Japanese grammar. Its small size makes it easy to tote around in a coat pocket. The explanations are very clear, and you can easily get a "macro view" of any area of Japanese grammar 
 This cd is not as good as K&D sessions but is right up there. Some may beg to differ. The one good thing about Kruder and Dorfmeister is you have to listen to enter with an open mind cause every cd is different. A lot of mellow pop, bass and drums, techno. This album could be the most mellow I've heard, but the kicks are a plus. A lot of bass and drums, which is the Kruder dorfmeister style anyways.  
 I have seen many historical war dramas from Far East (mainly China's) and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy.  Yi Soon Shin, however, is a rare exception.  Not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in-fighting between the Chosun political factions (and the second-guessing nature of the king) which causes his eventual death.     Also, the special effects are great.  The battle scenes (whether on sea or land) are realisitic and of outstanding quality.  The only problem that I can find is that the DVD has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the Ming China.  Then again, this is not unexpected since this is a Korean drama focusing on the great admiral.  Also, the entire selection should have 104 episodes.  I don't know why it stops at 101.  If you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject, try Samuel Hawley's Imjin War (which portrays Yi Soon Shin more accurately by quoting original sources).  Any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out Stephen Turnbull's Samurai Invasion (which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the Japanese perspective).    Lastly, anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out Shogun:Total War by Creative Assembly (now in Gold version). 
 Some call it reductionism.  Some call it holism.  Isaac Asimov discussed it as a science fiction theory he called psychohistory in his Foundation series.  And Edward Wilson has chosen the term consilience by which he means to describe a theory which attempts to unify man's search for knowledge in the various fields of mathematics, physics, chemisty, biology, evolutionary psychology (and its related individual centered fields) and socibiology (and its related group centered fields).  It's a noble effort and his book is fairly successful at discussing some of the enlightenment visionaries who first posited such a unification and some of the major developments along the way.  However, the book does not merit a a complete five stars because it fails to join contemporary academic wisdom in concluding that to be a physically observed phenomenon, the event or occurence must have a physical cause.  In essence he fudges -- and three centuries later at that -- in the same way Descartes fudged when he tried to rationally posit the meeting ground of soul and substance.  In this way, the "debate" as Wilson put it, between impiracism and transcendentalism has already been resolved in the lab if not the public consciousness.  It's amazing how the greatest of advancements almost always come with the questioning of previously thought unquestionable views.  In this way, Darwin with evolution, Einstein with time, Godel with mathematical impiracism and most recently Dennett with consciousness itself all have made great strides by felling old misconceptions in favor of a more accurate view of reality.  Pity that this book did not live out of potential of its Harvard author to itself articulate such a view 
 I would have to disagree with the suggestion that the intellectual is not personal. If the life of a person is one of intellectual pursuit, isn't that what is most personal to that person? An intellectual history of one's personal development is among the most intimate and personal portraits an individual can have. No 
 Because I sell luxury home and gift items, I was drawn to the title of this book.  Sometimes that is not always a good indicator of what is inside, but in this case it was dead-on.  The book helped me understand what I've seen over the last few years, as well as gave me some insight into where things are heading (and why).  I keep talking about the book, and the list of friends and associates who want to borrow the book keeps growing, although I may not want to give it up.  Only a few more pages to go... 
 I'm just going to say this book is very artfully written and features a clever surprise ending. I actually listened to it on audio read by an English actor with a great voice. I liked it so much that afterward I purchased the book for a friend who is a British school teacher (as is the book's main character) 
  This isn't a review, I just thought I'd attempt to clear up a thing or two;      The sample in "2Wicky" is from Isaac Hayes'"Walk on By",not from Joe Jackson.           There's been alot of discussion about whether or not Hooverphonic sounds like Portishead, as though that that would be a terrible thing, but I don't think Hooverphonic would feel too badly about it.  During a discussion with Alex before a show in Boston one night, he volenteerd that Portishead was the inspiration when writing the song "2Wicky".  Also revealed the use of the word "Prophet" in "the flight number of our galactic sun" just came from reading it off of a synthesizer, and "2Wicky" was just a cool way of spelling "tricky"(duh), which I was was actually too stupid to figure out on my own. When asked where the name Hooverphonic(which I love)came from he simply said that it was "vacuum cleaner music", which kinda makes sense.   Hope you "found this review helpful".     
 a lot of info but it is broken down into bonehead terms.... 
 Essentially, Jakob and Ben are the same person, but from different worlds. Jakob, from a small Polish town, and Ben from a more modern city. The concept of giving to receive is  discovered first by Jakob through his rescue by Athos, and then by Ben by way of Jakob's journal entries. Through giving their own feelings to others, both receive the knowledge of receiving  from others. This reception is not only physical, but more emotional to the extent that by having all of the feelings necessary to live, both can actually live by giving their own feelings to others and receiving feelings from others. Without the concept of feelings, neither character would have changed throughout the course of this novel. When the reader discovers the true connection between the two characters in both halves of the novel is when the story can be completed. Some portions of each half are purposely left out to leave the reader to connect the two characters for themself. This style of writing is more interactive and can give the reader the ability to actually become part of the novel. To connect the characters is to give the reader an important role in the story. This is accomplished in this novel to bring the reader's personal thoughts and feelings into the world of Jakob and Ben so at the end, both Jakob and Ben have the affection of other characters in the novel as well as the affection of the reader. When Jakob and Ben are finally recognized as one and the same person, the story is more understandable and the foreshadowing becomes obvious. 
 The five stars are the reward for something so simple that it is a wonder it hasn't been done more often. The historical characters in this production actually speak,and for more than just a few sentences! The mix of reenactment, historical sites and 'talking head' narration, has been effectively done in other productions such as "Liberty!","Franklin" and "John Adams", but here, in contrast to those efforts, the major characters, Washington, Braddock, get a chance to speak at greater length, and not just reciting their correspondence. This makes the story more interesting and move along with much greater ease. The pacing is good; it seldom drags the way some history presentations do. The casting is good, the uniforms are adequate (buffs will spot some budget related errors)and the story gets the respect it deserves. Washington's role in starting the first 'world war' and its crucial contribution of experience to his role in the American Revolution, should be more widely known. This edition should help. We can only hope other historical subjects will get a similar treatment 
 This printing of the King James "Demonology" consists of four main parts:  Demonology Books 1-3, and News From Scotland.  The entire book is written on old-english.  It takes geting used to the old spelling of nearly every word, but once you figure out what is being said, the book is rather interesting.  Demonology Books 1-3 are in a conversation format between two individuals:  Philomathes and Epistemon.  In these three books, Epistemon answers Philomathes questions regarding his odd and rather strict views on Magic, Sorcery, Witches, Demons, and mainly Satan.  It's interesting to learn how people in the 1500's thought back then--many things in entertainment, educational, and medical fields which we see today that we consider normal were considered the work of the Devil back when this book was originally written.  Epistemon comes accross and single-mindedly arrogant, but interesting, nonetheless.   The final part of the book the News from Scotland which is about how a handful of women and a doctor were tried, tortured, and some executed for the belief and fear that these individuals were witches--which, back then, anyone who did anything out of the norm was considered a witch (all witches were considered the Devil's deciples during that time).  The first three books tells us what they thought of Satan, witches, ghosts, and demons during the 1500's and the last part shows us an example of what they did when they thought someone was a witch and how far they went to rid themselves of these individuals.  This is a very interesting, educational, however very difficult read as it is in old english--spelling was rather different to how we spell things today.  Once you get used to the spelling (which you may never do--some words are spelled so far off as to what we spell them now; and some words have multiple spellings--which makes it even more difficult to figure out).  A very good, but rather difficult read 
 Good articles on current farming.  Varied articles on different but pertinent topics.  Extensive ad section 
 I am priviledged to have 10 grandchildren 8 of whom are teenagers.  Being a lover of books, I always read what I send to my family.  These 101 stories are so interesting and diverse that I keep a copy in my home for  young visitors.  I think every grandparent and school should have a copy  for all to read

 Garrison was on the Right Track. recently declassified documents, reveal alot more to the story than we suspected. now we know that Shaw was a CIA Contract Agent who reported from 1948-56 on the psych profiles of international leaders and business people. in addition, David Ferrie who also worked for the Agency was prepping UDT units all ready for the Bay of Pigs invasion. lastly, the CIA had trained agents posed as Journalists infiltraing Garrison's office stealing files. Walter Sheridan used very questionable tactics to smear Garrison. when Earl Warren was fighting for the case of Brown vs. the Board of Education, Sheridan used those same tactics to smear the witnesses by bribing them etc. in general, Garrison is admired for his Courage and Determination to present the truth to the Amercian Public. dont believe books like "False Witness" because they are just regurgitating the same old bad rumors about the late Jim Garrison that was promoted by the ever Corrupt Media and the Staff Members who betrayed him 
 If you are just entering the world of Beethovens' works, this might be just the ticket for you. From the familiar opening bars of Symphony # 5 to the majestic 'Ode To Joy', this is a fantastic overview of his music. Sir Georg Solti is joined by the London Symphonic orchestra with guests such as Yo-Yo- ma, Murray Perahia, etc. Should you want a great recording of Beethovens' 9 symphonies, try the 5 cd set by Karajan 
 I really like Cloe's converse shoes! I definitely want this Cloe! Her out fit is tooo cute ^^  *J3SSICA* &&I love the Bratz...but end the dollie war! Peace and Love# 
 When I first read this book several years ago, I hated it. I saw no reality in the story of Delia Grinstead, a 40-year-old wife and mother who quite literally walks out of her family's life one day--and stays away.  With my second reading, however, I see what made her walk away. I see how a woman can feel so totally invisible to her loved ones that the pull of gravity can simply release her from her bonds, so to speak.  Of course Delia isn't REALLY released from anything. Walking away from her Baltimore family into a new life as "Ms. Grinstead" in a small Maryland town allows her to experience life on an entirely different level. Here, she gets a job as a secretary (rigid Ms. Grinstead), makes a number of eclectic friends (this is where Tyler always shines, in describing the small idiosyncracies of ordinary people), and creates a new life for herself.   But what of those she left behind? Can she honestly put them away like a faded photograph? Read and see...I'm glad I gave this lovely story another chance 
 ...and probably one of the most fun to read. I read the first 8 chapters while working on a permaculture site on Isla Ometepe in Nicaragua, and ordered it immediately upon returning home.  Bill Mollison carefully and beautifully lays out the theory and practice of Permaculture (permanent agriculture). Permaculture is a holistic design system that sustainably envisions, creates, and organizes the spaces that we as humans inhabit on this planet. It takes everything that I feel is good for the world-Green architecture, local food, water conservation, renewable energy, organic agriculture, etc.-and wraps them into one cohesive scheme for planning the spaces and manner in which we live.  For more information, check out the Permaculture Research Institute's page at www.permaculture.org.au, especially the quick video "Greening the Desert", which is an excellent introduction 
 My only "complaint" about the CD is that I absolutely HAVE to sit and listen to the entire thing whenever I start it up!  I usually have music playing in the background while doing other things, but not this one!  There are no tracks that I find myself wanting to skip over as in most collections.  In fact, I usually find myself going back and listening to selected tracks again (and again and...) after taking the hour+ to listen to the whole thing through once.  These four ladies produce a unique and remarkable sound.  I can't recommend it enough 
 This has been a good purchase for us.  We are in northern Italy for about 7 weeks, and needed to navigate a number of cities: for several business meetings and just to find our way around.  It has been an invaluable tool.  We have still used physical maps to a certain extent, but in finding the shortest routes, and other points of interest, this has helped us never to be lost (so far! 
 Another great read by Mary Kay Andrews.  Great character development and a very touching story.  I hated to come to the end of the book 
 For anyone interested in where technology is helping to drive the human species and society, The Spike by Damien Broderick is one of the best books to come along so far.  Undoubtedly written by someone who readily embraces the positive possibilities for the future of humanity, it nonetheless outlines many of the potential dangers and problems confronting us as exponential change impacts our world over the next few decades.  He covers today's major technologies and technological trends in a highly readable and entertaining manner and presents perspectives on our near-future that are reasonable, well documented, and thought provoking.  Not science fiction, this book is a valuable and practical contribution to the continuing and creative and very important dialog on where our world is ultimately headed.  Highly recommended 
 Comparable to Ruse's _Taking Darwin Seriously_, but written just before the high tide of the sociobiological rendering of ethical questions, this work cogently, though somewhat naively, attempts to assess the implications of Darwinism for morality and religion. Overconfidence in the mechanics of natural selection is the only word to describe the result of such efforts, given in every sense a 'bum steer' by the dogmatic mantras of Darwinian selectionism. Man could suffer hybris, take himself to be special, and certainly Darwinism is a slap to this disposition, but it does not follow that if we accept evolution, or the proposition that man morphs from the domain of animals, that we must renounce the deeper side of _homo sapiens_, a side truly visible in man, and man only, however latent or occasional early signs of this might be in the species cousins, the great apes. And this deeper side of man gives signs of being a potential that emerges, not as adaptation, but as a self-consciousness at first superfluous, and barely used, and seldom for purposes of survival. Perhaps that is a sign of an evolution we are unaware of. Here the other religion is the Buddhist, nor miracles here, only that potential that nature leaves alone, for man must 'evolve' it in freedom.  Here Wallace himself became suspicious, and wondered how, as a more extreme selectionist than Darwin, one could account for this 'virtual man' behind the creature-hominid. Rachel's answer seems to be to simply eliminate the question through the prior given, which is not given at all, that natural selection is proven, when the example is the counterevidence! We should instead query the mysteries of time for deeper answers.  One issue bedevils the debate, the so-called naturalistic fallacy. While it was certainly brilliant for G. Moore to pull the rug from under Spencer's ethical naturalism with his separation of ethics and nature, a strange contradiction arises in this tacit acknowledgement, it would seem, of the need for non-naturalistic explanations of values!! Surely, the trap is not in Moore's subtle argument, but in what he called it, the 'naturalistic' fallacy. This description was not present in Hume's first use of this argument, as he cleaved the 'is' from the 'ought' in his _Dialogues_. We may not derive the 'is' from the 'ought', but we cannot derive even the mere 'is' of man from string theory either! Let alone the 'ought'. The whole question rests on a quagmire of incomplete foundational physics and its tendency to suggest a given set of premises, themselves in motion. The question of reduction is altogether a dark pit, and we cannot assume the 'ought' has no emergent source in nature. The dilemma is that while the 'naturalistic' fallacy, so-called, may be indeed fallacious, it does not follow from its _name_ that nature cannot 'evolve' ethics in some other fashion that is a mystery to us. In fact, history gives us alternate suggestions. Indeed, the emergence of religions themselves become orphans in Darwinian accounts, when the scientific demand would be for a naturalistic evolutionism that includes values! We assume thus that evolution is univalent, never changes, and does all in one stop mechanics, natural selection. A naturalistic fallacy indeed! This only deals with a few strains of this clearly expounded book, that left me for one shadowboxing, and whose central perspective seems doomed to frustration, for the secularization of religion seemed better addressed before Darwin, than after, as the immense resistance his theory created suggests. For after Darwin, a traditionalist was handed a golden argument in the superficial character of selectionist explanation. Before, all parties knew the hard uphill of the philosopher was the lot of all, no gimmicks allowed.  One should hope for a new theory that can produce a naturalistic account of the evolution of religion, and change the confusing description of the 'naturalistic' fallacy.  Worth reading, although one begins to fear the lack of foundations for any Darwinian account of morality.  But when all is said and done, one can only agree with Rachels that the unity of man and animals is a point of victory against pomposity for Darwinism and the idea of evolution, taken more generally 
 Package came in a timely manner with no defects...great price, too 
 I first heard of Morris Day when Purple Rain was released in theatres over here in NZ.  The dude is an exceptionally talented master of funk and HE ROCKS 
 There's not enough good I can say about this film. It is fascinating on so many levels.  Filmmaker Andrew Jarecki's original idea -- to film New York City birthday clowns -- took a new tack when he met #1 clown David Friedman, who had a family secret infinitely more intriguing than his birthday work. It turns out that David's father was an infamous Long Island pedophile whose story had rocked the small town of Great Neck in the late 1980s.   The film is a chronicle of the Friedman's story, from the days before the scandal until the present. Father Arnold Friedman is a beloved high school teacher who teaches piano and computer skills at his home. After police catch him with a few kiddie porn magazines, they start interviewing Friedman's students. Suddenly, Friedman and his teenage son Jesse are being charged with hundreds of incidents of sodomy and assault, and their lives are turned upside down. Luckily (from the point of view of the filmmakers) the family had always loved taking films of themselves and did not stop during the family crisis. Much of the family's film and video footage appears in the movie, either reinforcing or acting as counterpoint to the interviews they accompany.  But "Capturing the Friedmans" is about much more than a pedophilia scandal. It is also about the way that the structure of the justice system -- police, lawyers, judges and legal procedures -- can sometimes generate convictions from nothing. The film is also about memory, specifically the way our memories are reshaped by the passing years. Research is now demonstrating that memories -- rather than being videotapes of the past -- are strongly colored by the way we see ourselves in the present. In the film, the juxtaposition of present day "recollections" with the written and filmed record is staggering.   The filmmakers are not trying to exonerate the Friedmans or to indict those who brought them to justice. The facts are laid out with all their gaps and contradictions; the characters are allowed to tell their own stories with all their factual and self-serving facets. And we are asked to respond. Are the Friedmans victims, merely odd or truly evil? How did a community come to believe what seems to be a bizarre story? How did the legal system reach a verdict without adequate investigation by skeptical police or a trial before the peers of the accused? Was justice served -- or merely the justice system?  The 2-disk DVD includes Jarecki's interview on the Charlie Rose Show as well as interesting material taken during Q&A sessions at the film's premiers. The film's participants react to the way they are depicted -- usually continuing to make the case for decisions made 15 years in the past -- sometimes escalating into confrontations and raw anger.  In short, "Capturing the Friedmans" is a movie that I cannot stop talking about and recommending to everyone I meet 
 This book is a little dry for a layman's tastes probably, but more than likely only the interested will purchase such a specialized title anyway.  The reason for the "dryness"?  This book is very conservative, making no convoluted deductions from the evidence, but is actually a concise survey of everything currently known about the mycenaeans (what types of info are preserved on the tablets, what crops and livestock were cultivated, what aspects of the administrative system is known, etc.). The writing style isn't dry, really, just to-the-point as it should be in such a work. Any deep studies of bronze-age Greece should start here 
 Losing James Evans, the patriach of the family, robbed the show of its momentum and its core ideal of showing a complete African-American family struggling to make ends meet together.  And as badly as the writers chose to deal with the departure of John Amos' character, the performance of Esther Rolle in those two first episodes of this season salvage what is left of a bad situation and it hits home.  The end of the 2nd episode is probably one of the most emotional moments ever in television history and you just can't help feeling her pain and agony over the death of her husband.  It's a credit to Esther Rolle's acting talent and it does the show justice and puts a fitting, albeit bittersweet closure to this unfortunate circumstance.  There are some good shows this season to enjoy however it's clear that the show begins its steady decline from its heyday that it enjoyed the first 3 seasons.  But no matter what you think, Good Times is one of those shows that I believe will forever be considered the best of what television had to offer during the late 70s and is a classic for all time.  Enjoy it

 I have to agree with some of the other reviews.  This is one of the best, if not the best, novel ever written.  5 stars isn't enough 
 Ulam is an interesting character and an interesting mathematician. It is a pleasure to read his very human autobiography.. 
 Often reviews describe the Bird with the Crystal Plumage as Dario Argento developing his style. In fact, it is a classic of the horror genre and an obvious influence on John Carpenter. Though somewhat closer to suspense than horror the cinematography of the scenes with the killer attacking with a knife are jolting and shocking and with the (for the times) explicit scenes restored you have a classic film right there. Later films by Argento would be mired down in style over substance. The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, although obviously influenced by Hitchcock was taking Mario Bava to a new level and a blue print for the European horror film 
 The Kai Lung books have a nice dry humour, a beautifully way of turning a phrase and a concoluted way of using the english language. It is a China that never was but really ought to have been 
 Some of you may be familiar with Auguste Escoffier, the legendary cullinarian of French descent that was responsible for classifying and for many complicating French cuisine. This book truly takes that intimidating factor out of the preparation of French food.  This book is focused on recipes that any person with a basic understanding of culinary dos and do nots will have no trouble in grasping and mastering in a very short period of time.  In conclusion, if you have felt intimidated in the past of trying to create French masterpieces, buy this book fearlessly, it is well worth the pric 
 I train high school students to work with preschoolers.  This is the best book I have seen in my 23 years of teaching.  It is a straight forward resource that has everything my students need to know.  It is chockful of  ideas of manipulatives that can be made which is a real money saver.  I  order it each year for my students and I held my breath as I checked to see  if you still carried it.  I don't know what I would do if I could not get  it.  I assign chapters for my students to read and then have developed  questions for them to answer.  I certainly do rely on it to teach my  students. I have shared it with other vocational early childhood education  job training instructors and they feel the same way I do.  Thank you,Jean.  You are a lifesaver.  I know when my students graduate they have a resource  that they will use for many years to come 
 After buying this book and reading the negative reviews here, it seems clear to me that there is a church inspired agenda resenting Prophet's book and what she has to say. For centuries, the subject of the Book of Enoch has been forbidden within the Catholic church and this will not change in the near future. Therefore, if you want to enhance your knowledge of the Book of Enoch, the early church and why Enoch is missing from the Old Testament, then Prophet's book is really the only one to have. You will not regret buying this book, but you might enrage a few church fanatics if you dare to speak about it. 
 Rarely have I read a book that felt so much like it was written just for me than The World is a Waiting Lover. Over the years I've read many works in an effort to understand love and the innate and elusive longing for "the Other" that so commonly undermines relationships. The He, She and We trilogy by Robert Johnson, The Eden Project by Richard Ellis and others have all been valuable, yet my stubborn confusion persisted. Trebbe Johnson's book helped me separate finally, the capital "B" Beloved that pulls us ever onwards (if we allow it) towards the deepest knowing of our soul selves from the little "b" beloved of our significant others.   Perhaps my longing for "the Goddess" was inordinately strong. No matter. Now I understand just how natural, wonderful and important the pursuit of that longing is in the magical pulling of my soul towards it's highest completion. And finally, no longer will I confuse this sublime pulling with a need to manifest it in a flesh and blood woman. To do so, I now realize would only diminish The Beloved, myself and my partner. This book is a one of a kind detective story tracking passion to it's very lair. Whether it was the author's absolutely enchanting and delicious use of words, her uncanny way of tying mythology to daily experience or her own authentic heart so consistently revealed, I rank this book in the short list of works that have truly impacted life. Thank you Trebbe! 
 This solid 42-song collection of odds 'n' ends from the good folks at Bloodshot Records consists of the expected alt.country twang 'n' tears, but it contains a few great out-of-leftfield surprises as well. Among the expected highlights are the gorgeous "Do You Want To Go Somewhere?" by Richard Buckner, the solo acoustic "Behind That Locked Door" by Jim James of My Morning Jacket, the rollicking "Two Way Action" by Nora O'Connor (with the help of Andrew Bird), and "I'd Be Lonesome" by the Old '97s - all of them perfect examples of the best of Bloodshot's genre. And there's other great tracks by the Bottle Rockets, the Minus 5, Graham Parker & the Figgs, Andre Williams & the Sadies, John Doe, Crooked Fingers, Mary Lou Lord, and Kelly Hogan, but the leftfield stuff is, if not exactly better, then just a lot more fun. Bobby Bare Jr. handles the Jane's Addiction classic "Ocean Size", Dollar Store twang-ifies the Soft Boys' "I Want To Destroy You", the Waco Brothers check in with the Bobby Fuller Four (by-way-of the Clash) chestnut "I Fought The Law", Porter Hall TN throws the Jim Carroll Band's "People Who Died" against the wall, and the Yayhoos brilliantly rock up the O'Jays' "Love Train".    Sure, there's a little bit of chaff. But while you're picking through the 42 tracks for your favorites, you might find a another keeper along the way. For me, it was the Deadstring Brothers. I'd never heard of them before, but their song "Where Are All My Friends" is fast becoming one of my faves of this year. So who knows what you might find? 
 This book and this theory provide a comprehensive framework for understanding both infant/human development AND infant-parent relationships. More importantly, the book suggests what exactly it is that clinicians are or strive to be doing as they implement infant-parent psychotherapy and other infant mental health interventions with high risk families. This book brought together years of my own self-study in IMH, helping me develop an integrated framework for my work with families of young children. Actually, this framework impacts the work I do with people of all ages. It helps me define what clinical practice is 
 Slightly depressing, but a great overview of why the Arabs, Palestinians, and Israelis act toward each other the way they do 
 If you're interested in forensics, chances are you'll like this book.  The book also manages to tie in sexual abuse, repressed memories, Miss., Vietnam, PTSD, and a little romance.  It even broaches the topic of multiple personality disorder but does not linger there long.  I was impressed by the breadth of knowledge that made this book's plot and discussions as intricate as they are 
 Brian Malone is one of the best young defense attorneys in the city. Brian is at "The Men's Club" (a bordello) treating his soon-to-be-married friend to a final wild night out. Brian hates the place and can hardly wait to leave. His interest perks up, though, when he spies a lady he knows and tries to catch up with her in the back of the club. That is the last anyone knows about Brian's where-abouts.   At the same time, Andrea "Andy" Kendricks is too busy to think about her boyfriend, Brian. Seems Brian's colleague and ex-girlfriend, Allie Price, has dragged Andy to a Chippendales' show. Andy is busy imagining what her mother, Cissy Blevins Kendricks, the Dallas society maven extraordinaire, would think should she find out where her daughter was. Shortly thereafter Andy finds out that Brian is missing. His friend claims that Brian ditched him and ran out of the club with one of the dancers. Allie may believe that, but Andy did not!   Andy must put aside her mean spirited thoughts about Allie and team up with "the Blond Menace" to figure out what is going on.   ***** Author Susan McBride has become one of my favorite mystery writers ever! Her characters are always so well developed and totally believable. How could I not adore Andy, the main character? She is perky, sassy, and often hilarious! This mystery will keep you on the edge of your seat AND laughing uproariously. Stellar! *****   Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews 
 Was wondering just how old you were in 1981, when Jamie Lee Curtis stared in this great thriller?  This was before the big  super video store's & Markets, It didn't get any better. Now, As far as She could have and had done better, remember this was 1981. 
 I really liked this book. I found it quite enjoyable, except I already knew what was going to happen a little while after starting it. Also, it left me wondering what happened to Tommy and Maribeth at the end. Did she come back to visit? Did they get married? I would reccomend it though, because it was a great story 
 My wife bought this and we watched it over the weekend, and I was looking here to see what other people thought of it and I can't believe no one has said how funny Jamie is. When he's not being ravaged with business decisions and dealing with personal issues, Jamie seems like a great down to earth guy. He had me cracking up quite a few times. I wasn't sure if I'd like this show as I had only seen his Naked Chef show a few times and I wasn't that excited about it. But this was great. I can't believe his resturaunt ever opened with these kids. They start out not knowing anything he turns them into hard working chefs. It's really amazing.   I don't know what to compare this show to but it's a reality series thats for sure. But not like other ones you've seen really. It's a lot more personal than other shows like it I think. I had a great time watching it and I think you will too 
 I had been using a regular razor for years but with the price of blades figured something like this would be worth it, and when I saw this on sale for 50 bucks I jumped on it.  I have only used it twice and have already noticed a closer shave, so I highly reccomend this razor! 
 I seriously doubt Mr. Denzel Washington is able to give anything less than a performance of total conviction, as he proves once again to me here in one of his earliest leading roles. In a true-life portrayal of George  McKenna, new principal to the trouble-torn George Washington Memorial High  School, he is wholly convincing. The problems he encounters are not solely  those caused by the students, but also the parents and indeed some of the  teachers. His determination to turn things round stems from his passion  that his pupils WILL graduate to college if they want to, and that this  will never happen if they don't feel anyone cares about them. Despite  resistance from some pupils and teachers,(not to mention ongoing gang  warfare within the grounds), others rise to the occasion, both for  themselves and for McKenna himself, such is the respect he gains. In the  process of such diligence his once supportive girlfriend leaves him under  the pressure of his split commitments, but as for the School, he succeeds.  Seeing the graduating students really is a heartwarming moment! Having  previously seen "187", it does make the violent scenes and  troublesome pupils here look bland by comparison, but its hard to tell if  this film was sanitised or "187" sensationalised. Regardless, its  still well worth the watch, especially if you respect Denzel's work in  later movies already 
 Miss Margaret Mackenzie is a lonely young woman when she receives an inheritance after the death of her brother Walter which amounts to £ 800 a year, quite a substantial allowance in the 1860s. Subsequently Margaret moves from London to Littlebath where she takes care of her niece Susanna. Being fair and wealthy, she becomes the object of desire of three gentlemen in particular: her cousin John Ball, Mr Maguire the clergyman and Mr Rubb, junior partner in the company of her brother Tom. Margaret's destiny changes abruptly when her lawyer tells her that actually Walter's money is not hers since it was given to her before Jonathan Ball's death and that it belongs to John Ball. Mr Trollope casts a critical glance at all the intricacies of the Victorian era: money, social position, marriage and business. Nevertheless, the novel is a suspenseful family saga and the plot is so cleverly constructed that it surpasses many a story written in the 21st century 
 From Paul Saffo, Institute for the Future: Based on a deep understanding of the Internet and its origins, this book presents a compelling warning. It is a welcome antidote to both the naive utopianism of the Internet bubble and to oppressive liberty-quenching actions by global corporations and governments alike.

 This book should be a mandatory read for every parent & parent to be.  What an eye opener!!!  This book gives you things to look for in predators...how they operate.  There are comments from real predators as well as victims.  The book can be difficult to read at times.  People are truly sick!  But it gives parents power in what to look for & how talk to your child(ren).  MUST READ! 
 In this book a Latvian refugee from WWII nears the end of her life. She is the descendant of an aristocratic family, and has led two lives.  The first life ends as the war ends and she meets her husband to be.  He is a British doctor attending to the refugees in Berlin.  Her next life is spent in comfort and security in a Sussex village.  In 1990, after the Iron Curtain has fallen, she sends a package of clothing off to Moscow and events are initiated which cause her to revisit her early life, one that she kept secret.  As the tale unfolds she begins to see herself in a young Russian girl who has come to spend the summer.  This book is a mystery, and a novel.  There are three significant murders, but this book feels more like a novel.  The story is packed with historical detail and alternates between the past and present.  I loved Elizabeth Ironside's "Death in the Garden" and this book did not disappoint 
 I love McCartney's piece "A Leaf". Originally written for piano, it was given a beautiful orchestral arrangement for the album, "Working Classical". Here, it is performed by a flute quartet. A fine album

 If you need three Mountain CDs to purchase I would get this CD first, then Climbing! and then the two disc Fillmore East Concert from their bootleg series (followed by "Live - The Road Goes Ever On" and "Flowers of Evil").  I bought this LP when it was released in 1971 and to this day it is one of a few dozen LPs from that era that still gets consistent play 35 years later. The songwriting is excellent, the playing as well and the album sounds good.   It's a great classic rock album.   Leslie West is at the height of his powers in terms of playing and songwriting, Felix Pappalardi's songs are (as mentioned previously) truly wonderful as well. If someone loves 70s rock and they've never heard this album (and in particular Nantucket Sleighride, Travellin In The Dark, Don't Look Around, The Great Train Robbery etc.) you should consider purchasing this. Nantucket Sleighride alone is worth the price (and the live version is truly stunning) alone and it really is one of the great pieces of writing from that era.   
 For those of you that think the Ras ...[is no good]. Ya'll are trippin'. This fool is on fiya for God and knows how to rap. THis cd is worth buyin'. Trust me. The best songs are: DOWN SOUTH, FILL THA BLANKS, GUNS IN THA AIR, HAVE YOU ANY LOVE, THA DAY AFTER, AND WHO'S THA GREATEST 
 One reason this book succeeds is that the protagonists are so unique.  Gretchen Kaiser, a successful executive in her forties, has not resolved her childhood issue that her father refused to acknowledge even her most basic need for recognition.  As a result she is driven to ever higher levels of achievement while a loving relationship eludes her.  Seemingly incapable of giving or receiving love, she routinely engages in casual sex with an endless string of women.  Kylie O'Brien is intelligent and compassionate.  She is an attractive woman of thirty-seven who lives alone and has been celibate since the end of her last relationship over a year ago.  She enjoys the company of her loving family and is prepared to continue her life alone if the right person doesn't come into her life.  When the two women meet and feel an immediate and intense attraction to each other, they struggle to deny it, then to avoid acting on it.  But tragedy and necessity draw them closer together, until their personal issues can no longer be ignored.  As the story unfolds, it becomes a heart-warming tale of the journey of two women toward personal growth.  This book is sure to be remembered as a "first" in lesbian literature 
 I've read several reviews on this book that say it lacks the necessary depth; and I think they are a bit unfair. The objective of this book is simply to provide the least amount of information necessary to pass the exam. Conversely, many of the "larger" books contain information to teach the reader the subject, which may seem unnecessary to many who already know their subject matter. If you were to condense many of these books, you would end up with something resembling this one.  Many other books encourage the reader to memorize unnecessary information, such as vendor specific data, history or countless examples that aren't really relevant to the exam. In memorizing this unnecessary matter, it is possible to overlook more important items. Basically, more information is not necessarily better information. This is the objective of this book.  That being said, it would be extremely risky to rely solely on this book. This is because it contains the "least" information required, written some time ago, in an ever changing industry and exam.   I passed the exam recently using this book and the Official Guide. At first I started using the Shon Harris All-In-One, but found her very irritating and long-winded, so I dropped it (literally and physically). Interestingly she is the co-author for this book, and some would consider this a very condensed version of the All-In-One Book.   A lesser advantage of this book is that you can carry it and read it on trains, work etc. which I found very difficult to do with the bigger 1000 pager hardcover books. 
 Roughly 10 years after founding the seminal jam band Moonboot Lover in the early 1990s, Buffalo-born brothers Alan & Neal Evans teamed up with the naturally gifted upstart guitarist Eric Krasno to form the funky organ trio Soulive. This modern incarnation of the classic B-3 organ trio (ala Jimmy Smith) took the music scene by storm at the turn of the millenium and has since toured and/or recorded with everyone from Dave Matthews to the Neville Brothers to Talib Kweli. This range of collaborators mirrors the broadness of Soulive's sound, and their mix of jazz, funk, soul and hip hop is arguably the freshest sound to have hit the jam band circuit. With Soulive, every track they've ever recorded seriously grooves, thus Steady Groovin is a retrospective of select funky moments.   Of note are tracks featuring special guests Fred Wesley (of James Brown fame) and Black Thought of The Roots. Also, the two final selections are being released on a Soulive record for the first time in the US- one of which features DJ Spinna and the other is the bands take on Stevie Wonder's classic "Golden Lady" 
 Close to the start of the book Mr. Helfer recounts his first encounter with a lion which had been fear trained and nearly loses his arm and his life. However, he realized the lion was just frightened and defending itself. It set him on the first steps to founding a new system of relating to non-domesticated animals that really caught on in the 1960s. The very first beneficiary of this system is Zamba, an abandoned lion cub, who grows into a remarkably gentle, patient and sweet animal. Mr. Helfer details several major experiences with Zamba that includes their first meeting, Zamba's first major movie and trip to Africa, a harrowing episode due to a snow storm, an even more suspenseful escape during a flood, Zamba's departure from the world and a few other experiences they had together. I would have actually liked to hear about many more of these experiences as well as how he refined and developed affection training. Mr. Helfer also raised Gentle Ben and Modoc the Elephant both of whom make cameo appearances. Several times Mr. Helfer critiques his own species quite harshly. There were certainly a few individuals detailed in the book who deserved that condemnation but there were many others who demonstrated bravery, humanity and dedication to animals as well as to people. There were a few relatively minor downsides to the book. Mr. Helfer's writing style is a bit rough around the edges. He makes a few philosophical riffs here and there that aren't anything revolutionary. The author is a bit of a mystic and describes several events which I assumed had some type of magical significance but was not convincing to me. There was actual magic and that was the strong bond between Zamba and Helfer. If you have a fascination with cats especially large ones you'll want to read this book 
 I have always believed that it is NOT a coincidence that things and/or people have the names that they do.  And when I use this book, in my Bible Study time, I am amazed at the 'insights' I see into characters and places where the History of the World as seen through God's eyes happen 
 "The Insider" is one of the most incendiary movies of the 90's.  The movie is based on a magazine article, and for the most part the movie follows the article very accurately.  The acting is incredible, except for the fact that Pacino may have wanted to tone down his performance as Bergman.  The story itself is really a heroic story.  Both Wigand and Bergman desparately want to do the right thing, but are constantly foiled by corporate greed.  The companies in the movie (Brown & Williamson and CBS) also want to do the right thing but they do it under the purview of corporate responsibility.  However, we should not forget what this movie is really about.  It is about how the cigarette industry has manufactured a product that has lead to the death of millions of Americans.  What Wigand revealed was that the tobacco companies manipulated their product with a known carcinogen.  Director Michael Mann directs this movie with the serious intensity that it is due.  One of the scenes that sticks out in my mind is where Wigand is being driven to his deposition in Mississippi.  On one side of the motorcade is a graveyard, obviously representing death, and on the other side is the sea arguably representing life.  Thus, we should know that this movie is really about life and death, and the decisions that people make that influence the lives of millions of Americans.    
 The average person in the US now uses a computer. Typically running a Microsoft operating system or unix or linux. Yet there is an entire ecosystem of embedded computers out there, invisible to most people. Wolf's text explains how you can program such computers as well as design the circuitry in which they might exist. Here, "computer" in the book essentially means microprocessor plus some off-chip memory. The book surveys two main microprocessor families - ARM and SHARC. These are not the most common microprocessors. (Which might be by Motorola.). But Wolf chooses them to illustrate different design ideals for their instruction sets.  One nice thing about the book is that you get a direct grasp of the hierarchy of design and logic. Climbing from the low level devices of latches, gates, flip-flops and the like, to the microprocessor and its machine language, to the corresponding and far easier to use assembly language. Then, upwards to an operating system 
 It is the rare book that is written by a "big time expert" that actually connects with the needs of small business owners. Usually such books miss being practical because their picture of perfection is too far from the day-to-day realities of reader. Not so with this book and I heartily and frequently recommend it. Either Ms. Roffer is a particularly insightful teacher, or she is, despite her level of success, delightfully attuned to the every woman. If you are building a library to support your journey to thriving, take this one home and get out your highlighter 
 This is a great introductory book to one of the best psychologist/philosophers of our time.  It is a king of tough read, but not a like his other works.  This one can be read (with dictionary of course) as opposed to studied, although I did read it twice. Simply a fascinating book to read.  Do yourself a big favor and get to know Jung 
 Spawn is by far, along with the original Batman starring Michael Keaton, the best comic book remake movie ever. Sadly underplayed, especially to the recent flood of sub-par remakes. Well, not only was the magic and mayhem captured forever on film, the soundtrack played a huge roll in the movie as well, thus making it a vital part of the movie that sadly, now, has seemed to become a forgotten craft: That is of course, the lost art of producing a Great movie soundtrack. Showcasing some of the best and most cutting edge artists of that era, which may have not been very long ago, but nevertheless was a significant time. A time of change within the rock community. A precursor to what would be the short life of Nu-Metal and the rebirth of straight up Rock and Roll, which seemed to split fans right down the middle, and all different ways at that. A cool time and a cool change that was long overdue in the music world. although this is one soundtrack that is definitely dated, it is still a much appreciated and a more often than not listened to addition to my collection. Anyone who loves the movie needs this soundtrack, not to mention anyone who just loves music of the heavier sort, this is an awesome soundtrack. 
 Kazanjian discerns connections between phenomenology and human factors engineering forging a much needed breakthrough in understanding core curriculum.  toward that end, his unique work explicates and clarifies  applied phenomenology as he validates the seemingly divergent, often  warring camps of prepositional and holistic approaches to ethics and  education.  Chapter One Justifies the core cirrocumuli and comprises the  first of eight homologies tying together diverse disciplines.  The  remaining seven chapters constitute an elegant systemization, fleshing out  the first chapter.  Kazanjian's volume is the logical conclusion of  Ricoeur, Husserl and human factors engineering 
    As a Music Educator and researcher, I must give credit where credit is due. This  compact but most authoritative work is a testimony to the author's  tenacity for getting the details to some somewhat obscure information (in the case of some very old traditional carols such as 'O Come, O Come, Emmanuel').  He gives the complete story and history of each carol plus some rather modern traditional Christmas songs  such as, " Twelve Days of Christmas", "White Christmas", and "The Christmas Song".  In fact,  the story behind the "Christmas Song"  ("chestnuts roasting by the open fire...")  has some little known facts I was not even aware of about  Mel Torme and Nat King Cole.  Despite my other collection of  books about Christmas carols, I must say this book is the best of all I have read.  I could not rate this higher!!  You will not regret the purchase of this either as a gift or for yourself.  I'm urging all my own students to purchase this as well.  My thanks to Zondervan publishers---they  continue to publish some truly wonderful books!   Well,  don't just sit there---go add this book to your "shopping cart"   (and Merry Christmas!) 
  Anti-festive character who is Shylock on this play sacrificed unjustly. Shylock is a character who is legally invoking his rights as a money-lender among the community which experiencing transition from agriculture society to capitalistic society. Moroever, the character Portia's defending Bassanio as an disguised attorney is unreasonable in some ways and speech is crude, indeed.  In my opinion, to reach the axiomatically righteous conclusion, we should reverse pur point of view toward the 'Justice'. It is a transformation of way of our thinking. Therefore, I recommend rhis masterpiece for someone who aspire to ponder about our human being's viewpoint 
 I have read this book several times and i have to say I dont ever get bored by it. One of the many things I find appealing about this book is the way you can relate to the characters on a personal level. The emotions are so vivid that when you read the book, you find feeling what the charcters feel. The stories depth holds no boundries. The author is not afraid to get a little sappy at times, most authors I find try to avoid this and I think it robs the characters of personality and even the readers sympathy towards the characters.   My favorite aspect about the book is that it is extremely easy to follow and read. I hate it when authors try to impress you by using uselessly big words and complex structure. Not that this makes the story uninteresting, but that I find them exhausting to read. You find yourself stopping on a regular basis to figure out what the hell is going on, but not in this book. Evans is able to draw a picture with crystal clear detail, so much so that you could believe your are there. At the same time, he is able to say what he needs to say without wasting time with complex language.    The first time I read the book I got so absorbed that I read it in two days. The book is filled with twists and turns that leave you itching for more. Ranging in settings that take you from the mountains of Montana to the jungles of Africa, this story will leave no reader disapointed. 
 Someone once told me I'd have a hard time relating to the story because I didn't grow up during the fifties. Although there were probably references to things I didn't understand, I enjoyed it immensely. 
 You have to be around my age (i.e., older than dirt) to remember Barry Goldwater, a right-wing Republican from Arizona who wrote a book with the above title and spectacularly lost to Lyndon Johnson in the presidential race of '64. I invoke his long-dead phrase because, without the irony, it could be UWE's subtitle. Conrad actively hated leftists and self-proclaimed "revolutionaries," and this disgust shines through all of his best work, from the sniveling proto-unionist Donkin in "...Narcissus" through the bestial "generals" of "Nostromo" and, needless to say, the uber-hypocrite Kurtz. Razumov's moment of conservative illumination, in the snow on the night Haldin destroys his life, can be read as serious, humorous, or anywhere in between--but it is genuine. That fragment he pins to his wall (and which Councilor Mikulin finds so fascinating) sums up with Conradian depth and precision today's popular doctrine of personal responsibility. Peter Ivanovich, one of the slimiest characters on record (not to mention his "Egeria") could easily send major liberals over the wall. Naturally, all readers are free to interpret political novels as they see fit, but Conrad's biographers have documented his rightward tilt. UWE is wonderful proof that genius does not play politics. The novel's other virtues are too numerous to list here. I could read it every year for the rest of my life, and probably will 
 A well written, concise, value packed book brilliantly illustrating CTI's Co-Active model of coaching. A "must have" manual for professional coaches providing all the materials, exercises. and concepts of this extraordinary coaching model. Thanks to Laura Whitworth, Henry Kimsey-House, and Phil Sandahl for this invaluable model! I've used it in my coaching business for the past 6 years and it is constantly expanding. 
 I must say that I am biased for buying and reading this book cause one of the teachers in this book was my teacher. I love this book cause it shows you how far a teacher will go to enrich their students love of learning. My teacher has changed the way I have percieved my world, and I am forever greatful. She has lead to me to my career path and I am proud to say that I am presidents of several new start up companies. Teachers and students of all ages should read this to see what real teachers are. I guarantee that you will become a better person, a better student, a better teacher, and just appreciate teachers more for what they do to us (the students) and our community. I for one should think that this author should get a noble prize 
 I could not think of any words that better describe this album. A lot of people were disappointed with Electric Circus, and Common really came back strong with this effort. As much as I think Kanye West is conceited and overrated when it comes to rapping, you cannot deny that he is one of the best producers in the game right now. It seems like his production style would get old, but it never really does, and he puts forth some of his best efforts on this album.  1) Be (Intro) - I know this might sound crazy, but this beat is one of my favorite beats that I have ever heard. Kanye's production here is absolutely awesome. There is probably no better way to start off an album, the instrumental alone is classic, but Common's lyrics on top of it make this track amazing. A great way to kick off the album.  2) The Corner - The intro leads in very nicely to the first single, and again, another sick beat laid by Kanye. Here though, Com's lyrics outshine the beat, especially the first verse.  3) Go! - This one features John Mayer, a somewhat odd combination, but his vocals are very minimal and only on the hook. I like this song but my only problem with it is that much of the track is the hook being repeated again and again. Another verse by Common would have made this track better.  4) Faithful - Kanye goes back to the well here with the high-pitched vocal samples and Common explores the question of whether God is a male or female. John Legend and Bilal appear at the end and absolutely kill their background vocal part, a nice way to finish off this track.  5) Testify - Again Kanye comes with a nice beat, but this one is all about Common. He tells the story of a murder trial that has quite an interesting turn of events at the end. This is a great showcase of Com's storytelling abilities.  6) Love Is... - As the title suggests, this one is about love. It seems like it's getting repetitive, but the beat and lyrics here are both nice as well.  7) Chi-City - This is one of the standout tracks on the album to me. The beat is a bit different than most of the prior beats, a bit more rugged, and Common drops absolutely great lyrics here. This takes it back to the days of Can I Borrow A Dollar? and Resurrection, some classic Common right here.  8) The Food (Live from Chappelle's Show) - At first I thought that a live version wouldn't be as good as a studio version, but I was proved wrong. Kanye laces a nice beat and Common complements it with some nice lyrics. My only complaint here is Kanye on the hook gets a little annoying after a while.  9) Real People - This is a rather odd beat, the best comparison I can make is that it reminds me of some 80's TV show theme song. That sounds corny, but I like this beat as well. The beat isn't the story here though, Com's verses are. He drops some great lyrics and this is really a showcase of Common at his lyrical best.  10) They Say - This is another standout track. Kanye laces a crazy beat, I love the piano. Common spits two verses, Kanye spits one, and John Legend does the hook. Com's second verse in my opinion outshines all the rest. John Legend comes through as usual with a soulful, brilliant hook, and Kanye drops a verse that would sound better if he weren't spitting it on a track with Common, because Common is simply the better rapper. Overall though, a great track, one of the best on the album.  11) It's Your World Part 1 & 2 - The final track on the album brings the album to a close nicely. Not the best track on the album, but solid nonetheless. At the end Pops shows up as well which is always welcomed at the end of most of Common's albums.    Even though this album is only eleven tracks, it still will, in my opinion, go down as one of the best albums in quite some time. Too often now people substitute quality for quantity, but a short album can be great if you put the time and effort into each track, as obviously was the case here. Illmatic was arguably the greatest hip-hop album ever created, and it was only ten tracks. Be isn't quite in the class of Illmatic, but by modern standards, it could be considered as a great album. The replay value is very high, I am still listening to this the year after I bought it and I plan to be listening to it for a long time as well. We can only wish that all albums released nowadays could be given as much thought and effort as this. Common really created a gem here, and if you thought Common was over the hill after hearing Electric Circus, you were wrong. Like the man himself said, "Heard The Corner now they say that n*ggas back. 
 Dean's book pulls together all I'v previously read and experienced into a readable easily understood and flowing formatt 
 David Hall is a terrific scholar, known for his skill as an editor and anthologizer (check out his anthology on the antinomian controversy, for example).  Although there are other good anthologies of Puritan writing out there (Miller, Heimert and Delbanco, etc.) any person serious about understanding these people, their worldviews, their spirituality, and their impact on American culture should consider this anthology as an additional resource.  At the very least it should not be passed over on the basis of an anti-intellectual review written by someone who has not even bothered to review the book itself 
 I love to read celebrity biographies. This was one I thought I am going to love. It is very much different from the typical biography. He writes about what he is feeling rather than who kissed who. It was a refreshing change. I liked the book and am encouraging friends and family to read it too 
 This CD contains a superb selection of old-time string music and vocals from an era that currently seems to be overlooked by the country-western crowd, and, to a certain extent,even the bluegrass affcionados.  Some of the recordings in the mix are obviously dated and not the highest quality, but these are countered by crystal-clear performances by such greats as the New Lost City Ramblers, Mike Seeger, George Pegram, the Spare Change Boys, Mother Maybelle Carter and Doc Watson.  This CD contains fiddle tunes, waltzes, cloggin' tunes, spirituals, instrumentals and vocals that are pure and totally acoustic. I love putting this CD in my truck, rolling down the windows, opening the moon roof, and cranking up the volume, drowning out the hip-hop coming from the hoopdies in the other lane.  It's a fantastic selection.    
 Like all Barbara Michaels' novels, Here I Stay is a superb book.  I couldn't put it down.  Michaels recreates  the atmosphere of a country inn in a small town with consummate skill, and the characters are cleverly   drawn.  If you've read this author's works before, you know that she relies  on certain formulas, and most of  them are again in evidence here.  So  what!  They are formulas that work, and Michael's tale is, as always,   intelligently written.  Be forewarned:  the heroine of this particular  novel is bitter, extremely unlikable, and  astonishingly old-ladyish for  31.  Nevertheless, that doesn't stop her from being believable, and it  shouldn't  put you off from this wonderful, suspenseful book 
 Fantastic research, however, the book was rather academic 
 In this, the fourth volume of Proust's "In Search of Lost Time" (a.k.a. "Remembrance of Things Past"), the narrator is suddenly exposed to a new level of worldly knowledge, a knowledge that the previous volumes foreshadowed but never openly discussed.  The volume begins at the apex of society, more or less where the previous volume ends (i.e., a reception at one of the fashionable Guermantes).  We are then taken on a somewhat bumpy ride down from that peak, to the lesser salon of the Verdurins (previously seen through Swann's eyes in vol. 1) and the narrator's less-than-admirable conduct toward Albertine.  Along the way, as the narrator becomes more of an actor in, and less of an observer of, the world, Proust's style likewise becomes, at times, more traditionally novelistic.  Yet it retains the unique insight, precision, and vitality that make reading Proust a life-changing experience 
 I purchased this product since I do love all things Final Fantasy. Yes, the Movie remains the same but the extras are things that most serious colectors should not do without. The anime feature "Last Order" is one of the main reasons that I picked this up as it explains a lot about Cloud's past. The overall presentation of the box set is beautiful. 5 stars for the FF fanatic and 3 for the casual fan 
 I've been reading everything I can find on fashion and wardrobe, and this one is by far the most comprehensive, real-life, fully illustrated and easy to understand and apply. All the information is geared to the classics, so it applies regardless of the specific fashion trends of a particular season. Imagine how excited I was to discover that the author lives in my own home town.  If you like the book you should see her live workshops @ Lord & Taylor West County St' Louis! 
 Mma Precious Ramotswe is back in the third installment of this wonderful series about the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency near Gaborone, Botswana. Having expanded her family in the first book to include Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, her fiance, and in the second book to include two orphan children, Mma Ramotswe must now look to her business, which is doing well, but not so well as all that. She has promoted her secretary to assistant detective and given her a raise, but there is not enough money coming into the detective agency to keep it in the black.  Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is having business problems of his own. His perpetually lazy assistants seem to get nothing done, and suddenly, Rra Matekoni himself seems to lose all interest in his garage. Mma Ramotswe is distressed, and seeks professional help from the highest caliber of people she can think of.  Meanwhile, an important new client comes to the agency. He is a Government Man, very rich and very powerful. Convinced that his brother's wife is poisoning him, the Government Man hires Mma Ramotswe to investigate, and she turns up astonishing results. While shis is off on this important case, her assistant detective, who has suddenly found herself as Acting Manager of the garage, too, is required to determine the character of certrain beauty queens, to see if any of them is morally fit to win the pageant and go on to compete for Miss Botswana, and maybe Miss Universe.  But most mysterious of all is the small child who smells of lions and is found wild in the bush, unable to communicate with anyone. Naturally he ends up at the orphanage. But what can be done about his bewildering lack of communication with other human beings?  Once again Alexander McCall Smith has captured the cadence and the simpliticy of Africa, its beauty and its complexity. This is a truly delightful book 
 That about sums it up.  This CD is a great buy for anyone who likes Armin or just if you like trance in general.  Altough there are many great tracks on this CD just listen to number seven on disc one.  Escape(number seven on disc one) alone is worth it.  This sounds corny but if you've had a long day that you want to get away from for a little bit, just plug that track in and "escape" 
 I found this book very well-written, full of anecdotes and personal nuggets as well as statistical backing.  In sum, it explained for me the contradictions, opportunities and pitfalls behind the "China miracle". I have read several books on China and I recommend this one over the rest.  A book of this kind is very difficult to write, as the authors chose to incorporate history, culture, modern business practices and the law (among other things!) to explain business success and failure in China.  However, depsite their tall task, they did a good job.  I especially liked the historical and political grounding combined with really fabulous personal interviews with CEOs.  Some of the stories were fun (the golf story with Li Ka-Shing) and some were insightful (Pan Shi Yi's rise).  I found the chapter on legal affairs in China useful but heavy going.  However, regulatory risk is a big component of operating in China (just ask all those companies that have lost their patents there) and there is probably no "fun" way of communicating this.  The authors' insights and recommendations were very useful.  This book should be read carefully and digested.  I certainly do not advocate an overnight read (300+ pages!) but some chapters must absolutely be read before foriegners go to China -- and I think before the Chinese go abroad. George and Usha  Haley have cut behind the hyperbole to reveal some very disturbing truths about this super power and the global business environment which it has changed for ever. More importantly, they have given us some ammunition to help us to control our destinies in this brave new world.  A must read 
 "Hawaii: Tropical Rum Drinks and Cuisine" is an evocation of another era:  the 1950s "Tiki Americana" craze which swept the US after World War II.  The book is crammed with memories and memoribilia of Don the Beachcomber, the guy who created the "Zombie" drink, and may have created the "Mai Tai" as well.  He started his tropical-themed bar in Hollywood in the 1930s.  Think:  full-color photos of tiki drinks, vintage photos, food recipes, even a party guide 
 "Snots" is accepted into the crowd as he turns nine. Just a week after his birthday is Pigeon Day, his most feared day of the year. That is when he is scared to even watch, not to mention to wring the pigeons. Snots fears his ninth year of his life, knowing that he will soon be forced to wring the pigeons. Snots must hide the secret of his "pet" pigeon.  This book brings life to pigeons and is an awesome book to young readers. I like this book because of the tension that builds every page, just like all other Jerry Spinelli books.  Z.L 
 This book is a priceless gem. How long does it take one to write such a book? I have many books and dictionaries of Chinese, but nothing comes close to the usefulness of this book. The cross-references and the indexes are an invaluable aid to learning Chinese characters

 This was a really great book. It sucks you in and is very hard to put down. Its just enough fantasy and magic for me. An ordinary guy in an ordinary life, and he turns out to be not so ordinary after all. I don't like the whole unicorn and dragon adventure quest type fantasy that is everywhere, and have a hard time finding ones I think I'll like. This was one of them..very different type of fantasy. I wish I knew a category to call it. I don't know what it is about her books, but I just can't get enough, I wish 'Thread that Binds..' wasn't so hard to find. I read the Red Heart of Memories, and then I was immediately hooked on her writing 
 This book was fantastic. It offered an insiders view of one of America's most guarded families. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down! To those that refer to W. Noonan as a hanger-on...you're not giving the Kennedys he was so close to enough credit! This story offered the human side of John Kennedy, Jr. I don't think it was all disrespectful to him or his family. John Kennedy Jr. certainly seems to have had a rebellious streak and also a real respect for honesty. While reading I periodically found myself smiling at my own assumption that he would have gotten a kick out of the candid telling of his friendship with Billy Noonan. I absolutely recommend this book. 
 I would highly recommend these dvds!!  It's our favorite show - probably of all-time!  It's definitely gritty, and not for everyone, but if you're a Denis Leary fan buy it now!  The mix of drama and hilarious one liners is unsurpassed 
 As a life passion coach, I like the author's take on what to do if you've gotten stuck in neutral.  Sometimes it's hard to discover just what you are passionate about! I recommend the book for its clear style and helpful  exercises to rekindle your sense of what it is you are truly passionate  about, as well as the inspirational examples about folks pursuing their  passionate purpose 
 Another wonderful book by Patrick McDonnell.  The stories and art are fresh and funny, silly and poignant.  I have all of the Mutts books and calendars (OK, where's the 2001 calendar??)and have the same reverence for the strip as I had for "Calvin and Hobbes" and "The Far Side".  Somehow McDonnell manages to endow all of the characters with distinct "person"alities, without anthropomorphizing them.  Looking forward to more Mutts, ASAP 
 Pursuing a college degree in my late 30s, I found this book to be superb in every way. It reveals how little almost all students know of how to study and reach their academic potential. Have never been disappointed with any of Buzan's books 
 I am impressed by what this book has to offer to teens and their parents.  I was particularly impressed by the chapter regarding addiction.  I have known several good teens who grew up to be unhappy adults because they chose to experiment with addictive substances.  Perhaps one of my best friends would be alive today if he had read and applied the principles Sean teaches regarding addiction.  Definitely worth a careful read 
 I enjoyed Jet Li in this movie...never mind the dubbing, I can look past that and enjoy the move for what it is...fantasy/action.  Four stars.. 
 not about lust, infidelity, midlife crisis, sexual politics, or even dysfunctional families. Instead, it's about two much deeper and more fundamental themes, namely: (1) what happens as four people's lives converge, resulting in a perhaps unconscious but unbridled search for the true meaning of life; (2) and it's about the inborne human tendency to try to answer the age-old question: "Who am I?" (which is most strongly evident at the end of the film). Hence the utterly reckless behavior of the "hero" and "heroine", who, throughout the course of the film, try literally to destroy the existing "social fabric" of their immediate lives in order to get at, once and for all, "The Truth" of who they REALLY are, way down deep. Exhausted by the prevailing cultural matrix of the day and willing to go for broke just to feel something that is more real than what they've experienced thus far, they cast off their inhibitions and personal constraints and blindly and almost symbolically, but decisively, attempt to battle their way through to the truth.   As noted, Irons and Binoche blaze the way on this trail, which involuntarily pulls Irons' wife and son and others into that same kind of struggle, if only to the edge of that struggle.   This film is a magnificent study of human suffering and the quest for truth 
 Rec'd on time, in perfect condition ... no problems encountered at all.  
 Though she's most often dressed as a princess, my daughter enjoyed this book so much that she wore a black witch's cape with her sleeping beauty costume on halloween.  She liked the role-playing (we pretended to be witches in the book and mix evil brews and cast spells on her unsuspecting father) and she seemed to understand the underlying message of the importance of believing in oneself.  
 I shared this book with my third grade class in the beginning of the year. Each double page spread has a child's writing (best self-edited) and a black and white photo. Since the writers were close to their ages, they could model their own writing after the writing in the book. Each child chose their "best part" to write about and then posed for a picture of their hair, feet, etc. I used a digital camera to take black and white photos. The lack of color really emphasized their work. These are now mounted on their lockers for all to see and I have never had as many comments on student writing. This book could inspire writers of many ages 
 Violet and Klaus are stuck in a wagon rolling the cliffs of the Mortmain Mountains. While there sister Sunny was kidnapped by Count Olaf. Violet and Klaus are left for dead. The two Baudelaires must make a dangerous climb up the mountain to save their little sister.  A lot of things get in there way, but one good thing happens to them, they meet a mysterious friend that will help them on there journey to stop Olaf and save Sunny. Does Violet nd Klaus rescue there sister or does Coult Olaf keep hiding. I'm going to leave it for you to find out.   I thought this book was great, I loved how Lemony Snicket kept talking to you throughout the story. I loved the ending of the book because it just doesn't end it keeps you guessing on what is coming next. I think that, if anyone likes mystery or suspence this is a great book for you. 
 To the reviewer who called this movie disturbing all I have to say is save the psycho babble for real life. This is just a movie nothing more. No marriages were ruined.   The music was touching especially the song done by Johnny Mathis. I would recommend this movie for a rainy Saturday or when you need to just have a good cry. 
 Noll identifies twelve "turning points" in the history of Christianity, times at which the faith struck off in a distinctly different direction from that which it had been traveling.  He seeks to set forth the significance of each turning point and set it in its proper place in the broad sweep of history.  You cannot argue with his first few choices, although he seems to read more consequence into the events than may be warranted.  The fall of Jerusalem was indeed a watershed event, but Noll sees its significance in the formation of canon, clergy, and creed.  These three things formed after the fall, and would have formed quite differently but for the fall, but were not the direct result of the fall.  The main significance of the fall is that it freed Christianity from its status as a sect of Judaism.  Until Jerusalem fell, the premier church of Christianity was the Jerusalem Church.  The Jerusalem Church considered itself a sect of Judaism.  Until the death of the Jerusalem Church, all Christians everywhere would feel constrained to follow its lead.  One must wonder whether it was the Council of Nicaea or the Battle of the Milvian Bridge that was the second turning point in Christian history.  Nevertheless, the Nicene Creed's significance cannot be overstated.  The next turning point, the Council of Chalcedon, "settled" Christ's nature.  Although there is still disagreement among  various Christian denominations, most still adhere to the doctrine of Christ hammered out at Chalcedon.  Later "turning points" are more debatable.  Charlemagne's coronation may or may not have laid the foundation for Christendom.  You could make an excellent case for the proposition that we have Constantine, not Charlemagne, to thank for Christendom.  Some "turning points" aren't so much turning points as symptoms of greater movements within Christian history.  The English Act of Supremacy, which was basically an act of convenience for an heirless king, was more symptom than turning point, as were the French Revolution and the ministry of Wesley.  Noll makes this amply clear in the chapters devoted to those "turning points."  His most intriguing chapter is the last, as he maps out the survival of Christianity under Communist repression and the explosion of Christianity in Africa and South America.  This last phenomenon goes far to set at naught the arguments of those who see Christianity as irrelevant in the postmodern world 
 I held off buying this CD for awhile, thinking Jill Sobule was just another one of the blonde bimbo ala Jewel types.  Boy, was I wrong!  She's musically talented, lyrically witty, and socially pithy.  She's a songwriter that can give Elvis Costello (brillant as he is) a run for his money.  You'll never get tired of listening to this one 
 I've seen this movie many times. I like it because it's funnier than the first, as the first is more macabre. And the cross between of a dog and caterpillar, one of the characters in the movie, is extremely cute 
 I've been cataloging thousands of wildflower photos over the past six years and probably own or have "borrowed" most wildflower field ID guides that are out there.  This book is easily my favorite.  Why?  Easy to use:  A color key w/thumbnail images for more than half of the flowers in the book makes finding the right flower much easier if you do not know which family of flowers to search in.  If you do have to browse all the pages then the placement of flower photos along the outside edges of the pages makes thumbing thru the book easier than most.  The pages are substantial enough to make for easy browsing too.  Ethnobotanical info:  Most flowers have a special paragraph about the historical and current usages of the flowering plants for purposes other than visual pleasure, i.e. medicinal, food, ceremonial, dyes, etc.  I'd been using Jack Carman's book "Wildflowers of Tennessee" as my "bible" for TN wildflowers but now this book with a similar name is my favorite.  I still use the Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Wildflowers as a "family locator" because of its easy-to-use key (flower color plus bloom type) when searching for that unknown flower.  One big aggravation with the Audubon book is that the details are in the "white pages" somewhere in the back of the book.  The Wildflowers of Tennessee book has all of the info right there on the same page as the photo.    For newbies the color key makes this book user friendly--even though the flowers are grouped by family, genus then species (as are most wildflower field guides).  Downside?  There are still many, many species flower flowers that have only a description rather than an actual photograph.  However, this book is small enough to be practical in the field.    The price is great!  I paid almost thirty dollars for the Carman book and it was worth every penny.  I don't know how they can sell this fabulous book for such a low price.  Highly recommended.  If you want to buy only one wildflower ID book for the Smokies then this is it 
 Not the best writer in the world, but I still found it hard to put the book down during the last half of the book.  Erik does a good job of showing determination against major challenges.  This may not be on my top 10 list, but it is still on my list of books to read 
 I bought this album on vinyl when it first came out in the 1980s and have always liked it. It is the most underrated Deep Purple album in my opinion. Don't believe all the negative reviews here. This album is fresh and exciting because it is so experimental and largely unlike anything Deep Purple did before or since. Yet it is not so unlike their previous stuff that their trademark sound is lost; it is rather a modernized version of their still identifiable sound. Do all these naysayers really want Deep Purple to keep making the same album over and over again? That would be stagnation, and groups that stagnate don't stick around for long. Now to the "stroke of luck" part: I picked up a used copy of this CD, the NONREMASTERED version and what a surprise! There are longer versions of three songs here than on the vinyl, and I understand the remastered CD version is the same as the vinyl (shorter) version. The song 'Black and White', which on the vinyl version quickly fades out at the end, instead goes on for almost a full minute longer here and becomes an extended jam session with Gillan going nuts on harmonica and Blackmore going nuts on guitar! And with 'Spanish Archer', probably the best song on the album, on the vinyl version the song fades out at the end. Not here. Here we are treated to about 40 additional seconds of Blackmore's wonderful intense soloing at the end of the song, then the song ends cold. And 'Strangeways' goes on for an incredible minute and a half longer than on the vinyl version. It includes a longer solo in the middle from Blackmore and extended noodling at the end of the song which are totally cut out of the vinyl version. Bottom line? I don't know if the most recent remastered version of this CD includes the extended versions of these songs or not. At the ridiculously low price the remastered version is selling for, it is still worth getting because it is a very good album. But if you can find a nonremastered version, buy it at any price as it will be well worth the additional cost.  I sincerely hope the geniuses at the record company re-release this with the FULL versions of these songs included, simply because the longer versions are superior to their edited, chopped up conterparts. Maybe there is an anniversary edition in store with full versions, outtakes, bonus tracks, etc.? I am not attempting to start a rumor here and I have no facts to back this statement up, I am just hoping that this fine album can be released in full form so that it can get the justice and recognition that it deserves.. 
 This book is exactly what I was looking for. So often we don't have the words for what we want to express to our Father in Heaven. Stormie gives us these words, with varying situations and circumstances, so we can just seek, ask, and knock as we praise our Father in Heaven. The prayers are to the point, in language we use daily and have scripture references to support each request. The book is small enough to fit in a purse or fit in a glove box in the car. I'm enjoying it immensely. The author is a true PRAYER WARRIOR 
 Cooking, which has certainly been around for a long time, has been treated more as an art than a science. The recipies and techniques that we follow are handed cown from parent to child, or since writing was invented from chef to student.   But do many of these procedures make sense. Why do we have such traditional ideas of cooking that seem almost cast in stone with little or no evidence that this is indeed the best way to do things.   In this book M. This states a principle, but carrying it further he researches where this principle originated, and then conducts carefully measured experiments to see if this is true. For instance in making beef stock, the rule says put the meat into cold water and increase the temperature gradually. What happens if you put the meat into boiling water? Or what is the difference in Cheeses that are made from milk from cows that had south facing fields when compared to cows on fields that faced a northern slope. What about if the cow was fed silage (wet grass stored in silow where it ferments)? And what's the best way to test whiskey?   That's the idea, here is the analysis of cooking taken to a scientific level. It's a fascinating book for one interested in more than just the mechanics of cooking. I was reminded of Russ Parson's book 'How to Read a French Fry. 
 I and my family are from Virginia.  This is just the way we are when we visit family in other states...we sleep on the floor, eat lots of food, everything!  I am going to purchase this book to send to my niece. I hope that she remembers when her family comes from Virginia to do all the things in the book.  When she misses us, she can read the story and think about us 
 The strength of this book lies in its total honesty and realistic look at life in the inner-city living life and doing ministry among the urban poor. Lupton doesn't shy away from the hard questions, but answers them boldly with the words of Jesus. He exhorts us to be radical in our servanthood of our neighbors, and to sacrifice ourselves for others. In other words, he just calls us to what Jesus calls us to. This book is very easy and quick to read, but the lessons learned in this book can be pondered and worked out in a real-life context over and over again. This is certainly one of the best books I have ever read that encourages you to take the Gospel seriously in the inner-city. It's worth far more than the time it will take you to read 
 The Attractor Factor gives you much more than just a simple formula for acheiving success in your life.  Whatever you want out of life, whether it is love, wealth or fame, it requires an effort on your part and a paradigm shift in your thoughts and beliefs.  Because so many people have negative beliefs (whether they realize it or not) they "attract" negative manifestations into their lives.  By changing your thoughts and beliefs, your actions - and the resulting manifestations - will follow.  I have personally read this book seven (7) times, and each time I gain a new insight into my life.  I highly recommend The Attractor Factor to everybody I meet.  Whether you are in business for yourself, or you work for somebody else, applying the principles in this book will change your life for the better.  Let me share with you just how this book has changed my life:  After reading this book I made some shifts in my own personal thinking.  My own personal experiences haven't been negative, but I knew I could always use some help improving my "attractor factor".  I have been working on writing a book for over 10 years and didn't know how to take it to the next level.  Then one evening, after I had read "The Attractor Factor", I met an elderly lady at a meeting who put me in touch with her son who worked for a major publisher.  I now have a publisher who is working with me to bring my book to market.  Not only that, but I have also begun work on two more books; one, a training manual and another one for an inspirational "self help" book.  I have personally spoken to the author, Dr. Joe Vitale, on the phone on one occasion and have been corresponding with his Executive Assistant.  I have also attended several teleconferences where Dr. Vitale was a keynote speaker.  The author is a phenomenal person and his books exude his great personality.  I have asked him to be my guest speaker at an upcoming event in November of 2006 and he has agreed to be my keynote speaker.  That was just one of my dreams and wishes: actually meeting the man who became the internationally acclaimed author of this book.  Get this book!  The Attractor Factor should be required reading in whatever endeavor you pursue!  Sincerely, Ernest O'Dell The 100 Grand A Month Club Blanco, TX - USA P.S. Yes, this book is definitely a "5 Star" rating.  This review comes "straight from the heart" and you should get your hands on this book ASAP 
 I really enjoyed this book.  The complexities of Miguel Chico and his family are so rich and deep.  The relationships between them were interesting and made the book an easy read.  The irony and sadness the family endured showed the true colors of the family.  They were not perfect, but they were real 
 A few years ago the author of this title wrote his How to Beat Your Dad at Chess, an original and popular book which taught checkmating patterns. In Chess Tactics for Kids the lessons are all about learning chess tactics which win material, for example winning a pawn or a piece. The format is very similar to the DAD book and equally effective.  To improve at chess, the best chess teachers will tell you to study a variety of chess books. If you are interested in the opening stages, and are confused by all the choices, go for a book like Understanding the Chess Openings by Collins. This gives a useful overview of all openings.   If you want to study middlegames try a move-by-move book or study a collection of games played by a great player. But if tactics is your thing, you can't go wrong with Grandmaster Chandler's two books.  As a pair, How to Beat Your Dad at Chess and Chess Tactics for Kids cover all the basic tactical themes a chess player is likely to encounter. The motifs are grouped by, well, motif, and the concept of pattern recognition is introduced in a way that is easily understood.  There are several hundred diagram examples per book, including tests and puzzle positions to solve.  The best thing of all is how often these themes, tricks and traps occur. I found that I had been getting numerous opportunities to win in my own games, only I just didn't realize it! Chess Tactics for Kids teaches how to spot the patterns where a tactic is likely to be lurking.  It is amazing how quickly winning combinations can be found, once you know the patterns.        
 The novel, Breaking Her Fall, by Stephen Goodwin, is an awesome book! I would personally recommend it to older teenagers. It is a very detailed book, for those who are visual people, and it holds a lot of emotions and mystery. Also in the book, the family goes through a lot of imaginable crisis which is handled with a lot of realism. I know that many people can relate to this book. I really enjoyed reading this novel, I give it a `two thumbs up' and I strongly recommend it to anyone! 
 Basic concepts are well-explained and the book introduces you nicely into the world of poke 
 Beautiful book, a must if you are to visit Bucharest. More than a travel book, this book is infused with photographs of everyday life, written with an insider's knowledge of where to go to experience the spirit of the city 
 Monty Roberts' inspiring, compassionate and wise book "The Man Who Listens to Horses" made me weep with sorrow and joy. He shows through his life and work that the gentle way is the better way in all relationships. He transformed the abuse and pain from his violent, horse trainer father into developing gentle communication methods. Using only body language and trust he can persuade a horse to accept a bridle, saddle and rider in thirty minutes. A New York reviewer summed up Monty Roberts' book best. He will first break, then mend your heart.   
 From the director of Tetsuo - The Iron Man and A Snake in June comes a deeply challenging psycho drama.   Hiroshi (Tadanobu Asano) is a medical student bothered by memory loss after a road accident that killed his girlfriend Ryoko (Tsukamoto Nami). Coming home to his mom and dad's with his mind a tabula rasa, he exists through the days like a zombie. Finding an old anatomy textbook ignites/sparks his memories of his life as a medical student. Hiroshi recalls his girlfriend and things arduously begin to come back to him. He decides to re-enter medical school and take it from there - this is where the story really begins.   When the body in his dissection class turns out to be Ryoko, Hiroshi begins to unravel the shared past, in a way uncovering the "vitals" and piecing together the story of her death, but really more her life. Hiroshi rapidly regains his memory thereafter and surrounds himself in the escape of vanished love. For all intents and purposes, the viewer is allowed to share in an experience that is both profound and moving.  Miguel Llor 
 Wonderful story, fantastic acting.  The amazing true story of a young man who yearned all his life for the acceptance of his alcoholic father.  He becomes one of the greatest swimmers in Australian history.  The human spirit is amazing.  
 I wasn't really feeling it that much but the reason why i gave it a five star is because i fell in love with the song "Gonna tell everybody." Nick Cannon did her wrong 
 Fernandez-Armesto's venture into environmental history further enhances his reputation as the leading scholar producing large-scale history.  Here he classifies civilizations according to the general type of environment in which they arose, flourished and---often---declined.  Environments and their civilizations include highlands (Zimbabwe, Inca, Aztec); small islands (Polynesia, Malta, Crete); deserts (Peru, Sahara, Gobi), among others.  He then analyzes their adaptations to these settings, as well as exploring other factors.  This is an ambitious if not wholly successful work, and an exceptionally thoughtful one.  Among other merits, his discussion of the thorny issue of defining a "civilization" is both sensible and relaxed, unlike some other, rather overwrought treatments (Spengler, Toynbee, Huntington).  Like all his work, "Civilizations" is studded with insightful comments and distinguished by sparkling literary style.  That said, there are a few flaws.  Some equally valid alternate typologies exist to categorize societies and cultures, and some of these civilizations were not fully distinct from others.  Despite his best efforts, this work does not fully escape the shadow of determinism.  This US edition is not well-supplied with the illustrations (the British edition has photos) maps, diagrams and statistical tables that are very helpful in dealing with environmental data.  Lastly, the author relies almost entirely on published primary and secondary sources, but this is really a necessity in creating history on such a huge canvas.  It's the only way to avoid the "Lord Acton Trap:" that famous Victorian historian sought to write the entire history of human liberty strictly from manuscript sources, and as a result he never completed a single book.  Write on, Dr. Felipe 
 I've not been much of a fan of Andrew Manze's period approach. His wiry sound often puts me off and confirms the suspicions many have about period performance technique.  I am pleased to say in this release -- while I still haven't fully come to grips with Manze's style and tone -- his playing is warm and vibrant in this CD of Mozart's three best violin concertos.  Manze is totally involved in this CD and plays with sweetness and charm most of thie time, using plenty of oomph in the "Turkish" section of the final concerto, to rank with the better period performers in this music.  What really establishes this CD as a hit, however, is the remarkable playing and recording of the English Concert, a period band that has been linked to Trevor Pinnock. Their playing is special throughout with woodwind and horn soloes that melt the heart.  Their strings are also wonderful, sweeping and broad where need be, and light and delicious in the more delectable sections. The recording is consistent with the playing -- full and broad with a strong bass line and great depth in the sound field.  I had read good reviews of this CD and was skeptical based on my past reservations about the soloist. I was able to set aside most of my reservations, although there is the occasional hint of ugly tone displayed now and again during these performances. Never is it enough to stop or delay enjoyment of the music and this CD must now become the top-ranked period performance of these three concertos, besting what was the best recording -- that by and the Augustin Dumay and the Salzburg Camerata from 1998 on DG.  I continue to believe Pinchas Zukerman's account with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra is the best solo playing of these concertos, but the completely inadequate playing and sound of the supporting band removes those CDs (it takes two CDs for these concertos instead of one) from the top rank.   People that still cling to the David Oistrakh school of Mozart may want to try Joshua Bell's recent reincarnated 4th and 5th concertos, re-released last year by London on a twofer with some other warhorse concertos. For everyone else, this CD will probably attain the top ranking until something better comes along 
 What a pleasant suprise to find this!  This is the real Grape doing what they do best.  My favorites include "It don't take much", "You can depend on me", "Telephone love", yeah I know they're all sung by Bob but hey, what a voice.  The guy sings like Otis Redding. A big suprise to me was how funky Pete's rhythm guitar playing is, and good vocals too.  Jerry Miller is STILL one of the premier and under-rated guitar players in rock and he does it all with one guitar.  Don drumming is great, check out "Depend on me" and the fat groove he provides for the band.  Is there a better soulful singing drummer ANYWHERE?  I have been a fan since seeing them first in 1966 and let me tell you they were killer then and they still are now.  They are the BEST SAN FRANCISCO BAND I ever saw, and I saw them all.  RIP Skippy. P.S.  forget about MK, he is a bitter old man.   
  An excellent book for those who wish to improve 'figures in transparent watercolor....One of my favorites....Jack, Ohi 
 If you weren't paying attention to the words, you'd think you were listening to a true Chant CD. The music is beautiful, but from the text, you know that they don't take themselves too seriously. It's a hoot! two hooves up 
 Wolf broke the mold when he wrote this well-received book. He lays out the traditional ways individuals think about their issues and challenges, yet he offers optimistic and realistic ways to overcome one's doubts, shortcomings, or anything else that is holding you back at becoming the person you want to be. I purchased this book years ago and I still refer to it for its wisdom, practical advice, and eternal wisdom. Well done Wolf.   Randall Ponder, Author, "Leadership Made Easy" 
 The first three chapters lay down the causes and characteristics of market failure in the finance context, give economic explation fot them, and describe the history of microfinance.  I found Chapters 4 and 5 ("Group Lenging" and "Beyond Group Lending" respectively) extremely useful for applied contract theorists.  The word "microcredit" refers manly to lending.  In Chapter 6 ("Savings and Insurance"), the authors introduce another concepts: savings and insurance.  In the following chapters to the end, they go on to various issues such as gender and goverment subsidy.  Overall, the book is an excellent survey of microfinace as it is.  Yet, it lacks a big picture, especially regarding the future of microfinance.  Whether the human society can keep microfinance on the sound truck will probably matter in the first order sense to how much human beings as a whole can prosper in the 21st century.  My own guess is that key to the  success will be a good combination of self-interest and sympathy to others, which is exactly the spirit of Adam Smith 
 Another good read from the pen of Tony Hillerman!! Very enjoyable 
 I found this to be a fascinating account of the war in the Pacific, and I was impressed with the fact that the author imparts a deep appreciation for America and the sacrifices our soldiers made but can still step back and look objectively at the mistakes on both sides.  Does examining our own faults release the other side from responsibility for their crimes, as some other reviewers seem to feel?  I don't believe so; I think it's healthy for us to examine our history so we don't make the same mistakes again.  It's too bad that some people lump any critique of our own actions into the "pop-revisionist history" category.    But back to the book... I picked this book up not knowing whether it would be dry and dull or a great read.  I was not disappointed.  It is a hard story to read because it does not shy away from the atrocities of war- especially those committed by the Japanese- but it is also a compelling, well-written story.  The author clearly recognizes the heroism of these young Americans who fought so courageously for our country.  There is a lot of background information, but I found it all engrossing.  Most of the WWII history I've been taught and have read over the years has centered around Hitler, Europe and D-day, so this was a fascinating introduction to the war in the Pacific.  I can understand that a WWII veteran might have different opinions from the author, but as the grandaughter of two WWII veterans who served in the Pacific theater, this book only reinforced my feelings of pride in the sacrifice and heroism of my grandfathers and those with whom they served.  I'd recommend this book 
 I will admit that I heaved a sigh of disappointment when I saw Marie Osmond step out of the carriage.  However, she quickly won me over and I loved every minute of this film after that.  This story is wonderfully touching and in the end, their gifts to one another are funny but really felt.  You KNOW that they are gifts from the heart.  This movie really is about love at Christmastime and the actors in this version couldn't have been better chosen.  They all do a great job and I would recommend this film to anyone!  I plan to watch it time and again 
 This book had me from the humorous opening paragraph. Easy read.  The dialogue between characters flowed well.  I am now a fan.  Recommend this book highly.  
 I had this book as a child and absolutely loved it.  I was in a used bookstore the other day and found an original copy just like the one I had as a child!  Now, as my husband and I start a family, I will have one wonderful classic to add to my child's collection 
 Without the help of former angst/punk-rocker Joe Jackson, many of my generation would never have heard of Louis Jordan. Jackson's JUMPIN' JIVE album was made long before the current swing revival and it exposed many  under fortysomethings to the incredible fun, unbridled joy and sheer pop  smarts of Jordan at a time when prog-rock was on the wane, disco was just  about dead and the new wave was where it was at. But, for far too many  years since CDs have been with us, there had been no satisfactory anthology  of his biggest, bestest, swingin'-est hits. For years I made do with THE  BEST OF LOUIS JORDAN on MCA U.K., a great but not fabulous collection that  missed many of the great cuts on this fab double retrospective. Now, MCA's  newest anthology, a double, does the man justice thanks to great sound, ALL  the key cuts and a decently packaged graphic/booklet treatment. One could  rightly make a claim that this is the true start of rock and roll. Jordan  was immensely popular during and right after WWII. And though he may have  hated rock and roll (and he made no bones about how he felt about it),  where would rock be without "Caldonia" or "Choo Choo  Ch'Boogie"? This is more than just a historical document, it's a blast  from the past that causes heads to nod, feet to shake, hands to get  clapped. It's the balls, y'all 
 It's the Whispers, need I say more. If you ever liked the Whispers, yyou will love this C 
 Ben Witherington makes a strong contribution to the field of scholarship on Galatians.  Witherington shows two main strengths in this commentary.  First, he makes a strong case for an early dating of Galatians, placing this polemical book solidly before the Jerusalem council.  Second, he  brings his rhetorical skill to the text, and creates a first-rate  rhetorical framework for the letter in a remarkably readable effort.       There is room to disagree with Witherington on his conclusions, especially  on his early dating of Galatians, and the amount of historicity he places  with Acts.  Yet, one appreciates the strength of his argument, and the flow  of his presentation 
 I have raised three puppies and my last one was 15 years ago so I needed an update.  This is the best book to have prior to getting that puppy and the only one you will need to raise that puppy. It gives great pointers what to look for when choosing your dog and you will not be disappointed. 
 Dr. Kupers articulates in clear detail the serious problems confronting persons within the prison system. With an unfailing eye, he depicts the ravages extolled on prisoners in the name of justice and... expediency. The  problems, most often, manifest in the form of mental health issues that  custodial staff are incapable of addressing. Dr. Kupers suggest effective  solutions for dealing with the mental health needs of the incarcerated and  the needs of society at large. A must read for anyone in Corrections or  Forensics 
 A must read! Captivating, informative and educational. Don't allow yourself to become an unwitting victim. Impower yourself with Frank's knowledge. 
 This is another typical Hillerman, with his signature plots and style.    I find books like HB one of the best way to understand the Southwest, canyonlands between Bluff, Blanding, Shiprock and Flagstaff. Its people, from rugged ranchers, to acculturated Navajos & Hopis and the 'traditionals'.  And the interesting and often exhilarating competitive cooperation between various law enforcement agencies, including Tribal Police, BIA agents, FBI, State Police, INS agents, Border Patrol etc.  before he died, Jim Chee's spiritual father, taught him one last lesson to become a hataalii singer. "When you heal people who are out of harmony, who see no beauty anywhere...  you tell them that the Power that made us made all this above us and around us and we are part of this Power and if we do as we are taught we can bring ourselves back into harmony. To cure them you must make them believe. You must believe so strongly that they feel it. "  Can't miss with this book. 
 This translation of _Taira_ Shinken's 1964 Japanese language book "Ryukyu Kobudo Taikan" has the benefit of having been translated by an Okinawan and Kobudo practitioner, Eihachi _Ota_, with Michael _Rovens_.  Known in some circles as the "Funakoshi of Kobudo", Taira was instrumental in preserving the traditional weapon arts of Okinawa and bringing them into the modern age.  Indeed, Funakoshi and Taira were colleagues, and Taira dedicated a page of tribute to Funakoshi in this book! (page 167)  Included in this affordable edition are all of the same photographs and illustrations from the original publication which show Taira demonstrating kata and technique.  Taira is also pictured with other persons of note, including _Fujita_ Seiko and _Higa_ Seiko (page iv).  For those history buffs out there, also depicted in photos from the original publication are the Board of Directors of the Ryukyu Kobudo Hozon Shinkokai of which Taira was the president.  Includes are photos of Higa Yuchuoku, young Motokatsu Inoue, Teruo Hayashi, Mabuni Kenei, and many others from diverse karate traditions. (pages 169-177)  The first 15 pages cover the introduction and history of Kobudo, followed by 7 sections on kobudo technique and 6 kata (forms).  The contents breaks down as follows:  - Introduction - Profile of Taira Shinken - History of Ryukyu Kobudo - Items of Kobudo - Other Weapons Part I: Bojutsu, Bo Makiwara, How to grip the Bo, Basic Movements with the Bo,  - Kata "Shushi no Kun" (Dai) Part II - Kata "Hamahiga no Sai"  Part III - Kata "Hamahiga no Tonfa" Part IV - Kata "Sueyoshi no Kun" (Bo) Part V - Basic Nunchaku Kata Part VI - Bojutsu "Kingo no Kata" Demonstration Part VII - "Kingo no Kata" (Bo) - Gichen Funakoshi - Ryukyu Kobudo Hozon Shinkokai Board of Directors - Ryukyu Kobudo Hozon Shinkokai Supporting Members  All of the kata are shown in complete photo sequences, with the exception of "Kingo no Kata", which is every bit as complete, but shown with a series of woodblock prints accompanied with descriptions.    While this is by no means a completely exhaustive "bible" of Kobudo, it is still in its age one of the best works out there. This is by far the best translation Masters Publications has released to date.  I can't imagine any serious student of Kobudo forgoing this.  A study and history, well-explained in one volume.    
 Thanks to the previous reviewer for pointing this out.  The review posted March 2005 applies to Vol. 10, and the review posted July 2005 obviously applies to Vol. 13.    As far as the one from 2002, it's anyone's guess.  Both 10 and 13 are terrific movies, but I will need to rewatch them to do a better review.  And I would like to do one large review of both since it will end up listed in both places.  Meanwhile, I have done reviews for Vols. 1 and 8 of this series, if you would like to know what I think about them.  --Irene Hamilton, big Zatoichi fan 
      Originally released on the wonderful SST label (check out the website), "Evol" was the first really definitive Sonic Youth album.    From the ultra disturbing woman on the cover (Lung Leg, whoever that is, apparently from some indie film) to the music itself, we embark on a sonic journey through the nether regions of our minds.     This is where nightmares dwell and resurface in the detuned guitars that howl, feedback, ring out and swirl about under and over the songs themselves.      "Tom Violence" is somewhat subtle, at least as the CD opens (I don't think the track listing is correct), with the guitar noize waiting until near tracks' end to take us deep into audio alienation.      A gruesome spoken word piece giving us details of a gory auto wreck, a piano playing a beautiful snippet and a storm of guitar feedback and dissonant tones that closes "Sean, Madonna and Me", or, alternately titled "Expressway To Yr Skull" give us a view of the dark side from a safe distance.    Album owners of the original release may recall that at the end of "Expressway To Yr Skull", which closed the album, unlike "Bubblegum" that closes the CD, there is no outgroove to allow the needle to return to its stand.    Thus, the drone continues on and on, sometimes nearly hypnotizing you before you realize what's going on.    Can't do this with a binary code.    A must have for SY fans 
 This is the directors cut of the film. When first released in 1970 Paramount had taken the film away from director Blake Edwards and--instead of a nice little comedy with music--they turned it into a Julie Andrews Roadshow Attraction. This was never the intent of Edwards or Andrews. That is why this version of the film is so much better than the original release. Edwards cut out alot of extraneous nonsense and musical numbers and put back the heart of the film.I believe if it had been released this way opriginally it could have been a hit like VICTOR/VICTORIA was a few years later.   Julie Andrews shines as the music hall entertainer with a secret life and Rock Hudson and she have some nice scenes together. Rock`s wooden acting doesn`t help the proceedings and probably it would have played better with James Garner but why carp. It`s a fun movie for Andrews fans and in this version it doesn`t overstay it`s welcome the way the roadshow version did 
 The single most arcane book I have ever encountered, and a delight to all scholars of the English language. The degree to which our hertiage is maritime is made clear in this precise examination of how the littoral of  the American east coast influenced the development of how we speak 
 Deftly edited by Nan Bauer-Maglin, Cut Loose: (Mostly) Older Women Talk About the End of (Mostly) Long-Term Relationships is an anthology of testimonies from women who experienced the end of a long-lasting relationship. Some felt abandoned, others confused, and yet all came to realize they were set free; sometimes the end of a long-term relationship spelled sexual, mental, or emotional liberation. Women in both heterosexual and same-sex relationships speak out, and the essays themselves are categorized into personal narratives, practical perspectives on the psychological, sociological, economic, sexual, and medical aspect of being left; and the shared experience of subgroups of women such as single women, widows, or abandoned daughters. A true-life glimpse into personal experience and the lasting lessons that can be drawn from it 
 I collect baking and cookie books and this is one of the best.  The recipes call for very basic ingredients, and are simple to make. Try the Homemade Ice Cream Bars, you will never want to eat another one of those cardboardy tasting ones again.  I also loved the Butterscotch cookies (I used skor candy bits); they were very good, buttery and chewy.....and again, simple to make and so homey and old-fashioned. I also like the way the writer gives a bit of history on each recipe and it's interesting to see which States certain cookies are popular in. When I want to make cookies for my family or a school event,  I refer to this great cookie book first. The kids love them and I know what's in them.  A bit expensive, but worth it.  Thank you Nancy Baggett for an overall great cookie book 
 Great response.  Great product.  Timely communication with the seller.  Super sale 
 Alfred Hitchcock, arguably the all time master of suspense, made a bold and controversial statement for his time with the movie Lifeboat.  It can be called a study of social classes, a comparison of what happens when people are forced together in a life and death situation.    After an Allied Freighter is hit by a torpedo launched from a German U boat, one lifeboat becomes the salvation for eight very different people.  A sophisticated and world traveling journalist, a rich industrialist, a tough as nails merchant marine, a military nurse, an engineer, an injured sailor, a mentally unstable woman, the radio operator and a steward.  As these people come aboard one by one, they begin piecing together what happened.  They are soon truly stunned when they pull the last survivor on board, one of the German sailors from the U boat, which was also sunk by the freighter's deck gun.  When the dialogue starts, things really begin to unravel.  They aren't sure if they can trust the German sailor.  Is he the Captain?  Or is he just a deck hand?  Does he know the correct course to Bermuda or is he leading them into the hands of a German supply ship?  The suspense doesn't end as the questions find answers.  As circumstances become more bleek and the tensions begin to rise, the fate of the group becomes more indeterminate.  A few of the performances stand out, particularly Tallulah Bankhead as the journalist and William Yetter as the German sailor.  The screen play, which is based on a play, contains dialogue between the characters that remains sharp and focused throughout.  I usually find the pace of older movies a little too slow and plodding.  It's a generational thing, I'm sure, having grown up on the faster-than-light age of modern movies and TV starting with Star Wars in 1977.  But Lifeboat (and most other films by Hitchcock) moves with great ambition, the story told only through dialogue and a sharp mix of character contrasts.  The affects are dated, but what needs to be focused on is the plot more than anything.  What Hitchcock does most brilliantly is make us feel confined to the boat with these people, as if we are trapped with them and involved on the decision making.  Many of the actions of the survivors can be considered controversial or against social norms but one thing is for certain; despite the age of this movie, relations to the characters can surely be relevant today 
 The book separates core values from the operating practices of companies. Ultimately, the core value system is the determinant of success. It is the driver of success. The author plots the profits of visionary companies as against non-visionaries. The visionaries make over 5 times the profits. The challenge is to preserve the core values and stimulate progress in the industry. The core values involve innovation, integrity, individualism, initiative, personal growth, quality, risk-taking ability and expanded service. These types of attributes will give a large  institution the speed and agility of a small company according to the authors.  The book is an excellent value for anyone navigating through a large organization or facility in search of a strategic plan or implementation  
 This book is for the beginner that wants to get into electronics and has heard that the Stamp is a pretty cool thing. The book starts out with an introduction to the Stamp and Electronics in general. From this, the user is given more detail on the Basic Stamp. The majority of the book is dedicated to the projects presented in the book and this is where I learned the most about the Stamp. The projects focus on interfacing to other devices and this is where the book really shines 
 I recently began the application process for summer internships and, although familiar with the material covered in I-banking interviews, was absolutely clueless as to how to approach the case interviews in consulting. I bought Case in Point, read it several days before my first interview, and practiced one or two cases with the career center on campus. The skills and approaches Cosentino offers are exactly what the top firms want to hear. Although I only applied to one consulting firm, I made it all the way to final rounds and several days ago received a job offer. Needless to say I'm elated and grateful for the help I got from this book. Highly recommended.  Word of caution though: no matter how well you do on the cases, all consulting firms place a premium on your interpersonal skills. Don't underestimate the importance of getting a good nights sleep, being relaxed, and just visibly having a good time while working through cases in the interview. Best of luck 
 I havn't read it yet, but I've seen my dvd of it (at least) 3 times already. Let alone, on tv a few times too. ;)    ~a Stephen King Constant Reade 
 Zwillinger is an incomparable genius at organizing data, information, theory.  See my review of his Handbook of Differential Equations, which is the best thing in its field and which the reader should also purchase  regardless of whether currently into differential equations.  The other  reviewers have done a gone job noting details of this book.  Here I would  like to answer why tables and formulas are needed in a day when hand  computers are everywhere.  The answer is that we have to learn to think in  terms of tables and formulas to keep at the top of our fields (for example,  how many of you know that general relativity is based on sets of tables  called tensors?).  Computers today are stil mostly not for thinking but for  doing long calculations which involve repetition rather than innovative  thinking.  Make your hobby tables, formulas, equations, inequalities, and  you might pass Life 101 
 Pretty much tells history of coffee.  Provides in depth information on how to buy Espresso blends (various characteristics).  Also explains the history of how Espresso was developed along with the machines that make it the joy it is.  The author has a subtle humor which makes the book fun to read while teaching you about Coffee 
 This Time the World by the late United States Navy Reserve COmmander George Lincoln Rockwell had been reprinted many times since its first publication where the pages were laid out on long tables and Rockwell's Stormtroopers lined up and picked up pages in sequence and gave the assembled unbound pages to their book binder in the basement of their old two-story house on Wilson Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia in 1959. There were pictures left out of each succeeding printing, the pictures were of former members who had fallen into disfavour for whatever reason, so by the time of the last printings on "Hate-Monger Hill," it is reasonable to surmise half the photographs were removed. Some people have collected all of the editions, serious collectors indeed! 
 All The Rage is another in an impressive series of Repairman Jack novels, this is an interesting series dealing with the "OTHERNESS" whwich is not for the fainthearted. If you have read previous Repairman JACK NOVELS THIS IS SURE NOT TO DISSAPOINT, WELL DONE 
 I would like to recommend this book to any  student in grades 3, 4, 5.  I thought it was funny, original, and clever.  Each chapter is about a student in the classroom at the end of the hall and each student has some problem that gets solved in the story.  One girl hates spelling and a boy never follows directions.  Their problems get solved in the funniest ways.  It's also easy to read, but not too easy.  I used to hate reading, but this book got me interested in reading some other funny books 
 While there were a few minor things I disagreed with, this is a great book for turning your mind to all the things that you need to begin worrying about as you fumble around in that new manager role.  I suspect this is the kind of book I will keep re-reading every so often to ensure that I'm on track 
 This book is the best cabling book on the market and totally user friendly.  The text is clearly stated for those who have limited experience with cabling and the illustrations expertly drawn.  This is a book for anyone who wants to learn how to cable and the best products to buy for your installation 
 Not one of my favorites, but it still is a good book.  We enjoy all of the Sandra Boynton books 
 Excellent view of the complete White House staff from people who have roamed the halls of perhaps the most famous building in Washington. 
 This is a general comment on Piper's books and ministry. I deeply appreciate the work of John Piper--especially his emphasis on missions and on living God-centered, Christ-exalting lives of worship. And I am Augustinian, so I love Piper's theology and am thrilled that he has become so popular. But I do want to provide a warning. Piper's main emphasis is (and you'll read this over and over again) "God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied (or delighted) in Him." This is a biblical and wonderful proposition that Piper became aware of through the writings of Jonathan Edwards. And to Edwards (who also explained how God's chief end is to glorify Himself), this was one small part of his theology.  But Piper has taken this idea, which he calls "Christian Hedonism," and built his whole life and ministry around it. The problem is that if you read enough Piper, you will begin to focus on the FEELING of being delighted in Christ, rather than on Christ Himself. And when your feelings don't match what you want them to be, you will become disheartened. (And let's face it, few of us have the emotional intensity of John Piper.) At that point, your feelings (of being delighted in God) become the object of your desires and, thus, an idol. Yes, they are feelings TOWARD God--but those feelings are NOT GOD. And when the focus of your life has become your emotions, it has deceptively become an idol.  I know Piper fights against this tendency. But I'm afraid he is often unsuccessful. The fact is, the Christian life is not going to be one of unending joy in God. Read the Psalms to see how often the psalmists cry out in agony and desperation and sadness to the Lord. Read Romans 7 to find out how tough and discouraging the Christian life can really be.  According to Piper, our happiness in God should be the driving motivation in our life. But when Christians are inevitably not overflowing with delight in God, then under Piper's framework, the only solution is to seek that feeling of joy rather than just do our duty. There are times when duty and obligation (which Piper hates) are the only motivations for the Christian to be obedient and live a life of faith. I agree wholeheartedly with Piper that delight in God is a much better motivation for the Christian than duty. But when that delight is not there, we still must be faithful and obedient, and we can't always wait on our feelings to drive us on toward the prize.  Read Piper's books. And enjoy his passionate and Christ-exalting preaching. But beware and repent when your emotions--rather than the Triune God Himself--become the focus of your life 
 my one year old has little problem sitting in the chairs and using the table with me and on his own.  the chairs are a little wobbly for him, but he is only one. it is easy to clean, looks nice in the living room, and baby really likes it 
 I have read hundreds of books on business as well as on women's issues. If I was to present only one to a graduating female or any other woman I know it would be this one. I appreciate the strong academic and research foundation of the book and the accessible writing. At the end of the day, the world will only undergo profound change if women themselves demand a fair deal 
 I remember reading & liking this back in 1992 when I was in 5th grade.  It still is one of my favorite books now.  It is about a bunch of Pushcart peddlers selling things on the street and they wage a war with the big truck drivers because in the beginning one of the truckers needed to make a delivery and couldn't wait a minute for the pushcart to finish his sale so he ran him over and it was actually photographed and put on the front page of the paper enraging both the truckers and pushcarters.  The pushcarters then began to shoot tacks into the tires of all trucks in the city causing great chaos, and a small "war" ensued.  That's all I'll tell you you'll have to see how it ends but a great book for younger children & it has some good oictures and character descriptions in it as well 
  This review refers to The Great Illustrated Classic Edition(listed for ages 9-12) of "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley   I had to surf the various editions of Frankenstein to find this one, which is wonderfully adapted for older kids by Malvina G. Vogel and illustrated by Pablo Marcus Studio. There were many editions to go through and if you are interested in this one make sure you are on the page with the ISBN of:0866119817 (Playmore Publishers June 1993). You can enter the number in the book search. The cover has a fiery orange background with Frankenstein running in a wooded area.Only available at this time from the outside merchants, you may want to check with them by e-mail, to make sure which edition they are selling. The customer reviews as well as the editorial reviews seemed to be all lumped together, the children's issues along with the adult editions.    Malvina Vogel has done a fabulous adaption for younger readers to be able to enjoy this very frightening but most captivating classic. It is still the story we all love of Victor Frankenstein, who loved science and life. When a life of a loved one is lost, he vows to discover a way that no one will ever have to face the grief that death brings about. He works and studies furiously, to the point of obsession, until finally his labors prove it can be done. Invent life out of various body parts from corpses. But his creation turns out to be monstrous. A giant creature that seeks revenge on Victor for creating the hideous and terrifying being he has become. The path of the monster is covered with dead bodies, those of the people closest to Victor. Victor now has a new mission in life, to hunt the creature down and destroy him before the monster unleashes his vengeance on any more innocents.The monster is portrayed with feelings of hating himself for what he has done, and there are times, you may even feel a twinge of pity for him. The entire story unfolds wonderfully, and in a way, children will get caught up in, as Victor, near death and after chasing the monster through the iciest and coldest regions known to man, reveals for the first time to an explorer, also obsessed and risking lives, how his creation came to be. T   The books has fairly large print, excellent and somewhat scary illustrations with captions, on every other page.At nearly 240 pages it is a quick read and one that kids will be turning the pages enthusiastically. The school journal editorial here, say the illustrations are in color, however, in this edition they are black and white drawings. There is also a 2 page bio on Mary Shelley at the opening. I think the age group recommended here is pretty close(9-12), although 9 may be a little too young, just from a reading comprehension standpoint(Of course it depends on the child), and 12 may be a little young for a cut-off. I think even older kids, and even the parents reading with the child, will enjoy this adaption.  A great gift book for your favorite reader...enjoy...Lauri 
 I have read the other testimonies and I can understand where some are coming from. This book is not magic. It's not meant to be the end-all to other cookbooks. But, in my opinion, it's an important book to have if you are a beginner and/or just don't know how to make certain things that are pretty basic. I'm not a huge seafood eater but I think it's important to be well-rounded in your knowledge of basically everything, and this book does it well. Even if you don't eat meat, dairy, etc. this is the chance for you to expand your cooking abilities and substitute other stuff.  Which brings me to my concluding thought: This is just meant to help you start dinner. Sure, add seasoning, add sugar or salt or heck, even add a piece of fruit or two. It's a starting point that gives you the freedom to expand on. Also, the best part (to me) is that all the nutritional information is at the bottom, so you know what you are eating.   All in all, cookbooks can be pretty lame. This one is fun, easy and has pictures for many of the recipes! What more do you want? Alice from the Brady Bunch 
 Have you ever seen Oasis live recently? It's surprising just how great of a set list they play and yet how many songs you wanted to hear that weren't played.  I think Oasis is one of those bands that has a massive underrated catalogue. There is not a poor song on this compilation. Unless you're a big fan, they're are many you haven't heard(Half the world away, talk tonight.) The essentials are there(Wonderwall, slide away, Don't look back in anger, live forever). But so many great songs were ommitted. (D'you know what I mean?, Cast no shadow, Stop cryin yer heart out,Don't go away and a few more I could list) It's one of those albums where you enjoy it but know how good it could be. This album rocks but you can't help but reflect on what else you wanted on there. I want to see a vol. 2 
 Reading this book helped me to understand why my former fiancee decided to 86 me. Due to evolutionary pressures, the whore was looking for a more suitable mate. Now that I finally know what most women want, I can change how I live and behave in order to score more chicks. And you know what? It's working! Thank you, Dr. Buss 
 I received a honey dispenser as a wedding gift a few years ago, when Williams Sonoma carried them (slightly different model). My mom, who taught me the fine art of making a proper cup of tea, fell in love with the item so I decided to find one for her. WS no longer carries them but I found this was a good substitute. The trick to getting it to dispense well is to put a little bit of hot water in the stand about three minutes before you use it 
 I have read several reviews and decided the Spyder2Pro would be a good monitor color calibrator for me.   I have a Samsung 970P monitor with all adjustments via software.   The calibration process is very simple and all you have to do is follow the menu of questions during the calibration process. I like the Spyder2Pro and would recommend it highly. 
 As a proud former member of the United States Secret Service, I believe that this product is worth your time and money...and I also feel it is my perogative to inform everyone here that, while Vince Palamara is to be commended for his notable research acumen and getting many of my colleagues-and myself- to speak to him, he has also done so at the expense of many of their feelings, beliefs, and trust. In short, Vince Palamara believes the means justifies the ends. So, imagine my horror when I turn on the television a few years back and I SEE the young researcher who promised myself and many others that he was not a journalist, stating facts, theories, and innuendo as the gospel truth. Emory Roberts, for one, cannot defend himself. I will concede that I have no good explanation for what transpires on the film Palamara shows-but does that have to lead to conspiratorial conclusions? Does it, Vince? From what I gather, many members of the AFAUSSS, myself included, are quite upset with him, as well they should be.  Can we let sleeping dogs lie? Lee Harvy Oswald killed President John Kennedy, acting alone. Yes, my colleagues did not do their jobs as effectively as they could have or probably should have-but will that bring back the man? No. What useful purpose is served by defaming Kennedy's memory and all the still-living former agents with calling into question the very painful loss of said man, as well as their job performance.  Put that in your pipe and smoke it. T.R., proud alumni/ past member of the folowing organizations: MSU Army 1957-1959 USSS 1961-198 
 North To Freedom is a wonderful book.  It tells about a twelve year old boy, David, and his escape from a concentration camp where he has been since before he can remember.  He is on a dangerous journey, and he can trust nobody.  He meets many people, learns new words, discovers how to smile, and finds his mother.  On the way he makes good friends with Maria, and young girl whom he saved from a fire, he calls her "the little girl who looks so like a flower".  David also makes friends with the dog, King.  David is not used to dogs because he only knew of the mean one's in the concentration camp, but King is different, kind and gentle, and wants to protect David.  King is greatly involved in the end of the story, read the book to find out more.  This book is also good for class liturature.  My class has used it in sixth grade, but I would suggest it in fourth grade because now it was really easy to read.  This is a very touching story about a boy struggling for life, proving his strength, making friends, and proving his is smart and clever in ways unimaginable.  I suggest it for anyone, even if it is a quick read 
 I love hockey and I loved hockey before I saw this movie. this movie did help bring a lot of people my age into hockey to abd a lot of them didn't stay on the Mighty Ducks are a bunch of great kids who will keep kids and adults laughing and even though a lot of the on ice action is corny it is still cool to watc 
 I have used this book to assist my church ministry in divorce care and in my own walk down the road. It is sound from a biblical perspective and filled with common sense solutions. If you find yourself lost, wandering in the wilderness, grab thus survival guide.It works 
 Every story in this book is worth reading. Age doesn't matter- if you really love books, you'll really love this collection. The core of wonder, imagination, adventure, romance, it's all here in this collection. 
 Don't make up your mind about Jaci until you've heard this CD.  Even if the music doesn't appeal to you, the well-delivered lyrics are amazing; very sincere and full of truth.  The melodies are strong, each song can stand by itself, and before long you'll find yourself singing along.  Personally I'd buy it just for the beautiful, "You."  I don't own many popular Christian CD's, but whenever I feel I'm faltering in my walk with God this CD never fails to uplift and encourage me.  
 This is the second book in the series, _A Princess of Mars_ being the first. I like this one better. Again, John Carter astral-travels to Mars, and instantly finds himself in a battle with the plant men, alongside his old friend Tars Tarkas. A new  resourceful female character, is introduced. Surprisingly, Burroughs does a hatchet-job on fanatical mass religion and corrupt priests, which is something I didn't expect in an action-adventure novel [...]. Burroughs is generally an adequate, workman-like writer, but, boy, could he tell a story! This book is just one action-packed adventure after another. And even though Burroughs wrote most of his Mars novels right around 1912, they still hold up today 
 This book is technical and a bit dated, but its content and clarity is easy to follow. Unless you have a few years of formal grammar it can be difficult because the terminology and rhetoric may require some explaining by an instructor. It is knit picky with the details in Arabic so if you can use the language well but feel like you lack a strong grammar base then this book is perfect for you 
 I decided to read Mastering the Requirements Process (2nd Edition) because, while I am an experienced software developer/consultant, I have always struggled with writing requirements. It's not the writing itself that I find difficult it's the feeling that I'm wasting my time. You see, while I know that well documented requirements are critically important in any project, I often feel like I'm somehow missing the point when I sit down and struggle through a requirements document. I don't mind working hard and I don't mind wasting time but I can't bear the though of working hard to waste time! So, I was excited to read "Requirements are not meant to place an extra burden on your project. Instead, they are there to make your project run more smoothly" in chapter one. Yes! Exactly!   In this book I found a very thorough and well-presented requirements process. Robertson and Robertson clearly speak from years of experience.   The contents are as follows:  Chapter 1 What Are Requirements?  Chapter 2 The Requirements  Chapter 3 Project Blastoff  Chapter 4 Event-Driven Use Cases  Chapter 5 Trawling for Requirements  Chapter 6 Scenarios and Requirements  Chapter 7 Functional Requirements  Chapter 8 Nonfunctional Requirements  Chapter 9 Fit Criteria  Chapter 10 Writing the Requirements  Chapter 11 The Quality Gateway  Chapter 12 Prototyping the Requirements  Chapter 13 Reusing Requirements  Chapter 14 Reviewing the Specification  Chapter 15 Whither Requirements?   You could teach a full college course from this text. Rather than use the full Volere process, I plan to merge pieces of it into my company's existing methodology. For me, I was happy just to walk away with some new methods to 1) make my requirements useful and 2) ensure my requirements are complete.   [...]   Highly recommended. 
 A continuation of the delightful stories about the three friends, their joys and trials and everyday living.  I really feel as if I know these ladies and I miss them each time I finish another tale about them 
 I bought this DVD and IT WAS THE BEST! The only thing I don't like is they are playing for a job 
 After several years of using, and ultimately destroying, a variety of cheap ~$50 "leather executive chairs", I got tired of it and decided to do some serious shopping. I went to Office Depot's web site and staring me right in the face on their main page was a sale ad for this chair. Only $99 instead of the ususal $140, it said. $100 was about what I wanted to spend, and being a large indivdual, I thought it was serendipity. So I go to my local store the next day and they also have it marked for $99. I take a seat in their display model and instantly fall in love. It feels huge compared to my previous chair, a model by the same manufacturer, but cheaper and not as sturdy. I take the tag to the front to checkout, and decided to read the store's sale ad while I wait for a stocker to get my chair down from the back with a fork lift. I look in the ad just to see if my new chair is in it, but it's not. I was pleased to discover a note saying that I would recieve a $20 gift card with my $99 or up chair purcahse. Excellent, I though, but it got even better when the checker simply deducted the $20 from the purcahse price instead of giving me a gift card. So in short I was able to score this completely excellent and most comfortable chair for only $80!!! It's incredible, seriously. And the lumbar support is excellent. I can sit in this chair for hours at a time and my back doesn't hurt at all. I highly recommend this chair if you are a bit on the larger side like myself and find other desk chairs inadequate for your needs 
 This new Audioslave album Rocks!!  Its far way better than their last one Out Of Exile.  Revelations Rocks Rocks!! 
 The book explains why do we need a brand, what can it do and how to maintain it. If you are looking for deep branding tactics then you are in the wrong place 
 If you're already asking yourself, `Do I really need another Blondie compilation?' then I must tell you that the answer is most definitely "Yes!" This is the most comprehensive collection the band has delivered in their thirty-year history. No, it's not a box set of rarities, it's a two-disc set with one disc of "sound" that contains their greatest hits of the past three decades and one DVD disc of "vision" that provides solid proof of why this amazing New York-based band, fronted by Debbie Harry, was recently inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame. Of course, the obvious hits are here, beginning with the song that put them on the worldwide map - the #1 smash "Heart Of Glass." Other #1 smash records that follow are the Deborah Harry/Giorgio Moroder penned "Call Me," the reggae-tinged "The Tide Is High" and "Rapture," which made them the first new wave turned mainstream band to have a #1 rap song, not to mention by a female lead. The widely exposed "One Way Or Another" is here along with the 1979 classic "Dreaming" and the 1999 rocker "Maria." In between those obvious inclusions are tracks that have become Blondie staples ranging from their 1976 debut single "Rip Her To Shreds," through 2003's "Good Boys" with a new mix added in 2005. Other masterpieces include "Atomic," which topped the charts in the UK in 1979, "Sunday Girl," a new remix of "In The Flesh," "Denis," "Picture This," "Fade Away And Radiate," "Hanging On The Telephone," "Union City Blue," "Island Of Lost Souls" "End To End" and a new single that's burning up the clubs as I write this, "Rapture Riders," billed as Blondie VS. The Doors, with the classic 1981 track mixed with the phenomenal Doors' 1971 epic "Riders On The Storm." Everything old is brand new again and sounding fresher than ever. The DVD of their performance videos include most of what's on the CD with the inclusion of "Detroit 442," and a personal favorite "The Hardest Part." The Bonus DVD track is a UK version of the Blondie VS. The Doors' "Rapture Riders." It's inevitable that Blondie will one day deliver a box set of hits and rarities in one package, but until they do, pick up this "Sound & Vision" set, and hear and see why Blondie was, and is, one of the most important rock and roll bands of all-time.  
 It is in a way too bad that this CD is usually just found at the Yoga or "New Age" section of your music store. While Shiva Rea is a great Yoga teacher and her taste in Music is equally up there, this music will inspire many others as well. Great as lounge music, to dance to and a must for those who enjoy their yoga at 4:20 
 If your a woman, even if you aren't in the business world, this is a book you need to read.  It is unbelievably fasinating....and depressing because of how true it is.  Women just weren't raised to see the things they are missing to get not just by, but get what they deserve, in the world and this book really hits home and give you great ways to see what you can do about it.  It's just a new perspective and an increbile read and will definitly change your life, and your bank account, for the better.  It'll change the way you live and see your everyday life.  From the way you raise your kids to the way to deciding where to go on vacation.  Definitly a book that needs to be read, by men and read, if you want to make a difference for the women of the future 
 Maureen O'Hara is teamed with a very inferior part in "The Wings of Eagles," a moving tribute based on a true story...  As Wayne's neglected, temperamental wife, she finds her dedicated husband frequently spending most of his time and energy on improving the status of Navy aviation...  On the night, Wayne is appointed skipper of a fighter squadron, he falls down a flight of stairs and suffers back injuries that render him a cripple...  Determined to fight his way back to some kind of independence, he persuades his wife to leave him and live her own life with their two daughters...  Nursed back to health by his sidekick (Dan Dailey--largely instrumental in motivating him in physical rehabilitation) he begins a new civilian career as a successful Hollywood writer...  Just when Wayne and Maureen, now a successful businesswoman, plan a reconciliation, news is broadcast of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor...  Maureen is last seen having another test of Irish temper as she heaves her half-packed suitcase across the room, frustrated that she again has lost her husband to the Navy...  Despite his handicap, Wayne is sent to the Pacific theater of war to supervise his revolutionary jeep-carrier tactical system...  The film is filled with humor: Wayne's plane landing in the swimming pool strike in the middle of the admiral's out-door tea party; the clubroom fight and cake throwing; the assorted cast members falling into the pool... It is also filled with deep drama and heartbreaking tragedy: the tender kiss of a wife deeply in love on the head of a man in pain; Wayne learning to walk again; the shipmates on deck in full military ceremony to say goodbye to a decorated flying ace...   Ford gives a special warmth to a friend, considered a national hero...   
 This was a strange book. But, the moment that I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.  I found this book to be humorous and a very quick read.  In a nutshell:  Stephanie's marriage of thirteen years is ended by her husband. She finds another love, Peter,  and strange things happen.  Without giving away the plot, I wondered thoughtout this book if she has a disorder, is delusional, if Peter has a twin, if he has a disorder or if he is delusional......it kept me guessing.  The end was not what I had expected and that was part of the fun of the book.  If you are looking for a serious read, an emotional read, a true love story....then save your time and skip this book.  Once again, I'm glad that I did not look at the ratings first or I would not have read this book.  I would imagine that others gave it only one star or slightly more because they were looking for something other than what this book offered. But, if you're looking for a fun, quick, quite different, keep-you-guessing book, I'd recommend this book.  I didn't give the book 5 stars because, although the situations are often quite humorous, there are times when I had had enough of Paul.  
 for those who beome evil. I particularly enjoyed the evolutionary psychology and group dynamic approaches.  
 This has long been a favorite and now I have it on DVD. This movie has quality throughout.  First Class movie 
 For lovers of Russian music, this CD of the complete Alexander Nevsky as written for the film is a must. The recording by RCA is of demonstration quality and the performance is first rate. Follow this with the video  release of the film with this performance in the soundtrack, as was  originally done 
 After trying many brands of BP cuff, this is the first one that was truly accurate. I took it into my doctor's office to check it against the office readings, and they were right on! Unkike others that had been up to 30 points off! There is a great memory on it too---you can keep records of a month or more! Easy to use and set-up can be for either right or left wrist. Buy this one and don't bother looking further. You won't be disappointed 
 Clausewitz en su obra Sobre la guerra da las pistas del carácter puro de la guerra étnica al hacer la diferencia entre guerra absoluta y guerra real.  Las características de la guerra instrumental moderna, propia de los Estados, son: 1) instrumentalidad, 2) cálculo y 3) representación. En contraposición a la guerra pura que se ha hecho presente, me parece, en la prehistoria, en las Cruzadas y en las guerras étnicas contemporáneas, las guerras modernas fueron mediadas.:  "Si las naciones civilizadas no matan a sus prisioneros ni devastan ciudades y países, es debido a que la inteligencia representa un mayor papel en sus métodos de guerra y les ha enseñado medios más eficaces de emplear la fuerza que la cruda expresión del instinto." [vii]   Primera regla de la guerra política:  Considere la guerra como un instrumento político.  Clausewitz considera que la instrumentalidad de la guerra moderna es la expresión de que el ser humano ha llegado a una racionalidad en el arte militar.   Así, el motivo para Clausewitz de la guerra no son los sentimientos hostiles, sino más racionalmente, las intenciones hostiles, porque los sentimientos no encuentran ninguna expresión en la esfera racional del Estado..  Los sentimientos son la propia cosa de la sociedad civil y la vida privada.   Esta racionalidad se expresa en la famosa frase de que "La guerra es simplemente la continuación de la política por otros medios".  "Simplemente" expresa aquí que la guerra debe ser tan fría como un asunto de Estado.  Porque la política se entiende como todo aquello que concierne a la esfera del Estado. Es más, la intervención de emociones y sentimientos en la guerra es perniciosa para el cálculo del apropiado uso de la fuerza que está en directa relación con la magnitud del objetivo político:  "El objetivo político -el motivo original de la guerra- determinará pues el objetivo militar a alcanzar y la cantidad de esfuerzo que requiere."[viii].   Otra característica profundamente moderna es que Clausewitz concibe la guerra como una lucha entre dos estados.  La guerra en su fase racional, mediada por el entendimiento, es la guerra política:  "Un plan de guerra es el resultado directo de las condiciones políticas de dos Estados en lucha, así como de sus relaciones con terceras potencias."  La guerra es política, no es civil.  No es una guerra entre pueblos, sino entre dos Estados.  Así, el derecho entra en la guerra, la vuelve guerra real en el sentido especial dado por Clausewitz de una guerra racionalizada por el Estado.   Segunda regla:  Calcule la guerra como calcula una ecuación. Para Clausewitz, la guerra absoluta es un ideal de violencia pura que es imposible ser manifestado en un Estado.  La verdadera guerra es la violencia absoluta, pero esta es una ficción en la modernidad porque el ejército racionaliza las fuerzas.  Todas las actividades militares están influenciadas por el odio y la agresividad, ya que el ejército forma parte del pueblo, está compuesto por individuos que tienen sus propios sentimientos.   Las emociones puras y brutas que dan energías para toda acción eficiente yacen en la sociedad.  El Estado tiene el fin político de abstraer esas energías, administrarlas, sin sucumbir a su poder irracional.   Tercera regla: Distánciese de la guerra, piénsela en términos de conceptos..  El Estado como representación y objetivo de la actividad política moderna transforma la guerra también en representación.   La estrategia es la actividad propia de la guerra como representación.  La violencia de la guerra debe expresar, representar el fin político, no lo sustituye.  Corresponde al elemento abstracto del Estado.  Es el fin político el que se persigue.  Por eso, en Clausewitz hay pocas referencias a los elementos psicológicos y culturales de la guerra.   Desde Hobbes y Maquiavelo tenemos presente la mediación política de la guerra.  El Estado la media políticamente y calcula sus fuerzas.  Por eso la guerra es política, no es guerra pura, porque responde a un objetivo político que en la modernidad, dicho fin se circunscribe al Estado.   De esta manera, la guerra, por su subordinación a la política, responde al reino de los fines porque si no respondiese sería mediación absoluta.  El medio de la violencia sería su propio fin:  "Cuando comunidades enteras hacen la guerra, la razón siempre reside en alguna situación política y la ocasión siempre se debe a algún fin político.  La guerra, por tanto, es un acto político.  Si fuera una manifestación completa, pura, absoluta, de violencia (como lo exigiría el concepto puro), la guerra por sí misma usurparía el lugar de la política en el momento en que la guerra la hubiese producido, quitaría su puesto a la política y gobernaría a través de las leyes que le son propias." [ix].    
 When you read any of Amy Tan's books it makes you feel like you are a part of the story.  This book was a great read because it evokes emotions of excitement and sadness for the main character all at once 
 I first saw this exhibit at the CCP at the University of Arizona, when I was 18 years old. Since then, I have not been able to erase Greenfield's images from my mind. Not only are her photographs beautiful and powerful, but the testimonials that go with each photo are heartbreaking. After I saw the exhibit, I had to have the book... but I didn't end up buying it until years later. I was happy to find that the book has expanded content--more pictures, longer testimonials, an introduction by JJ Brumburg (excellent!) and an essay written by Lauren Greenfield herself. I highly, highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the psychology and sexuality of America's female population 
 I love this album pop it in maybe 1 time every week, all you really need to know is You Shouldn't Do That, it has to be my faviret song of all time 
 Mark Phillips' The Wizard Of Oz Vocabulary Builder is a unique vocabulary building guide, which teaches readers 1850 words through reading. The classic text of the memorable fable "The Wizard of Oz" is filled with literate terms, which are presented in bold with their express definitions at the bottom of each page. A recommended and unforgettable skill-improvement tool, The Wizard Of Oz Vocabulary Builder is especially recommended for the fans of Frank Baum (creator of the Oz books) and would prove a useful tool for building an impressive vocabulary for aspiring and professional writers.. 
 The opening line of "Howlin' Mercy" is "I taught the hellhound to sit, cheatin' Satan playin' cards."  Not many singers could sell that line, but John Campbell, with his gravelly baritone, makes you believe it.  This is blues with bite, the sound of the hard-living but tender-hearted bad-ass keeping on the move and looking for redemption.  Think of him as the blues soulmate of Johnny Cash, even though Campbell, who died of a heart attack at age 45 after recording only 3 albums, never got the chance to achieve the status of a legend.  Whether he would have is anybody's guess, but the seeds are here.  Some of the songs are traditional blues, but most have a little musical twist -- a touch of rockabilly, a little swamp voodoo, a bit of rock.  This is an album that just gets better on repeated listening 
 I can't think of any other TV series quite like Due South but, nevertheless, it was one of my favorites, and still is. Due South presents the adventures of a very sharp, good-looking, by-the-book Canadian Mountie (and his multi-talented but strong-willed dog) and a street-wise Chicago detective. How this improbable pair (or trio, since the dog is an invaluable member of the team) got together was developed in the pilot, but it really doesn't matter if you missed it as long as you're willing to take this special series on its own unique terms. The various episodes poke good-natured fun at both Canadian and American foibles while presenting well-written entertaining plots. Unfortunately, because it was transferred from one time slot to another and cancelled and revived, Due South was never given a fair chance to develop the audience it deserved. But for those of us who chased it around and saw it as often as we could, it was one of the best TV series ever. If you have a taste for things that are both unigue and well done please get this DVD set, even if you missed the series when it was broadcast  
 The idea that stages of life are "socially constructed" comes from two sources, Philippe Aries, Centuries of Childhood, and Margaret Morganroth Gullette's recent pathbreaking "deconstruction" of middle age: Declining to Decline. --Sandra Lee Bartky, Mother Tim 
 I just finished this book and OMG, I LOVED it. What great stories. I loved reading about Francois and Sarah, their story is so heartwarming and inspiring. Like Charlie said while reading the journals, they almost became real to me. I HIGHLY recommend this book to all 
 This is a great book for food ideas. If the 4 weight watchers books I own, this one I use the most. I find the food selections in here best meet what I want to eat. Often friends join me for dinner (2-3 times a week) and they always comment they can't believe I'm on a diet.  Given that information, if you're fighting the battle of the bulge and your family's eating habits are not helping, this might be a good book for you to use.   One warning I would give about this book is that each of the meals do require some prep time. More then I was originally expecting. So this is not the "fastest" book in the group I purchased. But the trade off is the meals (when you double the amount) make for great lunches the following day or two. So in the end, I`ve expanded my skills in the kitchen, I've made a better tasting meal for friends and myself, and I've lost weight doing it 
 This is a very interesting book and it takes you through Joe's entire life up to and past his Suzy Kolber interview.  Few sports biographies do that.  Like Paul Hornung Joe serves as an alter ego for guys who wish they could have had Joe's life in their younger days.  I wish that there would have been more pictures of Joe's serious girl friends (there were several), as only Susie Storm & his wife Deborah are pictured in the book.  It would have been nice if they were some pictures of where Joe had lived.  You always wonder how playboys will adapt to the married life, as they always get married.  Paul & Joe last longer than most playboys.  Joe said that he only wanted to get married once, and wanted to get his running around out of his system before he settled down.  Although his drinking was a problem, he proved to be an otherwise excellent husband and outstanding father.  His drinking wasn't what caused his divorce.  Unfortunately in Deborah Joe married someone who wanted her own life and wanted to have some success in life.  When you marry at 21, you haven't had that opportunity and that was a problem.  Joe was so smitten with her that he couldn't see that in her personality before they were married.  In retrospect it may have been better if Deborah never married or married much later in life after she had achieved some success in her chosen field.  She also was in astrology.  Deborah was probably too dominating and also wanted to remake or shape Joe's life and that's never good.  That didn't seem to bother Joe and wasn't the cause of the divorce either, although it does give you some insight to Deborah's personality.  Another interesting side note about Deborah's family is that her brother died or came up missing while he was suspected to be on a drug run.  As the author pointed out Joe lived off his past but didn't want to live in his past.  Joe was like Joe Dimaggio in that respect.  Joe did very well financially in his post playing career.  
 What a delightful spell Eileen Spinelli weaves with this soothing, colorful book that was probably written for her grandchildren. It's the perfect goodnight read, as it gently reminds children that they are loved. When they are sad, they'll be held. When they're cold, they'll be warmed. When they're sick, they'll be babied. When they're afraid, they'll be supported. Best of all, when they're lost, they'll be searched for like rare treasure. "I will wear out my shoes and a dozen little rays of hope," writes Spinell, "but...I WILL find you! 
 This book does a very good job in reminding you the basic principles of the subjects tackled in the FE exam. The problems are more difficult than the actual morning exam problems, so if you study, you are well prepared for the morning session and relatively ready for the afternoon one. It is also organized in small chapters so you can study selectively if you can't study everything 
 Simply put, this book is excellent.  After reading the previous book, Bird of Prey, I had a good background knowledge of some of the characters and the world in which it is set.  The characters are brilliant, so are the plots, the adventures, the intrigue, the love triangles.... the list goes on and on.  If ever a book deserved 5 stars, this is the one 
 I love this movie. It was a Valentine's Day present for my fiancee. He loved it, too 
 I love this game!!  My son has been playing it for 2 years now.  He's 4.5 yrs old right now.  It's so easy to learn and great fun for up to 6 people!!  We make it a little more challenging by taking two colored snails each and trying to remember which are ours when the colors are rolled.  For our family of 3, that makes it lots of fun!  I advise everyone to buy this game if there are young children in your house.  You will NOT be disappointed 
 I didn't care for this album as much as the first one I bought, at first.  After I listened to it the second time, I found that I really liked it.  Anthony has stuck to his storytelling style and I like it a lot.  My favorite songs on here are "Pass Me Over" and "Southern Stuff".  I would definitely recommend this album to people who like southern style music 
 I love the southwest having grown up in Salt Lake City, California, and visiting my grandparents in Mesa, Arizona. Hillerman has created his own unique genre...because there is no one who deals with Native americans and their own problems. This book especially was good because a few years ago they had many young people die from the Hantavirus (Hillerman adds the bubonic plague...but the Hantavirus is the main concern down there. With too much water, the pinion trees produce too muchand encourages the population growth of mice and rats who live under the homes of the Native Americans. When their fecal matter dries out, it aerosolizes and exposes the lungs to the virus in the fecal matter. the Center for Disease control had their hands full with that one.  Leaphorn and Chee are two diverse characters...each with their own flaws. Trying to be a cop down in that area must be very stressfull since they have to patrol large distances with huge problems, including being careful of the many diverse tribes with differnt religious beliefs and the need to honor those beliefs.  Hillerman knows the four corners area (Utah, arizona, colorado, and New Mexico) well. This particular story had to do with illegal poaching of eagles in that area, as well as people dying from exposure to a resistant strain of plague virusl. These guys are expected to be and do impossible things including deal with bodies that may have infectious disease in them and trying to get tribal permission to do autopsies, since most of the Navaho and Arapahos and Utes do not believe in desecrating the body of the deceased.  Interesting topic and a good read. karen Sadle 
 Man, I just love King George! I really couldn't tell you how many times I could read and re-read his Song of Fire and Ice series. This is a great filler while you are painfully waiting for the Feast.  The artwork is so well down in this "extended comic book."  Characters are introduced that are prequels to the future series. The names wIll definitely ring a bell, if you are familiar to the series. This was just a well done short story, full of sacrifice, back-stabbing, characters that are more than they appear.  Basically, everything you would expect from Mr. Martin, just in condensed form.  A MUST READ FOR MARTIN FANS 
 It has long been lamented that the Classics are declining. Where is education headed, if the university system is failing?--the pump has no water. Ask next, how this is connected to the failing public school system. It isn't just a matter of losing the classics, it's about losing the integrity of higher education itself. If the university is compromised, then so are the people who are educated there, who then in turn try to educate the lower levels in K-12--look where we are. We need to ask not just who killed Homer, but why we keep stabbing him over and over again 
 This movie is when the world was truly introduced to Jim Carrey in all his glory. He redefined physical comedy and stretched what a person could do with their body to new levels.   What Jim Carrey accomplishes in this movie is amazing. Ace Ventura is an entirely over-the-top and crazy character, but at times he still manages to be a real person with real emotions. Parts of this are like a portal into the future where you can see the deep well of emotion Jim Carrey has stored up for his brilliant performance in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  I really think this is one of those movies that 40 years from now will be a classic. It's brilliant. And you'll be laughing the entire time. If you haven't seen it yet, then that's what's been missing from your life for the past ten years 
 As a fan of Jane Austen, I am often curious about authors who use her characters as spin-offs for their writings.  "Jane Fairfax", by Joan Aiken, is a commendable look into the life of the little-known character from Jane Austen's "Emma".  Austen devotes little time to Jane Fairfax, the young woman destined to be a governess who forms a secret engagement to Frank Churchill; but Joan Aiken takes readers into the background of this fictional character, from youth to marriage, with generally pleasant but uneven storytelling.  In "Jane Fairfax" we are introduced to a young Jane of about six years old.  Destined to befriend the rich Emma Woodhouse, Jane dreams of a close relationship, but these are dashed by Emma's snobbish and superior attitude.  Jane is taken to live with the Campbells, friends of her deceased father, and is brought up as their second daughter, enjoying a sisterly relationship with Rachel Campbell.  It is through the Campbells that she first encounters Frank Churchill and agrees to a secret engagement before she makes her return to Highbury; this proves difficult for Jane who is now unaccustomed to the ways of Highbury, how every word and action are watched and nothing remains secret for long.  Joan Aiken doesn't quite deliver on the premise of "Jane Fairfax".  While she does an admirable job of fleshing out Jane's early life and her inner thoughts, the pace is uneven.  Lengthy amounts of narrative are devoted to frivilous stories while her attachment with Frank and the denouement of the book happen at a lightning speed.  She spends a good section of the book on Jane's childhood, but quickly passes over five years in two paragraphs.  There even seemed to be a four page spell when Mr. Knightley was narrating the story rather than Jane.  I enjoyed the book since I love the characters Jane Austen created in "Emma", but by no means should this be considered the definitive look into the life of Jane Fairfax. 
     The Firm is a very interesting book that will grab you from the very beginning and keeps you going until the very end. Mitch McDeere is fresh out of college with his law degree from Harvard accompanied by his loving wife, Abby. Mitch is recieving tons of job offers because he was ranked third in his class at Harvard. After careful consideration mitch decides to take a job in Memphis that pays a lot of money. What both Mitch and Abby thought was a god law firm turned out to be the place that could ruin their lives. They haved to perservere and try to secretly get out of this law firm without being killed. They are very upset with their decision to work at this law firm but will do anything to get out of this very mysterious firm.      I thought that this was perhaps one of the best books that I've ever read. This book had me reading from cover to cover as soon as I started reading. I just wanted to keep on reading more because it was so suppenseful and I wanted to find out what happened next. I thought that this was a good writing technique because he keeps you reading from front to back. All in all I thought this was a great book and would suggest it to anyone who likes reading suspenseful, on the edge of your seat books. 
 I have to give this book 5 stars. Mary O'Hara wrote an incredibly beautiful story about a struggling family. Many of the details of the story are so true to life.  As an adult reading this story, I found the details about the parents to be more interesting than the story of the horse and the boy. O'Hara really understands the concerns of a parent for a struggling child and it's very true to life in the book. Many important issues are touched upon in this book too; responsibility for our domestic animals, love for people and animals, doing our duty in our every day life are all there with out being mushy and sentimental. O'hara also paints a vivid picture of Wyoming and old-time ranch life. It makes me wish it was still like that, so I could visit it. This is another great book for a read aloud family time. 
 Great recording, a few I haven't heard before are better than the more common hits I hear on the radi 
 Sleater-Kinney has been my favorite band for some time now, and through my exploration of their works I've never been let down by a single album, or a single song. To me, every Sleater-Kinney album is incredible. These women know how to make amazing music, but with The Hot Rock it had something more boiling under its skin. Something about this album resonates with me on every level. Each song just creates this powerful emotional current, a current that will sweep you away to musical bliss. It's hard to determine which Sleater-Kinney albums are better than the others - in my mind they are all untouchable pieces of music, standing all on their own, seprarate from everything else. I have determined though, that The Hot Rock is my favorite of these works, each song as great as the last, filling you with what you've been missing but never knew you lost. This is Sleater-Kinney at their absolute best. This album has changed and saved my life countless times. Listen to this and breathe deeply: This is music as music should be 
 Its so hard to write a review almost 10 years after the fact. And 10 years later there has been nothing like this cd. Erykah hasn't even topped her self.  Sometimes you can only do it once and i guess that's what all it took cause this album is still undisputed. No need to list favorties...we all them from the radio and videos but for your whole album to be mind-blowing is CRAZY. Anyone who doesn't have this album by now, smack your self and go get it 
 In many ways this is a brilliant work.  It's difficult to review now since our tastes have changed and since part of its value was in its originality -- which has been built upon by more modern authors.  Thus, it is a true classic.  One's valuation of it has much to do with whether one evaluates it in the context of the 19th century or the 21st.  Collins subtly criticizes much of 19th century English society in his treatment of Ezra, Clack, Mrs. Merridew, etc.  Even Betteredge's reliance on "Robinson Crusoe" seems to reflect on Victorian religious mores (i.e. perhaps (?)  an allusion to the Bible).  Differences in social mores today can be seen in both Rachel's & Rosanna's coverups etc.   The basic structure of the book--a series of eyewitness accounts reminds one of certain TV shows & the normal operation of our police or CSIs--where evidence is uncovered bit by bit though interviews & re-interviews.  Today's mysteries rely on yesterday's just as today's sitcoms rely on Shakespeare's comedies.  Collins appears to succeed overall in well-defining his characters and their styles along with their assumptions, prejudices, etc.  However, as Collins states in his Author's Preface, "The attempt made here, is to trace the influence of character on circumstances" vs. its opposite per most other novels.  This is a lengthy & enjoyable (though at times a bit tedious & wordy) novel--not really escape fiction as with many of the pseudo mysteries of today (more suspense story than legitimate mystery with clues etc. that are fair to the reader).  Its values are much deeper.  It may not become your favorite, but it's well worth discovering 
 I had an LiDE30 before and would've kept it except the software didn't work on a Mac with other applications and there wasn't any new software to be found.  I've seen the negative reviews on this machine w.r.t. Macs and don't understand why they were written.  My unit worked right out of the box with Photoshop Elements.     The only reason I gave it a 4 is because, after all, it is a low-end scanner AND I had to give up a perfectly good scanner (albeit same low end) because of the lack of support by Canon for the LiDE30 
 I love "The Giving Tree."  This book teaches us how we are supposed to be in life.  If we could all be like the tree the world would be a better place.   I've been wanting to buy this book to add to my collection since the frist time I read it as a child.  Now I'm 20 years old and in college.  This book has spanned many generations and I plan on keep passing it down the line 
 Courage has to do with "big heartedness." I have read about many courageous people but few as courageous as this man. If you are a seeking a role model, a template for bringing meaning to life, then read this book. It made me realize the essence of non-violent living, gave me a clearer picture of Gandhi, helped me to see how little wisdom is exhibited in our leaders today.....and offered a hope for a new way of being. A way for bringing deep meaning to life. This is an important book and an important man. I intend to use it as a text in the class I teach at WPI 
 Finally a professional biography, which does such elementary but necessary scholarship as comparing the Kennedy brothers' appointment books with Monroe's to show how miniscule the contact was. Compares accounts in previous bios with verifiable facts. (The outrageous way con-men fabricate and market a dead hero's story could make a separate book.) As Mr. Spoto documents Marilyn Monroe's endless small generosities and quirks, she becomes more lovable than one had dared to hope. Marilyn had an uncanny ability to awaken our protective instincts, and at the end, when Miller is cold and her therapist exploiting, Mr. Spoto grows furious. Otherwise, the first objective biography of this American culture hero: all serious criticism must now start with it. George J. Leonard, Prof of Humanities, San Francisco State Universit 
  	Generally thought of as a privileged and political family, one that produced two presidents, the Roosevelts were actually a house divided.  The divisions marking this political dynasty are thoughtfully and engrossingly chronicled by the co-authors of "The Rockefellers, The Kennedys, and The Fords."  	The Oyster Bay Branch of the family was headed by Theodore, a loving, outgoing husband and father, who described his fourth child, Archibald, as "a cunning little polyp."  As adults these children became involved in government and the workings of their communities.  	Theodore's younger cousin, Franklin, was viewed by members of the Oyster Bay branch as somewhat of a playboy, whose future was uncertain.  He married Theodore's favorite niece, Eleanor, with whom he shared a strained relationship and became a rigid and distant father.  Franklin's children's adult lives were marked by numerous marriages and scarred by personal tragedies.  	The story of the Roosevelts is a dramatic one, filled with intrigue, machinations, and intense rivalries.  The characters are larger than life, but then so is their saga.           - Gail Cook 
 One thing I really appreciate about this book is that the author is humble about cultural realms where he is not familiar with.  Personally, I liked his writings coming from the the view of everyday life a lot more than his somewhat tedious comparisons of the CA phenomenon to each ethnic groups in America.  Nonetheless, this is a book worth chewing on 
 Kelly Benton has loved Rowdy McKay since she was a little girl.  She has saved herself for the handsome Marine and plans on living a happily ever after.  But, fate steps in and she is brutally attacked, leaving her shaken and scared...even of the man that holds her heart.  Will Kelly ever be able to accept Rowdy's touch or reach for the safety of his arms?  Rowdy comes home to finally claim Kelly.  She's all grown up and he's tired of waiting but his homecoming is not what he expects and his girl has been keeping a secret from him.  What's worse. The nightmare isn't over yet, she's still be stalked by the animal that dared to hurt her.  With the help of his two cousins Natches and Dawg he plans on getting the bad guy and the girl.    Ms. Leigh has once again created a good read.  What kept it from being great was the fact she didn't build the suspense as to who had hurt Kelly.  The end did not stop with an "Ah ha!" moment. The intimate scenes are not what loyal readers will be used to so be forewarned if you're looking for heat. This is story about two people with a past and I highly enjoy these kinds of romances.  I look forward to reading the next in the McKay cousin series.               
 There are some aspects of World War II, believe it or not, that are under-reported, or at least aren't studied as much as others.  One reason for that is just lack of interest, but another reason is because a lot of the source material is simply unavailable, and what's out there is likely to be so biased that you have to sift it for useful information.  For the longest time, the uprising in Warsaw in 1944, when the Soviet army was on the doorstep of the Polish capital, was one of those things.  Norman Davies has done a good job of rectifying that, to an extent, with his book Rising '44: The Battle for Warsaw.  Still, it is not as definitive as it could be because, as Davies points out, many of the needed documents to write a complete history are still not available through Soviet archives.  Davies does what he can, and he does a wonderful, if sometimes exceedingly slow, job of it.  One thing that Davies points out, which is the most important thing I take from it, is how often this uprising is confused with the uprising in the Jewish Warsaw Ghetto in 1943.  Until I read this book, I was one of those who were misinformed about this, and the Soviet Union (and the communist Polish government) readily allowed this misconception to stand for many years.  The two uprisings are *not* the same, and they deserve to have their separate histories and their separate commemorations.  The Warsaw rising of 1944 began on August 1, 1944, as the Soviet army was rampaging through the countryside.  They had reached the Vistula river, just east of Warsaw, and the Resistance movement (at least, the non-Communist parts of it) wished to rise up, re-take the city, and welcome the Soviets as liberated people (much like the Parisians did when Paris fell to the Americans and French).  Rising '44 is the tale of this uprising, a tale of woe because the Soviets stopped to allow the Germans to crush it, because the Americans and British were too weak in relation to the Soviets to do much more than provide token airlifts of supplies (many of which didn't reach the Resistance anyway).  The attempt to re-take the city, expected to last two or three days before the Soviets moved in, instead lasted 66, with the Germans taking heavy losses even as they systematically destroyed the city.   But Rising '44 is much more than that, and sometimes (especially in the beginning), that drags the book down a notch.  The book begins with a wide overview of the Polish situation, both in relation to the Allied coalition (Soviets, USA, and Britain) and with the Germans.  It works hard to set up the circumstances that were in effect when the Rising began.  Thus, it does not move chronologically, except within each specific area, detailing first how the Poles were the First Ally of the British and French, and how they heroically stood up to the Germans as the British and French decided they did not have the resources to invade Germany from the east in 1939.  The first section gives information on the Soviet invasion of 1939, along with the occupation by both sides.  This chapter moved incredibly slowly, with a few annoyances as well that made me almost put down the book.  Davies' insistence on renaming Poland "First Ally," presumably to make the point that Poland was there at the beginning and was let down, really got on my nerves.  He even inserts that phrase in place of "Poland" in quotes from various sources.  Davies' prose in this section did not help, and I found it a struggle to continue.  However, once past this section, it is well worth it, and I found that the information imparted was useful despite how it was presented, as everything becomes related when the Rising begins.  The middle section gives a chronological history of the Rising, almost day by day, that is just gripping.  Interspersed with the narrative are primary source excerpts that draw you in even more.  The only quibble I have with the excerpts is that they're referenced in the main narrative as if Davies is trying to tell you "now is a good time to go read this excerpt and then come back" but the excerpt has nothing to do with what you just read.  He gets better at that as the book goes along, but I was mystified at the placement of some of them.  Davies' prose sparkles in this section, giving the reader a detailed account of the triumphs and the miseries that the Resistance suffered through, the eventually dashed hope that help would be on the way soon.  He also details the political machinations behind the lack of help (at least as much as he is able to, though the Soviet side is more supposition than the Western side).  Davies tells us about the problems between the various Polish organizations too, such as the conflict between the Communist-backed organization that is just waiting for the Soviets to take over the country so they can be instated as the new government, and the Government in Exile that is based out of London.  Finally, Davies does an effective job of giving us the aftermath of the Rising, both the immediate aftermath and the extended one that carries over to the current day.  He details how the Rising was never referred to by the Communist government, and when it was, how the members of the Resistance were vilified as criminals.  He chastises the British and American governments for their weakness in standing up to Stalin, how Churchill felt horrible about the valiant fighters' predicament but could do nothing as the weakest of the three coalition leaders.  The last two sections of the book are riveting, and more than make up for the very slow beginning.  Rising '44 is a valuable book to read if you have any interest in either World War II or the beginnings of the Cold War.  Don't let the beginning slow you down.  It's worth it to get to the meat of the book.  Davies has himself a winner.  David Ro 
 In "The Definitive Book of Body Language," the writers, Barbara and Allan Pease, share their three-decade expertise with readers in subject of body language, which draws from a miscellany of fields such as psychology and biology. From this book, one learns some interesting and effective commication methods which are applicable to a variety of situations. One also learns about ways in which to tell whether or not someone might be lying, which is indicated mostly through specific hand and body gestures. They reveal the signficance of smiles and there is also good information on the functionality of handshakes 
 When a friend was recently going through a rough time, I loaned her the whole series of Grafton's Kinsey Millhone books.  My friend told me they allowed her to escape from the stress until she could handle it better.  Unfortunately, she also told me that Kinsey has replaced me as her best friend 
  The Rainmaker is an intriguing story that will keep readers wanting to turn the page.  Written by John Grisham, this story has inspired readers everywhere.  It's a story of compassion, devotion, and love- This is the story of a lawyers struggle through the beginning of his career. 	The Rainmaker is about a rooky lawyer named Rudy Baylor who just graduated from law school.  He has passed his bar exam and has taken on his first cases as a lawyer.  Since Rudy has no money and no place to live, he's just looking for some easy money makers.  At least that's what he thinks these cases are, but Rudy gets in over his head.  These so called easy cases turn into a fight for justice in this small town. 	With the help of his new found partner, a friend who knows the ropes of law, and some ways around it, Rudy finds the real lawyer inside of him, vs. the lawyer that breezed through college.  He fights for what's right against a dishonest insurance company that won't cover a young man with leukemia and a young woman with an abusive husband. 	This story follows his struggles, hardships and breakthroughs.  This is an extraordinary story.  It's a story for all readers and one that everyone will enjoy.  This novel is written so well you feel like you're not just reading it, but your there, in the courtroom, or in the office, or wherever the story may take you.  The details, it's not superficial or unrealistic, and how the characters are written make the story even more real.  It almost feels like a biography, like Rudy's thoughts were written down on paper as he thought them.  Reading this story will inspire young lawyers, and young readers everywhere.  I can truly say that this novel is one that I can read over and over and still be taken aback by this story of affection, love, and allegiance. 
 This was a blind buy - didn't really know too much about this show. Now I'm addicted. BBC/ITV need to get the other seasons into Region 1 encoding soon.  The tension between Nickie and Helen is masterfully played. Buy it. You will be glad you did 
 I am not much of a Pilates person, but I do use lots of walking routines on DVD. This is one of the better walks, in that it consists of simple steps and arm movements which are built upon to increase intensity and raise the heart rate. The 45 minute routine passes quickly, and I felt that I had worked both upper and lower body in an intense and energizing manner. The instructor is pleasant without grating, she cues very well, and she encourages you to test your own limits. It is easy to  maintain proper posture and alignment while following the routine, and the arm movements, which differ slightly from other routines I have tried, work the shoulders and back in a very pleasant manner. I highly recomment this DVD, along with Debbie Rocker's Walking for Weight Loss. They are a bit more vigorous than Leslie Sansone and Prevention's Chris Freytag walking programs. It's good to alternate the various walks over the course of the week 
 This is one of the greatest TV sets ever out there.  I was in complete shock when I read the back of the set box and it said the final two seasons.  Some of my favorite episodes are still out there.....Columbo goes to the Guillotine, Rest in Peace Mrs. Columbo, and who can forget Butterfly in Shades of Gray....its one my favorites seeing Bill Shatner doing a bad Bill Shatner impersonation!!!  If Universal has any heart, they'll continue to release the episodes 
 The second edition was published in June 2005.  Unless you're a computer historian, get the new one:  (...) Great book.  Marc Rochkind's book is also very good and surprisingly non-overlapping, considering 
 Excellent Book!  Wonderful insights into how and what a parent should think about and do to raise a son into becoming a good, solid man of G_D.  Mom's need all they help they can get and this book provides insights for both Mother's & Father's. A book for "Every" parent to read who is raising a son! 
 With the ever present ticking of a clock and nerve-wracking machine noises in the soundtrack, this is a taut, nifty disaster thriller, with the cruise ship HMS Britannic sailing to America, unknowingly with 7 bombs hidden aboard, set to explode; they have multiple booby traps, and the saboteur wants not only money but revenge against the system that in his twisted mind feels slighted him.  The cast is great, with Richard Harris as the head of a demolition team, David Hemmings as his right-hand man, Omar Sharif as the ship's captain, and Anthony Hopkins as the man in charge of finding the bad guy (whose wife and children are aboard the ship); Shirley Knight, Ian Holm, and Roy Kinnear round out the cast.  The direction by Richard Lester, better known for his comedic musical films with The Beatles and not thrillers, is fast paced, with some superb effects; I especially like the suspenseful moments when the demolition crew arrives on the scene, parachuting into the stormy sea.  The screenplay by producer Richard DeKoker is intelligent, raising this film up from the average production in this genre, and the cinematography by Gerry Fisher excellent. The score by Ken Thorne is also good, but mostly one can only hear the tick...tick...tick...of the bomb. Total running time is 109 minutes. 
 I have not seen this movie yet, but my husband has and wanted it.  He had Short Circit.  He is they type of person that likes all kinds of movies and thought this would be a good additon to our collectio 
 Jim Chee witnesses a mysterious plane crash on a makeshift desert runway on the lonely Navajo reservation in Arizona.  A body shows up near a Hopi village with the hands and feet skinned.  A windmill is vandalized by persons unknown. Storm clouds herald a violent end to a drought that parches the high desert country.      Thus, Hillerman sets the scene for his story, the fifth in the Navajo Detectives series and the second with Sergeant Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police as the main character. "Dark Wind" weaves into the story the religious ceremonies of the gentle Hopi Indians and the antipathy between village Hopi and sheep-herding Navajo.  The story is overlaid by the natural splendor of the country and Chee's knowledge of his people and land are crucial to resolving the mystery, while the Federals - the FBI and the DEA - thrash around ineffectively  Hillerman has professed to be a little uncomfortable with his creation, Jim Chee, a young man with a stubborn, rebellious streak, one foot in the Navajo world and the other in the White man's. Chee demonstrates those characteristics in "Dark Wind" and is less likeable as a character than in other books in the series.         "Dark Wind" is a good tale -- but not the best of the series -- with a lot of intriguing insights into Hopi and Navajo folkways and philosophy. If you like the wide-open spaces of the American west, you'll like Tony Hillerman's books.  Smallchie 
 The Grapes Of Math by Gregory Tang and Harry Briggs has one genre of math problems presented in an amusing fashion with good art.  The genre is patterns of objects with breaks in the patterns.  The children are expected to look at the patterns as groupings or shapes to figure out the total number of objects without counting one-by-one.  This is a good book.  The kids like it.  The problems are amusing, even bordering on tickling.  My only problem with this book is that an overview of methods for solving the problems should be at the beginning.  But so what?  There are a few ways to look at the problems and the kids actually sit down to do them without being pestered.  Let me repeat this:  after the initial disappointment that I had purchased math books, on their own the kids actually sat down to do the problems without being pestered.  If  this isn't an endorsement, then what is 
 I'm compelled to write this review after browsing the others, because something has to be said about book that isn't being pointed out for someone who is interested in the book for the first time.   At this point, this book can be found on the front table in your local bookstore. Other philosophy books can be found in the philosophy section either collecting dust, or being perused by someone intensely interested in philosophy who is well versed in debates that have gone on for centuries.   I have listened to the author, Robert Pirsig, being interviewed, and it seems that he did, in fact, intend for this book and its premise of "Quality" to be the great, all encompassing philosophy, presented in a straightforward, readable manner. However, despite Pirsig's intention, that is not quite why this book has become so famous.   This book is famous because it fills a perfect niche in that it introduces some very complicated philosophical questions in a form that the common reader will find interesting. Pirsig is attempting to create a practical philosophy and sets the book against the background of actual experience to make the questions he ponders real for the reader.   With that in mind, if you are not clamoring for a debate with someone else who is knowledgable on the ins and outs of Kierkegaard and Spinoza and are simply looking for a readable book that makes a real attempt of answering the big questions in life, this book is for you.   What I find interesting, and somewhat disturbing, is that many choose to deride this book because it doesn't agree with their notions of philosopy, but fail to grasp that the people who are most likely to read this book won't even be at the table to understand their objections to it unless they read it.   Probably no book has ever been more successful in interesting people in philosophy in the first place. So why are people who are interested in the subject eager to send them away because it disagrees with something they read in some banal tome?  Bottom line, if you ran across this book at your local bookshop or had it recommended to you by a friend, you must read it. It is an awesomely thought inspiring book and asks questions you never thought to ask or at least didn't know how to put your finger on. It's both a good novel and a great introduction to philosophy for people who have an interest in greater questions but not all the time to pursue them. I don't think you should worry about the fact that someone with a Masters Degree in Philosophy, or an equivalent knowledge, is bothered by the book. Also, I wouldn't be thrown by the title. The book isn't trying to sell you a newsletter or convert you to any church (despite the use of the phrase "The Church of Reason") and is only using a bit of Zen philosophy as a grounding for its premise.   Pirsig's premise does have a tendency to never be overtly stated, but I believe that he does this because he doesn't want it overly simplified in the way I'm about to do it.  Pirsig's premise is that we live in a world of both the "Classical" and "Romantic" or, as I'll simplify it, "form" and "function", respectively. Pirsig sees the problems in our world as the result of an overemphasis on form, when function is more essential. However, pure "function" has problems of its own. For example, our bodily organs carry out the function of allowing us to live, but one doesn't really desire for our skin to be translucent so we can watch these functions. In fact, we would have a revulsion to such a thing. Therefore, we have a combination of both of "form" and "function"; our organs work very well without our having to see them. This is the desirable state. This desirable state is called "Quality". Good "function" seems to bring about its own desirable "form". May the decorative towel be damned. That's grossly oversimplified, but there it is.  Finally, one shouldn't be thrown off Pirsig's premise by the fact that, quite frankly, he tends to be an impatient father and not very easy to get along with. While reading the book, it becomes apparent that Pirsig is sharing this with us because he is oblivious to it himself. He makes it obvious that he doesn't understand why no one is pondering the philosophical implications of repairing a motorcycle or why his young son isn't arriving at all of the conclusions he is, despite the fact his son is eleven. He seems to be trapped in the context of his own view of the world.  So, if you want to wade your way through all of the pontificating, please take the time to read "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance". If you really, really like it, then you can debate with the philosophy majors.  
 This outline could never stand alone as a DSP tutorial, but it is excellent if you need extra problems to solve or if you need a refresher course in elementary DSP topics. Chapter one starts where any DSP course usually starts - with a quick review of signals and systems. Chapter two is on Fourier analysis and discusses all of the basics including the concept of filtering, interconnection of systems, and finally the discrete time Fourier transform and its properties. Chapter 3 is on sampling, and includes a good discussion of analog to digital conversion and how it can induce aliasing. Next the converse, digital to analog conversion, is discussed as well as discrete time processing of continuous signals and finally sample rate conversion. Chapter 3 is especially useful, since most DSP texts do not go into as much detail on practical A/D and D/A conversion topics as this chapter does. Chapter four finally gets into the z-transform - its definition, its properties, and its inverse. Chapter 5 is about the transform analysis of systems and specifically how the z transform makes the analysis of such systems much simpler than what was done in earlier chapters. Chapter six discusses the discrete Fourier transform, which is a finite-series version of the DTFT, which was discussed in chapter two. Because the Discrete Fourier Transform has a time complexity of NxN, the next chapter discusses its more practical alternative the Fast Fourier Transform, which has an NlogN time complexity. This might seem trivial at first, but if you are filtering 1Kx1K pixel images, the difference becomes significant. Although this chapter is very brief, it does a pretty good job of driving home the main points of the algorithm. Also, it has some pretty good exercises on the FFT, which are usually hard to find in textbooks. Now that all of the groundwork has been laid, chapter eight discusses the implementation of discrete time systems, which is the essence of DSP. Common filter structures are introduced. Chapter 9, the final chapter, is on filter design. Both IIR and FIR filter techniques are introduced. Thus, if you are in an advanced DSP course, this outline will probably be too elementary for you. For first semester students, this should be a very helpful outline for transitioning from the study of linear systems to DSP 
 While it should go without saying that no martial art can be learned solely from a book and that the intricacies need to be experienced with a real live teacher in real time, I think that this book can definitely benefit students of Eishin Ryu Iaido. Whether you are a beginner, trying to remember the waza (techniques), or an old hand, looking to brush up on the basics that can get lost over time, Suino's book is a good reference text.  I have to say that I was surprised. So many martial arts texts either have amateurish pictures (such as Yang Jwing-Ming's texts, which are otherwise so useful) or pictures that simply don't include enough details. This book has basic but clear graphics that, along with real-life/real-time instruction, make a lot of sense. Even Suino's description of how to put on the gi and hakama are better than most I've seen. (If he included how to fold the hakama, it would be even better! Luckily, you can get that online ([...]).)  Compared to a book like Flashing Steel, Suino helps the beginner in particular by focusing on the pragmatic topics: he lists and explains the introductory Batto Ho no Bu (Drawing Methods Set) techniques, the intermediatesd Tatehiza no Bu (Half-Seated Set), and the advanced Tachiwaza no Bu (Secret Forms, Standing Set). While the glossary could be longer, you can filter through the text to find other words/phrases that he uses and explains and pencil them into the glossary on your own.  The other thing that really excites me about this book is that he always includes the kanji (Japanese characters) for the names of the techniques. As an intermediate speaker of Japanese, that helped me a lot when I was trying to figure out what the names really meant 
 There is not much new in this book for those who follow the UN, but it is a balanced assessment. His reform recommendations err on the conservative side, although he does show how the US Congress imposes limits on the organization and then blames it for not doing more. The book is intended for a general readership rather than scholars or those with an in-depth knowledge of the UN. 
 I liked this version of the Titanic story when I saw it on the big screen, and I've seen all of them except a silent reel made shortly after the sinking in 1912. I've been a Titanic buff for 50 years now, and read most of the books. However, last weekend I went to a museum to see "Artifacts of the Titanic", a collection of more than 100 items snatched up from the debris field two-and-a-half miles down, things once connected to the White Star Line or to individual passengers which survived 80-plus years underwater. It was incredibly moving and sad. Connected with the exhibit was an IMAX showing of James Cameron's "Ghosts of the Abyss." The "Titanic" director took some of his enormous profits from this 1998 release, and in 2001 he rented a Russian ship, two submersible submarines, and two robotic cameras, and went down to the wreck himself, taking along actor Bill Paxton from the movie. The resulting hour-long giant screen film is excellent. If you get a chance to see it, or the salvaged items, don't pass it up. Meanwhile, the movie works. So have most of the earlier versions, and so have most of the books, because the tragedy speaks to people of all ages and classes. The fictional parts of Cameron's film work better than the fictional parts of earlier movies about the disaster, in my view. Seeing the artifacts and the wreck on a 58-foot curved screen made me want to see this movie again, on a big screen. 
 A wonderful book. Like the history of religious atrocity, most people are not aware of the history of psychology. I encourage people to read this book and other honest tellings of the history of psychology. The fact is that people have been, and in fact are still being tortured in the secretive psychiatric institutions. Basic laws of right to trial and sentence are being routinely violated. The casual use of four-point restraints is a cruel and unusual punishment that gives, most of the time a nonviolent victim, less room to move than an animal cage and is forbidden for even the most violent offenders in the prisons of earth. Some people are locked in these hospitals for months without any hope of a trial, not charged with any kind of illegal crime, and people in the hospital refuse to give out information to people trying to locate loved-ones and family members claiming to be protecting their privacy.   This book is worth reading simply to hear about the brutal tortures inflicted on victims of the psychiatric stigma. These include the water-tub, forced lobotomies, shock treatments, forced druggings and many others, all well researched by Whitaker.   The stigma of "insanity" is really an interesting phenomenon, and although this book does not describe this phenomenon in too much detail, there is some inside information given on this topic. It's shocking to me that a majority hold that Jesus rose from the dead and brought people back to life, believe in their horoscopes, believe the stories of psychics, etc. but then inflict brutal torture and druggings on those with unusual theories (like people can hear their thoughts, and beam messages onto their heads, etc.) until the victims tell the torturers what they want to hear.  It's an informative story, a history of psychology and psychiatric hospitals. We need to put the magnifying glass on this history and we need to reform it, by stopping forced treatment (it is only natural that a human should only receive drugs consensually, or not at all) in particular forced drugging and stopping the practice of four-point restraints for people with no violent history at least. From there people should seek to integrate the psychiatric system into a legal lawful system, perhaps removing the 72 hour laws and making consensual treatment a service in prisons for both nonviolent and violent, who are better equipped to handle, for example violent people, and then ofcourse, the full weight of legal structure and protections will apply to those locked there.   The one criticism I have for this book, in all fairness is that there is not the total rejection of much of the psychology theories. For example, in my view psychosis, neurosis, and schitzophrenia as clinical diseases can be thrown into the garbage as absolutely useless. Paranoia and delusion (or simply inaccurate beliefs) I can see as ligitimate conditions, but not that should receive any forced treatment. I see these conditions as being best treated with lesson and history of science through talk and videos. Perhaps lessons on why consensual sexuality and physical pleasure is healthy, even though much of society rejects this. In addition, lessons critical of religious beliefs, exposing the religious stories as inaccurate and fraudulent might help some people to learn their way out of delusion.  Fortunately the people in psychology will probably never again cut into a human body, and there is progress, but I think we as a nation, and even as a planet, need to take a look at the history of psychology, and I ask why the people in psychology do not present this history to the public themselves.  We should not keep history a secret, and we can learn alot from the past, that is one reason why I recommend this book "Mad in America" 
 I absolutely love this book! It's so realistic and true, and it puts you right in the story. It is all about a 6th grade girl named Kelley Breann who gets in a horrible car accident, and gets scars a burns all over her face. She has to wear a mask and stockings so the scars won't be as obvious, but hates looking the way she is. Finally she learns that her friends still love her as she is and she is still the same Kelley Breann inside. I love this book and couldn't put it down. I hope all of you consider reading it 
 I read the review from the reviewer who had "figured out who did it" halfway through the book.  Yes, I suspected who did it also.  But, there was still the element of surprise as to how everything would turn out, etc.  It seemed like a hopeless situation when I realized the perpetrator.  I listened to the audio version of this book.  I usually only listen to audio books as I walk.  However, when I got to the point of finding our who the hit and run driver was, I couldn't stop listening.  I listened to the last two cassettes non-stop all morning long.  If I had been reading it, it would have been a true page turner until I reached the end.  I recommend this story highly.  It is different than The Notebook and The Wedding, and I applaud Nicholas Sparks as a writer 
 8 women is a good musical/ murder mystery with humor, light heartedness and mystery. It combines a bunch of the best French actrices, and an enjoyable plot. A real guesser until the end 
 You know when you pick up a novel and read that the central character's initial thrust is an investigation into a hippopotamus murder in Havana which is linked to a Mafia rubout in New York and that character's main love is a one-armed circus assistant who is deeply in love with a man with leprosy who in turn turned out his own male Swedish lover after possibly infecting him....well, you've either got a turkey of a book or a terrific one. Fortunately, "Dancing to Almendra", a recent offering by author Mayra Montero, falls into the latter category. It is two hundred sixty pages of unadulterated joy.  Set in 1957 months before the overthrow of Cuba's Batista, Montero invents a host of people that are incomplete, to say the least. But this is not Scarsdale and the color that Montero provides through her descriptions of the men and women who dot her book are second only to a powerful and well-paced narrative. Montero brings out the best in these flawed people, as they simply try to hold their lives together. I must admit that the beginning of "Dancing to Almendra" flies by with characters too many to keep track of sometimes, but the good news is that this book gets better with each passing page. She paints a portrait of the last days of Cuba before Castro, and how accurate that portrait really is doesn't matter. It surely contains many elements of a free-wheeling Cuba in its last free-wheeling days, much to the nostalgia (and perhaps anger) of those who don't or can't live there today.  "Dancing to Almendra" is rich in every way. Too crazy for words perhaps is Montero, but she finds the words and then some. One would like to fly  to Havana, sit back and have a couple of rums and read this wonderful book on its own turf. I highly recommend it along with thanks to the author for a much appreciated endeavor in writing it 
 I have read all of them. This ranks with the other two major accomplishments (in my biased opinion): The best without a DOUBT, Time To Kill followed closely by The Firm (movie was mediocre in comparison). This is a MUST read for any Grisham or NON Grisham fan. He has had some stinkers, but this one is DEFINITELY one of his bes 
 I've just purchased this book today, and am looking forward to delving into it shortly!  However, I would like to make a comment on all the negative press Marie Antoinnette & Louis XVI received during their reign.  It seems all throughout history, whenever someone is unhappy with the way the present regime is running things, those trying to over throw the it, such as the Napoleons, Lenins & Stalins, are far more tyrannical and spend thrifts than their predecessors.  Anyway, just some food for thought 
 I was given this book as a gift and think the photographs in it are absolutely great!  The text that accompanies all the photos is interesting, but I've noticed more than just a few spots in the book where the captions to the photos stops in mid-sentence.  I still love the book and if those captions were complete; it would rate 5 stars 
 This book is better than the original PS2 one by miles.  It has all the secret side missions and is well presented.  It is a must for anyone after 100% 
 If you love Rob Zombie,this is a must have for your collectio 
 I got this book from another person who felt that biofeedback has matured to the point that it is vastly superior to medication for children with attention-deficit disorders, or adults with anger or impatience issues.  Although it was published in 2001, I agree with the reviewers that say this is an ideal starter book.  I am so impressed by the very balanced, methodical presentation that this author provides, that I am scheduling a biofeedback evaluation session to see for myself.  Other reviewers have done a superb job on the meat of this book, so my usual summative review is not necessary.  Instead, I want to emphasize the relevance of this book to the future of the planet.  As with another book I reviewed over a year ago, on the emergent integration of psychology and neuroscience, I have become convinced that macro-neuroscience (belief systems of entire cultures or grops) and micro-neuroscience (individual issues now responsive to learned biofeedback) are going to become the PRIMARY science ofthe future.  We have to cut health care costs in the USA by 75% over the next ten years--there are only three ways to do that: preventive medicine, alternative medicine, and an end to price gouging by big pharma.  The US Government is wasting trillions of dollars on a heavy-metal military that is not only not going to win in Iraq, but is making the problem worse by being an occupying power and by inspiring jihadists worldwide.  At the same time, the US Government is talking the talk about Public Diplomacy, Strategic Communication, and Information Operations--a more substantive variation of Psychological Operations (PSYOP), but they are NOT walking the walk.  Funding for the understanding and remediation of evil belief systems is non-existent, and funding for ensuring that our own children receive the best and most innovation education is also not there.  We should be melding psychology, sociology, anthropology, neuroscience, political and economic science, and so on, and we should be thinking, as Howard Bloom does in "Global Brain" how to bring to bear the full resources of our Nation on creating an educated stable population capable of creating infinite wealth.  This book is therefore, in my opinion, the very tip of the iceberg on what could become the "American Way of Peace" in the 21st Century.  First we have to take our government and our military away from the neo-cons, and restore our reputation as America the good.  Getting biofeedback introduced very early into all our schools would be an excellent place to start.  This book made a believer out of me, and I am relatively certain that once I experience biofeedback for myself under supervision, I am going to want to adopt it as a personal tool 
 The seven Chronicles of Narnia written by C.S Lewis sold more than one hundred copies. The first film adaption of the first book, The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe was a television    movie made by Bill Melendrez who also made Sesame Street. It was good, but not as decent as other cartoons I have seen. I was somewhat disapointed that they did not show Father Christmas. The Rankin/Bass cartoons have far better drama and backgrounds. Still, just because it isn't my favorite movie, doesn't mean it is bad. A live-action version of the first book was finally made in 1988. The live-action The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is a BBC and WonderWorks production, directed by Marilyn Fox, produced by Paul Stone, and dramatised by Alan Seymour. Unfortunately, the BBC Version has poor special effects and sets. Fortunately, it is a faithful adaptation of the book, and it has good acting, especially the professor and Lucy. Aslan, the great Lion, is magniciently voiced by Ronald Pickup. The White Witch is a little overdone with her acting, but apart from that is fine. The Christian tones of the book are emphasized or else it would not be faithful to the book. C.S Lewis said that the Narnia books were Christian paralells, not Christian allegories. He said everything began with images, such as the faun and the witch. His idea of Aslan came when he was having dreams about lions. This is around the time he became a Christian. The film has beautiful scenery, rather like that of the Laurentians in Quebec, although it was actually shot in rural England and Wales. Cair Paravel was located next to the Atlantic Coast in Wales. The five stars rating is more of a personal opinion than anything else. I don't mind the occasionally weak special effects and sets. I first began to watch to watch the movie at a youth group, but unfortunately it was stopped because some of the smaller children were scared of the White Witch. I was disapointed, because the moment I began to watch it, I knew how wonderful it was going to be for me.I found it at the library and watched the rest of it. It is one of my very favorite movies 
 When all of us who are now officially Older Than Dirt were growing up back in the 1960's, we usually aspired to be one of three particular men of achievement. For those of us with an athletic bent, Mickey Mantle was the man of choice. For those adventurers and dreamers among us, John Glenn appeared to offer the perfect life. Finally, for us bookish sorts, Bennett Cerf, publisher of Random House, panelist on "What's My Line," author of some of the worst puns ever written, and all around man about town, was who we aspired to be. This book is in essence his memoirs, told in oral history format just a short time before his unexpected death in 1971. He describes in detail why he was able to grow Random House at such a rapid rate: in his day, the book business was a stuffy one, and no publisher worth his salt would dream of lowering himself to seek out new authors. Bennett, being young, foolish, and very intelligent, would travel to wherever these authors lived and impress them with his obvious wit and sincerity. The sheer number and weight of authors whose service he was able to acquire through these means was absolutely staggering: Eugene O'Neill, James Joyce, Robinson Jeffers, Gertrude Stein, and Bill Styron, to name a very few. Through his liberal editing policies, he was even able to publish authors whose ideas he completely disagreed with, such as Ayn Rand. Some, like playwright Moss Hart, became lifelong friends. Although New Yorkers have long thought of their city as the center of the universe, Bennett's long and storied career made many believe it was true. The reader will enjoy his chatty, breezy style time and again, as a reminder that at one time, in the world of books and publishing, one man truly made a difference 
 Certain cities have become the intellectual and spiritual property of a single writer. Dublin is Joyce, Oran is Camus,  Winesburg Ohio is Sherwood Anderson, Alexandria, Lawrence Durrell. Now Istanbul is Orhan Pamuk who in this autobiographical account of his own childhood and youth, makes Istanbul itself his major subject. The city, and the way it has been described by its writers, painted by its painters is a central concern of his throughout the book. Surprisingly it is the 'look' and ' feel' of the city which have greater importance for him than its people. And aside from his own immediate family, his parents and brother there are very few detailed descriptions of the citizens of Istanbul. Instead the focus is on the writers and painters depictions of the city. And then too Pamuk is very much aware of how the city is seen in the eyes of others outside it. And his description of his own formation as a writer includes this element of his seeing in the way Nerval and Gautier and Flaubert saw the city. His own small family drama and growing up are also given prominent part of the book. His close even clinging relation to his mother, his competitive and difficult relation with his older brother, his at times distant but at other times accepting relationship with his philandering father are described in detail. So too his own youthful adventure in painting. One of the best - told stories in the work of his first love with a girl called 'the dark rose' who eventually is forced by her family to go away from him.  The descriptions of Istanbul are again detailed and comprehensive. They are accompanied by monochrome illustrative photos most of which are credited to Ara Guler. These photos are truly helpful in filling out the pictures of the city Pamuk makes in the work. The Istanbul of Pamuk's childhood is the faded and decrepit former capitol of the Ottoman Empire. It is a city in which the people of Pamuk's class and social set are devoted to the Westernization of. And the theme of the partial and limited Westernization is one central to the work. At the very end of the work when Pamuk's mother is cautioning him against making a career as painter, cautioning him that there is no way to make a respectable career in it in Turkey, she has in her mind the clear sense of what a Frenchman or Englishman can do, and what a Turk cannot expect to.  In describing the mood and feeling of the city Pamuk discourses at length on the concept of 'hazzun' the city's special kind of melancholy. This is how Alberto Manguel in a Washington Post review describes Pamuk's account of it. It is " a Turkish word whose Arabic root (it appears five times in the Koran) denotes a feeling of deep spiritual loss but also a hopeful way of looking at life, "a state of mind that is ultimately as life-affirming as it is negating." It is the failure to experience huzun," Pamuk says, "that leads him to feel it." According to Pamuk, moreover, huzun is not a singular preoccupation but a communal emotion, not the melancholy of an individual but the black mood shared by millions. " What becomes clear in the way is that melancholy or not Pamuk is too deeply connected with his city to leave it in mind and in spirit.  Yet the city which Pamuk focuses on and describes is one in which religion plays a neglible part, certainly among the social circles of Pamuk's family, and apparently also within his own life. This Istanbul dated from perhaps the turn of the century to the early nineteen- sixties when Pamuk's narrative ends is clearly much different from the far more Islamic city of today.  One of the great surprises of this book was seeing how small a part Islam per se plays in Pamuk's vision of the city.  Pamuk writes with brilliance and intricacy, and he is masterful in his descriptions of the city. But in his description of human relationships he seems to me somewhat cold and detached. One does not even feel real love in his writing about his close family members.  In this work though the real emotional devotion is to the city of Pamuk's childhood and youth. Nobel- Prize winner Pamuk is now part of its legend.  
 The authors put together a maturity model for virtual teams. It provides at least a way to measure the team and its performance against a base, so it is a good starting point. The model seems to be a take off on the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) used to assess software development procedures and processes, for example a virtual team is defined as being at level 5 when they are involved in continuous improvement or having repeatable processes, similar to obtaining CMM 5. With interest I noted that in order for a team to reach level 3, the project manager cannot also manage a co-located team, or a team located in the same place where he/she is working. I believe this means that if he/she manages a group that is located in Texas and another group located in Ukraine it is okay as long as he/she lives in California; not in Texas or Ukraine. Why this is necessary in order to be at level 3 is not clear to me. To have 30 persons all working in different locations and not have the project manager at least located with some of the team members is not likely to occur in a software development situation.  Achieving Project Management Success Using Virtual Teams is a good introduction to project management and provides a good base for examining the differences between the two types of teams. The authors' state that they wish to provide project management professionals with a book to prepare them for the dissimilarities between traditional and virtual project teams, while highlighting what remains unchanged when one moves from a traditional to a virtual project. Since they spend a lot of time talking about the traditional project team development, they probably hit that objective. They developed a good base, in the form of a chart, of how some of the typical project management procedures change when moving from a traditional team to a virtual team. The assessment tools discussed are also excellent for any type of a team, and having the documents available for download works out well to make the tools useable and easier to pass around amongst a team.  Overall though, more discussion on how to handle the differences between traditional and virtual teams, and backing these areas up with examples and case studies would have strengthened the book. Additionally, two questions which specifically relate to software development situations, kept running through my mind as I was reading this book: How do the virtual team policies and procedures described in the book, change for an outsourced versus an insourced (i.e. all members of the team work for the same company) team? Secondly, how do virtual team policies and procedures change when a virtual team consists of multiple co-located groups? Perhaps subjects for a new book.  
 This album and Volume 2 are Joan Baez at her best.  The cool soprano voice and the clearly understood verse are evident here.  Great emotion is achieved with her ability to balance the timbre of her voice to the story of the ballad.  The accompaning guitar is fitting.  The choice of the songs and the order of their presentation are perfect.  The quality of the re-engineering is very good considering the original is over forty years old.  All in all a masterpiece 
 This book reaches a broad audience; from those who don't know anything about visual perception to those who are experts in the field 
 Only drawback; it's long, too long, but for sheer imaginative scope, Wilbur Smith's River God tops everything I've ever read. The story is narrated by the charming eunuch slave Taita, whose secret passion for queen Lostris surprises - until we learn Taita reached manhood before being castrated in order to render him "safe" for service in the palace. He retains his passion, artistic drives and incredible mind, and the exercise of these alone are entertainment of the highest order. After his responsibility to the queen, Taita's primary task in life is to oversee the creation of the treasures the pharaoh will carry to the next life. Along the way - if you believe Taita's egotistical and often condescending reports  (and I loved believing) - he engineers the cutting of stones for the pyramid, personally carves the most exquisite of the golden treasures to be entombed with the ruler, influences most of Pharoah's decisions, protects his friends and destroys his enemies and oh yes, devises equipment and tactics which make the army invincible. Ultimately, however, the Hyksos arrive, an enemy whose primary weapon - the horse - is unknown. The hoard drives toward the capital city, defeating the Pharoah's forces wherever they are met and finally it is necessary for Taita to oversee putting everything of value aboard barges and direct the flight to the south.  In the high place where the Nile valley ends and the vast plain of Africa begins, Taita and the remnants of the royal family go into hiding while Taita, deprived of his pyramid, struggles to conceive a way to create a safe tomb. Here, unfortunately, Smith has essentially exhausted his story material. The lengthy narrative covers decades, and becomes a relatively colorless telling of events - and as the end sections set up the precedents for The Seventh Scroll, (second novel in the sequence), of unfortunate necessity everything must be kept suitably vague. We never learn where the pharaoh is finally buried, and the whole story kind of subsides rather than coming to a rousing end.  It doesn't matter. What has already gone has left the imagination reeling and sated. There's also the story that awaits in The Seventh Scroll - I had no idea what it would be, but let me tell you, it knocked my socks off.  If you are tired of the same old same old, I suggest you buy a NEW (un-sneezed upon) copy of River God and treat yourself to a read that will stir your imagination like no other. Art Tirrell - author of The Secret Ever Keeps - March 2007 from Kunati Book Publishers. 
     The story "Many Moons"  is a great book and I would love for someone to read this book, because this book is interesting that the man that is suppose to be silly is the wise one. My favorite part of the story is when the wise men read their list of the things they had got the king. He is very lucky to get all of those things, because there are things on their lists that are amazing. I think the book is called "Many Moons", because everybody, except the king and the Court Jester decribed the moon in diffrent ways. The book "Many Moons" is a terrific book 
 Klosterman is definitely an intelligent writer, and I enjoyed his style.  Some chapters were beyond meaningless-- to the point that I just skipped ahead-- but overall you're bound to learn a thing or two and still be entertained 
 I must say...I average about 3 books a week these days.  It's so rare for me to find a book that I enjoy every page, every paragrah, every word.  This book is one of my favorites.  I read The Girls and The Dive From Clausen's Pier within a few weeks of each other and wanted to stop reading for a year....nothing could match the feeling after reading the end of this book, putting it down on the chair and just smiling.  I wanted to keep that content "man that was great" feeling.  Take a day or two...read it.  
 As most bass players know, Victor has an incredible ability to play the most highly technical music.  In this DVD, you get a chance to watch his hands while he's playing some of his most popular tunes.  Victor has a "thump-off" with his brother Regi, who plays guitar.  Victor also plays with his long time friend, Oteil Burbridge.  This DVD also shows how cool of a guy Victor really is!  He has such a pleasing and simple talent to answer questions and is surprisingly humble.  I originally ordered this and thought it was only 80 minutes.  That is the run-time of the VHS, but the DVD has a run-time of 140 minutes due to the extra interview on the DVD.  This is possibly the most helpful to bass players because he really shows you some cool stuff and more techniques than his onstage performance.    Another thing to note; the video quality is just what you'd expect from a proffessionally produced DVD and the audio is superb considering most of it is a live performance.  Overall this is a must buy for anyone who enjoys or plays slap bass or musicianship of the highest degree 
 Excellent Information, on the theme of Lyme Disease, good for any Health Provider, very good resource for any one interested in these topic. Thank 
 I have seen many a musical, including Monty Python's Spamalot, the 25th Annual Putnam Co. Spelling Bee, Kiss Me Kate, Flower Drum Song, etc.. and I have to say that Millie is still and will probably always be my favorite.  The music is just so fun. I don't know any other way to describe it.  My personal favorite to listen to: the Speed Test. My personal favorite to sing along with: a toss up between I Turned the Corner and Gimme Gimme 
 If you love the blues, and especially if you are a guitarist---you will LOVE this DVD. I've watched it several times and and just keeps getting better. Buy it!! 
 This book was great!  It explains the reasoning behind why and how all the current attractions were constructed.  I would have liked to see a little more on the past and the potential for future attractions, but it was good.  It is really interesting to see why this ride was built just like it was and how the idea formed into what it is.  
 I own a copy of the original edition of Ticknor's "Life of William Hickling Prescott". The original edition contained pen and ink illustrations at the head of each chapter. Furthermore, the original edition that I own was typeset using the "long s" and the "short s" so that it takes some conditioning of the mind to read what appears to be "From thefe, and fimilar maffes of manufcript, were felected .." as "From these, and similar masses of manuscript, were selected ..". This reprint edition is definitely a fascimile of a later version for which the type for the entire book had been reset. Apparently this latter version omitted the illustrations that definitely add character to the original 1864 printing 
 I am a fifth grader at North Hills Traditional Academy. I liked this book. It is interesting because:            *It tells about someones life          *It deals with feelings          *It deals with a neat family. Everyone  would love this book 
 Do you hate George Lucas for ruining his own creation like I do?  I mean, Star Wars, the defining mythology of at least two generations, the story of heroes and redemption has become the joke of our times.  How could it not?  Did you see that idiot, Anakin, scratching his way up the hill, beaten and burned, destined to become the shell for James Earl Jones's ominous basso voice?  Did it make you groan?  Did it make you want to set fire to the Skywalker Ranch?  Am I alone?  Now, I'm not a Star Wars Geek.  I don't play the roleplaying game.  Never have.  I don't have the library of tie-in novels and I do poorly at the trivia compared to a lot of people.  But I snuck into the theater when I was 11 years old to watch Luke Skywalker discover The Force.  I know great stories and despite the slightly cheesy effects and the ham-handed acting, Star Wars was a great story.  Why am I going on and on about what was?  Because Timothy Zahn does Star Wars better than George Lucas does Star Wars.  If Lucas had just filmed these three books - Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising, and The Last Command - he'd have a masterpiece to crown his early achievements.   In Dark Force Rising, Leia conducts a mission to influence an alien race heretofore loyal to one of the Emperor's warlords, Luke finds himself battling an insane Jedi Master, Joruus C'Baoth, and Han Solo races the forces of the warlord, General Thrawn, to get to a lost fleet of Dreadnaught cruisers.  The tension is high throughout this second book in the series and the characters conduct themselves admirably, keeping to the heroic expectations and rebellious attitudes we expect.   Reading this series, and especially this book, will remind you why we loved Star Wars and why we now hate George Lucas.  - CV Ric 
 Great book and was exactly what I had been looking for.  Very helpful and easy to follow instructions.  Price and service from Amazon was great 
 I have to voice agreement with those who praise this as the best but I wonder how much of our love for the book is because it has sat on our desks for so many years and is the first place we go to check something! 
 this book i read for information on spain was extremly USEFUL and had GOOD INFORMATION all about SPAIN! it had so many INTRESTING facts about SPAIN! YOU SHOULD SOOOOO READ THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO LEARN ABOUT SPAIN!!!! 
 Laurell K. Hamilton just keeps getting better and better.  I stumbled across this series from a friend talking about her work.  I started with the first of the series and have read everything in order, which is the best way.  Obsidian Butterfly is one of the more enjoyable ones of the series.  However, these should not be read by young readers as the sex is very plentiful and graphic.  I am hoping that her fairie series is just as great.  This is a MUST READ 
 If one of your favorite parts of Pulp Fiction was the time spent with Jules and Vincent, then these guys are going to crack you up.   They have lives (of a sort), they have women (maybe a few to many, maybe a few too few), and they have money. What they don't have is any common sense.   The story shows you how Melvin is struggeling to cope with his fiancee in one house and his mistress next door, his slacker co-workers (also professional hitmen), and a serious ulcer brough on because he really just doesn't want to "have anyone not like him". A likeable hitman? That seems a bit much.  But he is the one character you really do like. The action is great, the acting is great, the jokes are just two steps to far. I'm a big fan of stupid humor, I like clever one liners, I keep waiting to find enough of either to get me that last star and I just haven't found it yet 
 For those who are skeptical of just about anything coming from Llewellyn, I have to say that, if they continue to release EXTREMELY HIGH CALIBER material like Christopher Penczak's Temple of Witchcraft series, then they will fully redeem themselves as publishers.  Though I share the concerns of other reviewers about the lack of separation between sets of exercises on the CDs, after listening to several tracks I now believe that the exercises were recorded that way for a specific reason.  The series of meditations and visualizations, as recorded, afforded me a rich experience that has helped calm my mind and increase my focus within the first three days of receiving the set!  For example, after the initial relaxation and counting-down induction, the first "set" takes you through 3 (or four?) sets of simple visualization exercises.  Afterwards, he counts you up from the meditation state to full awareness and grounds you with a light chakra sweep and clearing affirmation.  Each segment begins and ends in the same calm, balanced and safe manner.  When I experienced the exercises for the first time, I appreciated that he didn't short-change the coming-back-to-awareness sequence at the end of each meditation, like some meditation recordings I've heard.  If you're considering the companion CDs along with the books,  I would consider this a required item to purchase along with the books.  Keep in mind, the CDs are a COMPANION to the books--they're not the audio version of the entire text, just the exercises, which comes in very handy if you don't want to have to work on your meditation trance while balancing the book on your lap.  Many, many, many blessings to Mr. Penczak for his excellent soothing voice, caring and warm reading, and the top-knotch level of the work on this CD and all his books.    Bright Blessings 
 This was a little over my 5 year old daughter's head. I think she needs to have a concept of where the states actually are before she will understand why they want to be scrambled up. This book will be great once she does. There is a lot going on on each page and the states feelings about their locations are really well thought out 
 Ayn Rand is one of recent history's most prominent defenders of the ideals - and as she would say, morality -  of capitalism and the free market.  For her it is not a question of wealth, but of individual rights that are protected only by a capitalist system and get trampled by socialism, communism and altuism. Rand's clear thinking is as important today as it has ever been in America's history.  It seems the wealthier our country becomes, the harder it is to remember and retain the basis, and the nobility, of the system that brought us that wealth.  Even within the reviews of this book there are cries against Wal-Mart and Exxon Mobil, but for what?  We are constantly fed the idea that they are bad, or malevolent entities, but how?  Wal-Mart provides low-cost items to  tens of millions of Americans and jobs to untold thousands and yet the story we hear is how the jobs aren't good enough or how local stores have been run out of business.  Who is forcing people to take those jobs?  Who stops shopping at the local stores when Wal-Mart comes to town?  By what right are people owed something more by Wal-Mart?  Exxon Mobil puts billions of dollars at risk searching for new energy reserves and for twenty years endured horrible energy prices set by the free market.  Now that prices have risen, thery're evil?  By what standard?  The fact that I preferred $1 gasoline doesn't make the company who provides my gasoline bad.  We need constant reminders of the good that business people and businesses do in our society without any charitable intent or giving.  Through their very actions and existence, they form the base that allows the rest of our country to function.  They cannot exist, however, without policies, freedoms and rights protected by the goverment.  That is why Rand's work continues to be critical to our future.  This book is intended as Rand's non-fiction compliment to the fictional "Atlas Shrugged."  I don't believe you need to read "Atlas Shrugged" to get a lot from this book and this is certainly a less time-consuming option.  Very highly recommended.  Please read this book and share it with your friends 
 "Helen" is the last play in this volume, and unlike the others is not a tragedy, but a satyr play.  This means that everyone doesn't die at the end, but the play is taken from a relatively happy mythological theme.  "Helen" departs from the Homeric tradition, because Euripides claims that Helen was never actually taken to Troy, but was left in Egypt by Paris when he came their, and a simulacrum of Helen went to Ilium.  Euripides has Menelaus and the fake Helen reach Egypt, where Helen is in danger of being taken as a wife by the new pharaoh.  After they have recognized each other, they try to use trickery to escape the land of the Nile and return to Sparta. Read this volume to find out how it happened 
 I THINK THAT THIS SOUNDTRACK WAS ONE THE BEST SOUNDTRACKS EVER RECORDED HANDS DOWN. I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS CD EVERYWHERE AND NOW THAT I'VE FINALLY FOUND IT,I'M NOT LETTING IT GO. 2-PAC,DOGG POUND,SNOOP,SWV,B-HOGG AND EVERYONE ON THE SOUNDTRACK WAS OFF THE HOOK.(BROUGHT BACK SOME FOND MEMORIES 
 WOW. Great remastered sound.  The 2nd CD has a great blend of remix (extended) songs and live versions.  As always great music.  
 This tries to research the mind of this evil person and how it became that way, and mainly explains it away with genetics!  It seemed to be more about his father - who was a "real piece of work."  So he inheirited his "mean streak a mile long" and added to it as he went along.  The only saving grace to a person of this horrible magnitude is to keep us on our toes against someone else coming amongst us and taking over like this scoundrel did.  So far as I know, people like him are incarcerated in Maximum Security Prisons in our country, and they are usually discovered earlier in life than Hitler was.  This book stops before he really gets into the Auschwitz mentality, etc.  I had not read Norman Mailer in a long time and found his writing interesting.  Mailer is in his 80's now and still writes engagingly.  I did not like the subject of the book much, but enjoyed the author's ability to keep me reading in spite of that.  
 As a member of KISS Eric Carr had the opportunity to play on albums that sold over ten million copies worldwide and to play to millions of fans on world tours in support of those albums.  In turn, KISS (Gene Simmons and  Paul Stanley) had the opportunity to work with a phenomenal drummer, AND a  very talented singer/songwriter.  They had the opportunity, but rarely took  use of it.  ROCKOLOGY shows just how much Gene and Paul missed the boat by  not fully utilizing the talents of a VERY popular member of their band.   "Eyes Of Love" is the best KISS song that never made it on to a  KISS album.  Recorded as a demo submitted for the HOT IN THE SHADE album,  "Eyes" showcases Eric's strong vocals and has a better chorus  hook than almost anything on HITS.  One huge opportunity missed - it could  have been a great single follow up to "Forever."   "Somebody's Waiting" is a great Heavy ballad; it's not wimpy, but  has a great melody and wonderful harmony vocals.  Another opportunity  missed.  A song recorded as a demo submitted for the CRAZY NIGHTS album  that should have been included on that album is "Mad Dog."   Featuring a couple of great riffs, and a strong vocal hook (although no  "real" lyrics - just a scat/guide vocal harmony track to write  lyrics to), "Mad Dog" would have been a standout track on an  album that desperately needed a kick-ass straight ahead Rock And Roll tune!   "Heavy Metal Baby" (just a working title, he never got around to  writing lyrics on this one either) is a mid-tempo down-tuned riff-heavy  song with a great sense of groove.  "HMB" could have been written  for REVENGE, but the notes don't say whether or not this was the case.   Regardless of whether or not it was written for REVENGE, it would have fit  right on that album - AND been one of the best tracks!  Another strong  track is "You Make Me Crazy," which takes its musical cues from  both Van Halen (think "Panama") and Bryan Adams (ditto -  "The Kids Wanna Rock").  Again, no lyrics but a strong vocal  melody and a killer set of riffs.  In fact, some of the songs were written  with Bryan Adams in mind, as Bruce Kulick (who plays all the guitars on the  album, and produced it as well) attests to in his notes for "Can You  Feel It?"  "CYFI" is a strong track that would have worked  well on HITS, as "Nightmare" would have as well.  "Nightmare  is another mid-tempo song with a great chorus hook. As an album ROCKOLOGY  is not as cohesive as it would have been had Eric recorded it with the  intention of these songs being released together as a solo album.  Since he  never got the chance to really work on a proper solo album, however, this  is all that can be expected.  Actually, it is much more than most fans DID  expect, since the existence of most of these recordings was not common  knowledge.  Kudos to Bruce Kulick for taking the time to getting these  songs as close to completion as possible.  A MUST for die-hard KISS fans,  and one to check out for the casual fans to find out what Eric was all  about

 Although I haven't finished this book I am very impressed with what I've read so far. This book would interest anyone who wants to know more about the early history of quilting without regard to the "color" of the quilter. The pictures show families during this time and their living conditions. I would recommend highly. I am eager to make some of the quilt squares offered here. 
  Ok.I HAVE NOT READ THIS BOOK.I hope that you don`t hurt my reviews for this,but in a way,I HAVE read this book.I am in this play,so I have read this script.And since the play is going to be on Saturday,(5th) and Sunday(6th) and also for the next weekend,I have to read this script over and over and over again.I think that this book is a very good book.In the play I am Miss Applebee but I think that this book is very good it must be 
 This is an excellent detective story.  Well written and characters are quite well developed.  An excellent read 
 This movie is hilarious and brilliantly done. For a while you even think it is a true story, even if you recognize the actors. The bottom line of this movie, though, is the message. When Zelig acts as a chameleon, when he blends in, he gets into trouble. It is only when he is himself that he finds true happiness and love. None of us should be afraid to be ourselves. Sometimes society makes us feel inadequate, but who cares what society thinks 
 I am surprised to read the harsh editiorial reviews as MY LITTLE GIRLS AND I JUST LOVE THIS BOOK. As avid readers of children's literature to my six children this book ranks up there with our favorites!  Not only does it validate that it is OK to have unique goals and interests which we may develop as adults which differ from those which parents have set for us as children, it does so without coming across as DISRESPECTFUL of the well intended parents. While it SAYS "ZORA Only listened to her mother" I think the irony of that statement is REALLY obvious to even little readers who don't miss the fact that ZORA became a writer and that it was indeed HER FATHER who insisted that she hone her academic skills and study her BIBLE daily which most certainly was as influential and formative in developing skills required for her later writing success as her mother's teaching. While Zora'a father is portrayed as teaching her in a structured and disciplined way SKILLS and LESSONS, Zora's mother is shown to have taught her to not be limited by expectations and rules imposed by others in her life but to actively seek out to learn new things.         I thought that while the statement "Zora only listened to her mother" did indeed benefit from  SOME EDITORIALIZING for small children which can be sticky,  that issue merits this story becoming a 4 star rather than 5 star one.  However at the same time, I FOUND IT REFRESHING that the fact parents AT TIMES are contradictory to children WAS SO HONESTLY PRESENTED IN A CHILDREN'S BOOK. How many kids have received opposing messages from each of their well intended parents? HOw many parents have themselves struggled with EACH OTHER over how to present their ideas which at times contradict?       HOW WONDERFUL for kids to have a book where they CAN IDENTIFY WITH THE MAIN CHARACTER who has to make her own way in the world BY ASSIMILATING WHAT HER PARENTS TAUGHT AND MAKING CHOICES REGARDING THE POINTS WHICH HER PARENTS DISAGREED AND PRESENTED OPPOSING IDEAS. AND HOW WONDERFUL for us parents to read of the brilliant success of ZORA and realize that our kids ALSO will likely be successful and capable DESPITE our errors and flaws of not always being COHESIVE and IN AGREEMENT in our parenting of our children! In this day and age where 50% of marriages end up in divorce, I think those seeming "flaws" of writing may at second glance be apprechiated as honest reflections of OURSELVES and valuable in assisting our CHILDREN in feeling comfortable knowing they are not the only ones who ever felt like that! ,      IT is POWERFUL to read of the overcoming SOCIETY'S OBSTACLES AND EXPECTATIONS BASED ON RACE  AND GENDER, as well as overcoming the unintended confusion we parents sometimes present to our children.    I felt the inclusion of the myth of DEATH was not at all confusing to young readers and indicated Zora's interest in folk lore at a young age which informed her later antropological work. I think for very young readers this myth gives them some explaination of how death took her mother as the personification of death makes it not seem like a mystery but offers explaination which is satisfying to them. (And not harmful regardless of ones beliefs and teaching regarding death, as young readers have such short attention spans they forget this detail as quickly as it takes for them to be entralled by the beautiful illustrations.)   Older readers are not likely to be at all confused by this inclusion of  storytelling that is represented as being a myth.   Overall I found this to book to be a beautiful one which my girls JUST LOVE as they identify with the dreamy climbing of trees and reaching out for the world in wonder.  
 Some of the negative reviews would have turned me off this book if I had read them first. I have enjoyed this book, the Vampire, Geall setting did not turn me off. Actually It was a nice change.  I enjoy contempory, historical, mystical and I guess Vampire. Yeah Nora for having more of a read than in some of your latest books 
 In a thorough, comprehensive manner, Bart D. Ehrman's _Truth and Fiction in the Da Vinci_ examines the historical claims made in Dan Brown's bestselling novel _The Da Vinci Code_.  Since Dan Brown himself asserts in his preface that the historical information concerning documents in _The Da Vinci Code_ is factually correct, Erhman's project is one that Brown's novel invites.  Under the scrutiny of a dispassionate scholar versed in the scholarship of the ancient texts, the historical foundations of _The Da Vinci Code_ prove to be specious, at best, and, at worst, completely inaccurate.  Ehrman's critique is gracefully written.  He is not concerned, as he says, "to give Dan Brown a grade on how well he did" but rather to help the reader in "separating the historical fact from the literary fiction."  Ehrman, in fact, credits works like _The Da Vinci Code_ and films like _The Passion of Christ_ and _The Last Temptation of Christ_, despite their inaccuracies, with inspiring people to explore history and religion deeper.  His caveat, however, is that readers not accept these works as history.  In his introduction, Ehrman discusses what critical history is: namely, a systematic study of the known available sources with an eye toward assessing their credibility.  Ehrman points out that just because a source exists that makes a specific claim this does not mean that the claim is historically accurate.  Instead, the evidence must be evaluated carefully in its own right and in terms of what other sources say.  Ehrman notes that history, unlike an empirical science, is "a matter of probabilities."  Weighing the claims made by characters in _The Da Vinci Code_ with the existing evidence, Ehrman proceeds to dissect the novel.  His deeply informative approach highlights the painstaking work of the historian in piecing together the distant past.            One of Ehrman's most important conclusions is that, contrary to the claims made in _The Da Vinci Code_, the four gospels in the New Testament are the most reliable, oldest sources for understanding the historical Jesus.  Ehrman also evalautes the non-canonical gospels and explains his criteria for assessing their historical accuracy in terms of four categories: "the earlier the better"; "piling on the testimonies"; "cutting against the grain"; and "context is (almost) everything."  Throughout, Ehrman paints a vivid picture of how critical history is written and, specifically, how he arrives at the conclusions he does.  He considers pagan sources, Jewish sources, Christian sources, and the canonical tradition (namely, the Bible as it appears to us today).  In addition, he provides an overview of the role of women in the early Church, acknowledging that women likely played a significant role in the early Church, but that early Christianity was not, as Dan Brown's characters' claim, a matriarchal church.     Ehrman confines himself to the early church and the historical Jesus, understood through a critical study of the known sources.  He does not discuss Dan Brown's treatment of Opus Dei, the Templars, or the Priory of Scion, nor does he explore the novel's claims about architecture, art, or Leonardo Da Vinci.  These topics are left to other specialists.  Instead, drawing in large measure from his own scholarship, including _Lost Christianities_, Ehrman offers a probing critique of Brown's novel as well as an engaging historical study.        For the reader intrigued by the ideas in _The Da Vinci Code_ or interested in early Christianity in general, Ehrman's book is a logical and rewarding place to begin. 
 I should have written this  years ago when I first got this recording.  I host a half-hour program of music for guitar called Silver Moonbeams on WHRO FM 90.3 in Norfolk VA.  I have all the Barrios recordings, and this is simply the best.  Antigoni Goni knows and loves this music.  Her timing and phrasing are superb.  Her touch on the instrument is light and just right.  In short, in my opinion, this is the very finest Barrios recording available.  Many guitarists are competent, a few are brilliant and just a handful play music for the Gods.  Antigoni Goni is definitely in the latter category 
 Nancy Anderson's unique book, Work with Passion, is unlike anything I've ever read. It's a one-of-a-kind, hands-on, practical approach to getting paid to do what comes naturally to you. This is not a job hunt book. It's about the process that takes you to knowing your life's work, what's enjoyable for you, the job or business that uses all of your talents and skills. Doing this work gives you deep personal satisfaction, and all the money you need.    Work with Passion is different from other career books because it connects the emotional and psychological intricacies of early family life to the subconscious blocks that inhibit  personal and financial success. I discovered this connection six years ago after I worked through the exercises in the book. I am still amazed by the transformation and changes that have occurred and are still occurring in my life since then. The process was slow and often painful, but it led me to freedom from the past. I've learned that the journey should be enjoyed because that's how you come to know yourself and what you love. The hardest part was letting go of what's familiar and trusting in the unknown. It's been a struggle to dissolve the myth that work should be drudgery, but three years ago I moved to Madrid, Spain and created my own business doing what I love most, language and communication coaching. The journey and process are still unfolding, but thanks to the work Nancy's book encouraged me to do, I'm at a place in my life that I had only dreamt of when I was younger.  
 ...but not a necessity for your Nickel Creek collection.  It's "cute" to hear Nickel Creek in their early days, and my daughter (4 yrs old) really enjoys this CD.  But I don't think I'll be throwing this one in when I need a Nickel Creek fix 
 	 Babe the Gallant Pig was taken away from his mother at an early age, and Mr. Hogget had won Babe at the fair in Topeka, Kansas.  Fly the sheepdog took care of Babe.  Babe wanted to be a sheep pig.  Fly assisted Babe to become a sheep pig.  One day Farmer Hogget took Babe and Fly down to the trials to view, but didn't show himself, Babe, or Fly.  Fly wondered what farmer Hogget was doing.  When they got home Farmer Hogget set up an obstacle course for Babe to work a few sheep through.  Now Fly knew what he was doing to enter Babe in the sheepdog trail.  Fly worried because at home they had sheep that Babe knew, but at the trials there were different sheep.  Fly went to the sheep and for the first time ever Fly had talked nicely to the sheep and they had listened.  Now she talks to them about Babe.  When she asked them they said, " Password." 	"What's the password?" Fly asked. 	"I may be ewe, I may be ram, I may be mutton, I may be lamb, but on the hook or on the     hoof I ain't as stupid as I look," the sheep said.  When Fly told Babe to memorize it he asked why.  Fly said, " Just memorize it."  One morning Fly woke Babe up and said, " Today's the day!"  	"What day?" asked Babe.  	 " The sheepdog trials!" said Fly excitedly.  Will Babe win?  Read and find out.  I recommend this book because it is suspenseful and exciting.  
  French director Louis Malle made in this one, in my opinion, his greatest work.  Briefly -and mainly- this is the story of two kids in a catholic school during the German occupation of France.  As always, different critics will pick up those themes that most interest him. To me this was a film about   a) Childhood cruelty, b) Coming of age  c) Social classes (as noted from the environment of a school) d) and religion  Not in any particular order but all very interrelated. Also, I'd like to point out some interesting notes that caught my eye: the education environment. The relation between kids themselves, and the kids and their teachers. I was specially interested (because of the contrast with today's US) in the quality of education that was taught in France, in the spirit of discipline, respect, hard word... the underlining importance -as usual in French films- of books. Sure the French kids could be as "naughty" as US kids, but at least they would read Jules Verne or Arabian Nights. What do US kids read? That's right, nothing. They don't know Melville, Steinbeck, Jack London, Robert L. Stevenson. In US public schools kids don't read anything. They have the maid-teachers read for them. They still write on lined paper in college because they wouldn't be able to write straight (!!).  A work of art, even more because it is not an easy-to-tell story, this one. And time practically flies while watching it. I suggest showing it to your nearest specimen of teenager. If he stands the whole movie, he is probably a happy private school kid or a miserable public shool underachiever. If he stands ten minutes only, he can still live to be a senator or even President. If he runs away at the beginning he is probably a "normal" kid. (And, unfortunately, the same applies to their parents).  A wonderful film 
 When I started this book, I figured I'd hihglight Ms.Murphy's best pointers for taking real estate business from traditional marketing forms to easy e-listing and website applications. Turns out, I practically highlighted the entire book! What a wealth of step-by-step action for even the beginner Internet user . . . and a veritable encyclopedia of the most creative innovations she and Realtors around the world are already using. I'm convinced this is the only way Realtors will continue to profitably exist - and all the answers to that existence are right here 
 My husband and I are adopting a toddler from our state's foster care system and I looked everywhere for a book that included adopting out of foster care. It seems like all the adoption books out there are outdated and geared towards the international or domestic infant adoptive parents and I could not find one that encompassed are adoption scenario. I was extremely excited to find this book-Christian to boot!-had just come out. It is very thorough for EVERY situation-even going into parenting after the child arrives home in each given adoption type.  I absolutely loved the brief testimonies, bible quotes, and quick facts that were upbeat and comforting. There are sample letters for fundraising, for caretakers/birthparents, family-even a sample letter for an adoption announcement to send to families. There are relevant websites, local/state/country contact information, support group listings, etc I was actually relieved and comforted by the section on how to afford adoption and the differant subsidies, grants, tax credits, and loans available. This book is so easy to read-not at all intimidating and is invaluable in it's Christian perspective.  I could not believe how much foster care adoption information and tips were available!  Whole-heartedly recommend this book to anyone looking for wisdom, comfort, and answers 
  I watched Disney's animated THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989) in one nasty, angry mood.  Within twenty minutes, I was feeling happy, caught in the spell of a strong story, gorgeous animation, and lively Oscar-winning songs.  The magic of Disney for kids of all ages permeates this story of Ariel, the likeable mermaid who falls in love with a human.  If she can go without her lovely voice for three days and still get the handsome prince to kiss her, she is a human for life.  The catch is that she can never again see her aquatic friends, like her king father and Sebastian the hilarious crab comic relief who almost gets eaten!  The central villainess is one of my all-time favorites, Ursula the sea witch, evil enough for adults and not too scary for kids.  She has stolen Ariel's lilting voice.  The story is taken from Hans Christian Andersen, but with a downbeat ending radically rethought in Disney fashion.  But I have a hunch the Andersen literary circle would approve of  the changes in making this a wonderful family film.  The voice work is perfection, including Jodi Benson as Ariel and Pat Carroll as Ursula.  Alan Menken and Howard Ashman collaborated on the songs; "Under the Sea" won a deserved Oscar, but I like "Part of Your World" and the hilarious "Kiss the Girl" also.  	The new double-disk DVD of THE LITTLE MERMAID is an absolute must-own, and not just for families with children.  If you are a child at heart, like me, you will treasure it.  And Disney Studios has restored the heck out of it--the colors are gorgeous, the image clarity is flawless, and the remastered soundtrack does justice to the music.  The 83 minute movie is on disk one, at its correct 1.78 moderate wide-screen aspect ratio, along with an audio commentary, should you decide (I did not) to listen to the co-writers and co-directors talk about the movie.  (They do enough of that on disk two.)  Also on disk one are a trailer for LITTLE MERMAID III (straight to video, probably a wise business decision) and a "Kiss the Girl" music video.  There is also a feature that lets you go to a particular song, a popular feature on a movie with these songs and an Oscar-winning music score.  	Disk two is mammoth, a good three hours.  I went to bed at midnight with the whole games section untouched.  There are 45 minutes of deleted scenes with commentary on what we are watching and why they were cut out.  There is another 45 minutes that goes behind the scenes at Disney Studios in 1989 at a time of great business upheaval to create the mood that this happy and romantic film was made under.  We also get a nine minute segment on animated special effects, like sea storms.  Disney was apparently thinking of doing THE LITTLE MERMAID back in 1941, but changed his mind and thankfully made DUMBO instead.  Or was it PINOCCHIO?  THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL is a lovely and sad animated short adaptation of another Andersen story, an exquisite bonus.  There are also LITTLE MERMAID art galleries and the original theatrical trailer.  	I still have Games and Activities to do, so I am not sure what to expect.  I gather that Disney was going to do a LITTLE MERMAID ride at Disneyland or Disney World, but changed their minds.  There is something called "UNDER THE SEA: A Virtual Ride" and a live-action segment on life under the sea.  It's an incredible two-disk DVD, and I have a hunch it belongs in every household.  Maybe even two copies--Disney is threatening to put this title back in the vaults for seven more years, and your kids may wear out one copy before seven years is up.  THE LITTLE MERMAID is not quite a Walt Disney immortal animated classic for me, but give it another decade and it might be.  For the time being, it is a fabulous way to spend a long evening with your kids.  Or even alone in a night bedroom.  
 Mortimer's book is well written and very interesting. He does a great job of weaving in enough anecdotes to make the historical figures come to life and, unlike some historical authors, saves the discussions of source material for the footnoes. He also does a convincing job of putting forth his theory about Edward II's life 
 This is an ideal reference book for just about every options strategy I could ever think of. Compared with other options texts I have read, this definitely comes under the heading of "Reference Books".  I can imagine that this must have been a very ambitious project as every effort has been made to make the book user-friendly and as interactive as a book could  possibly be.  By this I specifically mean the layout, the liberal use of diagrams (especially good for explaining the Greeks) and even the use of the simple (and sometimes humorous) icons (the stages of evolution are used for each strategy's level of appropriateness for your level of trading experience - the monkey icon for beginners I found amusing!).   At the end there is a chapter on taxation for options traders, which gives a useful introduction to that particular minefield - at least I understand now why my accountant charges me so much for my annual trading audit!   All in all a great book that gets to the point and gave me exactly what I wanted, and therefore highly recommended.   
 I dont know what the fuss is wether the fans will be accepting to The Killers new sound and look, I for one love it! By the 3rd time i heard the album, i knew there was no way i'd be able to stop listening to it for a very long time, just like Hot Fuss. The songs are great, the hooks are awesome and its so polished to perfection. 
 Frantz Fanon was a contemporary writer of the 1950's.  Born in Martinique, he studied psychiatry and medicine in France as a young man after volunteering his services in World War II.  He had an educational background in post colonial studies including racism and colonization.  At the age of 27 he published "Black Skin, White Masks" which played a vital role in civil rights and Black consciousness movements throughout its time. Fanon's analysis of the Black psyche, "Black Skin, White Masks", was amazingly interesting and educational.  It gave me a fresh perspective to what it means to live as the minority, as a person of color in a White world.  This is a wonderful review of how the French of different backgrounds interacted with each other.  There are also a few downfalls in understanding "Black Skin, White Masks".  This book is hard to follow because it jumps around quite a bit, making various points throughout the same train of thought. There are many topics covered, one of the most thoroughly explored being romantic love between interracial couples. It also explores the use of language and the importance of knowing one's familial, racial, and cultural history. 	One of the topics Fanon concentrates on is the Black man and his goals in life.  To understand what Black men go through, one has to first understand the history of the particular Black man he is talking about which is born in an island off of France then moves to France and faces the culture shock of entering a country where the language and customs are different.  Here the Black man goes from being comfortable and part of a larger entity to being the minority.  At this stage the Black man feels he is worthless because of the history of the relationship of Blacks and Whites, where the Black man has led a forced life of servitude and abuse which has caused him to believe that he is inferior to the White man.  The White man's racism has created the White man's feeling of superiority which correlates with the Black man's feeling of inferiority.  Because of this inferiority complex the Black man has an overpowering need to prove himself equal to the White man.  Fanon goes on to argue that the Black man's goal is to prove to Whites, Blacks and himself that he is an intelligent, good, and worthy of pursuing happiness individual.  One of the most detailed examples was how the Black man attempts to get closer to being White by having any relationship, be it friendship or romantic (preferably sexual), with a White person other than a master/slave association.  As an example Fanon tells a story of a young mulatto woman who marries a White man and in a split second goes from being the slave to being the master. Yet there are other cases when the Black man succeeds and he is not only rejected by Whites, he is repudiated by Blacks. 	Another theme was that of language and what happens to a Black person when he arrives to France.  The Black man has to learn how to speak French as it is spoken in France in order to become "whiter", for example, an educated Black man is no longer seen as Black because Blacks are savages while the intellectual is civilized.  Yet there have been many cases where despite the success of the Black man, Whites refuse to accept them as equals and show it by speaking to them in pidgin or as children.  There is also the struggle of remaining part of the Black community after assimilating into the White world.  After learning to speak French, he returns home as white in the eyes of other Black people.  The Black man must be able to code change in order to survive in both worlds.   	Antillean education is looked at carefully in this book.  Fanon compares the children of France with those of Martinique.  As French children learn about their culture and their ancestors, Martinique children learn of the ancestors of others.  Fanon proposes that the Black Martinique children should learn about Black history as a separate section in order to build self esteem and confidence.  Children need to learn that there have been others in similar situations that have pulled through and made it despite discrimination and hate.  If the educational system increases the Martinique children's knowledge and understanding of their own heritage and history, they will be able to make connections with their own ancestors and their amazing accomplishments.  This would thus curb ideas of inferiority. 	There was a contrast between Blacks and Whites that kept the world as it was.  In order for there to be white, there has to be black.  In order for there to be a slave there has to be a master.  In order for one group of peoples to be superior another group has to be inferior, and this is the case with Whites and Blacks.  As a result, whatever one group is the other is the opposite.  Here arise a series of stereotypes that support how people think of these two groups.  Whites are intelligent, progressive, civil people while Blacks are primitive savages in need of taming.  Since Blacks are savages they cannot control their emotional and sexual needs hence in contrast Whites are not sexual and have the ability to suppress their emotions. From this Fanon argues that a subtle jealousy was born; the White man envied the Black man's sexual freedom.   	As I read this book I could not help but think of my students and how they embody many of the same believes as Black men in the 1950's.  The children I teach Mathematics to are people of color, either Latino or Black.  I spend much of my day listening to them speak among themselves about various topics and have picked up on certain ideas that reflect that of past colonized populations.  Although there is this total rejection of anything and everything that is White, there is also an underlining want to be White (perhaps mainstream is a better word).  For example, I have heard my students discuss accents and the implication that those who have one are in some way less intelligent than those who speak like Americans.  Students have also expressed in happiness that they do not speak their parent's native tongue, typically Spanish, which is an indication that they are closer to being white than those who's first language is not English.  Another disturbing behavior I have noticed is the animosity towards Whites.  It seems my students have been programmed to be hostile towards White people, especially peers.  They constantly refer to Whites in derogatory terms; for example, when one of my mentors (an older White woman) spend a period in my classroom the students were flustered and after she left referred to her as "the white b*$^%" as opposed to "the lady who was just here".  At the same time they insult each other by using terms that are associated with being Black such as insulting the wideness of their nose and/or thickness of their lips.  I find this to be an interesting contradiction and would like to explore it further in hopes of understanding the contemporary adolescent. 	As a teacher I found this book to be very helpful in understanding why our children of color behave the way they do and why they consistently fail in a system designed for children who are not exposed to the gruesome situations the students in the South Bronx (where I teach) go through on a daily basis.  These children could very well have an inferiority complex which they will have to overcome before being able to succeed in this White man's world.  
 Very deep and thorough investigation has been undergone by Earl Doherty.  If only Christian apologits wanted to read the book, they woould admit that for 2000 years the humankind has been a prey to the greatest falsification in the human history!     
 Albers is a color genius, and although I personally incorporate several color theorists into my decision making in color or color theory practices. Albers has an easy approach to understanding color 
 There should be a warning on this book's cover - Not to be read by teenage boys or men approaching mid-life crisis.  A book which I always thought somehow defined the sixties, even though it takes place in the late forties, seizes on wanderlust, angst and the secret desire in all of us to live a vagabond life, free of care; a life of exuberance, intensity and passion.  Of course there is a dark side to all this, as Sal Paradise, the novel's semi-autobiographical protagonist discovers, but even the dark side is viewed with such verve and spirit that it doesn't seem all that bleak. Kerouac's writing style, while undefinable, seems to me to have the vigor of Hemingway, the earthiness of Steinbach and the sheer exuberance of Walt Whittman all roled into one.     The novel, apparently written on a continuous role of paper 120 pages long, during a two week blitz, describes Sal's journeys across America and his interactions with the people that come into his life along the way.  While his lifestyle is definitely not something you want to emulate on the way to a Harvard education, its wildness and carefree (some might say hedonistic) ways will stir the spirit of adventure in even the most rational of hearts.  Sal hitchhikes, rides buses, pays for rides and steals cars - actually, his idol, Dean Moriarty does the stealing -  and criss-crosses the country several times. Most of his travels involve the West but a side-trip to New Orleans and a final excursion to Mexico city are also included.  Along the way he drinks, gets high, encounters a wide variety of women and generally lives a life of dissipation and dissolution.  Sal's zest for life's experiences is somewhat tempered by an undercurrent of doubt.  Characters are gritty and  full of life but often terribly flawed.  There is a subtle ambiguity which colours Sal's view of the world.  He is at once in love with life but often seems vaguely disturbed by it.     A friend once told me that it was a good thing that troubled souls wrote about their experiences.  That way we could experience things without having to live them too. Sal's travels are something like that: Best experienced second hand - unless, of course, you too are a troubled soul.        
 This series of parenting books which begin with "Your One Year Old" and go all the way up to "Your Ten to Fourteen Year Old" I have found to be most helpful to parents in 25 years of teaching preschoolers. A lot of the sitautions are quite dated but the basic developmental information is all there and still relevant 
 One thing I love about greatest hits packages from groups with only one legitimate hit is that you never grow tired of them. Timbuk 3's greatest hits package is a good place to start enjoying their music and you will not  get tired of hearing songs you've heard a million times on the radio. If  you want more info on the band seach the web because there is a least one  great web site. After buying this CD and the live one you will have to  seach the used bins and I highly recommend the album Eden Alley 
 Tolstoy is just powerful...with his words. He talks about everything, describes every aspect of the surrounding down to the very last intricate detail. The result? An extremely enthralling and moving book. Apart from the widely discussed infidelity and love themes, this book manages to transport the reader to Russia in the 19th century, and to blend into the background whilst Anna and Vronsky's sordid affair takes place. The translation was wonderful; it is hard to believe that this isn't the original. I did however, wish I knew Russian so I could experience Tolstoy's actual work.   I loved this book. I read it long before Oprah decided to add it to her book club, and so I have the Oxford Classics edition, which isn't as nice to look at and the translation is slightly different. This however, does not influence the book's distinction as one of greatest novels ever written 
 I have followed this cookbooks recommendations since 1983.  My son is ADHD and my husband always said if you can't read it don't eat it.  It definitely made a differnce in my sons actions and he is now graduating from college and we all still eat much healthier than we would have.  The recipes in this cookbook are delicious and I would like to give atleast two of these for Christmas presents and I need one l for myself since whoever borrowed it never returned it to me. They must of liked it too 
 This book is perefect if you're looking for great color photos and interesting facts about all makes and models of american muscle cars. It covers Chevy, Ford, Mercury, Dodge, Plymouth, Oldsmobile, Buick, Pontiac, and AMC.  Covers everything from the early sixties up till the early seventies.  There's even a little info on later muscle like the Buick Grand Nationals of the 80's.  The one thing this book lacks is technical data.  It won't help you with restoration info, but it's perfect for armchair musclecar enthusiasts 
 I find Roger Ebert's reviews an indespensible resource for ordering video rentals. He'll always give you a good, well written summary and review of any recent movies you're interested in. This latest '07 edition matches the excellence you've come to expect in this series 
 I never watched Friends, until it was in rerun syndication. I have never seen the final episode of the first season until watching this dvd. I now must get the dvd for season two because I am quite sure that I never saw the first episode of season two as season one ends on a fairly big cliffhanger. Friends is probably the best comedy serial that was on television. At least IMHO. I have to watch the reruns whenever I can 
 This book fills a gap in the mental health field; the many books out on depression have not been a good fit for those struggling with dysthymia. Beating the Blues speaks to those who have been managing to function, but missing out on pleasure and full productivity. Easy to read and apply, the information and  techniques shared in this book can change lives. I have shared it with both teens and adults-members of both age groups connected quickly with the book, feeling that it captured what they were experiencing.  Both teens and adults benefited from a deeper understanding of how dysthymia was impacting their lives, and had success with the strategies for change. I recommend having a few copies around since you will inevitably want to lend some out. 
 I found Lewis's book very ordinary in terms of its theme but still enjoyable. I liked her writing because it was simple and easy to understand. Her narrative is not one of those that require the reader to  exert themselves to understand everything fully. It's a story of two  sisters, a mother and her two children, her relationship with a mysterious  guy, and her relationship with her ex-husband. It's funny at times and a  good read 
 Having reduced from a 34E to a 34C, this bra gives me NO BOUNCE comfort, without looking like a uni-boob.  Great for high impact running.  I am very satisfied, worth the money---thanks 
 The title captures the essence of the book. Albom does and excellent job of weaving a meaninful story around this premise. This book will challenge you to examine your own life, and possibly change how you interact with other people. I was so moved, I bought an additional copy for a friend 
 Reading this superb book by James Sundquist will unlock the gate to understanding the purpose driven church movement ongoing by Rick Warren. It is exquisitely written, thorough, clear and concise. He walks you through the purpose driven life chapter by chapter and relates very well how it is biblically inaccurate and obscures the gospel. If you don't understand what is wrong with your church or our churches in general this book is for you. If you do understand what the purpose driven church movement is all about, this book will enhance your understanding. I cannot recommend James Sundquist' book, Who's Driving the Purpose Driven Church? to you highly enough. 
 This is a very good book.  Very inspiring.  Langley is successfull in making a very human Sandy Weill 
 I love the music selection and it is a pleasure to listen to 
 This book is a deviation from the author's usual books about complex cosmological issues. The Discovery of Subatomic Particles is accessible to anyone, an easy read revealing much about scientific method.  It's more a history of how scientists and physicists with rather rudimentary tools devised innovative ways to probe and measure atomic particles with surprisingly accurate results.  This book will be appreciated by the mechanically inclined.  For the mathematically inclined, you will see in the appendices calculations developed in such a way that requires only a basic background in algebra to understand.  The author guides the reader through the history of processes that refined our understanding of the subatomic world.  The subject matter is covered in a logical timeline progression and consistent format.  Quantum theory is outside the scope of this book, but Niels Bohr is included in the history for using some of the discoveries to formulate his view of electron dynamics.  The reader will gain a higher appreciation of how much can be measured and discovered using the basic tools and instruments available at a given level of scientific development.  Extensive appendices amount to a concise development of fundamental physics, itself creating much value owning this book.  My favorite appendix has the author describing how much of Rutherford's formula for the scattering of alpha particles can be derived through simple dimensional analysis, continuing the historic application of  basic tools to analyze, measure, and discover subatomic particles.  The appendices give the technical details supporting much of the scientific development described so well in the main text.  Steven Weinberg's book, The Discovery of Subatomic Particles, is an easy read that can be appreciated by anyone 
 This is THE book for training your dog in my opinion. We have a very stubborn Beagle puppy who was showing many signs of thinking she was the alpha dog. After reading this book and applying the simple principles we have a changed dog! She is calm and responsive. We were at our wit's end and our obedience trainer recommended this book and it has been fabulous. I would recommend reading this book before you ever put a foot in a breeder's kennel. It will help you so much. It does work for older dogs too, so if nothing else has worked...try this book! This woman is a genius 
 I swear by the Betty Crocker Cookbook. I got mine before I got married (over five years ago), and I am always referring to it for tips, techniques and everyday recipes that you can't find in ordinary books/magazines. I kinda want a new one now 'cause it's even more detailed (I have the 9th Edition). Highly recommend it 
 Disney has released certain evidence that a new "Masterpiece Edition" of this timeless classic should be expected somewhere in 2007, whether it is a single or 2-disc edition is not known yet, but being a "Masterpiece Edition" in the likes of the 2004 Alice in Wonderland DVD re-release, it's quite possible that The Rescuers will too see a two disc set!  I'm so excited, I can't wait, it was well about time.  Like I said, don't waste your money on this poor standard edition, the print looks horrible, the colors are dark, murky and unbalanced, nothing like they are supposed to look like and the sound is nothing extravagant.  2007 
 When I first got this dvd I got it strictly for the price.  I had bought the 10 minute solution DVD with Michelle teaching and because I had been teaching aerobics for 10 years I wasn't too impressed so when I saw that she was teaching it I almost didn't buy it.  BUT I AM SO GLAD I DID!!!  How much of a better instructor is Michelle when she has people to instruct not just a camera lens.  I loved everything about this dvd. The lenghth of time, the intensity, the fact that you don't need a lot of room (I live in a small NYC apt) and more importantly how much I sweat for only 30 minutes of exercise.  I love buying exercise videos but I find that they are getting shorter and shorter.  They used to be 70 mintues long (Jane Fonda!!!) then the went down to 60 then 30 then 15 then 10 and now 8!!!  What happened???  Do people really not have that much time anymore??  I have to do like 3 dvds in a row to simulate what I used to do for 45 minutes to an hour in a gym aerobics class the intensity is just not there anymore.  But this dvd is great because it has intensity of your choice no less and my heart rate is up there as if I am doing a step class work out.  Thank you prevention I am going to check Amazon right now and buy all the rest of the series. 
 I was skeptical at first, but after reading it I found the universal truths explored by Carter-Scott to be life changing!  A friend of mine loved her LIFE is a game book and I am glad I gave this one a try.  It's deeper than most "self-help" books but really struck a nerve in me.  It makes a great book to pass on to friends or to give to newlyweds.  Now I'll read the Life is a Game book and review that one too 
 when you buy a house cd.. u expect perfection.. and most of the times.. you are disappointed.. i've experimented with everything.. from sander kleinberg's flawed 'everybody too' to steve lawler's dark tribal classic 'nubreed'.. but trust me on this. this cd, by house music standards.. is fantastic..  it starts off on a low tone.. but suddenly fades into 'music play' by DJ nukem. this is the part when u know tht this cd is not going to disappoint.. my favs. on the first cd are music play,marscarter, hungry(satoshi tomiie mix) and burden by kaz.. but the highlight on cd1 is the part when 'hungry' fades into 'burden'.. flawless mixing.. wont really give this cd 5 stars.. but 4..  cd2 is mindblowing.. worth the money i spent on the entire set.. superb.. the first 3 mins. of a 'lesser man' might keep you wondering wht's next.. but when the song hits the 4th minute mark and when the beautiful tune fades in, backed by awesome vocals(short and sweet).. you'll be in awe.. trust me.. then of course.. u have songs like 'visible noise','you gotta believe','strange world' and of course.. .the beautiful finale.. 'tell you' remixed by max graham..  released in 2002.. you might think of letting it pass.. just because nowadays people want the latest stuff.. i've always wanted the latest stuff.. and i've always been disappointed..but if you're a house music fan..like me. you'll be making the biggest mistake by passing out on this cd.. the opener on the 2nd cd, 'lesser man' is reason enough for you to go to your closest cd shop and buy this cd...!! 
 FANTASTIC TOO !!! W 3eb !!! The Second Album is VERY GREAT !! 
 This Emmy-winning film is visually beautiful and moving, and also very accurate historically. Like the boy in the movie, a real-life young boy named Gerhard von Breuning enjoyed a special relationship with the composer while residing nearby. As an adult, von Breuning wrote about his experiences in a book titled after the name of Beethoven's building, Aus dem Schwarzspanierhaus. The talented actor who plays Beethoven (Neil Munro) looks remarkably like pictures of Beethoven from this period in his life. Much of the dialogue is drawn from Beethoven's own letters, conversation books, and other writings, and most of the action really took place. The musical score includes performances of Beethoven's masterpieces by some of the best international performers. This is one of my favorite DVDs, and very popular with friends to whom I have lent it. Highly recommended 
 Unfortunately no stranger to intense grief, I marveled at the author's capacity to touch my spirit.  In the midst of Sophie's pain, I was often chuckling with the author's perspective, biting my lip with consternation, or cheering for small victories.  (Lolly Winston crawls inside your skin and won't come out until the book is complete.... yet leaves a haunting voice. 
 Dear Reb Yitzhak:  I am grateful to you for your book "The Light and Fire of the Baal Shem Tov".  It has the positive, earth-loving, spirit-transcending feeling that I always intuitively connected with the Baal Shem Tov.  Your book made me HAPPY and lifts my spirit up.  Thank you for the richness you are giving the Jewish people through your work 
 The best medieval holiday music yet!  A trip through time, and so well done.  I have listened to many others, and this one rates the best!  I am looking forward to their next release 
 Bought the book for a class and have already given one copy as a gift and recommended the book to several others in leadership positions.  Great read for leaders in any type organization.  As a matter of fact, if you can motivate your people in a "for-profit" organization the way Drucker speaks of in this book, you can't help but be successful 
 Two old war horses moving past their prime, one a disalusioned u-boat commander, the other a former merchant marine skipper now commanding a destroyer escort, come up against each other in the atlantic. In their efforts to outsmart and kill each other, they earn each other's respect, ending in friendship after a spectaculer climax.  Extremely well done. Great drama. Respectful of both sides.  
   This is a marvelous history book which I enjoyed a lot.  Besides,it is beautifully written and never dull.  By reading this book, I was able to fathom America's economic might.  Amid praise, I have to say that I object certain comments made throughout the book by Mr. Gordon because, more than fact, they seem to convey his bias as a deeply conservative thinker.  Nevertheless, the story that evolves through the pages of this book is truly an epic.  This book manages to be informative and entertaining at the same time.  The book itself is easy to read (close to double space between lines) and has a handsome cover.  I am looking forward to read other books authored by Mr. Gordon. 
 The Soul Of Southern Cooking is a wonderful combination of recipes and stories that evoke a time when black families had to make-do in the midst of hard times, yet were able to develop and enjoy a variety of delicious meals with a culinary tradition popularly referred to as "soul food". From Homemade Hog Head Souse; Neckbone and Macaroni Stew; Delta Fried Catfish; and Sunday's Fried Corn; to Boiled Chicken Feet and Legs; Stovetop Roast Beef; Celery Seed Dressing; Ten-Minute Oven Pecan Brittle; and Mrs. Hunter's Southern Tea Cakes, The Soul Of Southern Cooking fully lives up to its title and will prove a welcome and unique addition to the family cookbook collection 
 I had to do a paper for university on Ecovillages. What a blessing when i found this book at the library! It's just perfekt, I wanted to translate everything and not change a word. It gives a good overvieuw of the movement and shows examples of ecovillages around the world. There are also some interviews whith key people! GREAT GREAT stuff.  It made me want to take a plane and go and live in one of those places right away... I'm seriously considering it! 
 What a charming book. I picked it up in a bricks-n-mortar retailer who shall remain unnamed... then slammed it down before I let my fingerprints mar the surface and be forced to take out a loan to pay for it. I would recommend purchasing the book, chock full of informative, helpful, and timely advice-lets here and saving a pretty penny, though. It's not like I wanted to buy the store... just this excellent tome of digital wit that will help the user navigate the recesses of Al Gore's Internet (does he have that phrase copyrighted yet?) and remain out of prison and without "severe monetary penalties" (or, more succinctly, consequences and repercussions) 
 The first time I read this book was at the age of 13. My mother had an old, worn, 1950s copy of the book on our bookshelf, and one day I just decided to give it a try. I think the first 50 pages were a bit of a mystery to me. I remember struggling with the language at the beginning, and having to look up several words in the dictionary. After 100 pages, I had finally "learnt the language," and managed to at last translate it into my native tongue. I enjoyed it, and over the years I returned to it again and again. Now, at the age of 35, I practically have numerous passages memorized, and reading the book is no longer a culture shock. Every word of this novel is an old friend, and I wouldn't remove a single one from the text. This is the book I turn to when I'm in the mood to read, but not in the mood to read something new.  Every time I read it, I am struck by its relevance. I don't mean the morals or the need to marry well in order to win approval from society (although I think we still see a little of that to this day). I refer to the characters. Their personalities and basic code of principals are timeless. I can identify with every single character in this novel. When Lizzy and Mr. Darcy fell in love, their courtship could have taken place anywhere and at any point in time. That is why her novels are so well adapted into modern films.  You cannot possibly do wrong by reading this novel 
 This has got to be one of my favorite new albums out right now.  I bought this a few weeks ago in NYC mostly based on the reviews comparing Feeder to Coldplay.  The comparison isin't entirely accurate.  But right now it seems everyone coming out who's British is being compared to Coldplay.   Feeder still sounds like Feeder but they've expanded their music as well as their lyrics.  One of the best tracks is track #3. It has Dougie Payne and Fran Healy of Travis doing background vocals.  It's simply awesome.  If you want a great record to hold you over until the new Coldplay and Travis, then get this.  But please, everybody stop comparing everyone to Coldplay!  Give these guys their own credit 
 Although there are tremendous similarities to the Sebastian Junger's Perfect Storm masterpiece (the geographical area in which the story takes place), this is not the Perfect Storm.  It's a great book which I absolutely could not put down!  I live in Beverly, MA which is near where some of the big events in the book take place and it so happened that as I was reading the book, my wife had me drop by a yard sale at the Coast Guard housing in Beverly.  What a wonderful book and one which transmits to the reader quickly and artfully the tremendous power of the sea!  
 This book traces the origin of the modern day "blood quantum" for tribal membership to european origins, not native american origins. Very well researched and presented in an intelligent readable manner. 
 Paul Stiles wrote a book that has made me really think about how the market rules our lives.  His book combines urban planning concepts with some sage advice on what makes a "quality of life" or lack of.  Local, State, and National politicians would be wise to explore the concepts in Paul's book.    Work is not everything and families lives are deeply affected by "the Market".  Many parents, exhausted from long commutes because of market "planned" communities, causing horrible traffic gridlock, do not get to spend enough time with their families on a day-to-day basis.  Streets that don't cut through to other roads cause massive traffic jams.  Yes, it is nice to have your own suburban oasis with dead-end streets and courts, but getting out of typical neighborhoods in the morning commute can be hell because of the ridiculous urban planning, planned largely by developers maximizing their income.   Because of the expense of living in the U.S. - wildly inflated housing prices, out of control medical insurance and health care costs, the market has made it nearly impossible in many areas for a Mom to stay at home with her kids.  This is important in the first years of a child's life, of course.  Part of the expense is artificial with prices being jacked up due to the "encouragement" and self-fulfilling prophecy of the market getting Mothers to work.  Many mothers have to work - leaving little kids raised by day-care or neglect, if they can't afford adequate day-care. Even when kids get older, it is nice to have a parent around when they get home from school and today's artificial price inflation in "making a living" has made it impossible for most families to have a "stay at home" parent.  From visiting Europe and Israel, I can see how citizens there have national health insurance and private physicians to supplement their insurance, if they have the money.   In the U.S., we have mainly private health insurance and if you lose your job you won't have health insurance and even some jobs cannot give their employees health insurance due to rising costs.   In U.S., we have expensive fresh baked bread with no preservatives or chemicals, and for much of the U.S., the fruits, vegetables, cheese are fairly expensive, for the best quality.  But, we have cheap meat, chicken, pork in the U.S. In Europe and Israel it is the opposite - cheap top quality bread, fruit, vegetables, and dairly products are usually easily available to the typical consumer.  The citizens overseas don't have to spend $4.00+ for a decent loaf of freshly baked bread.  I have enjoyed the pedestrian-friendly very interesting towns in Europe and Israel.   We have our comparable planned communities in the D.C. area and U.S. that attempt to emulate European towns, which were what old U.S. towns were like before suburban hell!    But, one has to fight traffic way too much and some of the areas are hopeless with endless homes, too few roads, boring blandness.  The list of market ruling our lives in the U.S. goes on and on - overseas there is a more efficient and cheap bus and train network to get around.  In the U.S., not so in many areas.  The car is king in the U.S. and of course, that is what gives us a big advantage over Europe and Israel with the freedom personal automobiles give us in the U.S.  But, for daily urban and suburban commuting, more and efficient public transportation would increase the quality of life for the typical worker, quite a bit.  Radio stations used to be more community-oriented, featuring music and programming geared towards the taste of local residents.  Now, most radio stations in the U.S. have been taken over by large companies and the market has ruined most radio programming with bland, cookie-cutter radio shows and top-40 music.  Switch from one station to another and there is a depressing dullness and sameness.  Innovative musicians and bands are rarely heard.  The same music is played over and over again for years on end.  Experimentation in music and radio programming, in general, is discouraged because of the need to maximize profits.  I thought that radio stations were supposed to be for the "good of the people".  This is another example of the "the Market" taking over something that was previously for the public benefit - radio stations. The Market has made it necessary for radio listeners to purchase private radio station broadcasting, such as XM, to get the satisfaction they used to have for free.  Many things in the U.S. are becoming slaves to "the Market".    The U.S. is such a wealthy nation, that the above problems could be easily solved if the will of the people, politicians, and urban planners were enlightened.   "Is the American Dream Killing You?" is an excellent education towards this goal.  
 A tribute by Pastor Walker and his famous choir for those who lost their loved ones on the 9/11 incident was recorded at the Radio City Music Hall on February 16th, 2002. The concert kicks off with the introduction by Pastor Donnie McClurkin which leads to "We made it," a powerful song to show that many survived through the tragedy and fear. The live recording also features Kim Burrell and John P. Kee. Two studio recordings "Don't Wait" and "Breakthrough" are also included. The album ends with a slow, emotional song of "I need you to survive" in which Walker asks everyone in the audience to pray and show love for each other 
  I wouldn't consider myself a jerky expert. But I do like jerky, and I have tried more than a handful of brands.  This is definitely better than most. You can taste the brown sugar, and the spicy. Actually you can see the spicy all over the insides of the bag. Don't rub your eye after eating this stuff.  Most of the strips were soft and chewy. And not overly salty like others I've tasted. And I feel the spicy on my tongue as well as the back of my throat, which is always a good sign.  I will be putting in another order in a few weeks, so I can have some at a camping trip.   
 I have looked for this movie for years!! I always got the title wrong when looking. Once I found it here on amazon, it was mine! It was delivered quickly, in less time than it was promised. Thanks for great service 
 Dance of anger is a real eye opener. It points out many of the distructive loops that we are unawarely caught in, and also gives some of the tools for communicating out of them. I found it both helpful and reassuring, and I'm ready to learn more. Thank you for a wonderful book 
 La Carreta is a great read, second in the jungle series.  The first five books set the stage and the book, "General from the Jungle" is the climax. Each book stands alone well enough, however, by reading the entire series, preferrebly in order, a greater understanding of what created the conditions for revolution can be garnered. Characters from previous books have cameo appearances in later books, so some previous knowledge of them makes it more interesting. Tierra y Libertad 
 Lovely job.  This one was just plain fun once it got started.  It reads well.  I don't think Ms. Davis' strength has ever been the puzzle.  No one would mistake her for Agatha Christie.  On the other hand, she's a lot more enjoyable to read.  Yes, one could wish the mystery were tidied up better, but then the whole thing might not be so nicely spiced.  As it is, I enjoyed myself hugely.  (Note the wonderful "Briton" playright who gets by without royalties by being popular with the general public and hence sharing in the ticket sales.  Several rather delicious references to a Vespasian-era Shakespeare.  We were amused. 
 Many years ago, when this series of three books first came out in paperback, I bought the first volume because of the Stephen King Dark Tower Story.  I love the Dark Tower series and when I accidentally stumbled on this story, I was very excited.  Needless to say, I loved the novella but I also read the other novellas in the volume and quickly became an Orson Scott Card fan and have read the Ender series written by Card because of this volume (I was already a fan of Sci-fi so the Ender series was a logical place to start on Card books).  This volume also got me interested more in the fantasy genre and before this had only read the Stephen R Donaldson series "The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant" which I still highly recommend as being one of the best fantasy series available.  However, since reading volume 1 of the Legends series, I have become a huge fantasy fan.  So, I finally ran across this particular volume (Legends Volume 3) in a used book store and when I saw that Terry Pratchett and Tad Williams had contributed novellas, I had to buy it.  To start off, I have not yet read any of the Jordan "Wheel of Time" series because I have heard so many different opinions about his style of writing.  His books are huge to say the least so that has made me shy away from his series.  I must say though, that after reading "New Spring" (which he has since expanded on to make a prequel novel) that I am interested in the series and plan on reading the first book to see if I like it.  Yes, it was confusing for the first half of the story since I had no background to this series, but I was intrigued enough to keep reading and ended up enjoying the story.  The second story is Ursula LeGuin's Story "Dragonfly".  This story is simply beautiful.  I have read some of LeGuin's other stories but never any full novels.  I WILL be reading this series, though I know the series is older than the others in this volume.    Tad Williams' story is also well written and as great as I had expected.  I own the "Memory, Sorrow and Thorn" series but have not read it yet, though I have been looking forward to reading it.  I have read his "Otherland" series (over 4000 wonderful pages) and loved every word of it.  From reading the "Otherland" series, I consider Mr. Williams one of my favorite authors, right up there with Stephen King with character development and making the reader feel like you are there with the characters sharing the adventure with them.  This guy is one of the greatest.  The last story is "The Sea and Little Fishes" by Terry Pratchett, another one of my favorite authors.  This novella is just as funny and well written as any of his books.  It is a great introduction to his Discworld universe and provides an excellent example of this series.  Read this story, laugh, and nod your head in agreement to the social commentary that he throws in and I bet you will want to read more.  Pratchett's Discworld series will have you laughing and even on the verge of tears in some places.  I would recommend starting with Wyrd Sisters (one of the Granny novels), "Guards! Guards!" (a great dragon story and introduction to the Night Watch of the Discworld series), or "Mort" ( a hilarious story about a favorite Discworld character known as "Death".  Did you know that the great stallion that "Death" rides is named "Binky"? How funny is that?)  Anyway, I went on a lot more about these stories then I intended.  Get the Legends series, all three books and then get the new Legends II series which also has some great novellas by authors like Terry Brooks and another one by Tad WIlliams which is based on that great "Otherland" series.  You will not be disappointed.  It is well worth the money you spend 
 I found "How to Trade in Stocks" fascinating. Phrases such as "The Trend is Your Friend" are statements made by Jesse Livermore. I learned a great deal about the psychology of markets from this book 
  Credit must be given to the author for exposing major parts of her life as it takes great courage to tell the world of our secrets, our past and our dark sides. Experiencing a life on the street as a prostitute, a peep-show girl and a drug user yet working hard to be loved and to advance in life through college and education. The author had a life of constant struggle and at the same time lived a life that was guided by her own sexual desires and fantasies. Some things have changed over the years but her promiscuity is still well engrained in her life style - I know! I highly recommend the book as the author has done us all a great service and we should all learn from this incredible passage. 
 This is a beautifully written and illustrated combination of stories about some real heroes - dogs, their handlers, and their owners.  You'll have tears of sadness at the loss of heroes like Sirius, and tears of joy at the exploits of others like Alette and Bullet.  This is a great book for kids and adults.  What a wonderful tribute to heroes, two and four-footed 
 My 4 year old daughter loves her baby princess.  She is now looking forward to Snow White and Sleeping Beauty to come out since she now has Jasmine, Ariel, Belle, and Cinderella.  If your daughter loves the Disney Princesses, this is a great Christmas choice 
 E. Lockhart's THE BOY BOOK: A STUDY OF HABITS NAD BEHAVIORS, PLUS TECHNIQUES FOR TAMING THEM tells of Seattle teen Ruby Oliver, who appeared in the prior THE BOYFRIEND LIST: this time Ruby's junior year marks the past loss of best friends, her boyfriend, and new friendships. Ruby has a job and a new driver's license: neither of which seem to be helping her decipher her boyfriend's psyches in this funny analysis of boy problems 
 I'm reading about Barsetshire in the order intended.  Doctor Thorne (third in the series) left me satisfied, and I can recommend it.  It contains fewer of the engaging, and for me novel, nuances of 19th century Church of England politics.  Instead it is a rustic tale, somewhat contrived, compensated by a set of plausible characters who held my interest.  Ever since the author in the earlier "The Warden" effectively punctured my elevated opinion of C. Dickens, I've been contrasting the two contemporaries.  Yes, Dickens remains one of my favorites.  But, his caricatures are more exagerated than Trollope's; I can easily envision both the characters and dialogue as of the type that actually would occur, having known analogs in the rural area in which I was raised.  No, it's not Great Expectations; but Doctor Thorne is good, and probably a better picture of 19th century England 
      Cinderella, is in my own opinion top 1 or 2 of the very best 80's hard rock bands ever, they rank right behind Poison and just a tad better than Bon Jovi, Skid Row and Ratt. These guys came out of Philadelphia in 1986, with their first effort, Night songs, then 2 years later came, Long Cold Winter. Then in early 1990 Cinderella decided to change their sound a little bit, adding more blues and a little less pop to the mix, the result is, Heartbreak Station, their best effort to date.  The More Things Change 10-10 This song really gets the album off to a rockin' start one of their very best.  Love's Got Me Doin' Time 10-10 This track has kind of a funky vibe to it, it has to grow on you, but after it does its a one of a kind.  Shelter Me 10-10 This is my very favorite Cinderella song. I really can't say why, it is just an up-tempo rocker with kind of a 70's rock  vibe.   Heartbreak Station 10-10 This is a pretty good power ballad, one of the best out of the pop metal scene. It's slow and very catchy, no disappointment here.  Sick For The Cure 8-10 Now I am not really sure why, but this song is not one of my favorites on the album. I gave it an 8 out of 10 because it's a pretty decent rocker. Who knows you might love it.  One For Rock & Roll 10-10 Awesome song all the way around, another one of my favorites off the album.  Dead Man's Road 10-10 This song reminds me alot of Bon Jovi's Blaze of Glory. Sounds like something you would see on a cowboy movie.   Maker Your Own Way 8-10 Another song thats not great, but not bad.  Electric Love 8-10 Good, but not great.  Love Gone Bad 8-10 9-10 Pretty good song, typical 80's rock song.  Winds Of Change 10-10 Last, but not least, very good track.  Overall one of the best cd's of the era, if you like 80's pop metal and don't already have this album, get it you will not be disappointed.   
 I honestly do not think that I am very good at United States History (still got an A+) and being that it is now two months before the May AP Season, I can tell you with confidence that after reading the 1070 pages, my knowledge of US History is flimy. Of course, I plan on going back and reading teh book again and buying the Princeton Review's prep book, but I cannot tell yet for sure how well the book has done for me. I find several things about this book that annoys me somewhat, but then again deems teh book stimulating and captivating...first of all, all of the metaphors that constantly plague the sentences will inevitably thwart full comprehension of any student seriously studying the text. I agree that the task of making history fun should be taken by the teacher. Thus this consistent, never faltering usage of metaphors and such has to have a reason for being there, which is that the authors are slightly subjective. Again, a history book should be objective. There is then the positive effect of laid-back diction. Instead of feeling like one is merely reading an encyclopedia, a student may actually perceive the American Pageant as a story, a story of the growth of America. From her infant days with the Pilgrims and Virginians to her failings with the Vietnam War and Nixon Watergate scandal, the reader feels a sense of attachment with history 
 While dated, and slightly insular, this text is an excellent introduction to the sub-culture of fanzines and fan fiction.  While many of the current  generation of fans seem to believe fan fiction was born online around 1994,  they should be surprised and hopefully pleased to discover the rich  (off-line) history of the phenomenon, dating all the way back to the pulp  magazines of the 1930s 
 This and the companion book, the Materia Medica, are excellent books, for the students of Chinese medicine. This book is understandable to the beginner, as well as an excellent resource for students who are well into  their studies 
 I think that this boog y very good, it's easy to understand, and very clear and gives information very important  and useful for the clinician

 I just purchased through Amazon the 3 DVD set "American Knitter" and LOVED it.  I have wanted to learn how to knit for years but the  "instructional" books are to confusing for me. The DVD set is perfect.  The  verbal and visual intructions are easy to follow, and I can pause or turn it  off until a step is completed. I have knitted a few pot holders, and I'm  still trying to make a perfect one so I can continue to the next DVD. I just  want to be sure I have it before I try to add something new 
 Wendell Berry is a farmer, poet, novelist and literary critic. It is as an essayist of enormous acuity, however, that he has become best known. What Are People For? is an important collection of essays (and two 'poem  essays') written between 1975 and 1989. The pieces here range from the  literary and reflective - meditations on the work of writers such as Edward  Abbey and Wallace Stegner, to the empassioned and urgent. 'Why I am not  going to buy a computer' is as cogent a rallying call for the neo-luddite  movement as could be imagined! Berry is an advocate of the local, the real,  the humane, that which is connected to the earth and which knows and loves  its place. Essays such as 'Writer and Region', 'The Work of Local Culture'  and 'Nature as Measure' display a deep-felt commitment eloquently argued.  While Berry writes of the politics of farming, Hemmingway, Twain and Blake  are never far away. Berry's aim is to recall his readers to the wasteland  corporate, industrialised America is becoming and to offer an alternative  vision, one of considerable hope. Too critical to be co-opted into the  ranks of the acceptable voices, too contrary and complex to be labelled  simply an 'environmentalist', Berry's writing is essential 
  Maria Muldaur is sweet, sexy, fun, passionate, original and fresh in "Waitress in Donut Shop," which hands-down is my favorite album of hers. I used to play this album on my turntable every morning to get ready for work. Yep, it was that good it got me going every morning day after day for months!  
 William Byrnes' book is obviously one of only a few books touching all aspects of arts management today. Readers will learn how arts organizations and arts management evolved, the theories and processes behind strategic planning and decision-making, and how to integrate various management theories with practical applications to this type of organization. Of course, not all of Byrnes' examples lets copy into other cultural markets, but there are a lot of general basics for arts managers and administrators worldwide. We can really advise to buy this publication 
 Elvis Presley enjoyed great success with his four standing room only concerts at Madison Square Garden in June of 1972; and this CD shows us why. Elvis is in excellent form for this concert; and his rapport with the crowd runs very strong; almost instantly the audience rests in the palm of Elvis' hand as they whoop and shout for joy as he sings to them.  The concert recording, so well remastered by BMG Recording Studios, begins with "Also Sprach Zarathustra (Theme From 2001: A Space Odyssey.)" This brief yet auspicious theme gets the audience all worked up for Elvis to come onstage. Elvis launches into rousing renditions of "That's All Right" and "Proud Mary" as the crowd loves every second of it. Elvis then switches gears to a slower paced "Never Been To Spain;" and by this time the audience is in total ecstasy. "That's All Right" also features great drums and horns; and the guitars work wonders for the musical arrangement for "Proud Mary," too.   Throughout the rest of the concert Elvis alternates between songs with faster and slower tempos; but they all work well and Elvis bats them all straight out of the ball park! Some incredible numbers Elvis performs include the gorgeous love ballad "You Don't Have To Say You Love Me;" a sublime cover of "The Impossible Dream" with its great use of the piano and "For The Good Times." Elvis sings them all with great sensitivity. Excellent!  Of course, it couldn't be a proper Elvis concert without some of his signature songs. We get classic Elvis numbers including "Heartbreak Hotel;" the beautiful "Love Me Tender" from Elvis' first movie; a slower than usual paced "Hound Dog" that breaks out into a rousing, rapid fire red hot number and "Suspicious Minds," one of Elvis' most beautiful numbers.   Elvis also receives terrific backup from J. D. Sumner & The Stamps, The Sweet Inspirations and Kathy Westmoreland. The orchestra is conducted by Joe Guercio.  The concert ends with two wonderful, full of punch numbers: "I Can't Stop Loving You" and "Can't Help Falling In Love." These two songs provide a strong ending for this concert.   The quality of the sound is good considering that this is a recording of a live concert; and the liner notes include the song credits, too. The art work reflects good judgment.  One mystery exists, for me at least: the CD clocks in at roughly 53 minutes. I find it hard to believe that Elvis' complete and unedited concert lasted a mere 53 minutes. I must wonder if this recording includes all the songs Elvis sang at this particular concert. In any event, this CD is so good I will choose to overlook this possible flaw and give it five stars anyway! It deserves it.   Overall, I highly recommend this CD for Elvis fans. Elvis obviously loved every minute of this concert. Elvis' voice displays his strength and yes, he WAS at the top of his game for this concert. Fans of rock and pop will also enjoy this live concert CD. 
 The question posed by John Brockman was "What do you believe but cannot prove?" It might be classed as one of those Mediaeval "angels on the head of a pin" queries. However, this is the 21st Century and what we know of Nature now stands in stark contrast to what was known then. The responses show that serious questions remain to be resolved. Not all of them can be, as the issue concerned lies either in the past or is too remote for close study. Some, of course, lie in the realm of what we deem "consciousness". A vague term in its own right, made even more difficult when the various respondents offer their own definitions. That tactic, however, makes the answers more stimulating by creating fresh questions. By selecting novelist Ian McEwan to write the introduction, Brockman shows he doesn't consider the question limited to scientific speculation. McEwan demonstrates his knowledge of the scientific issues [would that more fiction writers matched that capacity!] and how "inspiration" has advanced our understanding of Nature.  Although he doesn't describe the process, the reader will soon learn that the editor has placed the responses in some general categories. The first area of interest is cosmology - who is out there? How might we learn of them? Can we ever reach worlds light years away? More to the point, how is the universe put together and why in that way and not another? Are there other universes we can't see? Since many of these questions touch on what we call "values", the next grouping addresses that sort of reply. What is "morality" and what are its origins? In this collection, the "divine" is bypassed, leaving only humans to provide the answer to those "eternals". Yet humans, the responders acknowledge, are the product of natural selection. We have had a long time with even longer biological underpinnings to develop ideas of what is "moral". And moral issues are considered with other emotional aspects of our relations with others - including that favourite topic, "true love". As "love" is limited among humans without language, how we communicate and how language developed is another aspect of our evolutionary roots.  None of these behavioural characteristics of our species can be adequately explained until we have some notion of what drives them. Human consciousness is receiving greater attention through brain research. Cognitive science is revealing what is ticking over in our brains when we deal with such factors as "love" or "communication". A precise definition of consciousness has yet to emerge. The respondents here include one who feels consciousness doesn't even emerge until the language facility is fully developed. Others, using different criteria, even assign consciousness to the lowly cockroach. That consciousness may be at a different level, and operate in more constrained circumstances than that of our species, but consciousness it remains. It is in this segment of the collection where the respondents include the views of colleagues in their essays. That alone is enough to demonstrate the importance of the issues raised here. It may also portend deeper questions on wither the human species is bound. Will humans merge with computers as a means of enhancing their cognitive capacity?  Some more random responses to the "Edge" question conclude the collection. A few direct social issues are addressed, along with associated predictions. Is the human species "improving" and can that be directed are typical examples. Rounding out a fascinating collection, these last are wide-reaching and may be more immediate than the foregoing replies. With such a talented stable of commentators, Brockman's gathering is of immense importance. These are real questions under investigation by highly qualified thinkers. McEwan himself reappears in a thoughtful note all of us should consider. It has great impact on how we conduct our lives - and how novelists portray that behaviour. This is an enduring collection, and should be on every bookshelf. Add it to yours. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada 
 This is a terrific product. When the sticker book arrived my 3 year old was sick. This kept him busy for several hours. Highly recomend 
 The 3rd in this Evangelical Christian Sci-Fi Thriller Series is even better than the 1st 2 ( I've reviewd those as well, if you are interested. ).  I have several reasons for saying so, and none have to do with the similarity, or lack thereof, with the books.  I've never read the books.   This film is an out, and out, Action film with a mission.  It is bringing home, in a very strong fashion, that whatever comes next in the series ain't gonna be a walk in the park.  While Buck, and the other Christian characters, are strong characters portrayed nicely by strong B-Level Actors the nature of the story, and of the growing power, and menace, of the character powerfully played by Gordon Currie, demanded an A-List Star with the Gravitas to sell the violent nature of the tale.  You have to remember that this is Low Budget Filmmaking ( Though they obviously spent much more money on the "Boom!" this time, as well as on Gossett.  ), and that plot choices are made with the number of actors the budget would allow.   This film belonged to Lou Gossett Jr.....  Gossett does a steller job of making us believe in all his character does as he learns an awful truth, and makes various decisive choices along the way.   To say more would spoil the enjoyment of a very interesting film.  
 I had this album in 1971 when I was in college. I attended many a James Brown show. It was a GREAT party album then.  NOW 35 years later and one who still loves the grooves and beats, I find it long overdue in my CD collection.  This is ventage James Brown at his best.  This one is a "must have" for any James Brown fan especially the live version of "Sex Machine".   
 great book, great architecture. this is exactly what architecture needs. makes most of contemporary architecture look like a self-indulgent foolish waste of time, energy, and resources 
 This book gives a deeper understading of aromatherapy. Essential oils are much more than something you use for a certain symptom, and Valerie Ann Worwood gets that message through in her book 
 I recently purchased a new copy of this book. I read it years ago, in 7th grade.  I enjoyed the book the second time and I'm glad I have it for my future children to read someday.  The story is a pretty heartwarming one.  Everyone gets along pretty well and there really isn't too much unhappiness in it.  Everything gets wrapped up pretty neatly without anyone getting hurt.  This is mainly a story about learning to compromise.  I would recommend this book for children (primarily girls, since the main character is a girl) ages 10-13.  Younger children would probably enjoy having it read to them.  It's a nice story for adults too, for the child within.  It's very funny how everyone refers to the lion as a "dog", and the unicorn as just a "little white horse".  I must say that I prefer the picture on the cover of the first book I read.  It was of the girl either standing between a lion and a unicorn or she was riding the lion who was standing next to the unicorn.  I think that one was much prettier than the current cover art.  Also, a suggestion for parents or teachers...when I originally read this book, it was for a school book report.  Part of the assignment was to create a board game that went along with the book.  It was actually kind of fun, though maybe these days 12 an 13 year olds may not enjoy it as much as I did.   
 Seven years before Guillermo Del Toro gave us "Hellboy" he gained himself a beachhead on the American horror movie front with "Mimic", 105 minutes of chilly, goopy, genuinely creepy high-tension nastiness that does what most New York apartment dwellers don't wanna do: checks behind the fridge.  Ever heard that expression, "for every one you see there's 100 more"? If you've lived in New York City you have: whether you live in a luxury high-rise with a doorman or a Bowery flophouse with communal toilets, you're going to deal with roaches. The city is infested. And for every one you see---every crawling, skulking, mottled brown little soldier trundling out from under the fridge---you can bet the little guy has one hundred buddies just waiting for the lights to go out.  Click-clock-click.   "Mimic" plunges right in to its icky little tub of spooky goo with what has to be the world's Worst Scientific Idea ever: in order to combat the virulent child-killing Strickler's Disease, which is spread by a New York cockroach plague, entomologist Dr. Susan Tyler (played with panache and conviction by Mira Sorvino)and some research pals from the CDC engineer a special hybrid bug.   Named the "Judas Bug", this little devil is a special combination of Mantid and Cockroach. Its modus operandi? It's awfully good at mimicrcy: drop it off in a cockroach hive, and it will draw the Strickler-infected roaches and poison them. Problem solved, New York's children saved.   Or are they? Cut to three years later: New Yorkers are disappearing in droves, and mysterious, shrouded figures are lurking around the subways and back alleys. Oh, and they like to make funny noises as they stalk their victims, noises like "click-clock-click". Sorvino gets back into the action when one of the Night Terrors comes clicking around her lab when she discovers a new specimen of super-sized mantid in the New York subway system, and things don't let up from there.   Let's cut right to Mimic's stylish, sleazy, richly atmospheric buggy heart: Guillermo Del Toro ("Cronos", "The Devil's Backbone", "Blade II") is a consummately gifted director with a fine sense of style, and "Mimic" gets its hands dirty from the start, delivering on the spooky, buggy fun, serving up gorgeous camera angles and a knack for the perfectly creepy shot. the sequence where a mildly autistic boy encounters the shrouded lurkers in a decrepit church, for instance, is one of the more genuinely horrific scenes ever committed to film. And best of all, "Mimic" has no bones about shredding cute little kids if it needs to---how often do you get that in a film these days?   The acting is all first rate, from a competent job by Sorvino to nice turns by Charles Dutton and the Giancarlo Giannini, and even a nice hot slice of gratuitous F. Murray Abraham, who classes things up a bit. But style and ghoulishly good atmosphere are the real stars of this spookshow, and Del Toro delivers the goods in creepy-crawly spades. All of the set pieces, particularly the climactic scene in the subway, are beautifully designed, and add to the film's sleazy, rotten, infested atmosphere.   For a nice paranoid jaunt into the crawling darkness, you can do far worse than "Mimic": just take along a super-sized can of Raid.  Click-clock-click 
 This one (by the authors of The Complete Guide to Self-Publishing) will help you come up with non-traditional, 'off the beaten path' ways to market your book.  And the best part?  They give you ideas and concepts to think about while you're still writing your book 
 Wow -- this book is not just for sushi, but for seafood technique, period. Full of color photos, with, for instance, several different species of fish shown with dotted lines as a cutting guide ... a glossary of japanese terms, how to prepare the usual condiments (also shown in color photographs). I just want to keep this around as a reference! Or, maybe that's just an excuse 
 P{arrots in the city was both informitive and a really wonderful read.  I have always had an interest in Monk parrots and this has certainly been an amazing eye opener.  A truely wonderful book for anyone who loves parrots and maybe for those who should learn a little tolarance for this noble little creatures struggle to survive 
 As one of the best Fela tribute bands around, Antibals makes one wonder why to pick up their records, when the Man's work is still widley available.  With SECURITY, the band beings to move out from under Fela's shadow and find a true voice of their own.  Produced by Tortoise's John McEntire, the group begins to stray from mimicry of the 70's Afro-Beat master and explore their own sound to great effect.  While the longer tracks like FILLIBUSTER X and SANTUARY still hue tightly to the Fela sound (especially vocally) shorter tracks like the opening BEATEN METAL, I.C.E. and the closing AGE strive for more expansive sounds closer to jazz.  No doubt all of these tracks cook in front of an audience, but they still need to take that one last leap to find their own personality and become a special band 
 Essays in this book included his famous "The Methodology of Positive Economics" and "The Marshallian Demand Curve". There are other essays on monetary economics, price theory and methodology. You can  learn a lot from this book about Friedman's way of thinkin 
 There are few people in the world who are known by one name only; Cher is one I can think of off hand. Dan is another.  Here in Louisiana, if you are talking about gardening and say, "Dan said.......", everyone knows who you mean and everyone believes what you say. Dan is not only the casual gardener's gardener; he is the professional gardener's gardener.    Month to Month Gardening can guide anyone through necessary tasks in the garden and yes, here in Louisiana we are lucky enough to be able to garden 365 days a year.  There are always flowers blooming, always plants growing and we who live here are dedicated gardeners.  We garden in the winter, the summer and the two or three weeks of fall and spring that come our way.    Dan does a regular Saturday morning radio call-in show and a weekly segment on a morning TV show.  During the 20+  years Dan has been disseminating plant knowledge in the New Orleans area, his reputation has spread and we rely on him for all sorts of growing information.  And since he continues to write this knowledge down in a weekly Times Picayune Newspaper column and now in Month to Month Gardening, we are indeed fortunate to be able to share his Louisiana gardening information.  Now readers can learn what grows and what doesn't, how to care for it, what to try, when to try it, what will fail, what will flourish and what to watch out for. Dan emphasizes organic growing methods in his gardening approach as much as possible and as an organic gardener myself, I appreciate that.    If you wish to learn of Louisiana Gardening, and have a good read and reference source, have this book in your library 
 Rhett keeps getting better as he go 
 I give it 4 stars because Gloria Estefan is talented.  The only song I like here is "Dont Wanna Lose You now" but even then they overplayed it and I dont like it anymore.  Most songs are just ballads which are good but too many you need to diversify a little.  I suggest "Let It Loose" because the ballads and dance songs are better 
 The Crucible  The crucible is a pretty good book. It is not only a good peace of literature but also a good history lesson. It sends a mix of messages throughout the story such as , good vs. evil, why are the towns people so cruel?, why do they put so much judgment on each other and lastly are the townsmen turning other suspected witches in for the sake of the town or to cover their own backs? As you read the book, it gives off a sense of evil and demonic feeling. Although, you probly feel annoyed with certain characters in the book, you soon come to realize that they're only doing what they thought was in the best interest for the town.   The crucible is all about the excommunicating of witches in the early 1900`s. All the people believed excommunicating or even better, burning them at the stake would eliminate the problem. I think for the time it took place and obvious lack of trust that was in the town the people were truly fighting for the best thing in their minds. I also feel like the people are living an unaccomplished life because all they did was fear each other and accuse each other of witchcraft.   In my opinion, the book is a good read and it offers a lot to think about when you put it down. That is if you can put it down. All in all the suspicion , hatred, accusations, and judgmental attitudes turned out to be one of the most interesting parts of American History. This book is a good piece and Id recommend it to anyone.   
 Speak, by Laurie Halse Anderson ISBN #0-439364010-5  By Ionela Shapiro  Do you remember your first day in high school?  Where you nervous that you wouldn't fit in or be accepted?  In the book, Speak, the main character, Melinda Sordino is experiencing this on her first day at Merryweather High.  Her friends from 8th grade hate her because called the police that broke up a senior end of the summer party.  No one knows the reason why Melinda did this; it's something Melinda will not SPEAK about.  In this realistic fiction novel, Melinda is the victim of high school rape.  Through out the story she begins to speak less and less, her grades are dropping lower during each marking period and she cares less about herself.  The story takes you through Melinda's healing process to when she finally decides to SPEAK.  I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to other teenagers to read.  It really describes what a troubled teenager is going through.  Maybe it would teach kids not to judge people without really getting to know them.   I felt for Melinda's character, especially because she was an outcast.  I have been the new student many times and constantly feel like an outcast, and I knew exactly what Melinda was going through.  There were so many times while I was reading the story, my mind would wander to a certain incident at school and I thought,  "been there and done that before".  When you are new and have no friends, you want so much to belong to a group or "clan".  I know what it is like not to know any one and not belong and it just feels awful.  Any teenager that feels like an outcast or that feels they are not accepted by their friends, would enjoy this book and would definitely relate to it. 
 This tape series change my life. You will find the info and meditation so helpful. They certainly assist as you study energy in your own life You wont be disappointed if you get them  : 
 To Reviewer Number One:  Play it again, Rich, and I think you may change your tune.  Outstanding tunes IMHO are "Mama's Boy Blues", "That's Where I Am", "Hey Bartender", and "Cue The Violins".  "Cue" is like a lost song from the Blue Thumb days, it's so sweet.  "Bartender" rocks, and brings Dan up to date nicely.  The lyrics are pure Hicks drollity, and the dispassionate backing vocals are a stitch.  Wonderful covers of "I'll See You In My Dreams" and "C'mon-A-My-House" do a nice job of showcasing Dan's jazzy sensibilities.  Remakes of previous tunes are there for good reason, since the album they appeared on ("Shootin' Straight") has been out of print for far too long.  Besides, "Shootin'" was live, and "Selected" is studio... so there's another reason.  The duets, well, I gotta say I'm with you on this one to some degree.  But that Gibby Haynes on "That Ain't Right"!  Man, that's like a duet with Beavis!   Did I convince you yet?  Or did you microwave the disc already?   (As to which DH discs would rate my coveted 5... those would be "Strikin' It Rich" and "Shooting Straight" 
 I bought this book last week to read over the holidays. I know it sounds like a clich but I really could not put it down. The intimates poignant flowery Persian voices will make you laugh and cry. As you read you will come across a spectrum of views and a hopeful and promising Iran will come alive on the pages.  If you are not Iranian and you are interested in Iran it will be an eye opener about a society in flower. This is all I wanted to say, but I have come a across a review here that I am forced to respond to.  I know that the Iranian government is trying to close down these blogs and has imprisoned many bloggers. Just as it has closed down hundreds of newspapers and imprisoned many journalists. Even on Amazon some reviewer (who has evidently not read it) has referred to them as group living in "La-la land".  Why are the supporters of the Iranian regime so scared of the truth? No, Iran's youth don't live in "La-la land" but in Iran so get used to that.  I was so moved by some of the writing that I sent out several emails   and they were real enough to respond.  This book is also not about the affluent youth of North Tehran. Read it and you'll be taken aback as I was. Trust me the affluent kids like you or I have either left Iran or have other ways of occupying themselves. I am at least able to admit that I do not have the courage of these bloggers and fearful of reprisals will not be putting my real name on this Amazon review.  Just look at the bloggers like Mojtaba Saminejad recently arrested they are mostly educated kids from traditional working class families, whose mothers wear chadors. I'm sure while Mojtaba is in jail his mother brews tea on a traditional Samovar instead of sipping cappuccinos. Who would have guessed it 27 years ago that the children of radical revolutionaries, would have turned out to be the most educated and liberal youth in the Middle East today. These are the voices of the children of that revolution who have experienced the reality of living under such a regimes and now want reform and change. I hope that one day I will be able to look back at these blogs as a distant moving memory, as we do today at the diaries of Anne Frank.  
 Eileen Reeves has created a portrait of Galileo the artist-scientist that is complex and and worth a long look. I was not familiar with Galileo the artist, and her story includes memorable tidbits that add another dimension to his life. For example, Galileo's dislike of pietre dure, or portraits that were mosaics of polished minerals, and his study of the illumination of the Moon convincingly show that Galileo had an artistic sensibility that influenced his scientific observations. Reeves conclusions may be stretched, but they are worthwhile debating. The writing is not easy, the book wanders and is repetitious, but a careful read will pay off with a new understanding of a giant of the Renaissance and subsequent Scientific Revolution 
 wonderful work of history, takes the reader beyond the myth and caricature of Marie Antoinette, to reveal a complex, very interesting queen. Not a dull moment in the book 
 Another example of how Michael Crighton can make learning history fun.  Well researched, the author brings you into the mind of master criminal Edward Pierce.  The reader follows along as the theft of 12,000 pounds sterling is planned and executed from a secure payroll train bound for the Cremian War front. The story is reconstructed from actual court testimony of probably one of the best documented court cases in Brittish history.  One thinks "Why would the master criminal Pierce be so brazen as to seal his own fate with such open boasting? But, the story does the reader one better by suprising you with the Master Criminal's escape from the clutches of the Law never to be seen again 
 I read this book many, many years ago on a very long flight.  I couldn't put it down.  The philosophy is simple; live frugally, save/invest money every month, and you too can be a millionaire.  It's great advice, especially in this day and age when the younger generation wants the big house, expensive car, and everything else right NOW, with no regard to the future.  Although some of the info is dated (Enron being named as a great company to invest), and some other advice (putting new soles on old shoes) is a bit much, the general message makes plenty of sense. 
  VERY ENTERTAINING. EACH CHAPTER KEEPS YOUR INTEREST AND YOU  WANTING TO READ MORE 
 First, start with the cover: O'Reilly looks like a constipated leprechaun.  Then comes the content: alternavely pathetic and laughable.  Bill really should be fitted for a straight jacket.  The End is really the best part of the book.  By this time you've become familiar with Bill's perverse image of the world and you won't have to inflict any more masochistic behavior on yourself.  O'Reilly is mean, spiteful and nuts 
 This is not Ginzburgs only book on Shamanism. He also covers the subject in his book "Ecstasies". Nonetheless, this is a superb book. In it, he deals with a group of men in northern Italy who believed that their souls left their bodies while they slept to do battle with malignant forces. However, he does not view this as either a hard-line skeptic or a muddle headed New Ager. He approaches it as a historian and treats it no different from any other subject, thus creating an unbiased account of what happened. And what he constucts is an account of shamanism and witch trials in a northern Italian village. This is a fascinating account, and certainly well worth the read. If you appreciate this book, then I strongly recommend you check out "Ecstasies", his other book on European Shamanism and the witch-hunts 
 I'll get this out of the way up front; I approached this book with a completely inaccurate perception of what it was going to give me. I would consider myself an intermediate to advanced php developer, and I was hoping this book would teach me awesome ways to use PHP5's OOP power to make my applications better, faster, and more attractive to women. That wasn't what this book does. This book introduces OOP, explains why it's useful, and goes through to develop several sample applications to demonstrate OOPs power, and more importantly how to use it.  The books pretty thin weighing in at 216 pages, split up amongst 15 chapters. The first bit of the book concentrates on explaining what OOP is, why PHP needs it, and why you want it. It then moves on to explain why OOP sucked in PHP4, what works better in PHP5, and all the fancy new words you're going to need to memorize to use it (protected, private, etc.). It then moves on to develop a sample indexing application, adding in thumbnail generation as the book progresses. Later on more advanced topics like design patterns, interfaces and exceptions are introduced. Finally the book gives a brief introduction to SPL which was introduced in PHP5 and improved in PHP5.1.  Overall I would recommend this book to beginner PHP developers, or intermediate developers who have not yet gotten their feet wet with OO 
 I bought "Distance" by Marconi Union and had this CD as part of the package.  I couldn't believe that it was only $2.99, and after listening to it, I still don't believe that it was going for that price.  This is an excellent array of talent on a sampler CD, worth many times the price, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to find out what All Saints records is all about 
 If you enjoy chanting and Kirtan,  then this is a great CD to purchase. Jaya Lakshmi has a sweet voice, a voice like and angel. This is a great CD for yoga,(I'm a yoga instructor), even massage, or just plain relaxing 
 all the songs on here are great but theres one that stands out Light Years is a Amazing and Magical song it's a song that will get you dance'in. it's not a slow song or not a fast song it's just right this song will lift you.......it's Magical.. 
 In brief this was one of the best books I read in 1995. While the book is a splendid introduction to an exciting topic, it has numerous special insights and clarifying presentations. It keeps close to biology demonstrating  some fascinating respects in which biology and its theorists  raise special issues in the philosophy of science. The book   would go well with one of the main philosophy of natural sciences   textbooks 
 I loved this book.  Easy reading with amazing dialogue.  Fantastic characters with sometimes funny sometimes sad twists and turns.  Would love to see Ms. Frank on bestseller's lists everywhere.  
 Inside it you will find everything you want and need to know about the BIOS. If you're an overclocker, it's indispensible. If you're just curious about what all those settings do, it's great. The author's website is well-known in the enthusiast community and for good reason. Buy it 
 Based on the excellent New Living Translation (NLT), this study Bible is without doubt one of the finest that it has been my privilege to own and use.I am a relatively new convert to the NLT so this very practical, user friendly and comprehensive study system blended with this wonderfully practical and immensley readble text, make this Bible a delight to use. I recommend it to all believers from the new to the thoroughly theological. Pastor Brian Allenby, National Director, Christians at Work (UK 
 After a long day of hunching over my computer at work for 8+ hours and a brutal workout after, I came home tonight and enjoyed the best shower experience I have ever had by myself with a bath bar!  :)   The cooling sensation of the wiccy magic muscles bar, the cool air in the bathroom, mixed with the warm water of the shower made for a incredibly relaxing, blissful, enjoyable shower.   I feel great!  I'll sleep great tonight!  This experience has made me a LUSH customer for life 
 The classic adventure story of The Wind in the Willows is set in early twentieth-century Britain and features the lovable characters of the Water Rat, Mole, Toad, and Badger. Rat lives in the river bank and is totally fond of his little place. Mole lives underground and wants to see a lot more of the Big World. It's no surprise that Rat becomes his mentor and best friend. Both animals do have one constant worry: Toad. Toad, who owns Toad Hall, the biggest building in the neighbourhood, is extremely rich and conceited. But both friends know that beneath his vain faade, Toad means well. But all their effort in vain, Toad gets in a big mess when he buys an automobile. Mole does not know what he can still do to avoid Toad killing himself and others, so he calls in the help of the intelligent and respected Badger, who lives in the Wild Wood.  The major theme of this classic story is the struggle between the noisy, common way of life of the Wild Wooders, like the stoats and the weasels, and the quiet and genteel River-Bankers. Toad is a lovable rebel who does not fit well into either camp. With this setting Kenneth Grahame delivers a lovable and enjoyable fairytale for the younger readers, but has not neglected to fill the story with enough witty sidetracks to address a much wider audience. It is not without reason that this book was voted one of the best children's books ever.   The Wind in the Willows started as a series of stories shared by Grahame in letters to his only child, Alastair, born in 1899. It took until 1908 before these stories were first published. After almost more than one-hundred years this book still manages to capture its own place in the hearts of thousands of people. The Wind in the Willows is simply a must read for everyone who is still young at heart 
 Having lived 60% of my life outside the USA in various countries, I've often been surprised at how unhappy many Americans appear to be. In the poor countries where I've lived ("third world"), people generally seem happier, friendlier, more willing to share/give and less stressed--even though they have much less (material goods, that is). Those of you who have travelled, that is, actually gotten off the beaten path, the megaresorts, the disneyfied locations, to places like the Phillipines, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, etc., have probably noted the difference.  Why are people in the richest society the World has even seen, generally, so unhappy? The book makes a very strong case that the lifelong advertising barrage Americans endure, has gotten too many people to believe that happiness comes from acquiring stuff, always more stuff, better, newer stuff. However, as Americans have gotten materially richer, their happiness indeces have gone down as a result of trying to acquire more stuff and the damage that producing/marketing/moving/disposing of the stuff has inflicted on the environment. Along with longer work hours to pay for all the stuff, our health, time for leisure, time to be creative, and much more, has been lost. The book offers genuine, practical solutions to many, if not most of the problems our society(ies) faces. I found the book's tone to be engagingly honest, fresh, not patronizing or preachy. I also disagree with some reviewers' views that the book falls into the category of "liberal". Such a simplistic tag is virtually useless when it comes to trying to intelligently discuss the complicated issues facing humanity. I'm buying five more copies to send to people like legislators and university presidents 
 I have all the Final Fantasy Games except for VIII. I just never got around to getting it. I purchased VIII two months ago and I have currently beat it. I though it was well worth playing. The storyline was great. Each charcter brought something spectacular to the game. I never put it down. The ending alone was worth it. 10 of 10 for the best story and gfs.  Trinity 
 I loved this book.  I found the characters rich and compelling.  The descriptions are beautiful.  It's not a book you want to tear through, but one you want to sit with and savor.  What I liked best was the essential decency in all the characters.  It's much easier to write a frightning psychopath than to keep the readers interest when describing real people who may hurt one another, but who always care 
 The history of revolutions, at least the modern ones, have always been preceded by an animated struggle over radical/revolutionary ideas which more or less animated the progressive parties to push forward to what is an exception circumstance in the historic process, revolution-the going over from the old order to a new order by means of eliminating the old ruling class and installing a new one. Thus, the English Revolution of the 1600's found plenty of pamphleteers and publicists, especially among the Levelers (the secular democratic wing of the parliamentary forces) in the struggle to gain parliamentary ascendance. The French Revolution was inundated from many sources with ideas about which way society should be run leading up to the famous Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. And certainly the Russian Revolution, the most conscious effort at revolution known to history, was centrally determined by the titanic struggle by the various liberal and social-democratic parties over ideas. The book under review here takes its place in the debate over the role of such ideas in the American Revolution. Professor Wood is thus on fertile ground in tracing the history of the prevailing pre-revolutionary ideas which culminated in the Declaration of Independence and the American Constitution as well as the later struggle between the ideas of a society run as a democracy or as a republic which burst forth after the revolution.  Professor Wood is an eminent, if not the contemporary preeminent historian of the American Revolution, so what he has to say bears attention. His fundamental premise in this volume is that the struggle for ideas in the pre-revolutionary period determined the nature of the later, essentially parliamentary, struggles after independence was declared and the new frame of government was established. In short, he argues for a much more radical interpretation of the heretofore stodgy American Revolution known from childhood. His point that this revolution represented an important accrual in the struggle of the forces for enlightenment is something that militant leftists can appreciate whatever other disagreements with Professor Wood's political conclusions we might entertain.     Professor Wood makes two main points that bear notice. The first- while today rather obvious bears acknowledgement-that is the struggle from early on in the 1700's in the colonies to break from the role of subjects of the king to independent citizens of a republic. That premise was indeed progressive at the time and animated all movements from the late 1600's on. It is a struggle that continues today. The exception I take to Professor Wood's view is that while he is content with the general outline of current democratic practice I would argue that the road from citizen under capitalism to comrade under socialism is necessary to fulfill the still remaining democratic tasks of the American Revolution and the American Civil War.  Professor Wood's second premise is to note the divergence between the ideals of the leaders of the independence forces concerning the establishment of a government based on disinterested rule and the more plebian (and messy notion) that every cook could be a legislator. The gap between the leadership's (Washington, John Adams, Hamilton and the usual cast of suspects) high expectations of a Republic of Letters (their own personal republic) issuing forth from the revolution ultimately led to the demise of the elitist Federalist party and the rise of the rule of those claiming the interests of the plebian elements. In that fight militants support the plebian elements. That fight has never really been completed or expanded. Nevertheless Professor Wood's goal of defining the revolution as animated by more radical ideas that generally realized is an addition to our historic understanding of the American Revolution. Read on.  
 I read The DaVinci Code before this one.  I liked this one even more.  It's very clever & equally adventurous - if not MORE!    The same cons as DaVinci.  Some results & fleeing authorities seem to come too easy.  This one I found more spiritual than DaVinci though.  
 I first read this book years ago, and have since read it again.  This is one great book.  If you are even remotely interested in golf and/or the goings-on of the PGA Tour, read this book.  
 Excellent, personable insight on the rationale and approach by an artist relative to his subject matter.  Kahn succinctly summarizes, discusses not only his appreciation for the unusual, be in Nature or weathered man-made structures, but also the specific application of the medium used, pastels and oils, to capture the emotional content of the scene, as well as the color harmonies developed over a lifetime of conscientious study.  Freedom of action and thought pervades the book that appeals to his artistic soul 
 I have to give him 5 stars... I watch his show "Good Eats".  Some of his TV shows are as funny as a Seinfeld show.  And his scientific approach to cooking is as good as the humor.  I just ordered this book.  I understand I can come back and edit my review here later.  Will do.  
 Great book! A friend recommended this book to us a 2 years ago - our son is now 7 and I wish we had known about it 5 years ago. I haven't read it cover to cover, but it's a great reference guide for all the different stages kids experience. Our son is a joy, but like all children he has his "moments" and it's such a relief to refer to this book and find out he's perfectly normal 
 I thought this book was excellent.  It was a quick read with some very basic and easy to follow advice.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking to achieve great success in any aspect of their life 
 No one goes after the "bad guys" like Michael Moore. He is relentless asking big business why not take care of the working man who put you where you are today?  He asks the simple question, why not share the wealth?  He pursues the answers to these questions in a humorous and compassionate manner. Being a working woman myself, and working in the auto industry, I appreciate where this documentary comes from 
 This book has such a unique style that you have to own it just to own it.  The story is told in a nursery rhyme format, but it is a very dark and demented nursery rhyme.  The material is intense, but not too intense for the audience.  The illustrations are incredible and breathtaking.  The color is just as intense as the images.  The anger and meanness of the world surrounding the homeless kids is astounding.  The story presents a real problem in our society to kids in a way they can understand it.  I understand there is a lot of controversy surrounding the book, mostly allegations of racism.  Watch out for that 
 Putting two superstars together on an album doesn't always work, but it does in this case.  This was a good idea and the two obviously interacted well throughout.  All of the songs are great blues tunes, but I especially liked "Key to the Highway" with the two alternating on the lyrics.  My only criticism is that this album is a tad overproduced for my taste in blues 
 I think they won a grammy for that track.  Just fun rock 'n roll, enough said 
 There's a good reason O'Neill insisted that Random House not publish this play until 25 years after his death, which would have prevented its production until 1978. The characters and the story are painfully drawn from O'Neill's own family life. Even though his immediate family members had all died, he surely was concerned about the hurt it could cause his surviving relatives and the impact of memories shared by his close friends. Random House ultimately honored the agreement but, fortunately for the history of drama, O'Neill's wife allowed the play to be published by Yale University Press and produced on Broadway in 1956, only three years after his death.  The volume is labeled here as a "second edition" but in truth it's simply a corrected edition that fixes relatively minor errors that were introduced in the 1956 publication. (Due to a production error, the first printing dropped a single line. The 61st printing in 1989 restored four lines that were dropped by the typist who retyped O'Neill's edited manuscript. Otherwise, it's the same play that was originally published fifty years ago.)  The play's power comes not from its plot; there is hardly any action at all. Instead, one sees O'Neill's family living out a single and typical day. James Tyrone, Sr., has spent his entire life playing one role in a nationally popular play, much like James O'Neill (Eugene's father), who starred in an adaptation of "The Count of Monte Cristo," appearing in some 4,000 performances between 1883 and 1912. Early in the play, Tyrone realizes that his wife, Mary, has suffered a relapse into her longtime morphine addiction. Similarly, just before he turned 13, Eugene O'Neill had learned of his own mother's morphine addiction (when she attempted to drown herself). The addiction, which lasted for more than a quarter of a century, resulted from the difficulties of Eugene's birth.  The two sons are modeled on Eugene and his brother. The older Jamie is an amiable, shiftless loafer and an alcoholic in training. (The real Jamie entered a sanatorium after a bout of alcohol poisoning and died soon thereafter.) And the younger Edmund, of course, is Eugene himself, who worked as a seaman on various freighters, attempted to commit suicide in a Manhattan saloon soon after his return to the States, and returned home to learn he has tuberculosis.   The play is set on a specific day in this family's life: the day Edmund finds out his diagnosis (which in Eugene's life would be in November 1912, only months before O'Neill began to write his first dramatic sketch). And it is certainly a long day's journey. O'Neill portrays his family brutally and lovingly: his mother is a ghost wandering the house in her dreamy universe; his father is a cheapskate concerned more about acquiring real estate than about spending a cent on his son's medical recovery; the brother begins drinking early in the morning and stumbles home nearly 24 hours later. Edmund is lost in his poetic musings.    And all four of them manage constantly to get on each other's nerves with well-practiced rituals of selfishness, denial, argument, insult, and forgiveness. Their incessant banter and taxing squabbles don't always read well on the page; that professional performances of the play don't wear on the audience is a testimony to O'Neill's mastery of the dramatic form. It is, I think, O'Neill's best work 
 A good thriller, that was very Grisham.   Delivered on exactly what you read Grisham for.  
 Excellent well presented books with lots of vey good information...Top marks for this book  Doug Jansen Sydney AUSTRALI 
 This was a Chriatmas gift for a family member that loves Johnny Cash. It is an obscure Johnny Cash album featuring songs for a young audience. Item arrived in time for Christmas and in brand-new condition. 
 this edition.  The Wordsworth Poetry Library offers some decent printings of the works of any number of poets for fantastic prices. These editions may not be of the best quality, but that's okay for most of the books in the collection. However, when it comes to Wordsworth, quality is an issue because of the sheer volume of his poetical works. The WPL edition of the namesake's poetry will fall apart if one attempts to actually read it. There are simply too many pages in this edition for the paperback, perfect-bound book to stay together.  When it comes to Wordsworth, a little probably goes a long way for the casual reader; such may wish to consider the Penguin edition of Selected Poems of William Wordsworth. However, those who truly wish to read (or at least own) every accessible bit of verse by the venerable poet will do well to look around (use bookfinder dot com or eBay) for old hardcover editions under the title Complete Poetical Works of William Wordsworth.  It should be stressed that the casual reader will generally find the WPL editions adequate, especially for the price, and that this volume is only a poor choice because of the amount of pages 
 I think this book was really good.  In this book Mr. Lamb showed the other side of the story about Vietnam.  He showed what they think about the whole war, and what they think about American people.  By Mr. Lamb's words, the book showed that Hanoi is a beautiful city in Vietnam, and that Vietnamese people are not mad at Americans for what happend, they say that they are people just like us.  I do recommend this book, because it's nice to know what the other side thinks about the war 
 I finished the audio book earlier this week.  In typical Stephen King fashion, he draws you along the story, twisting several plots into it.  Surprisingly, it was not the main focus of the story that gave me chills, but the last 5 minutes when certain revelations are made, or at least hinted at.  I especially loved the iconography of the statue in front of the hospital, and the often repeated quote which basically said that there was no comfort without pain.  Which I guess can be considered a message of hope, or at least a message that suffering is not done in vain.  But again, it's one of those details that makes this whole story just a bit askew.  Overall, it was a great read.  I really enjoyed the story, it was a bit predictable, but the pace of the words draws the listener along nicely.  I would recomend this book to a friend, but not to my mother 
 This book was excellent and clearly showed just how absurd racism can make people. It was disturbing* as a black person myself* to read about how people used to negate each other that badly. It changed my perception of a lot of things. I recommend this book to EVERYONE. It pointed out so many things that I didn't twice about and I wish I could have found it sooner 
 Having always been interested in the military, especially the Marine Corps, I thought that this book would be interesting.  It gives a very realistic first hand look at a Dartmouth College graduate that decided to go through Officers Candidates School to become a Marine 2nd Lieutenant.  Upon completing OCS, he then embarked on deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq before leaving the Marines.  This book gives one a good understanding of real combat and real combat decisions, both good and bad.  It shows how our military leaders still make mistakes and how the strong bonds form between members of a platoon that have endured the hardships of combat together.  I enjoyed this book very much 
 "The Departed" will join director Martin Scorsese's other classic crime dramas, arguably on a par with "GoodFellas" in particular. This film easily swept the Academy Awards in 2007, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editor and Best Adapted Screenplay.   This classic film is set in Boston, where two young police cadets( Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio) are pulled into the web of betrayal and murder orchestrated by Irish crime boss Frank Costello (played by the legendary Jack Nicholson). The complex plot is based on the Hong Kong film "Internal Affairs"(2002) of which "The Departed" is a remake. The film is packed with A-list talent; in addition to that mentioned above, the movie also stars Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg.   The screenplay for "The Departed" is among the best ever written for a crime drama, it keeps the action moving at a fast clip and delivers clever dialogue alongside fantastic character development. Martin Scorsese won his first Academy award for Best Director for this picture; a well-deserved and long-delayed honor for one of America's greatest directors. It's easy to see why Scorsese won for this film, it is yet another brilliant expose of his masterful skill as a director.   Jack Nicholson dominates this film. His performance as crime boss Frank Costello is brilliant and seems to come effortlessly to this living legend of the silver screen. The Costello character is ruthless and Machavellian to say the least, he "adopts" the young Colin character (Conor Donovan, played as an adult by Matt Damon) who grows up to join the Massachusetts State Police, thereby giving the crime boss an inside man within law enforcement, and the perfect ally to protect and expand his various rackets. From Nicholson's opening line, he outshines the other actors with screen presence alone, and then eclipses them altogether with his classic line deliveries.   Leonardo DiCaprio has grown to full maturity as a true A-List actor. His third collaboration with Scorsese (following 2002's "Gangs Of New York" and 2004's "Tha Aviator") as police cadet-turned-undercover cop Billy Costigan is perfectly performed, illustrating Scorsese's continued ability to draw out DiCaprio's best interpretations. Matt Damon revisits familiar territory as a South Boston cop, this role recalls his performance in "Good Will Hunting" complete with authentic Boston accent. Damon also works well under Scorsese, portraying the duplicitous, crooked cop Colin; his performance is sharp and well-balanced.   Mark Wahlberg's character Staff Seargent Dingnam is all wit and constant profanity, giving him the majority of the hilarious one-liners and zingers in this film. Martin Sheen provides a perfect counterbalance to Wahlberg's character as Chief Queenan. Providing further evidence of perfect casting is Alec Baldwin, who portrays Lieutenant Ellerby, the most crass and humorous of the veteran officers. Ray Winstone also delivers a superb performance as the menacing, authoritative Mr. French, Costello's most trusted enforcer.   The music of The Rolling Stones constantly drones in and out during the film, providing excellent atmosphere for a crime flick set on the mean streets.   "The Departed" is a instant classic, a great movie for fans of gritty, violent crime dramas ala "The Sopranos". Scorsese continues to exhibit his mastery for this genre of film, his best work to date. 
 I purchased this book because it was how I got interested in astronomy when I was 8 years old.  It is a great introduction to stargazing and despite naysayers who don't like Rey's interpretation of the constellations, it is very friendly to young people who may want an introduction plus some more depth 
 One of my friends used the techniques in this book and "pitched" herself into a new and better job in three weeks. And it's summer, usually a dead season for job hunting. The techniques work

 I've noticed a couple of reviews that suggest there's something missing from this book. For example, Dennis Phillips has written a wonderful and accurate review of the book, but expresses disappointment at the fact that there isn't more background information included, or that there were no investigations conducted.  Well, I certainly understand where Dennis is coming from, but I don't feel that this book is about getting to the bottom of these ghost stories. I think it's simply about the wonder of the occurrences, and the startling fact that these things happen to normal people on a seemingly frequent basis.  As another reviewer stated, the subtitle of this book is "True Stories of Paranormal Encounters from Everyday People" and that's exactly what it is. No, the author doesn't have a team of paranormal investigators and psychics that delve into the history of the haunted location and try to determine its origins. There are plenty of books out there that are packed to the gills with that stuff.  Personally, I'm more interested in reading about the good stuff--the actual events that took place, which put these stories into the "paranormal" category. If I want history and investigation, I'll read something by Hans Holzer. In fact, some of us actually prefer NOT knowing the origins or reasoning behind the occurrences...it sort of takes away some of the mystery and creepiness.  At any rate, no matter what your position is on the history/investigation issue, I think anyone who's read this book will agree that it is indeed very well-written and entertaining, with a pleasing variety of chillingly believable stories, which are featured nowhere else but in this book. I'm certain it will remain one of my favorite volumes of true ghost stories.

 How did Gibbon do it?!  This book is so good and so rich on so many levels, and the centuries have not made it any less a terrific read than it must have been when first published.  There are so many reasons to read it -- I'll choose one.  If you want to understand human nature in something approaching all it's depth and complexity, you can do no better than to read Gibbon's tales of what happens when a long succession of very different characters attain total dominion over the entire civilized world.  The incredible variety of comedy, calamity and infamy is unmatched even in Greek Myths or the Bible, and to my mind, at least, the story telling is better 
 *	As others have said, whether one agrees with his amalinial stance or not, that he presents a comprehensive, balanced and biblical perspective cannot be denied.  This book is full of exegetical insights that will send scholars to the study for hours, yet it is easily accessible to laymen.  I have found this book particularly helpful for preaching because of the numerous "implications" (his wording) that are drawn from each theological statement.  Hoekema reguarily proves a theological truth and then adduces several practical implications that are implicit within the given truth.  I cannot say enough good things about this book.  I almost forgot to mention: Hoekema is strongly calvinistic.  I am not.  However, he presents one of the most balanced portrayals of divine sovereignty and human responsibility I've read. Do not be misled (if you might otherwise be) by his calvinistic heritage 
 Irving Berlin started it all, though this story is not a biopic. The only part he plays is as an unseen friend to a lower-class girl named Stella (Alice Faye) who sends her "Alexander's Ragtime Band" which helps her get a job in a club and forces her together with two men that play a significant role in her life. "Alex" (Tyrone Power) is her mortal enemy, but the two become quite close after Charlie (Don Ameche), the man who loves her, brings them together. Pitfalls and love triangles make for an interesting story and the great music it is set to really keeps one's toes tapping.  Later on, Ethel Merman joins the story. She is certainly one of those singers who you love or hate, and I happen to hate her. She has a brash, obnoxious way of singing that is in stark contrast to Faye's creamy alto voice. However, these two polar opposites add variety to the film.  Also included on this DVD is a documentary about Faye from the A&E Biography series. It includes interviews from her daughter, Roddy McDowall, and Hugh Hefner and shows many clips from her relatively few films. It is an interesting watch 
 I have read alot of Amber Brown books and this is my favorite so far.  She a normal girl and learns to handle things-I really like to read about her 
 Craig Childs is an amazing writer. Each time I take up my copy of HOUSE OF RAIN I eagerly anticipate another view into the ancient Anasazi culture through Childs' eyes. HOUSE is Childs' personal record of his trek across the lands of the Anasazis. Childs is an attentive observer. He mainained a journal of his observations, his feelings, his speculations. HOUSE OF RAIN reads like a cleaned up edition of Childs' personal journals as he treks through arid arroyos or walks like "an angel of death" through a rare desert drenching downpour. His self-deprecating humor tickled my funny bone when Childs describes his dash across a suburban landscape in his boxer shorts, facing down two friendly and slobbering dogs. Childs' research leg work is extensive. Interjected aomng the details of his journey, Childs provides insights about the Anasazi world with startling finds by archaeologists, paleonlogists, geologists, physical surveyors, native peoples, and USA Park Service people.    Childs' language and word images are as finely sculptured as the wind and water erroded desert landscape and arroyo walls.  HOUSE OF RAIN is a must read book for students of paleo-America and tellers of American tales. Childs' greatest contribution may be that he affirms that the myserious ancient ruins spread across the US Southwest are more than tourist picture ops; rather they are remnants of real people grinding corn, doing house hold chores, laboring to build roads and places of worship, eking out a living in a hard land. In the end, Childs causes  a readers to acknowledge that those ancient peoples are us 
 I just got back into Batman after finding out they put Batman Beyond was in one collection. After that I started to remember why I loved batman so much. So I went out and got all 4 volumes and the last one IMO held up the best. It's been fun revisiting Batman again and I hope to see Bruce Tim make one more series. 
 This is a wonderful flight of fantasy that is full of magic castles, horses that fly (hippogriffs), and such imagination and humor that you never cease to be entertained by it all.  You may wonder like I did that:  If this is "Part One", where is part two?  I was unable to find  any such continuation.  You have to just enjoy this marvelous tale for what  it is 
 To give a synposis of this classic story would be repetitive.  I will say I was suprised at how much I loved this book.  I thought it would be good, but it turned out to be great.  The story starts slowly, gradually building, until you just can't put it down.  It is a mystery that turns itself on end.  I don't want to give away the plot, but whatever twists and turns it takes, you still keep rooting for our shy little heroine.  A previous reviewer commented on the abrupt ending.  I thought it was perfect.  Any more said would have overstated the obvious.  I highly recommend reading this book.  I think I will reread it.  It is that good 
 Recipe ideas are great. I have the original hors d'oeuvres book but this one takes it up a notch (sorry Emeril) and is more up to date with food trends. It's in Martha's bossy but methodical style. If you have teas or cocktail parties, this book is a must for your coookbook library 
 whatever field you are in, if you want to do some numerical computation, then buy this book. it is the best book on boundary value problems which is an important part in numerical computation, and of course, it is the more difficult part, compared to tht IVP.  This is the classic, this is the book. (borrowed from an ad 
 First, a caveat: I know Glenda, and like her very much. That being said, however, I'd also point out that I write this review without prompting, and wouldn't say a word of it if I didn't truly believe in the opinion expressed below.  Glenda's fantasy trilogy is a great read, with passion and tragedy and suspense and some brilliant worldbuilding. When it comes to creating a fantasy environment you can truly see, smell, taste and touch, I don't think there's another writer in the genre anywhere who can beat her. She's a master of this skill.  She also sets up difficult moral and ethical questions for her characters and doesn't let them off the hook. Also, throughout the trilogy (we've got it all in Australia, wheee!), Glenda takes bold chances in structure and execution, which means the books are refreshingly orginal and bold in style.  I'm pleased beyond words that readers in America are getting the chance to enjoy her work 
 So like any number of other American disaffected from the political process and the culture of corruption these days in Washington, I picked up Barack Obama's autobiography in hopes of finding someone to believe in for the future.  I'm not going to say I was disappointed, but the book wasn't your typical "I'm going to run for President someday, listen to my ideas" story either.  In fact, much of it isn't political at all, rather it is a well written, sometimes interesting, sometimes fascinating story about Obama's life from Hawaii to Indonesia to Chicago to Kenya.    Pay more attention to the subtitle than the title, as Obama very carefully develops his credibility on issues of race, and I was left with the impression that he may be one of the few who can speak with authority and eloquence on immigration, family, and the issue of black-white race relations that has haunted our country for so long.  He just might be someone who can start the healing process if given the chance.  The other aspect of this book I enjoyed the most was how refreshingly honest it is.  No political editing, no glossed over sections. Obama very clearly states what he did and didn't do, what his regrets are, and what he has learned from his mistakes.    And couldn't we all use a little bit of honesty and eloquence from our leaders about now?    Some say Obama is a rising star.  I hope so.  I gave it four stars because it gets a little long winded in places, but it is still a very good read 
 Here's the first of 2 volumes on Blue Note capturing the Jazz Messengers at the Cafe Bohemia on Nov. 23, 1955. Kenny Dorham, Hank Mobley, Horace Silver, and Doug Watkins join Blakey for the club date. "Prince Albert" is a handsome little tune by trumpeter Dorham, and "Alone together" features tenor saxophonist Mobley in a beautiful ballad performance. "What's new" features Watkins on bass and might be of limited appeal. Volume 1 is slightly better than Volume 2, but you shouldn't have one without the other--and both are very good 
 I've been vegetarian for 19 years and vegan-ish for 13 of those years.  I've got my share of veggie and vegan cookbooks, and this is the one I go to first.  The great feat of the book is that it makes simple, ordinary ingredients taste wonderful together.  Every recipe I've made has been a pleasant surprise at the end.  I like food spicy, and I always tend to question the spice measurements of most recipes, but Donna Klein's recipes seem to always get it just right.  I also like that the recipes are free of soy products and meat substitutes.  Another reviewer complained that the recipes were old hat, but I wonder if that reviewer actually tried them out or just read them.  Have faith that these recipes will surprise you with their great flavor, even when extremely simple 
 "Decisive Day" is a superbly constructed volume detailing the events leading to, the battle itself and the impact of the Battle of Bunker Hill. Meticulous detail is spent describing in-depth the events of the  battle; the sights, the sounds, the smells of that day. It truly takes you  back 225 years to Charlestown and puts you smack into the middle of the  battle. His attention to the real hero of the day, William Prescott, is  outstanding. This book is extremely readible and isn't bogged down with any  useless information. This is a great chance for anyone to learn more about  the battle than just the immortal phrase "don't fire till you see the  whites of their eyes.&quot 
  This is one of my #1 recommendations for anyone dealing with the death of a loved one or simply interested in spirit communication and the afterlife. A truly uplifting and inspirational collection of first-hand ADCs that will comfort and intrigue readers with every page.  ~ Bob Olson, OfSpirit.com Editor  
 Ignoring the religious aspects for the moment, this is a well-written and well-crafted set of books.  The author creates a consistent world, which believable characters.  The story is tight, the writing is good, plot is fun and dramatic. It is well worth reading.   Now that being said, I do not recommend these books to those who are sensitive to religious issues.  If you do not want your adolescent to have exposure to ideas that contradict your own then keep them away from these books.   I enjoyed it at 33.  My eleven year-old goddaughter has picked it up and seems to be enjoying it as well.  We will speak at length on what I do and do not disagree with afterwards 
 The black cup is unique and eye catching but the lid is not airtight and therefore leaks and does not keep the liquids hot. I still think it looks cool 
 Great book. We learned a number of admissions tips and strategies that helped our son get into college.  We will certainly hold on to the book and reference it when our sophomore starts filling out her applications 
 This item is a brand new book and the price is less than 1/10th of the brand new one. I recommend this company to everyone. Excellent shipment.. Thanks for a very fast service 
 There is much written about the songs and the artists.  To add, this is a great sounding record.  Robust bottom end and dark in the top likely due to the photographs appearing several times with EC in front of an RCA ribbon mic.  I've not heard the CD, but as for the vinyl, a good pressing.  The feel is live, and the non elimination of a healthy number of clams leads in support that this is a recording of a performance rather than yet another production number, in the same way as The Delivery Man and the subsequent performances of that material led me to see it as something a little less than live, a little more than a recording, and incidentally, my favorite of EC's records 
 I don't why they bother giving the Nobel Prize for literature to the bleak plays of Harold Pinter (2005) or the dreary novels of Kanzaburo Oe (1994), when we've had such a great writer as Sidney Sheldon around for the past four or five decades. This is one writer who deserved the ultimate prize, although now it is - alas - too late.  "The Other Side of Midnight" is perhaps his masterpiece. It is the story of Noelle, a naive young French girl who falls for a handsome American aviator during World War II. But when the war ends, Noelle waits in vain for her handsome flyer to return. Alone and abandoned, the young lady finds that she has to make her way by selling her body. She quickly discovers that she can make her sex appeal pay off and sleeps her way into movie stardom. All this time she keeps tabs on her aviator, who has returned to the US and started a family.   Several years later, when he loses his job, Noelle, now wife of a Greek millionaire, arranges to hire her former lover as her private pilot. Not recognizing his wealthy boss as the fragile young mistress he knew during the war, he is bewildered by Noelle's cruel treatment of him. This game of deception leads them both into very deadly territory.  A great book makes you want to read it. At the end of the day, that's the only prize worth struggling for: the prize of being read again and again and, in Sydney Sheldon's case, again and again and again and again.. 
 This book changed my life!  I couldn't put it down and the tragic though triumphant stories will never leave my mind.  Susan Bergman, who writes with all the beauty of classic authors, shares the stories of many different modern-day martyrs.  The pain and sorrow these people endured are beyond comprehension and yet their faith in Christ sustained them to the very end of their lives.  The legacy of faith and hope that these 'Spiritual Giants' left behind are worth their weight in gold.  Foxe's Book of Martyrs illuminated many a generation on the reality of Christian martyrdom but this book is for the present generation.  We are called to suffer many things and this book reminds us that it is all for a wonderful purpose.  God's Glory 
 required reading as background history  of Iraq, Oil, Middle East            to understand the future we need to understand the past to the best of our abilitie 
 In this book, Ms. Paget talks about orgasms, speciafically how an orgasm really starts in the brain and finishes...you know. I liked the clear, conscise information and how to get orgams more quickly, etc. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to know more about this subject, along with "Good Sex, a woman's guide". 
 The service and delivery time were good and so was my experience with this order 
 Suceeding in sport is not made by hazard.... it needs specific aptitudes that Mr WEINBERG et Mr GOULD explained very well in their booK. Please to the readers:can you give me the e mail ftom Mr Weinberg and Me Gould. I  want to join them. Thank you. MICHEL REQUE

 I know what you're thinking. You're thinking a story that unfolds entirely in the mind of a woman chained to a bed cannot be all that frightening. But you need to step back, take a breath and remember who is weaving this tale. "Gerald's Game" is a testament to Stephen King's versatility. Search all you want, you will not find another novel written from the perspective of a woman tethered to a bed after a sex game gone amok. The story, in the form of runaway ruminations, is spellbinding from the start. You'll begin with the flapping panic of a person bound and helpless with little hope of rescue. And then you float away on the fevered thoughts of the victim as she reflects on memories that are truly grim and frightening. Vintage King, it has shades of Dolores Claiborn, with sinister family secrets and weird connections to a solar eclipse. "Gerald's Game" is clever, original and masterfully written. Ultimately, it's as capitvating as any of King's mainstream horror and more so, in ways. Place your own bondage joke here and we're done 
 'nuff said.  It's simply the best book you could read if you own an aircooled VW.  Read it cover to cover, follow it's advice and you have a good headstart on being a great owner 
 Bergerud is magisterial in his approach, utilizing interviews with the participants and diaries as a principal tool for getting readers deep into the action.  Highly recommended 
 There are so many great r&b, jump blues oriented blues singers/guitarists, taht sometimes one disc has to cover a good overview, and this disc does the job.  It has plaenty of jump blues stompers, as well as draggers and boppers.  There is a little r'n'r but mostly shuffle blues rhythms, great for lindy hopping, jitterbug, jiving, or cruising or working on your 50's hotrod or custom.  Awesome rockin' cd, essential!  Also if you like Albert King, then Johnny Guitar Watson is a must(get "Hot Just Like TNT").  Buy this now!! 
 This is a timely, well written and exciting book. I enjoyed reading it. 
 Scott Bourne is an outstanding teacher and successful marketer.  The book exemplifies this by being well organized, very readable and packed with valuable information for any photographer wanting to market and sell photographs.  The three divisions of the book are well thought out.  As I considered marketing my photos the section on "general secrets" was very helpful.  The last two sections provide valuable information on who to contact for sales and all the issues that need to be considered to complete a successful business transaction. 
 As someone who has worked with polymer clay before purchasing the book, I was pleased with some of the tecniques presented in this book that I had never even thought of or tried.  If you are someone who is ready to dive in to using polymer clay, this is an excellent way to get started 
 This book dispels may ill-conceived notions people in developed world have about people in the rest of the world. Explains how the inability to put a value on assets in various parts of the world is a major cause for stymied growth. And the reason for this inability to quantify assets stems from the extralegal ways in which the assets are obtained.  Emphasizes the importance of institution building (over long periods of time) for the capitalism to really work. Explains why institution building is not always easy. Explains how, to set things right, extemely unpopular measures have to be taken (which upsets the some people who are afrid to lose their influence) which in many cases leads to unrest resulting in rollback of reforms.  Explains how to bring extralegal sections of the society into the fold in order to ensure long term success. Mentions the transformation of US over centuries into what it is today (largely governed by the rule of law) 
 I spent less on 3 of these dresses (purchased for 3 bridesmaids) than I spent on 1 dress I wore in a different wedding that I will NEVER be able to wear again!  This dress is gorgeous and I can wear it again for a night out with my DH.  The dresses were shipped VERY quickly, arriving in less than a week.  1 was on backorder and that arrived just 1 week after the initial order was placed.  Sizing is generous, so the dresses fit a bit looser than regular dress sizes and can easily be altered down.  If you don't want to bother with alterations, the PacificPlex return policy is fabulous and their customer service is outstanding.  
 This movie is a scream!  I laughed until I thought I was going to die.  Comedy doesn't get any better than this.  The characters are incredible.  It's amazing the actors could keep straight faces while making this movie!  Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!  It's even better the second time around 
 This book has several features that roll into a very useful action guide and reference manual.  IT executives should keep this book on their desk, and refer to it every time they have a significant decision to be made.    The book covers the IT field at the business level, not at the detailed technical level.  It treats the information management field from strategy formulation by the business, to operation and retirement of the IT asset.    In particular, at the end of each chapter are a series of 10-20 questions that any executive should ask every time she or he has to make judgements or decisions about IT.  These questions can be used and re-used throughout an entire career, and will enhance the individual's performance 
 Previous reviewers have commented that this book is an easy read- this is true in a sense. "Standing for Something" goes down like a long tall cool glass of crystal clear water on a weary soul. Clean, cool, pure and oh so refreshing and revitalizing. I read this book almost in one sitting and found it to be sober, enlightened, genuine, inspiring, motivating, comforting, humbling and sustaining. The truths, principles and qualities found in this book are timeless, universal and "common" in the sense that what is most personal to each is most common to all. But for me "Standing for Something" is also special for what one does NOT get from it. Unlike so many other books and authors around today one does not get the sense that the author is "promoting" the latest "self-help" angle, or seeking to pierce the market with the latest spin on old material, or even that he is attempting to "put his best foot forward" in a new work. Rather one gets the sense that the content of this book flows naturally and effortlessly out of the mind, heart and long rich life experience of a man who speaks through his book no differently than he would any day of the week if you were sitting with him in person in his living room. In todays world this is a rare and refreshing quality and in my opinion is what gives the book its satisfying resonance and credibility. This is a book one can read over and over and still glean new insight and nourishment from with each read- not necessarily because of its "originality" as so many other authors would like to have you believe about themselves- but rather through each read one is reminded of ones own deepest and best self in refreshing and inspireing ways. How can that not be appealing? It is difficult for me to imagine a single individual anywhere who could not benefit from this book 
 This collection of lovingly-selected Hammond organ feature tunes is a must-have for anyone who shares the addiction for the sounds of electro-mechanical music.  It's not only brilliant, it's historic.  I'm not guaranteeing you'll like every cut on the CD; there are one or two that I find a bit tedious.  You may not love every track...  but even my less favorite tracks are still salient in that they contribute to the full-round picture of the capabilities of Hammond consoles and artists.  If you have a jazz fan or any keyboardist in your circle of friends, this would be a great gift 
 This book has contributed to my understanding of living in the present moment more than anything else I've read. In fact I've read it several times and plan on reading it again. Highly recommended to anyone seeking higher consciousness 
 This is a very comprehensive book.  I enjoy it and find it very helpful 
 Incest and dirty double hearted deeds that led all to this tragedy! In cattle and horses siblings are breed that good genes double and bad ones die out. In humans it engenders a madness of the superego  that leads to downfall and disgrace for all. " Get thee to a nunnery " is the other side of "Tis Pity She's A Whore". There is no wrong save "they" said it were so. For men are but animals and their empty morals all useless inventions? We would better in these latter days trust  to DNA science than outmoded conventions 
 THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITE PRODUCTS.. I CAN ONLY SAY I HAVE VERY DRY SKIN AND THIS PRODUCT IS FANTASTIC.. VERY MOISTURIZING AND CONDITIONING.. IT DOES EXACALLY WHAT IT SAYS AND HAS A WONDERFUL SCENT TOO... 
 It is a great book for training for speed in soccer. It is short, on the point and has a set of excellent practice programs which one can use. It definitely helped me a lot to develop a personalized training system. The shortcoming is that it doesn't discuss to much the physiology of the exercises 
  The author's stated objectives are to examine Franklin's medical contributions, show how his knowledge was influenced by eighteenth-century medicine, and describe how his life and medical views were shaped by his own chronic conditions.   Franklin's views on the importance of exercise, eating and drinking modestly, breathing fresh air, obtaining a good night's sleep and avoiding things dangerous to the health are described. His improvements in stoves, furnaces and ventilation systems contributed to disease prevention. Franklin used Poor Richard's Almanac as a vehicle to make colonists aware of lead poisoning, and the importance of getting inoculated for small pox, after losing his son to this disease. He used electrical shock therapy to treat depression. His bifocals and the long arm made life easier for the aged and infirm   This book is more than a listing of Franklin's medical contributions. Dr. Finger recounts Franklin's role in founding the Pennsylvania Hospital and the first medical school in the colonies. The Library Company and American Philosophical Society were started by Franklin to foster the exchange of medical information to a much wider audience. Franklin favored hard evidence based on repeated observations and experiments when approaching his own chronic conditions of gout and a large bladder stone.   This very readable book exceeds its stated objectives. The author often lets Franklin speak for himself, the annotations are scholarly, and the illustrations enhance the masterfully crafted text.   Hundreds of books have been written about Franklin, but this is the first book to emphasize Franklin's contributions to medicine, a part of his life largely overlooked until now. It definitely should be read by anyone who wants to know more about Franklin, not just professional historians or people engaged in the healing arts.   
 Just when you think that all of the truly intriguing plot lines have been taken, along comes Peter Robinson.  "Strange Affair" left me a little breathless and full of admiration for Robinson's ability to weave a complex story around the brittle and edgy Chief Inspector Alan Banks and his sometimes love interest Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot.  In reading fiction, I get really tired of babysitting flawed characters who are written with the expressed desire to add quirkiness, but Banks and Cabbot are not gratuitously damaged and they make bad decisions that seem logical in the light of how humans are wired.   In this case, a beautiful young woman is found in her car on a deserted stretch of road with a bullet in her brain and Alan Banks' address in her pant pocket.  Is this murder tied to two other similar murders in the same region?  And why in heavens name does she have Banks' address on her person?  The answer won't be forthcoming because Banks is on holiday in pursuit of his own demons, namely an estranged brother who has left a desperate message asking for help and then disappeared. This journey takes Banks to London and submerges him in the shadowy and unexpected world of his brother's business dealings and situations where he has no authority and no backup.  While Banks is trolling the underbelly of London's stock speculators and arms merchants, Cabbot is following the trail of the dead girl back to London and trying to reach Banks through his relatives before an official APB must be issued to find him for an explanation of his connection to the dead girl.  The clock is running and Robinson does a masterful job of weaving the parallel stories as they get closer and closer to each other and then collide with a tremendous crash.  This is something like the 15th book in this series and it is well worth it to go back to the beginning.  My favorite was "In a Dry Season", which sported one of the most unique plot lines I can ever remember.  The one to avoid is Robinson's first book entitled "The First Cut".  It is completely original but a little unbelievable and not nearly as well written as his subsequent work 
 Its not even worth rating any other GU productions.  This is easily the best.  Budapest was another great one as well.  Warren finds flows naturally.  In an industry of 80 billion DJ's, very few can make magic the way this guy can.  A natural 
 Who doesnt love the Wind in the Willows? great book for children, I love it even now as a college student. I brought it with me and keep it on my bookshelf in my dorm room. The sweet little mole, the wise old badger, and of course, the silly and carefree toad-what charming characters! everyone must read this book at some point over the course of their lifetime, and will most likely chose to read it again soon after. 
 As a little girl in the early 1960's, Little Bear's Friend was one of my  favorite books. What a joy to discover that this old friend is still  available for my three year old daughter to enjoy 
 My grandma got this movie for my baby sister at disney store and she is a big fan of little einsteins and it is really good for her because she just loves it alot.When she wines or cries this movie will make her happy and t is suitable for little kids even babies 
 This is an excellent, practical resource for anyone interested in improving their supply chain. The author has done an outstanding job at explaining specifically, in practical terms, how to use Lean Six Sigma methods to achieve supply chain improvements. The lucid explanations provides valuable guidance for both experienced and novice Lean Six Sigma practitioners. Using this reference as a guide will assist you in realizing supply chain improvements quickly.  
 Our church is an established congregation over 200 years old that is transitioning toward a "Purpose Driven" ministry focus. This book was just what we needed to guide us through the process. We are well on our way and are following the 8 steps laid out in the book. I highly recommend it 
 it was when the mass hanging scene was stupidly inserted two , not just one, long church hymns, with a cardboard-like preacher on the gallows to conduct the crowd to sing them, and a condemned-by-hanging rapist kept monologuing about 10 minuntes to synchronize those two hymns, this movie was beginning to fall flat miserably.  the other ridiculous and illogic part was when the marshal escorted the two young rustlers and that murderer back to where the hanging judge resided, why he suddenly had to take a route across a vast desert instead of going back by the original path where the posse came from? there's no way and no excuse to make such stupid arrangement simply just because the director and the screenplay writers wanted to show how difficult and tough the marshal got to do a heroic dead-man-walking mission, then turned himself out for the next lame a-hero-was-born scene.  there were wonderful moments of this film, but it started to drag along and lag behind gradually. it often gave you an impression that both the screen writers and the director didn't have a clue how to make this movie going, they could only asked clint eastwood, the marshal, to do lot of unnecessary hollow scenes.    
 A quick easy read with big ideas and great concepts.  This and Gladwell's Tipping Point should be on all the high school reading lists.  Together, these books would make great graduation gifts.    Provides alot of useful insight and forethought 
 Lilly is a 14 year old white girl in the south. Her mother was shot (unclear by who, but Lilly feels responsible) in infancy, and she has been raised by her mean, hateful father, who punishes her for any little infraction of his inflexible rules by forcing her to kneel for hours bare kneed on grits (among other tortures). Lilly's only friend is the African American housekeeper/babysitter, Rosaleen.  When Rosaleen decides she has to go to town to register to vote, she gets into an argument with a typical white cracker character--and she and Lily end up in jail. Lilly is bailed out by her father, but she escapes, and then breaks Rosaleen out of the hospital (she was beaten half to death by the police after Lilly was bailed out).  On the lam, Lilly decides to try and find out about her mother. She and Rosaleen end up in the home of a trio of Black sisters, who survive making the best honey in the county.   Of course, ultimately, their summer of freedom ends, and reality comes crashing back in, when Lilly is found by her father.  While the story is somewhat predictable, Kidd keeps the tension, moves the plot forward, and does a superb job of getting into the heads of all of the characters. While the racism of the time is clearly a subtext to the entire plot, it is (with a few obvious exceptions) the subtext, and not the foreground. This allows the reader to discover what racism feels like from the inside.  A very good read 
 A storyteller who can grab your attention and keep it is "doing his job", I guess.  Grishham is one of my favorite pop-lit writers and who only disappoints occasionally, never completely.  This is one of those times and the only time, I think, that I've caught a whiff of his boredom.  In The Broker, he seems to rush, or telescope the plot, leaving out detail in the continuity so that the denouement arrives all the quicker.  I dunno, maybe it's just me.    Anyway, it's a satisfying read for all Grisham fans.  I'm looking forward to reading his new non-fiction book.  (Maybe it's the reason he rushed to complete this one!) 
 This is a real page-turner. Despite the fact that you know the outcome of this story, Joe Simpson takes you with him on the impossible journey. You'll have no trouble making time to read right through this exciting book. 
 This is not an easy book for me to review.  Despite its verbosity, repetitiveness, and simplification, Atlas Shrugged made me think about the nature of humanity - and the struggle for happiness - in a new and unique way, and for that it should be applauded.  It argues for a standard of personal morality based on hard work and ones word, and it's one that I fully agree with.  Furthermore, the book provides a window into the thinking of a lot of the "James Taggart's" that I see where I live (in Los Angeles), which is invaluable.  Not many books make me sit down and think and for that I am giving it a high rating.  On to the objections:  1. Everything is projected in abject black and white - either you're on the side of laissez-faire capitalism, or you're a degenerate looter and moocher.  There isn't anything portrayed that's in between - Ayn Rand thinks that you "can't have your cake and eat it too," but this is a fundamental straw man argument and doesn't reflect objective reality.  There are plenty of honest, hardworking businessmen and women who understand the nature of the society in which they live, and use the much-despised "pull" to secure their accomplishments - without betraying themselves or their values.     2. Ignoring the dangers of monopoly.  If a company performs its actions and achieves its objectives better than everyone else, driving them out of business, I have no problem with it.  But what inevitably happens without some governmental restrictions on monopoly is stagnation and price increases, suppressing of new competition through local price cutting below cost, contracts with competitors in restraint of trade, and the like.  See Standard Oil as a historical example.  3. Unrealistic character dialogue.  Dagny, Rearden, Anconia, and Galt seem incapable of having a regular, everyday conversation - everything revolves around finding out the truth of objectivism and, once finding it, exorting the wonders of it.  This can be straining; there's a lot of dialogue in this 1000+ page book and you'll sit there wishing they talked about other things from time to time.  4. Repetitiveness: I will admit that when Dagny left Galt's Gulch, around page 800,  I skimmed the rest of the book.  At this point Rand had demonstrated what she wanted to accomplish and most of the stuff past here was highly repetitive.  Galt's 50 page speech was a prime example of this.  Interestingly the buddy who let me borrow this book also had starting skimming where I had.  5. Sex bordering on rape.  This is a theme in The Fountainhead as well and  such fetishtic acts - occuring over and over - seem a little disturbing.  Ultimately, people need to be free to accomplish and succeed - and there is no doubt that a capitalistic society is more productive than any other kind, and that the more socialist it gets, the worse off it is -- but I remain unconvinced that complete laissez-faire capitalism is the answer.  There needs to be taxes to pay for public roads, for the military, for police and the fire department, and for enforcing limited governmental regulations.  I'm also in favor of a very limited social safety net - i.e. unemployment benefits - tied strongly toward the unemployed finding new jobs in a short time frame.  However, we've gone far, far beyond these things - Europe today is in a terrible state, slowly collapsing under itself, and unfortunately, the U.S. is slowly following in its footsteps.  
 I have never been an erotica reader before, but my wife and I thought we'd try it.  It has definately added something fun and a little naughty to our sex life.  The first few stories are a little slow, but they pick up 
 Anything by this director is going to be amazing. i like how his films pay so close attention to the place that the story is set in- in no other film will you hear wind blowing through the grass and bugs flying around your head. it is a powerful story as wel 
 Excellent look at race issues in America that apply today even though the book was written more tha a decade ago 
 I couldn't add anything else to the other comments; just buy it - you will not regret 
 Finally, a book by V.C. Andrews that dosen't involve the main character falling in love with her brother/cousin/uncle.  It is a breath of fresh air 
 I bought this on a recommendation from another web site. While the book has alot of information in it I mainly wanted the DVD inside of the book. I have to say I was not disappointed in the book and felt it was a good thing to refer to also. 
 Roll of Thunder hear my Cry is a great book with heart touching parts. The narrator in the book is Cassie Logan. She tells the stories on horrible things some boys do in her neighborhood. The is the time of segregation. Cassie tells how her family is losing some of the land and how one of her brother's friends is in a whole lot of trouble. 
 So many art smocks are too little for elementary students, but these were big enough to both fit and cover school uniforms!  Hooray for no more paint on white shirts 
 I'm completely addicted to Zoe Mellor's designs as it is, but when I saw this book was coming out, I had to have it!  I only received my copy a few weeks ago but I've already made two of the toys.  The patterns are just adorable!  I made the dinosaur as a baby shower gift and the mom-to-be loved it!  It's great to be able to mix and match my leftover skeins in such creative and fun ways.  My three year old has already poured over the pictures and picked out her rather long wish list of knitted toys she simply cannot live without!  So quick and easy to make, not to mention economical if your yarn budget is limited!  And absolutely ADORABLE!! 
 	The book's strength lies in its intellectual rigor.  William Edmundson starts at some specific notion of rights and follows its reasoning to the end: either the reader sees the final consequences or Edmundson sees the arrival of a new question.  Or he begins with the contrast between two apparently similar ideas, and then follows this contrast as far as it will go.  The result is a fertile field for classroom discussions.  Edmundson frequently offers an abstract line of reasoning without supporting examples.  In places almost every sentence could open a lengthy exchange.  The result is a book where ideas travel fast and the reading is often dense.  One hopes that the professors dish out the parts of the book in bite-size pieces. 
 This book was definitely not boring! I read it in 3 days and couldn't put it down like a good novel but I was actually learning stuff I probably should have known already.   Some reviews have complained about the book leaving out some of the important southern battles. In defense of this book, it has given me enough information and interest in this part of history that I plan on finding another source to fill in the gaps. 
 After being in a 15 month "relationship" with a commitment phobic partner I bought this book. It has a number of practical exercises which helped me realize what had been going on from day one. Unfortunately I hadn't trusted my own intuition or the warnings my friends, her friends and my family gave me as I felt so in love. This book gave me the insight on what she was doing and I was doing which weren't helping. It took me a while but with the help of this book I gained the courage, tools and life skills to rebuild my life which I am now happy to say no longer includes her. Be warned though, you may also find things about yourself which you perhaps don't want to know either. It's facing these issues in both myself and her which ultimately have helped me to move on. If you really want to sort out commitment phobia issues, this book is the one for you 
 As far as my opinion goes this is my favorite Pink Floyd album. I am a huge fan and like all their music but this one is just amazing. It also seems unfair how under appreciated this album is. It may not have that one huge hit as some of the other albums had, but this one is classic Floyd. Must have for any fan of classic rock music 
 I hesitated for a year to upgrade from the 550 to the 580 because, on paper, I did not see much advantage.  In fact, the 580 is a worthwhile upgrade.  I like the new dial on the back for adjusting exposure compensation, etc. and the catchlight screen is a nice touch but the biggest advantages are the incredibly fast recycling time and smailler size.  I can machine gun my 1Ds2 and this flash keeps up.  The 550 could not.  It is small enough not to overwhelm my little Rebel too.  I did note that there is some vignetting at 24mm with a direct flash unless I drop the wide lens screen.  The manual says ths will not happen but it does.  Not a big deal since I use a Gary Fong diffuser or bounce flash almost always 
 This is a very cute book with lively illustrations, but I was surprised when I received it that it was not written by Jack Prelutsky.  The poems were selected by him, and they are enjoyable, but to me don't compare with  his wonderful, zany poems that my children always want to hear.  So, buyer  beware- make sure these books are not "selected" by him or edited  by Mr. Prelutsky if you want the real thing 
 This album contains some of Queen's greatest tracks-the rollicking Fat Bottomed Girls , Bicycle Race and one of my favourite queen songs-Don't Stop Me Now. Also noteworthy are the fast paced Let Me Entertain You and Fun It , the melancholy Leaving Home Ain't Easy and Jealousy , the Middle Eastern style  Mustapha and the waltzing 50's style Dreamer's Ball. An excellent album featuring a very important stage in the bands development. 
 Absolutely excellent! I use Procini's all the time. The quality of these are first rate. In addition, the quantity of these are such that the value is high...no more will I buy little bags in the grocery store 
 Printer+Copy+Scanner Canon MF3240 is a simple machine to use. I bought it for home use, works perfectly with my laptop, I do not have to worry about how many pages the printing job is, since the printer is a monochrome cartridge laser which lower the cost of printing at home.  I am satisfied with the multifuction futures, and its simplicity to use, I do not use all at the same time but I have it for any project after  the office or weekends. The printer's size was a little bigger than I expected but overall it is a good value purchase.   
 The Irish In Victorian Britain: The Local Dimension is an informative and compelling collection of essays presenting recent research findings on the experience of Irish men and women , especially with reference the specific Victorian era communities of Birmingham, Camborne, Hull, London, and Stafford, as well as South Wales and the North-East of Britain. The contributors address a wide variety of issues with the entire body of work resulting in a seminal, scholarly, benchmark examination of the Irish experience in Britain during the reign of Queen Victoria 
 This is the best book I've read on the "problem" of the evolution of life and its probability throughout the universe. He reviews all of the major theories and gives up-to-date critiques. I concluded that  at bottom the only reason for not believing that life is common in the  universe is the argument of incredulity: "I can't imagine how life  could have evolved, so therefore it must either be exceedingly rare or  miraculous." In fact, there's no reason for believing that there is  anything especially unusual about our solar system or our planet Earth, so,  following the Copernican Principle, life is probably everywhere 
 A lot of this book confirms stuff I already suspected; that Christianity had inherited the Greek-Roman civilization and this was an important tool in converting Germanic and Slavic chiefdoms (in which case the chiefdoms became statehoods); how missionaries targeted the kings who, after conversion, enforced the religion on their people; and that the `pagan threat' of the Vikings wasn't really all that `pagan'.  But I learned more after reading this book; the importance of monasticism in the conversion of the aristocracies under the kings; how converted kings waited a generation or two before destroying the indigenous religions; the importance of pilgrimage to the Christianized Irish and how that took them all over western Europe in their missionary efforts (before that, I was guilty of viewing the Irish church as isolated); how some pagan societies in eastern Europe emerged as statehoods (and thus not as attracted to Greek-Roman civilization as much as earlier converts were) and therefore had to be subdued by merciless crusading forces. Some of these crusades in eastern Europe reminded me of how the Americas was lost to the American Indians during Christendom's expansion across the Atlantic; rather than converting the natives, they were simply driven out of the land which was then colonized by western European Christians.  The downside to this book (tortuous writing about all these monks founding monasteries at boonies-shire and sticks-bury have already been addressed by other viewers) is that it doesn't tell us much about how Christianity affected the slave trade or its evolution into serfdom. I was under the impression that slavery dwindled in Europe after its Christianization but there are passages in this book that suggests that it continued for quite some time well into the middle ages, but he doesn't have much to say on the subject. He does mention Frankish monasteries that banned the murder and torture of slaves but that's about it.  I would also have liked to see more of how the monks who founded missionary monasteries affected the lower class populations but the author addresses this as much as the surviving evidence allows him to, so it's not his fault, but that evidence doesn't tell us much. We do learn though, that some people were bitter because the missionaries destroyed their former rites without giving them new ones (suggesting that religious devotion for the lower classes after their baptism was not a big deal to the religious leaders). There is also some slight evidence that the people did not like the strict abstinence preached and practiced by the religious leaders and were quick to notice any hypocrisy in the observance of these dogmas by these priests, monks, and missionaries.  Perhaps it might not be appropriate for this book, but I would like to have read more about heretical groups like the Albigensians in the chapter that discusses rival monotheisms (one of the rival monotheisms, Islam, was considered a heresy anyway). Perhaps there would be room for this if fewer pages were spent detailing the accounts of various monks founding monasteries.  Don't let these criticisms fool you into thinking that this book is not worth the read. It is very worth it. It doesn't completely close the gap between the modern age and antiquity but it does close a large portion of it. After reading this book, the middle ages will help mankind's timeline appear to flow much more smoothly and won't look so blocky 
 excellent revised/expanded edition of the classic albers theory/anti-theory of color. the classic that most art schools continue to base their color courses on, this edition has more reproductions from the original collectors hand silkscreened edition and is nearly twice the number of pages 
 As a superman fan I watched the whole series in a week and I am working also. I finally got to see them got married and have kid!! The whole season was everything I ever asked for.  The only missing thing was the special futures. I belive there could be more to it then just a chronology 
 I received them as promised for Xmas. The old lady loved them. Thank 
 I loved the book because the chapters were short and too the point. I returned to reviewed the books several times.  When you are tired reading in short increments helps 
 What i loved about this book is that it gave straightforward information without it being too cerebral or too dumbed down.  It gives a great summary of the milestones of the things you should expect from your child, and what to do if you don't see them happening.  I feel very confident about raising a healthy and happy boy with this book around 
 I have to say that I really enjoyed this film.  It is well done and not to mention beautifully shot. It has become one of my favorite films and is much better than most of the drivel that comes out of Hollywood these days.  Most times films are so overhyped that once you sit down to see them you are most often times disappointed.  This film did not receive that much hype and it does not disappoint.  If you love horses, adventure, beautiful scenery and a film about the spirit of man and his horse, then please do see it.  And lets face it (ladies) Viggo Mortensen is just as beautiful as the scenery around him.  He is a very good actor and an underated one at that.  So sit back, pop some corn and enjoy a good adventure.  And admire one of God's most majestic creations...........the horse. (and viggo mortensen!! 
 My wife tried to get me to read this book soon after we got married. Being a guy, I didn't want to read some girly book about love though! O what a mistake! Nine years later, I had a change of heart and discovered that I had missed out on so much in the last nine years because I didn't understand the language my wife was speaking. If you want to be able to show your spouse that you love them and/or you are confused about why they don't seem to show you love, then read this book. It will open up a whole new world of understanding for you 
 Does anyone know when and if this title is going back into the Disney vault?????   Please e-mail me:  anthony2004@earthlink.net  Thank you very much 
 Loved the movie.  The cast was terrific.  It was sad but very funny 
 In the book "Among The Heroes:United Flight 93 & the passenger & crew who fought back" author Jere Longman tells about the amazing people who would be on Flight 93 and when face with something that no person should face, they put aside their fear and rose to the challenge in fighting back men who wanted to harm against this nation. What I liked about the this book Longman, he does not try to a make one person efforts seems better than another, instead he tells the readers about the passangers and crew lives and these experences could make them able to deal with crisis. It is a great 9-11 book that should not be missed 
 If you like Steve Winwood or think you know him but not sure, buy this DVD.  His is wonderful.  All the songs are great and they jam on every song.  This is well worth your money.  Don't miss it 
 Writing is very lyrical, with excellent use of imagery.  Ninety percent of the metaphors work.  However, some of the metaphors do not make comlete sense in context and are mixed (See LRB article by Nicholas Spice).   Although some reviewers dislike the books non-linear storytelling and structure, I thought it worked well.  Each of the scenes feeds into the next and allows reader to get a better understanding of character, events, or themes.  The book is not entirely historically accurate and is more similar to taking a trip inside a very imaginative and talented person's stories based on history. The use of imagery and the creative, if not entirely accurate, use of historical events or people as "snapshots" that evoke feelings or ideas is a theme that occurs extensively throughout Ondaatje's poetry (ex: "Elizabeth"), so it is not surprising to find it in his novel.   Another weakness with the novel was that the characters and events often functioned more to explore themes, which made the character behave in ways that would not be truly realistic.  The English patient, Katherine, and Hana and lost some depth becuase of this.  Kip is probably the most multidimensional character in the book.  The movie, especially Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas, did a far better job of bringing the other characters to life. You would probably enjoy this book if any of the following are true: you like the poetry of Wallace Stevens, you like and prefer historical fiction that is romantic or has strong story telling elements over historical fiction that is 100% true to its time (think Tale of Two Cities, Love in the Time of Cholera, Gone with the Wind, etc.), or you are not a historical event nitpicker.   A novel does not always have to be historically 100% accurate (hence the term FICTION), but is often an exploration of emotions, themes, or ideas.  I enjoyed the novel, even though it was not "perfect. 
 This is one of the best CD's that I have heard this year and maybe would even go into the "desert island disc" category.  It is even better than the first CD by Glow, Rain Theory 
 I watched this movie in a middle school music class. It was so funny and the whole class loved it.It is about a school and they need a new nun to teach music because it is geting out of hand, so they get whoopi to fake being a nun.[sister Marie Clarence]When she teaches them at first it was a struggle but then she their hidden talent of singing she has a great idea to start a choir and that is what they have to do to pass the class-say good bye to bird class. This movie was so much fun from begining to end. I enjoyed it so much i want to buy it and i bet when you whatch this movie you will want to buy it to. 
 This tank is exactly as it looks in the photo or better. The quality of the inside bra is high. I bought the white one and it covers and hangs my chest properly. Straps can be adjusted. I really would like to have it in other colors but they only sell them in white and ivory :- 
 A quick easy to reference book on spell crafting that covers a large variety of life's occurances.  Not all the ingredients in the spells are easy to come by, but all in all a good little spell book 
 I found this book enjoyable in several ways - as a practical and creative guide to use Catholic traditions in your home and as a well-researched historical perspective on traditions and rituals in my faith. It would appeal to any one who is interested in the different manifestations of the Catholic faith employed by those practicing this religion and those who grew up Catholic.       
 I absolutely recommend this book to everyone who is likely to encounter a dog in their lifetime! It is chock-full of excellent information and is written in a very accessible voice. I also love the author's sense of humor 
 One of the best romantic and funny movies of the last 10 years! The story is almost the same like the movie Road Trip, only it was made earlier and is much better 
 With relations between the West and the Islamic world worsening rapidly, a better understanding of Islam and its roots is badly needed in the West.    One major barrier between understanding Islamic culture is the key sacred text, the Q'uran, has been little studied in the West, and until recently, good translations were unavailable.  Many Qurans were translated into the same sort of english as the King James Bible, and not a glint of the Quran's revevered poetic beauty was reflected in such translations.  Thankfully, better translations in modern English are being made by leading Islamic scholars who have a more sensitive ear to the poetry of the Quran, as well as a better understanding of the influence and appeal this text has for believing Muslims.    Like all great works of literature, especially a poetic one like the Quran, its power and beauty can only be appreciated in its original language.  This is why Muslims often say the Quran is untranslateable, but when one hears a verse of the Quran being sung aloud with a little knowledge of Arabic, the beauty (while unfortunately not fully understandable) does start to become apparent.    But, even in translation, when read carefully the Quran still has great beauty from a literary viewpoint.  The most beautiful part of the Quran in my view is the 'Light' surah, which compares God to a light whose glory fills the entire cosmos.  This surah has been a favourite with Sufis, Islamic theologians like Al-Ghazzali, and also Muslim philosophers as well.    While the Quran does contain descriptions of violence and its style is often difficult to read for the Westerner, it is important to study this work with patience and try and see it as an organic whole rather than a fragmented jumble of poems.  It is in this sense the deep underlying unity of the Quran and its theology (which reflects the unity of Allah, the divinity in Islam) becomes apparent, especially in the names of God.    A good knowledge of this religious classic is becoming indispensible in a world where Islam is becoming more important to understand from a global perspective 
 This book was surprisingly interesting about the life of screen gossip Louella Parsons and her shenanians in tinseltown. I thoughoutly enjoyed it. This would make an interesting movie 
 Consent & deny. Filling in the gaps with retro-fitted pleasure craft billbowas, frittering away the last vestiges of ceiling con-cavedness, somewhat fluid morants of militancy are left hanging by a chad. Helping the booze bound will be tantamount to a feeling of dis-servatude. Catfish? 
 This book is written by physicians  for physicians to give some guidance about work restrictions/limitations and uses common sense, art as well as the science in work-related injuires and illnesses. At the same the authors helps to translate and make sense our of the legal definitions of the work comp world of lawyers, case managers, and employers. I wish I had read a book like this in medical school or residency. Easy to read and understand 
 If you like Johnny Cash at all, this will be an excellent purchase.  "Hurt" got a lot of attention, but "When the Man Comes Around" is arguably the best song on the album.  Some of the covers seem to be odd choices, but they work.  Note that there are two editions of this CD, one with a bonus DVD of the "Hurt" video and one without 
 I love this book! I was hooked after page one, fascinated by a couple plucking themselves out of Philadelphia to hike the Pacific Crest Trail, unsure of the adventure and each other. Years ago we backpacked many weekends on several of the trails the Ballards hiked across. But being a hiker isn't necessary to enjoy the reverence and discovery as the couple set about their arduous trip. It's a very interesting,human story, written by two nice people 
 This is not the first thing I have read from Lonni Collins Pratt, but it  is my favorite.  The simplicity and power with which the book is written is  wonderful.  It was a breath of fresh air to read a book about monastic  spirituality that was down to earth.  There was not any fluff.  It was  truly a wonderful book with powerful applications for modern living 
 Expectations were high for this album and Chris really delivered!  This is a first rate CD from the songs to the production!  Chris calls it progressive traditional which is a perfect name for it.  The songs would be very at home on the radio today, yet he holds true to traditional country.  The song selection is so diverse with no fillers here!  Each song stands on it's own.  They all tell a story; whether it is a tearjerker, a great tongue in cheek comedic song, or an uplifting, feel good song.  His rich baritone voice resonates on the ballads, which he does a phenomenal job with and then he rocks out with the best of them on some up-tempo southern rock.  He starts with a fun up-tempo song, Beer or Gasoline, runs the gamut of emotions and then leaves us with Who's Gonna Take me Home.  Who wouldn't want to at that point!  In a concert, I bet he would have a lot of takers.  There's truly something here for everyone and you won't be disappointed 
 I had mixed feelings when I bought and listened to Sneaker Pimps' first album - "Becoming X". After listening to "Bloodsport", I realized what the problem was - the songs were great but the singing sucked! Kelli sounds like a small child and her voice did not have the level of maturity required to sing those dark, moody songs. After hearing Chris' mature and "intelligent" voice, the situation was completely rectified. I haven't heard their second album "Splinter" yet, but I think I can safely say I will probably like it now that I know Chris also sings on it. My only confusion is why Chris didn't sing in the first place - he has a great voice and I would love to hear "Becoming X" redone with his voice.   As far as the album "Bloodsport" itself, if you like this type of music - pseudo-electronic, moody, Depeche Modey - there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't like this album. The songs have unusual yet catchy vocal melodies and lyrics, and the music is just superb. 
 I must admit that initially I didn't want to watch this movie. I'm not a big Brad Pitt fan and I viewed this as just another vehicle for Brad to strike a glamorous pose or two and nothing more. Fortunately I changed my mind and gave it and chance and I'm happy I did.  'Troy' released in '04 is an epic of grand proportions, brilliantly directed with a crisp script, stellar cast and memorable soundtrack. Brad Pitt was perfect for the part of Achilles as was Eric Bana as Hector. I would also like to credit Peter O'Toole for delivering one of his best performances in years as Priam, King of Troy, Diane Kruger as the lovely Helen and Sean Bean in the role of King Odysseus 
 Although I usually preffer more energetic D&B this album really caught me by surprise. The beats are so precise and well executed. I really enjoyed the amount of control that Photek had over the music. Don't go in thinking this will be dieselboy or DJ DB because it's not. It's an entirely different beast. It's a bit more along the lines of Polygon Window mixed with Amon Tobin's walls of sound. It's a really great album to relax and read to. Some of the tracks can be a bit stale but most of them are pretty great, especially track one (it's my fav) 
 This work is simply beautiful, transporting one into a world of ethereal finesse and high art.  Don't believe me?  Buy this and listen for yourself - I am sure if you have any sense of beauty, you will agree 
 I grew up inspired by Science Fiction, and eventually had the privilege of working on the Space Shuttle program for several years.  Of all the many SF stories I have read, The Menace From Earth has always been one of my favorites.  There are other stories more technically inspiring, or with better drawn characters.  There is none that conveys the sense of humans fitting in to a non-earth environment and making it their home with such ease and inspiration.  When the flying starts, the story becomes simply lyrical 
 Koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late 1500s. The career and tactics of this Admiral are still studied at the U.S. Naval Academy, and doubtless those of other nations. The screenplay is based on a couple of novels, so there is some fiction, but the life of Yi Soon Shin was well documented, so there's plenty of fact supporting the story.   If you are not familiar with Korean Drama, it's good to keep in mind that  this is not a Hollywood product, but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non-Hollywood budgets involved, and it's easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told.   It's a long series, but presents an epic with power, depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode.  It would be great also to see KBS make other dramas available for viewing through Amazon, such as "Seoul 1945".       
 	"Time, time, time, see what's become of me!"  	The image of time as a sports car racing swiftly away from the curb of our existence is a picture which those of us, in that joyous span of life known as "middle-age," can see with utter clarity.  In today's society, we have an abundance of riches: possessions, unparalleled affluence, access to information and images, instantaneous communication and freedom of expression.  And yet, for all of our multi-tasked nirvana, we are simple beggars as time slips through our fingertips.  	Gary Eberle conducts us on a delightful exploration of the concept of time - its evolution, its importance, its scarcity, and our obsession with filling every nook and cranny of the thing.  Drawing on both personal reflection and academic considerations, the author examines our fixation with robotic productivity and offers thoughtful ways to effectively slow the pace of daily living to a level that is consistent with the internal rhythms of our being.  	One of my favorite sections is Chapter 4: Books of Hours, which examines the concept of prayer as an integral part of daily existence and in finding our internal tranquility.  Rather than viewing Liturgical Prayer as a numbing restrictive regimen, Gary Eberle offers its liberating patterns as a tonic for temporal gastric distress.  	The book is well written and holds the reader's interest throughout the 200+ pages.  It is well worth the time! 
 Before I read this book, I was like most non-biologists out there.  I'd heard of the theory of evolution, but had an incomplete understanding of what it meant and if it really had any meaning in the "real world".   It was from this book that I learned that every living creature has an evolutionary past, and that this past has to be considered to understand how animals (including humans) behave. There is so much beauty in nature owed to evolutionary processes--this book is a good place to start if you want to understand that beauty in biological terms 
 This program is great!  I use it all the time during my morning commute.  Makes the long drives that much more bearable, and I can already see the difference in my Japanese!  Highly recommend this program to anyone looking to improve their Japanese ability 
 I read a few of her books, finding this one the most ... shall we say, approachable. Not that the others weren't well-written, but this one is plot-driven and funny, rather than a serious character study (like "The Bookshop") 
 Fans only review:  OK, so David has lost a step, voice wise.  Well, what do you expect after years of movies and being the growly-voiced Buster Poindexter?  What we have here, really, is a band's tribute to its fallen members:  in order, Billy Murcia (original drummer), Johnny Thunders (guitar), and Jerry Nolan (drums).  Syl Sylvain, David Johansen, and Arthur Kane still rock hard for this Festival Hall show.  What we as fans get is the same intensity that's on those records from the 70's.  Hard, driving rock and roll that preceded punk, with hard-rock licks provided by Syl, and off-Jagger vocals by Mr. Johansen.  The lyrics run the gamut from sex and drugs to, well, sex, and drugs.  Check out "Lookin For A Kiss," "Vietnamese Baby," and "Personality Crisis" if you don't belive me.  This concert also serves as a final, wonderful footnote to the life of bassist Albert Kane (possibly the true founder),  who died two months after playing this show, and his heavy bass work keeps things pinned to the stage even as Johansen wants to run all over the place.  And as a capper, they tribute Johnny Thunders with the best song Thunders ever wrote, "You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory."  I had never heard the song before buying this, and they sang it without introduction, and the raw emotion still made me tear up.  If you don't know these guys, go buy their debut LP, "New York Dolls" first.  It's much tighter, but more accessible and sloppy in the good spots, of course.  Other than that, raucous pre-punk, last-year fun.  I think it's great 
 Readable academic study of visual aspects of Indian cinema, with a terrific chapter on Bollywood movie posters, gorgeously illustrated on almost every page. Get the Oxford UP India edition. Informative, well researched and documented, and stunning to look at 
 I have read multiple books on the Rolling Stones and music in general and this is by far one of the best.  The pictures are unique, many not seen anywhere else, and the writing is definitely frank, honest, and amusing.  You won't be able to put this book down 
 Jack London needs to be given his proper due. He is a tremendously talented writer and his understanding of life matches his tremendous knowledge of the snow-enshrouded world of the upper latitudes. Although The Call of the Wild is a short novel and on the surface a dog's story, it contains as much truth and reality of man's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life's work of many other respected authors.   Jack London's writing is beautiful, poignant, and powerful, yet also somber, morose, and infinitely real. London doesn't paint pretty picture, nor is the story elevating or uplifting. As an animal lover, I found parts of this story heartbreaking from Buck's removal from the civilized Southland in which he reigned supreme among his animal kin to the brutal cold and even more brutal machinations of hard, weathered men who literally beat him and whipped him full of lashes.   Even sadder are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled's traces around him. Good-spirited Curly never had a chance, while Dave's story is only made bearable because of his brave, undying spirit. Even Spitz, the harsh taskmaster, has to be pitied, despite his harsh nature, for the reader knows this harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for riches. Buck's travails are long and hard, but it is his nobility of his spirit that makes of him a hero, despite the primitive animal instincts and urges that dominate him. Buck not only conquers the weather, the harshness of the men, the other dogs and the wolves he comes into contact with, he thrives.   Hopes for redemption with John Thornton are dashed in the end, and that's when Buck finally gives in fully to "the call of the wild," becoming a creature of nature only. While this is a sad ending, the reader also feels joy and satisfaction at Buck's refusal to surrender and his ability to find his own kind of happiness in the harsh world in which he is placed 
  I read The Fountainhead and enjoyed it very much.  So I picked up Anthem and read it in less than a day.  To compare this to The Fountainhead (or any of her other novels) is irresponsible.  This is really just an expanded short story and stories should not be compared to epic novels.  Ayn Rand was an extremist.  You may or may not agree with all of her ideas, but all of us should read her work (this coming from someone who considers himself more liberal than conservative).  Anthem and The Fountainhead are examples of intelligent literature.  I can't wait to start We the Living and, someday soon, Atlas Shrugged 
 This is a great book to begin to understand your dream and which steps you will need to take to get you there.  This book is easily understood by anyone with a sixth grade or higher reading level.  I currently have 650 employees under my direction and I have suggested this as reading to most of them and have purchased it for the ones that have seemed really interested in it.  Everybody has a dream or two or three, this book will help you in defining and achieving those dreams.  The only concern that I have is that the book refers to a web site that is no longer in existence, it would have been good to have that site to refer to for further information 
 Good clear prsentation of the various facits of the stock market. Designed for the novice. Does the job in good fashio 
    Jeffrey Cramer's annotated "Walden" weaves together the "woof" of Thoreau's philosophy and observances with the "warp" of all the influences upon him in his life, current and remembered. Cramer brings light to bear on the puns and allusions that would likely escape the reader of today. It is an uncommonly rich reading experience.    The book itself is the best designed I can remember in years. The annotations are side by side with the text; the type is crisp and clear; the book opens flat for easy handling; and it is printed on fine stock. Cramer and Yale University Press have given us a rare gift.    
 "Truth Needs No Ally: Inside Photojournalism," Howard Chapnick, Univ. Missouri Press, Columbia, 1994, ISBN: 0-8262-0955-6, PC 370 pgs., (Table contents 2 pgs, 48 pgs photos, Biblio 12 pgs. Index 8 Pgs.) 6 1/8" x 9 1/4"  Author Chapnick, 50-yrs experience in freelance PJ, photo-agency presidency, & as monthly columnist, amassed salient sagacity that sanctions him to write, rigorously, of the many faces of photojournalism (PJ).  He illustrates 4 broad miens of PJ - its foundations, basic components, career evolutions, & creative and ethical issues in 24 chapters of succinctly written prose. His style & clarity of delivery reveals he is a gifted writer.  He interprets the essence of eyewittness PJ, responsibilities, of "concerned" photographers, & PJ essays using examples of renowned PJs, & of how one enters the field via portfolio, dress code, gender, education, specialization, minority ranks & agencies. He summarizes fundamental assets of 29 successful PJ photographers.  In describing the evolution of PJ field, he notes importance of ideas, aesthetics, personal projects, writings, photo book projects, workshops, grants awards, etc. Importantly, he devotes coverage of ethical concerns including invasion of privacy, manipulations, setups, marital break-ups, demands of wartime PJ &  re-affirming news photographs as sacrosanct.  Throughout the book are short accounts of PJ greats as Margaret Bourke-White, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa, Newman, Karsch, Lange, W.E. Smith, Leibovitz, Arthur Fellig (Weegee), & 2-time NPPA awarded Lisa Larsen of LIFE whom I met on photoshoot of Paul Robeson.  He quotes the 1990 AP statement: The content of a photograph will NEVER be changed or manipulated in any way," but then details some deviations & manipulations by mags as LIFE, Nat. Geographic (pyramids), TV Guide (Oprah Winfrey's head on Ann-Margaret's torso) etc., & notes damages are done to alter public's perception of truth. 
 as a drummer myself I think Scott Travis is as solid a rock drummer as there is but I gotta tell you that the guitar playing on this CD absolutely smokes! These guys tear it up at every turn and don't miss a trick. You guitarists out there, get his CD, fasten your seat belts and crank this sucker up!   [... 
 I owe Jane Jacobs a huge debt of gratitude. After reading her book I chose a home within walking distance of everything I needed. It was not in good shape, and I had to put money and sweat into getting it in shape. But she was right that suburbs are not sustainable and it was a terrible place to get stuck if the price of oil went up.   I have a community of friends I did not have in the suburbs and as the price of gas soars I don't have to move my car to get 90% of the things I need. Thank you Jane Jacobs, your work changed my life for the better 
 Death brings Chief Inspector Armand Gamache and his officers of the Sûreté du Quebec to the small village of Three Pines, Canada.  Much-loved Jane Neal has been found dead in the woods.  Gamache must determine whether her death was the result of a hunting accident, or deliberate murder.    Penny's debut book is a true, classic traditional mystery.  Penny has a wonderful writing voice full of introspection and humor.  The captivating opening sentence "Miss Jane Neal met her maker in the early morning mist of Thanksgiving Sunday." sets the tone for the book.  The characters are interesting and well-developed.  Gamache, and his side-kick, Jean Guy Beauvoir are ones I definitely felt I want to follow through subsequent outings.  Gamache was ethical, even to his own detriment, and his four sentences that lead to wisdom are ones everyone should keep mindfully.  The secondary are a wonderful microcosm of people everywhere.  The plot was interested taking me along as story unfolded and there is a subtle depth in Penny's writing that kept the story with me long after the last page.  I loved this book, highly recommend it and am already signed up to receive her second book. 
 Rhino closes out their compilation series "Super Hits of the '70s - Have A Nice Day" with this twentyfifth volume (who would have thought they would have gone this far!).  The tracks here come from 1978 and 1979 and were all top-30 pop hits, nine of which were top-20 with four of them making top-10.  Adding a bit more interest to this volume is the appearance of a few seldom-found tracks, namely City Boy's "5.7.0.5., Ace Frehley's (of Kiss) "New York Groove" and Roger Voudouris' "Get Used To It" all classifiable as one-hit wonders.  Whether intended or not, the appearance of "Oh Well" as the final track on this final volume in the series has a twinge of irony about it.  Sound quality it decent and an eight-page liner notes booklet provides some backround on the included tracks.  All told, a respectable finale to this amazing series documenting the top-40 music of the 70's 
 The Rains Came was released the same year Gone with the Wind (1939) brought a storm of viewers to the silver screen.  Unlike Gone with the Wind, which received a legendary status in the cinema history, The Rains Came only made an impact in the special effects department.  The special effects are rather amazing, even today many viewers will drop their jaws, as they ponder the age of the film and the fantastic catastrophe sequence in the film's midpoint.  However, the film presents an experience that parallels the cheap thrills of melodramatic afternoon TV drama of longing homemakers and bored college students.  The film follows a traditional Hollywood concept of star-loaded talent attracting a large audience, which is blatantly obvious in the film.  Tyrone Power, as the Indian medical doctor Major Rama Safti, will have the women of the 1940s having their knees give away.  A lively George Brent provides the role of the aging playboy Thomas Ransome seeking seclusion in the Indian province of the story while encountering the love struck 18-year old Fern cast by first time actor and beauty Brenda Joyce.  Additional melodrama emerges through the appearance of the infamous Myrna Loy, best remembered for her part in the Thin Man films.  Together these four actors provide a solid cast, which is backed up by an equally impressive supporting cast.  The film opens in a sweltering India in 1938 where drought, famine, and sickness trouble the Indian province of Ranchipur.  It is midday and people are going about their business while Thomas Ransome sits in the shade of his porch trying to cool down and preoccupy his boredom with a slingshot.  An amusing notion is that there are no sweat rings, or other signs of heavy perspiration, besides to the water pearls on the foreheads, which would be normal in heat such as the one in the film.  An assumption could be that stars do not perspire heavily, as it would probably lower their star quality.  Nonetheless, the beginning of the story discloses that Major Safti and Thomas are good friends, Thomas cannot get out of a garden party, and everyone prays for the rainy season to arrive.  The story is told out of Thomas' perspective, but the focus is on the events taking place around him.  At the garden party, Thomas meets the youthful beauty Fern, who requests his help to break the chains of her parents.  It puts Thomas in an awkward situation, but he does not really worry about it.  Later, he also meets an old friend and confidant, Lady Esketh (Myrna Loy), at Maharajah's palace, and it is here the witch's brew begins to simmer.  Lady Esketh first drifts off to some secluded area of the palace with Thomas where something (let your imagination run free) happened, and later falls for Major Safti.  This instigates an intriguing triangle drama between Thomas, Lady Esketh, and Lord Esketh (Nigel Bruce), but Lord Esketh doesn't ever suspect Major Safti for anything.  When the emotional witch brew seems to hit its high point the rains begin followed by a severe earthquake.  Here the audience gets a chance to experience a magnificent example of the special effects capabilities of the 1940s.  However, the emotional turmoil begins to seep away, as a greater problem has emerged that has set all people in danger.  There are several other subplots within, but the film only touches on the issues the way a soap opera would. In addition, there are cultural misconceptions within the film, which often have the purpose of glamorizing the actors.  Jean Renoir's the River (1951) does a far better job depicting the Indian culture, as he also shot the film on location.  Yet, the film tries to be good, and tries to enlighten the audience, but does not achieve the film's full potential.  Despite the culturally awkward situations, it is within the effort of trying to teach the audience a valuable lesson where it also puts forth a cinematic experience worthwhile in a Western perspective that will amuse an attentive audience 
 Ok Kids, get your copy and hit the books! Who knows what nuggets are inside this darkest of all Dicken novels... Enjoy summer reading until the Fall Season!  
 I am really finding myself enjoying many of the new entries into the extended Little House family, this book included.  However, I did not like it quite as much as others in the series (and of course not as much as the originals, but that goes without saying!).  I don't think this is the  writing, but perhaps just the setting, more urban than any of the others,  so not as full of descriptions of self-reliant country life. This book is  well written, and I do look forward to following Charlotte's life and  seeing how it fits into the big story of the Little House family!  I  especially enjoyed the description of school life in the early 19th century  Boston area 
 This book not only provides all the tools for a well-balanced and in-depth science/technology based curriculum, but it is also quite informative on it's own, and provides answers to many of the questions posed in other classes on a daily basis 
 This novel is excellent for its character development, plot, prose, and so much more. Julia Glass deserved all the praise she received for this tour de force. There are as many good books out there as there are bad ones, but only a few, once in a while, are great like this one. Also, for anyone looking for a great book to discuss in a book group, this would be an excellent choice 
 Just as I said in the title-- this is an amazing look at love and death and being in the spotlight when you enter that inner circle of the famous or society...not the infamous, not the instant celebs...but the inner circle of names that make America what it is...Carole Radziwill married "John John's" cousin, son of Lee radziwell (Jackie O's sister). And because of this she entered the inner Kennedy circle and coincidentally became one of Carolyn (John's wife) best friends....Some fascinating stuff here-- I think many of us assumed that Carolyn and Carole were both upper class-- they appear to have been middle class and even worked at the same department store in NYC at one time where they had to wear yellow aprons. Of course Carolyn worked in cosmetics dept and Carole worked in customer service...The fascinating part of this book is that Carole is able to somehow view both the yin and yang of her marriage and the relationship with the Kennedy family --especially John and Carolyn...Carole's husband gets cancer and is actually dying the week that John and Carolyn's plane crashes...Carole is the one who has to notify the Coasts Guard and Carolyn's family....It's a great book to read to show that you can be happy and sad at the same time. I appreciate her honesty-- she signed up for love and roses and got death and dying much of the time...now it's time for her to get her own life again...a former news researcher...she spent much of her married life taking care of a sick and/or dying husband and then dealing with the Kennedy tragedy too...fascinating book.. 
 absolutly an incredible book. as a childbirth educator I work with many many women and reccomend it to every one of them. I being my copy to class and have them all skin through it, and read a part outloud they have interest in to the class. I know a few fo them have bought it and they all love it too! Anyone who wants to get out of having the horrible births your friends tell you about should get this book. Are you afraid of labor and birth? get this book. just want general informaiton? get this book. and get it as early in the pregnancy as possible so you can keep going back to read more. Great job breck!!! 
 Even though this is about 4 years old, it is extremely halarious.  I've been waiting to see a good stand up comedy. The first 15 min is just one hilarious hit after another. I love this guy 
 This book tells the story of the nazi excursions into the tibetian areas in search of establishing their race agenda. Lots of "reports" of such journeys have been referenced throughout the years, this book gives the facts, of the actual journeys, the "experements", and the men themselves. Good info for those who want to look at factual information about this subject rather than hype. 
 I really like this book. It help me a lot in additional knowledge in  structural mechanics. It gives a very good approach on the energy method as  well as the calculus of variations. Although i would not recommend this  book for studying about calculus of variations (not a book for beginner`s  in this field). The book gives good details about beams (and other not so  well known theories and approaches for solutions) and also plates. It deals  with shear deformation as well as buckling. This book is recommended not  only for civil engineering students but also for mechanical engineering.  The book also provided basics for finite element analysis. But the approach  of the discussion for the FEM should not be considered for an introductory  course. All in all for what i`m looking for this book (mainly about plates)  it is fairly complete. It is a very good book and very satisfying to read 
 This book provides a lot of good information on how to market a woodworking business.  The steps are clear and doable for most people.  The advice is based on the author's experience with advising woodworking business and seems sound.  At times the author seem to be a bit ridgid in his stance, stating you must do this professionally or it will harm your business.  While this may be true, some of the items could be shortcut.  Instead of finding a professional photographer, find someone skilled at taking pictures of your work or do it yourself.  With all the computer programs around, you can do printing of your own business cards, letterhead, etc. and still appear professional. Overall, I found this a good book to read for starting my woodworking business 
 A fabulous & fun pop up book with extra surprises on each page, in each corner.  Bought as a gift for my niece (age 6) and she absolutely loved it 
 ...and the Pixies were a group of youngins having a good time playing music. No one outside the left-of-center had ever heard of these noiseaholics who just happened to not really care about what the Aqua Net militia and your Yanni loving dads thought. In the midst of being seen and classified by the Billboard masses, the Pixies fought every inch to be heard in what David Bowie describes as "sludge", cookie cutter garbage that cluttered the music landscape for much of the 80's and early 90's. Is this reminiscent of now?  This DVD exemplifies the Pixies righteously. It includes all of the Pixies videos, which were not even a fraction as memorable as the music itself, and a 1987 London performance in it's entirety that captures not only the Pixies in their glorious years, but as well proves that this group was more influential to early 90's music renaissance than any other band.  As well, the DVD includes a great documentary on the band with commentary from the likes of David Bowie and PJ Harvey. It wonderfully sums up the band's existence, and it also contains live clips from the accompanying live performance.  This DVD includes home video footage from the Pixies' tour as well, right before Doolittle was released. Most of this portion will mainly appeal to the more-than-casual Pixies fan.  All in all, this DVD is a good buy, roughly selling for $20.00. While a fun and engaging view for anyone who likes the Pixies, it also contains a great documentary for the casual fan that needs to be brought up to speed. Overall, very good 
 This incredible volume was one of the first things I read when I began researching the issue of Contra cocaine trafficking for the San Jose Mercury News in 1995. To call the experience an eye-opener is a major  understatement.    Cocaine Politics not only confirmed to me that the  Contra-drug link was for real, but that it was just a small part of an even  more insidious picture: a secret and practically invisible world where  intelligence operatives and criminals collude, wreak havoc, and almost  always escape prosecution and accountability.   When a producer from  Dateline NBC, which did a show about my Dark Alliance series, asked me for  recommended reading material on this issue, I unhesitatingly recommended  Cocaine Politics. His reaction afterwards was memorable: "This is the  most amazing book I've ever read. How come I've never heard any of this  stuff before?"   The answer is pretty obvious once you read this book.  If the American public ever got wind of this story, our country and our  government would never be the same again 
 As an information junkie, I'm always turning to the Internet for fast and up-to-date information for my garden design business. This book has replaced my computer for first-glance information. Debra provides significant editorial value in this reference, which I find dog-eared and well-used in a few short weeks. A must-have for any gardener in the Northwest, and a brilliant gift for a gardener new to the area 
 "Jason and the Argonauts" is a Ray Harryhausen fuelled adventure, in colour (1963) based on the Greek myth, full of stop motion monsters, intrigue, great locations and costumes. Like a lot of the Ray Harryhausen related DVDs, there's "The Harryhausen Chronicles" documentary added as a special feature (at least on the version of the DVD I watched), narrated by Leonard Nimoy and feauturing interviews with Ray Harryhausen, fans like Ray Bradbury and George Lucas, as well as rare stop motion footage Harryhausen never used in films. It's a great feature, a great documentary, a great package 
 This is a collection of Jeeves stories, most set in New York, that also includes the story of how Jeeves came to be hired by Bertie Wooster and Jeeves own account of one of his adventures with Bertie. All is classic Wodehouse and great fun to read 
 As biographies go this is a good read. The physics, though superficial, is quite informative. I do wish Dr. Wheeler had delved deeper into the concept of quantum foam and quantum gravity. Wheeler's discourse on who, when, and "how" the 'super' was developed is very good. The fact that Ulam first came up with the radiation method of igniting the 'super' was news to me!! Good read. Well worth the price.. 
 This is a beautiful and complex novel, mixing the themes of art, family, innocence and loss. It alternates between the voices of Pru, a young girl whose pictures are taken by a family friend, and Kate, a young woman teaching at a University. Beverly-Whittemore does a marvelous job with this story, it lets the reader make up their own mind about art and what Pru's family is accused of, and gives each of the girls a voice of their own so we can understand how the events feel to them. I thought it was a well written and credible story from an obviously talented author. Recommended 
 I took her certification training and received the book at Ananda in California. I have shared the book with open minded pathophysiology instructors at The University of Utah College of Nursing. It is so helpful to have adapted poses to offer people of "less than perfect" bodies. Yoga has been so helpful to my patients on numerous levels. I also got to hear a testimony from one of the participants of the Dean Ornish Program on which she collaberated. He was inspiring by reaffirming the benefits of yoga came to him even without his appreciation for or acceptance of Eastern philosophies. But peace and healing came to him nonetheless. What an inspiration Nischala, her course and her book have been for me 
 Le Tissier continues to amaze and horrify his readers with the descriptions of Germany's death spasms in the East. This particular volume details the efforts of Germany's 9th Army to escape from it's encirclement and find saftey beyond the Elbe River in what would become the American Sector of control.   The reckless ferocity of the German bid to escape is only matched by the dogged and may I say "murderous" determination of the Soviets to destroy the Germans.  While no one can deny that the Germans certainly reaped what they sowed, one is also confused at the effort the Soviets put forward to destroy German military and civilian elements that were basically attempting to leave Soviet control. One asks this question, because the Soviets suffered tremendous losses themselves in attempting to completely annihilate the German 9th Army. With Berlin already falling to Soviet domination, one must wonder what the Soviets hoped to gain by destroying the German 9th Army.  Le Tissier's only flaw in my opinion is that the really never tells us why the Soviets, and Koniev in particular found it necessary to destroy an army that at that stage of the war posed no threat to Soviet stratgic aims.  Thus the reader is left to conclude that Soviet lives were lost simply to add more prestige to Koniev's military accomplishments with the destruction of yet another German Army.  For the Germans, the story of Halbe is one of unending tragegy. Le Tissier for all his effort can only convey the briefest glimpse of the hell these people endured.   This is not cheerful reading, but for any student of the Second World War, your studies remain incomplete until you have read Halbe. 
 A great book for anyone interested in fashion history and the impact of Gabrielle Chanel on the world of haute couture 
 I have loved everything that Rebecca York has written in her "Moon series" and althought this is not my favorite book in this series ......it is still an excellent, well written love story with a bit of suspense thrown in. A++ 
 Like the book for women, this book is also used as an educational tool in the juvenile facility where I volunteer my time. It is an excellent book for young men to read, and hopefully follow 
 This is an excellent product. It is far superior in audio quality to all the other iPod minispeakers (and I've tried them all - the JLab product is the only one that doesn't sound tinny). Its concept of enclosing the IPod while allowing full access to all the controls is brilliant. Highly portable. I will be buying several more as gifts 
 I was 13 when I read it.  It is now 25 years later.  I can still remember the high brought on by a book that vigorously exercised my mind and imagination 
 with a little experiance of knowing HOW to use this book, it quickly becomes a unique favorite. 
 The table of contents for 'Maze of Death' includes old fashioned chapter summaries, but they are incredibly inaccurate, a pretty good indication that things are not as they appear to be.  The characters in Maze are lost in the surreal world of PKD.  Many reviewers criticize PKD for two dimensional characters and his writing which wavers between excellence and sloppiness, however the really great thing about SF is the fantastic ideas and PKD has these in spades.  Fourteen characters marooned on Delmak-O where nightmarish happenings are the norm, and reality, if there is any reality here, may be even worse. 
 This movie was very great. I enjoy Indian show but usually find them to be to long. This show added just the right amount of culture to it. It explores the friendship of two girls of opposite races and shows that people are just that people now matter what class, race,or sex you are. They also portrayed woman as strong and independent,I liked that 
 This book is an outstanding reference on crime scene investigation. Gardner writes from experience after many years with the US Army's Criminal Investigation Division, an agency known for their superb crime scene skills. Gardner's book covers the many facets of crime scene investigation with particular emphasis on documentation, one of the most important aspects. He presents the Army's 18-step method for crime scene processing which the reader will find to be an excellent model to follow.  I am a working police detective and have received a great deal of training in crime scene investigation and own numerous texts on the subject. Gardner's book is far better than anything else I have seen to date.  
 I held off buying THE LIGHTNING THIEF for a couple years.  The market seems glutted with YA fantasy at the moment, and I read quite a bit of it with my 9-year-old.  We've discovered several good series, but THE LIGHTNING THIEF seemed too long to hold his attention when it first came out.  This year we noticed it in the book fair at school, then saw that it was an Accelerated Reader book.  So I picked it up and read a couple chapters to try it out.  I was 50 pages into it when I realized I needed to be reading this to my son.  I did read it to him.  We FLEW through the book (375 pages!) in 6 days because he kept pestering me to read it to him.  We finished it up in a 5-hour marathon yesterday, hanging onto every page as Percy and his friends tried to save the world and put things to rights in their own lives.  THE LIGHTNING THIEF is a great book for adults and kids.  I've already recommended it to a couple of adult friends who experienced the same kind of can't-put-it-down pull that I did.  Percy Jackson, the hero of the book, comes across as every kid you'd ever meet or ever would.  He's no brainiac (he has dyslexia and ADHD) but he has friends who are.  But he is courageous and clever, stubborn and loyal.  He is the best he can be, and he's getting even better.  Riordan works in many of the Greek myths in the novel.  There was a time when knowing Greek mythology was a pre-requisite for having a "classical" education.  Many morals and philosophies are presented in the tales.  From the very beginning of the novel, we find out Percy is different when he ends up fighting a harpy in the museum while on a school trip.  He's been kicked out of 6 schools in 6 years, lives with his mom and step-dad, Smelly Gabe, an evil guy who deliberately makes Percy's life hard.  Then, when he's on a well-deserved vacation with his mom, he finds out he's a Half-Blood, the son of one of the Greek gods.  But his mom doesn't know who his dad was and that's just one of the mysteries Percy ends up solving.  The cool part of the book is peeling away all the mysteries of Percy's life and who really took Zeus's magic thunderbolt.  Along the way he gains powers that set my son's head to spinning with hope and delight.  Percy's a superhero without the costume, and there are plenty of villains in his world.  Riordan is a teacher who obviously loves kids as well as the subject matter.  The Greek gods were a cantankerous lot, and Riordan delivers them well.  Not only does he give his readers the stories, but he also brings the gods on stage and gives them personalities.  The series is supposed to run for 5 books.  I think it will go on longer.  I hope so.  I've already ordered books 2 and 3, and my son and I are looking forward to them.  The books take a while to read outloud to younger readers, but the effort is well rewarded.  The story is rich and deep, and will keep your child's attention.  In addition, you'd be surprised how much you can talk about even when you're not reading.  And your child may just want to wander around the internet learning more interesting facts about Greek mythology.  THE LIGHTNING THIEF is well worth reading and is probably in most public and school libraries 
 I read this book with a poetry reading book club and it was one of the club's favorites.  Edson writes often surreal philosophical fables which are easy to enter into because of their familiar, "There once was a woman who..." language.  However, this river runs deep 
 The young Hal and his instructor in the art of living the good life , Falstaff cavort through the first half of Henry IV as if life were going to be one long , irresponsible entertainment. The dramatic transformation of all of this , and Hal's casting off of Falstaff, and moving to kingly responsibility will come in the Henry IV Part II.  What is present here throughout is the tremendous richness of Shakespeare's imagination in his creation of character, and inventiveness in language , in his ability to create so many different moods and feelings.  'Falstaff' is one of Shakespeare's most beloved characters, and one of the great figures in the Comedy of world literature.  Enjoy 
 The characters here are spectacular.  I also enjoy how this book doesn't run into the cliches.  Each time I thought I knew which way the story was going, something came and turned it a different way.   Pick this one up, and then go back and read her others.   
 I really dislike it when publishers put too much information on the back of book, outlining too much of a plot from the get-go. I prefer to let plots unfold naturally while reading, and while it is established pretty early on in the book that Freddie is in jail following a sinister crime, we don't read about the act until after 100 pages or so. Banville is more concerned about the man than the crime. He is guilty; Freddie will let no one misunderstand that about him. But why does he do such horrendous things? Why does anyone? Does anyone really know what they are capable of? This novel reminded me in some ways of Richard Wright's "Native Son" in that the protagonist is not a sympathetic character in a lot of ways. He's not a good man. But... there is something else there, something that makes the reader care about him and his motives, even while shaking a castigating finger at him at the same time. I really liked the way Banville told this story, through the use of an ongoing monologue, with almost no dialogue whatsoever. It's like Freddie is sitting across the table from us, talking to us as a trusted friend, confessing his secrets and shame and accepting the consequences. While the peripheral characters are not clearly defined, we do get a clear picture of the main character, and that is the point. This is the world from the point of view of a man who one day finds himself in the role of criminal. Banville captured this eerily well. Definitely worth reading 
 i dont know why alot of people dont like this movie me and my girlfriend went to see it and we thought it was hilarious and had a good heart. this was better than alot of other comedies that came out this year to me and i cant wait til this comes out on dvd to buy it Nov 21, babyyyyyyyyyyyyyy 
 I bought the Opteka Battery Pack Grip for my Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi, and was a bit leary about the considerably lower price than the Canon brand battery pack grip. I am pleased to report that the Opteka grip has met my expectations.  PROS  The grip fits extremely well on the Rebel XTi. It even comes with a convenient place to store the battery compartment lid (which must be removed to insert the grip into the camera. Removing the lid is an easy procedure).   Attaching the grip is quick and easy, with a large, serrated wheel to tighten the grip against the camera bottom.   The finish on the grip is different than that on the Canon-brand grip. The Opteka has a thin, rubbery, texturized non-slip insert layer over the front, bottom and back. The Canon grip's rubbery insert is smooth and looks more "finished."  My only concern about the Opteka insert is that it shows signs that it may not stay perfectly attached to the grip, and will likely need a touch of cement in the future. Not a big deal, though.   The vertical shooting buttons on the grip (exposure bracket, A-E lock, Auto Focus point selection, selector wheel and shutter release) are, as far as I can tell, identically placed like those on the Canon grip. All work like they are supposed to.  The grip comes with an "On-Off" slide so you can turn off the vertical shooting buttons when they are not needed. This prevents accidentally activating one of the buttons or taking a picture if they are inadvertently pressed while shooting horizontal.  The battery compartment in the grip is very easy to remove and insert batteries. Although I haven't used it yet, the optional AA battery insert looks easy to use, and is good to have in emergencies.  The two NB-2LH batteries that came with the grip seem to be OK, and charged up just fine. With the battery that came with the camera, I now have 3 batteries to use. More than enough for the number of pictures I take during a typical shoot.  The grip certainly improves the handling and feel of the XTi, which comes with a too-small grip for many hands. Personally, I like the additional heft and mass the Opteka grip gives the camera, although some may object to the additional weight.   CONS  This is a very minor point, but worth pointing out. The shutter release button on the Opteka grip is a bit "mushy." What I mean is that it is not always easy to tell when you have pressed the shutter releae halfway down to activate auto focus or metering. There is a noticable tactile difference between pressing the shutter release down on the camera, and the shutter release on the grip. It's as if the spring underneath the camera's shutter release button is a bit stiffer than the one for the grip. However, if you use the viewfinder to determine whether you have achieved focus or not, then the little bit of mush in the grip shutter release won't make no never mind.  BOTTOM LINE  Would I recommend this grip to a friend? Yes.  Would I buy another one if the need arises? Yes 
 This is the funniest book ever. A true pick-me-up and a fun family favorite. I love Dave Barry's views and respect for the Japanese culture 
 Like another reviewer, I spent a few weeks this past summer in Italy.  In a small town near Rome I had one of the most memorable meals of my life.  In Naples I had a plate of spaghetti with fresh tomato sauce and basil so good if I'd dropped dead right then and there, I would have died a contented man.  When I got home, I wanted to recreate the food I had in Italy.  This book, and all the others La Place has written, showed me how.  I have other Italian cookbooks and I love them all.  What distinguishes LaPlace's books is that she makes cooking a simple, quick undertaking so you don't feel like every meal's the final exam at Cordon Bleu.  Along with speed and simplicity, she captures the improvisational, unpretentious essence of the best Italian cooking.  Flavors are allowed to speak for themselves, they get amplified, not sauced over or cooked out of existence.  The results of her recipes are dishes so fresh, easy, and authentic if I sit back afterwards over a cup of authentic Italian coffee (made according to La Place's directions in the excellent La Bella Cucina), I can almost hear Vesuvius rumble, almost hear the waves in the Bay of Naples.  No one who buys any of La Place's books will regret it 
 Unlike all the bad reviews on this doll, I want  to say how wonderful this doll is she does everything it says on the box, I know a lot of people says she doesn't cry but she does it takes a while if your child plays with her a lot and feeds her the right way she will cry, our doll cry's every time my daughter squeezes her hand, even my 8 year old son loves to make her cry, it is over all a great doll my daughter dresses her in different outfits and take her everywhere she goes... 
 I purchased this book when the third edition first came out. I found the information so brilliant and so helpful. It has remained a constant bottom line reference for those hard questions that have simple answers! I have referred the book to many other who were trying to establish viable consultanting businesses and were searching for all the 'questions and answers' of getting started. And more important - "how do I figure out what to charge???"  When I purchased the book, please note, I was living in the highly competitive North Eastern United States 
 I own this and the love it. Works great and is more accurate then the Bushnell, although costs a little more. I have not found a course that it does not have and I don't know if I could play without it now! Easy to use and worth the price 
 Great movie, made back in the good ole days before all of the bloody violent garbage they pump out today. It is a good one for anybody, I saw it as a kid and I still love it 
 I got the book for my kids to use to get them excited for the trip (not that Disney World in it of itself wouldn't get them excited).  My daughter read the book cover to cover and had her list of attractions she most definitely wanted to see.  She carried that book everywhere and probably knew the parks better than we did 
 perhaps this is the most romantic and most beautiful book of love poems ever written. every word, every stanza is so easily read, so quickly understood, like an arrow to the heard. give this gift to your lover and they will never forget it 
 The two who wrote the music for this show are brillian!  Why isn't it still on Broadway?  The story is haunting and rich and beautiful.  Perhaps it pulls on our very souls, and perhaps this is tough for us sometimes.  But to listen and experience the highs and lows of this heartfelt music is to feel alive! 
 If you are chris Rea Fan, Blue Jukebox sounds like a beautifully aged "Road to Hell" Album. Slow and very melodic. If you expect a fast Chris Rea album you will be deceived. If you have yourself aged with Chris Rea's music, this album will be a jewel, specially after being heard 3 or 4 times. If you are new to Chris Rea's music, start with "Road to hell" instead. 
 AWESOME!!!  Just as fuuny as I remembered it was.  I'm glad they finally put it on DVD! 
 Somewhere among these reviews was a fairly intelligent post that pointed out the fact that Jewel's poems seemed more imagery than art.   I think that same reviewer said that young people should just get together and write poems for eachother because the poems would be just as good as her book.  That is where I disagree.  The artistry in poetry does take time, but usually, so does the imagery.  Too often, I see people writing poetry with such vague language, that there is nothing remotely tangible in the poem.  They write about floods of tears, broken hearts, and all that other common stuff.  What Jewel does in her writing is evoke.  It is difficult for many people to understand that putting those concrete details in a poem won't make the reader feel disconnected to the poem.    I'd love to see the kind of writing Jewel does now.  If she's matured as a poet, she could have the potential to be poetically explosive.    The best attribute to Jewel's poetry is that it is tangible to the youth.  Young people were able to see that there are conemporary poets, and that poetry is an expressive art that requires details rather than hokie rhymes, cliches, and abstract language.    Jewel succeeded in putting a tiny spark into modern poetry.  People, at least for a short time, were slightly interested in buying an actual poetry book.    Give her a little credit, and like I said, she was VERY young when she wrote this book of poetry.    
 First, let me point out that Oasis is my favorite band. There isn't an Oasis song I don't like. So I'm going to guide you throughout the entire album and give you my overall opinion of the album.  The Masterplan is a collection of Oasis B-sides from singles covering their first three albums (Definitely Maybe, (What's The Story) Morning Glory, and Be Here Now). The featured tracks and the track listing were decided from an online poll of Oasis fans in 1998.  First up: "Acquiesce" This is probably the most famous Oasis b-side out there and often played live. This song is fantastic, the combined vocal solos of both Liam and Noel Gallagher make this song magnificent. Noel's solo seems to sound better than Liam's, but nevertheless a beautiful song.  Track Two: "Underneath The Sky" Liam Gallagher sings. It sounds good, not as strong as "Acquiesce" but an upbeat and nice tune.  Track Three: "Talk Tonight" Noel with a beautiful guitar based song. This is something you would hear a street performer sing, the lyrics are sad, but the tune is relaxing. Great song.  Track Four: "Going Nowhere" Noel sings once again, and the song is another sad one, but there is a mix of brass and string to lighten it up. A nice soft listen.  Track Five: "Fade Away" After the first few chords you know this is from the Definitely Maybe era. Hard, pure rock from Oasis with a good amount of "Shoegazer" influence. Never fails to slam a good dose of energy into me.  Track Six: "The Swamp Song" If you liked the untitled filler tracks on Morning Glory and wanted the whole song, that's exactly what "The Swamp Song" is. It was originally a warm up song for recording sessions, and you can tell why. Nice hard guitar with even a mix of harmonica in it all. Fantastic little tune.  Track Seven: "Listen Up" My personal favorite song of the album. It plays hard but feels soft. Bittersweet and beautiful. Noel's voice shines and the lyrics flow magnificently. This song should have been a single instead of a b-side. A hidden gem.  Track Eight: "I Am The Walrus (Live)" First of all, this song was not played live. It was recorded during a soundcheck with the audience noises later added in. Nevertheless an entertaining song, and a faster paced and harder rocking song than the original. Seems to get repetitive at the end though, but that might have been why Oasis sometimes played this song last at concerts in their early days.  Track Nine: "Rockin' Chair" Supposedly written by Noel Gallagher back in 1990, this song makes an interesting b-side. Nice acoustic guitar solos and the organ mixes in well. A very well written song for it being one of Noel's firsts.  Track Ten: "Half The World Away" A great song and another bittersweet one. Noel sings very well, while the electic guitar and organ mix in softly and nicely.  Track Eleven: "(It's Good) To Be Free" Another hard rocker that sounds like "Shoegazer" rock as opposed to Britpop. The lyrics could use a bit of support, but I nevertheless enjoy it. There is a bit of nice organ that sounds like an electric guitar.  Track Twelve: "Stay Young" Another famous b-side, featured in the film "The Faculty". The lyrics sound like a teen revolution, "Stay young and invincible", but the melody is upbeat and happy. Nice song.  Track Thirteen: "Headshrinker" My second favorite song of the album. Sounds like rock overcooked to a crisp. This is as hard and pure as Oasis gets. Fantastic song.  Track Fourteen: "The Masterplan" The track that the album was named after makes a nice finish for the album. Strings and brass mixed in well in a bittersweet and smooth song. Don't miss the guitar solo (a reversed recording of a solo). Leaves you with a great aftertaste for the entire album.  Now, the songs that should have been here but didn't make the cut. Sadly, my favorite Oasis b-side (and quite a popular one as well), "Sad Song", is missing. In fact, they should have added all of the Definitely Maybe-era b-sides, because they were by far the best. "Alive", "Take Me Away", "D'yer Wanna Be a Spaceman", and "Cloudburst" are some of the best Oasis b-sides but sadly arent on The Masterplan. Instead there was more focus on Morning Glory-era b-sides. "Angel Child" was another b-side from the Be Here Now-era that I very much enjoy but just wasn't there.  Overall, this is a great album. I highly reccomend it to anybody who just loves music. The album is one of my favorites because it encompasses the sound of Oasis through three different albums and most songs are beautifully bittersweet. I also enjoyed hearing Noel's voice often, which is nice considering Liam sings most of the singles. At time of writing there are supposedly plans for a sequel to "The Masterplan" covering Oasis b-sides from their next three albums, and it will be interesting to see what makes that grade.  This is indeed a fantastic collection of Oasis b-sides.  
 George Sessions Perry's Hold Autumn in Your Hand is a classic piece of Texas literature. He writes in a style that allows the reader to whiz through the pages, and makes you fall in love with the characters and their problems.  Sam Tucker is a hardworking and decent tenant farmer during the Depression. He is trying to get his family out of the duldrums they have found themselves in the last few years. He finally gets some luck when he is allowed to farm a piece of land that has enough acreage to make a profit. With one neighbor helping him every step of the way and another trying to thwart his attempts to prosper, Sam is able to use his optimism and will power to succeed as a tenant farmer during the Depression.   I loved the story pertaining to his neighbors cow, along with his quest to catch the giant fish (one hilarious and the other filled with mixed emotions). There are some classic characters riddled throughout Hold Autumn in Your Hand (the grandma for example) and some funny scenarios, which make this a must read for anyone. Everyone enjoy 
 I must have re-read "A High Wind In Jamaica" at least a dozen times since first reading it in high school.  It remains one of my favorite novels.  It is a finely-drawn portrait of a certain era, but its depiction of the fears and fantasies inside the children's heads is timeless.  Its  humor, though definitely on the dark side, is first rate: there are passages that never fail to make me laugh out loud, despite the fact that I have read them many times before.  The ending, however, is disquieting, and it is easy to see why this novel is often compared to "Lord of the Flies. 
 "Koma" is a surprisingly suspenseful film.  While there is enough gore to certainly warrant horror flick categorization, director Chi-Leung Law delivers a very old school Hitchcock suspense tale.  Close-ups on objects like a foot dragging across the floor leaving a bloodstained trail heighten the suspense and move the story.  Angelica Lee as Fung Chi-Ching, a girl who needs a new kidney and has inhibitions that keep her from fully embracing her boyfriend, does a good job and hits many levels from hysteria to jealousy to drunken delirium.  Andy Hui who plays her boyfriend, Dr. Tsui Wai-man, hits a number of levels also from the guy in love to the man whose hormones outpace his common sense.  As researcher Suen Ling, Karena Lam projects a person who has had a difficult upbringing and as frequently as not walks on the shady side of the street.  The twists of plot that trace a kidney thief who black-markets organs for $60,000 a pop never leaves you quite settled until the final frame.  Subtitled with Chinese dialog the often sparsely verbal picture translates well to an international audience.  "Koma" turns out to be a pleasant, often intelligent, surprise.  Enjoy! 
 This is one of the most interesting biographies I've read in a long time. I think Pollock is mostly misunderstood. He was a very good painter, but he's a simple guy, looking to be famous to make a few bucks, have a few kids, and remain relatively on the level, but Lee Krasner knew better.  Pollock hated "phonies" and felt he had became one after the Look article, etc.. Here you'll find all those wonderful Pollock stories in fine detail. Like him pissing into peggy Guggenhiem's fireplace during a cocktail party. This book will give you the history of that period like no other, and a feel for what it's like to be an ambitious artist in the New York art world. Great supporting cast in Lee Krasner, Clement Greenberg, Peggy Guggenhiem, and all those painters 
 I have found all the Sun "Core" Java books to be at cut above, but this one differs in that while obviously Java-centric, much of the patterns dicussed are relevant to all development platforms. I'd recommend this book to developers and architects of web services and web applications regardless of their preferred development environment. 
 Written by a trained fireman, this exciting alphabet book realistically takes the reader through a fire fighter's day as it goes through the alphabet. Its rhymes are unforced, written in natural language.  Firefighting vocabulary is explained.  The illustrations capture the excitement of firefighting. Includes an illustration of equipment and further informative fire fighting facts in an author's note. This book is sure to become a favorite 
 You know, when I read Are You are Ladybug, which I read just prior to this, I didn't think the subject could get any simpler...and I was wrong.  This book is, in fact even simpler.  It contains much the same information, starting out with a paragraph (on the back of the title page) about the Two-Spotted Lady Bug Beetle, which you can read (I think it's aimed at parents) and from there each page contains one very simple sentence and is accompanied by one very large (but deliciously colorful) illustration.  What this book lacks that Are You a Ladybug had was a slightly more complex look at the metamorphosis that the Ladybug Larvae go through (i.e. that they split out of their skin multiple times before finally morphing into the from we are most familiar with).  It does take the reader (or listener) through the entire lifecycle of the ladybug and even goes into some of the dangers they face in navigating through the world, but never fear parents of very young children, all ends well in this story.    Overall I give it 4 stars, this is strictly for very young children (ages 2-5) who are curious about those flying red bugs they see outside in the spring.  A good starter book for kids and a nice breakaway from reading story books for parents who are reading aloud to their small children several times a day.   
 The best dessert cookbook ever created. The recipies are uncomplicated, flawless, and the most delicious I have ever tasted. This book is pure pleasure. From the day I got this book, my other dessert books have been demoted to collecting dust. Absolutely brilliant 
 We have this set strictly for IF I HAD MY WAY, the 1940 musical co-starring Bing Crosby and Gloria Jean. Every version that has appeared on television and in theaters for six decades has been Universal's 1946 reissue, which is missing some Gloria Jean footage and almost all of the featured appearances by vaudeville stars.   It is a pleasure to report that Universal consulted the original 1940 release for this sparkling DVD edition. The film is fully complete with all of its original (undoctored) titles. The entire score is on parade here, including Gloria Jean's charming "Little Grey Home in the West," seen and heard for the first time in 66 years. The guest-star specialties are intact: Blanche Ring and Eddie Leonard sing their signature numbers backed by Six Hits and a Miss; Paul Gordon does a trick-cycling act; Trixie Friganza, Julian Eltinge, and Grace La Rue appear as themselves.   A fine ensemble cast (El Brendel, Allyn Joslyn, Charles Winninger, Nana Bryant, Claire Dodd, Moroni Olsen, Donald Woods) lends fine support to Bing and Gloria, who sing memorably. If you like Bing Crosby, this is very enjoyable and highly representative of his talents. The restoration job is excellent, with the long-lost deletions artfully fitted back into the standard vault print. Picture and sound are also excellent. The restored IF I HAD MY WAY is a major find for movie-musical fans, and the DVD is highly recommended.  
 I find myself going back to this book over and over again. It's true that it makes a great compendium of a wide range of topics, but to me, one of the best things about this book is that there are practical considerations taken up that you will not see discussed at length elsewhere. Frankly, I wish Bob had let himself go (by stating some of the other as prerequisite) and explored deeper into that territory. Example: discussion of package structure and marking packages as fixed or volatile, and how to manage dependencies, etc. There is a great tie in with Meyer here. All around great book 
 I picked up this book thinking it would be a bit of fluffy fun, but from the first page it was clear that London had a larger scope in mind.  Her tryannical father, diagnosed with terminal cancer, manipulates his three daughters ruthlessly and wounds them all, but Robin finds a way through his destructiveness to the real world.  She is a spoiled princess with everything,and  Jake is a self-made man who has little tolerance for her, but  the two find a middle ground and eventually love, with a lot  of humor along the way.  This is a charming story.  I look forward to seeing what London will do with the other sister's stories 
 "It seems fitting that Paul Lauren's book should have been published on the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  In it, he provides the most comprehensive and exhaustively researched  history of human rights ideas and the institutions to implement those ideas  that has been written to date.  I expect it will become an indispensable  reference source for scholars and students of human rights"                      -- Political Science Quarterl 
 This book is, in fact, full of cartoons but, even so, is actually a useful statistics book.  I am a chemist who has long forgotten her math and this book was suggested to me by a co-worker who was given the book (earlier edition) by her sister (a medical person).  So, this book has a long history of being helpful to those of us in technical fields who are not math experts but who need occasional help with stats 
 All three volumes of The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP), are classic. Each is a book that every CS student should try to study diligently reimplementing example after example. Not many will succeed to finish even a half of one volume, but if you do please buy all three of them and think about post-graduate studies :-).   I think the most important is to study the Vol 1. It gives enough exposition to the Donald Knuth style and brilliant thinking. While the content is definitely important it is the level of thinking of the author that represents the main value of the book: you instantly understand the book was written by a great scientist and it does not matter much that now the contents of most chapters can be significantly improved using more modern sources. After all Vol 1 is more then a 30 years old book (it is older then Unix) and as such it should be outdated (we all believe in progress, don't we)... And it is not surprising that parts of Vol 1 on of TAOCP today look completely out of touch with reality especially MIX, the CPU instruction set that is used in all volumes.    Actually MIX instruction set (and thus assembler) was outdated even when the book was first published and more reflects unique Knuth's background with IBM 650. It was far from the state of hardware development even in late 60th when the first volume was published, the period when IBM/360 was the king of the hill.   Now IBM 650, a 1,966 lb machine that consumed almost 30 Kw of electricity looks more like a primitive calculator than a real computer: typical installation has the memory of just 10,000 decimal digits ( 1,000 words; 10 digit per word).   It's really sad that Knuth did not adopt System 360 architecture and PL/360 assembler (Wirth's structured assembler for S/360) for his books but we can do nothing about it. Still this is a book about timeless truths, not the book about the resent CS fashion like Java or you name it :-). It actually can serve as a perfect antidote against any current CS fashion.   And Knuth does provide pseudocode with his natural language algorithm description. And natural language pseudocode has an important advantage over 'structured pseudocode. The problem with a "structured pseudocode" is that the set of control structures is fixed and may not reflect the needs of a particular algorithms (branching out of loop is a common problem that is not addressed by structured programming well). Moreover it can cripple the algorithm by enforcing unnatural control structures, the structures that are absent in it but might be present in more modern languages. For example Perl has an interesting set of control structures that is superior to C. But even "Perl control structures set"  can be improved further.  That's why assembler language is preferable: it never obscures "natural" control structures for each algorithms, structures that one day can be mapped into some new elegant language construct. Also as one review noted "sometimes high level languages with all their abstractions make things look more complex than they need be."   I would like to stress it again that each volume is very difficult to read; you really need to work on each chapter by reimplementing the examples that Knuth gives in your favorite language (assembler might help but is not essential).   Mathematical considerations as for average and worst running time of a particular algorithm can be largely ignored during the first couple of years of study of this book. Actually most mathematics in Vol. 1 can (and probably should) be initially completely ignored. See Softpanorama Classic Computer Books for more information.   On the negative side this is an overpriced book, if we are talking about students budget. To save money you can buy one of the first editions: there is not that much difference in content to justify the differences in price. The differences do not interfere with the study of the book. Knuth did an excellent work the first time he published each volume and for a significant improvement we probably need another century and another person.  
 This scholarly and fully referenced, yet not dull or boring, informative book is a treasuretrove of angelic lore information. It doesn't commit itself to any particular religious tradition. You find entries for Judeo-Christian, Islamic, Eastern, Mesopotamian, Gnostic, Kabbalistic, and many more origins and types of entitities. The author does not stay away from non-canonical areas, such as magickal lore angels, celestial hierarchies, the demonic realm, etc. He both welcomes or is skeptical of various characters, mostly depending on the degree of consistency or lack of such in the available literature on each particular subject. Something one learns even in the Introduction is that the field of angelology is full of opposing, sometimes openly contradictory understanding, definitions, specifications, correspondences, and purposes attributed to the angels. An angel who is a benign helper in a certain context might be an evil demon in another tradition or system of beliefs. Eventually, this has something to teach about what dualistic, good-vs-evil mentalities can result in. Please note that humans are the ones who both devise and have such mentalities; the angels are the way they are. It's the phenomenologic principle of "if something is really true, it will be so regardless of whether I believe in it or how I believe in it." However, with angels sometimes one wonders, on the basis of the fascinating information in this book, if one might not be assisting in their creation, or at least the creation of their "public image," their myths (as in Jungian archetypes). There are various highly useful appendices going further into some areas that benefit from further detail (example: the differences in angelic hierarchies based on different systems and authors). This work is for those who truly relish as much information as they can find when their topic of interest is angels. It's not likely to be cherished by clerics or the pious. Those with less committed interests, or with decidedly esoteric or occult interests, will find it a treasure to keep and refer to time and again. It contains numerous highly relevant illustrations. Where history is of help, or other types of documentation, it's included in the text of each topic's definition and information 
 Nice book, but too bad its front picture cover is defaced by Norton's double-layer of big gold stickers with high-tack adhesive that makes them impossible to remove without adhesive remaining on the cover 
 Anyone who has written a novel and wants to see it in print should read this novel.  Seriously.  Poor Martin pinches pennies for postage money, types up his manuscripts, dispatches them in the mail and waits.  When he inevitably gets them back, he mails them off to the next publisher on his list.  Martin Eden is the perfect example of what it means to write for the public today.  This tenancious, and realistic, routine eventually pays off, but the ordeal, as well as some difficulties in his love-life, has taken its toll.  Martin becomes one of the bitterest cynics in all literature.  The story moves at a fast clip and culminates in a shocking and heart breaking end.  Unlike many of London's superb novels, this one will appeal mostly to adults--not that it is particularly racy; it just deals with adult problems and situations.  Word has it that this is the most autobiographical of all London's novels

 This resouce helped my college-aged daughter evaluate and nail down her own beliefs.  
 My kids love this movie.  Mike Myers as always is hysterical.  As for the bad reviews--lighten up you watching a movie about a cat that can talk--really.  Big hit with all kids I know.. 
 I thought this book was interesting.  It is about the hardships a 15 year old girl go's through to reach "The Land Of Hope".  It tells a lot about Ellis Island. A definate read!!!! 
 I bought this book because it was referenced in another book I read. I found the book to be witty and humorous. It's a fun and short read, thats great for a train or before sleep.  The diary entries alternate between Adam and Eve and deal with subjects like intimacy, talking (in Eve's case talking too much), and sexual roles (why does Adam name everything?)  Some of the entries were a little dry (hence the 4 stars) 
 The book reads even better the second time around, and the Afterword addresses some questions I was left with.  A real fun romp.  It would make a great road flick 
 At many points, J.L. Austin's How to do Things with Words reads more like a linguistic textbook than a philosophy text. Whether you count this as a benifit or a distraction will depend on your disposition (it certainly beats reading Kant), but whatever your views on the subject, the work is a useful introduction to Speech Act Theory. How to do Things with Words examines a part of language that philosophy has traditionaly ignored, what he dubs the performative utterance. There are certain instances in language where to say something is do perform the very act you say, promising being the perinial example. If I say, under ordinary circumstances, "I promise to do x" then I have promised to do x. Using this seemingly magical fact as his starting point, Austin goes reach profound conclusions about the nature of language and philosophy. Though the tasks Austin sets out to accomplish are largely left uncompleted (he himself admits this) the book will give you the grounding you need to pursue other works in the field, such as those of Searle or Grice. Happy reading 
 By the age of 70, the average person will have spent 6 years dreaming.  And the scientific community still really has no idea why.  I completed my thesis on the function of REM sleep, so I have read a lot on the subject, from J. Allan Hobson to Edgar Cayce to Freud and Jung.  This book is thoughtful and very entertaining.  Regardless of whether Don Juan's teachings are true or not, it made me very desperately want to experience lucid dreaming.  The ideas presented are captivating and make you think.  Plus, it's trippy 
 I picked up this book intending to read only a couple of chapters. I ended up reading the entire book with fascination. This is the kind of book that makes one think, reflect, and re-evaluate simplistic cultural paradigms. Those who confuse leaders with super heroes or think leadership has to do with wielding power to combat evil would benefit from reading this book. Wills does an excellent job of recognizing that people with a lot of influence or power are not necessarily leaders. I found this relavant to today's shortage of positive leaders.  Although each chapter cannot delve into the representative leader in great depth, each chapter does an excellent job of distinguishing between different types of leadership. The introduction, the conclusion, the notes, and the many citings of other books on leadership added to my learning. This very readable book provides an excellent sense of history and places leadership within the context of history. This is a pleasant change from the endless books on leadership and business.  My only complaint would be the lack of attention to the influence of media on today's leaders and followers 
 The East West knife cuts through carrots like butter!  It is so worth shelling out a little extra for the quality you recieve in this set of knives 
 I've read all the previous reviews on Amazon on this book, and I was surprised to find what I consider to be the major message of this book overlooked by all the reviews.   First of all, let me say that I found this to be an excellent, elegant exposition of just what the title indicates - the "Heart of Islam."  Professor Nasr explains better that any other writer I have ever read just what things like love and justice mean to Muslim inner life.  On the one hand, he was addressing the post 9/11 world, and attempting to nurture a sense of balance about what the terrorist attacks meant, from a mainstream Muslim perspective.  That believers of religions do not always live up to the ideals expressed by their faith is nothing new, and Professor Nasr certainly isn't trying to deny that.   But another major point - one suggested by the subtitle "Enduring Values for Humanity", and one that has taken on a more serious demeanor since 9/11 - was Professor Nasr's attempt to show that Islam, as a society, sees itself as threatened by secularism and globalism, which are basically western creations which western society has assumed, without any really good reason, to have a universal application, and which western governments, from the beginning of the imperialist period up to the present, have foisted on the Middle East, theoretically in its own good.  As he points out, many of the major ills of Muslim societies, such as oppressive regimes, are the result of western tampering with their societies over the last two hundred years; if one doubts that this is possible, one only has to look at other areas of the globe, such as Central America, to realize that this is not only possible, but almost unavoidable, as long as the major industrialized powers insist on setting the moral tone of the world - a moral tone that is predicated on maintaining control of other areas of the world, mostly on the premise of economic necessity.  Professor Nasr is a writer in the tradition of the major esotericists of the twentieth century, most notably Rene Guenon and Frithjof Schuon among others, whose major warning for us was that the world has become more secularized, and that true belief in God has been jeopardized as a result; secularism creates a world in which God is marginalized, primarily on the basis that belief inspires tyrrany.  Globalism further creates a world in which there is no real place for people to base their lives on a belief in God, because economic necessity becomes the only constant in life.  In the final analysis, I believe that this was the major argument of this book; 9/11 simply provided a reason for making the argument, and as time goes on this argument seems to make more and more sense, as America sinks into its third year of trying to create a Middle East in its desired secularized, globalized image.  You may not agree with this premise (although I do); the worst part of all is that most westerners don't understand the argument at all 
 I really disagree with those rating this movie poorly. My kids and I really love it! It is such a hoot to watch it again. The kids were watching it in the car on our way home the other day and I was cracking up just listening to the snappy one-liners. It is full-on fun from start to finish and I think any movie that delivers this is truly a worthwhile watch. We sure need some relief from all of the doom and gloom in the world. If you want some relief too, give it a watch. You'll be in stitches! 
 I bought this book, and within 6 hours had to read it cover to cover.  Do not venture into estate-pipe collecting without first informing yourself with books like these.  I now own ALL of Hackers'  books, and while not perfect, they are pretty close to it. They are all interestingly written, and educational in almost every way. There is simply no better book out there on pipe collecting. Accurate pipe dating guide for most collectible brands of pipe.  As a side note, this book is a collectible in itself, and was limited to 2500 copies produced total. Hard to find, and increasing in value 
 I had suffered from canker sores all my life, culminating in college when I would get four or five or six of them all piled on top of each other (I know you know what I'm talking about) and in so much pain it hurt to open my mouth, much less eat anything.  It was only when I sought out a remedy and came across studies linking SLS -- sodium lauryl sulfate -- as a major contributor to canker sore outbreaks that I discovered this amazing toothpaste.  I have used this toothpaste since it came out on the market and my incidence of outbreaks has diminished nearly 100%.  If I do happen to get an outbreak, which will happen if I do not brush two or three times per day, the intensity of the outbreak is significantly reduced and the amount of time the canker sore lasts is only a few days.  If you suffer from canker sores to any degree BUY THIS TOOTHPASTE!  You will never suffer again.  I turned my aunt, my uncle and now my husband onto this toothpaste and they are now canker sore free as well.  
 I have thin hair, and these curlers work great to give you body and curls.  I would definately recommend this product.  They have the regular iron pins to help you keep the roller in your hair, but I purchased conair's clips for rollers because it is easier for me.  I also purchased these curlers at Target!!  Worth the price 
 Listening to this album is like a vacation.  Or a well deserved rest.   I felt so much better.   I brought this album  on vacation  with me  and  woke to the feelihg that all was well with me and the world.  It is clear the two have a good perspective of who they are and where they are going.   It is also clear that  the slection of the songs can orchestrate an album into and enjoyable listening experience.  From all the songs I felt the joy of singing and the joy of doing some thing you love to do.  The quality of the performance and the meaning of the songs  were just what I needed 
 After hearing the author speak at a conference, I knew I had to read this book. What I didn't know was how deeply and profoundly it would affect me. This is truly a book of the heart--and the Spirit. If you love Francine Rivers, don't pass this book by. Hey, don't pass it by regardless. It's a keeper 
 Gingrich and Fortschen have written an excellent conclusion to their alternative history of the Civil War.  AS I stated in my review of the first book, those of us who grew up in the south have lived with the "what if?" Questions our whole life.  The first volume of this series posits a Confederate victory in the Gettysburg campaign.  But even with that victory could the Confederacy have pushed the campaign to victory and what would have been required to acheive that victory.    The authors have done an excellent job of taking into account the difficulty of capturing Washington and the overwhelming superiority of men and material the Federal forces had.  To win this war, it would have required a quick knockout after July 4, 1663.  this book shows why this would have been difficult.   The difficulties in controlling a captive population, sabotage, internal weakness of the confederate government all are taken into account in this book.   I think the embrace of "colored" troops and the army of workers is probably a stretch.  The book involves a short period around on final conclusive battle in Maryland, not far from the site of the Battle of Sharpsburg.  The carnage is overwhelming, but in comparison to Cold Harbor, it seems feasible.  The authors show an excellent knowledge of the area the battle is fought on.  I enjoyed the trilogy.  It was fun fiction, but it also helps the reader to address the 'what if's"  Recommend  
 As the "give a mouse" books, but still way better than alot of the mind-numbing books out there for kids 
 This excellent book is a must for anyone interested in the historical roots of the dominant economic school today (noeclassical economics) and how it shares foundations with sociology. This may come as as a surptise for most students of either economics or sociology, but these approaches used to unite in studying the dynamics and mechanisms of society. However, due to fundamental disagreements pertaining on how to study this phenomenon, economics and sociology separated in the 19th century (the methodenstreit) read all about why and how these schools mnow wide apart maybe are reuniting in a neoinstitutional framework. This book is really well-written by one of the really great authorities in social network research: Richard Granovetter. I can only recommend this book which will make you feel much wiser on the social sciences when you are done with i 
 Another great training resource from Ed Rose working with Steve Buckley. Practical exercises, well described, well illustrated, and full of additional trainer insights 
 This is a great book for children and adults. The art is really good and keeps children interested. Also it is educational. It teaches kids the alphabet and sign language for every letter. This is a really great book and I recomend it to any parent. 
 The Communists, the traditional demon-designees, went by the wayside. Lo and behold, an alternative was found, none other than the Prince of Darkness himself!      The author does a thorough job of exposing the  cult-like obsession with alleged cults, Dungeons and Dragons, and various  teen rebellions, which they, the cult cops and their disciples, with a  comical lack of evidence, have made into a global, multi-generational  conspiracy of devil-worshipping cannibals. Indeed, it's such a thorough job  that this ain't no 2 1/2 hour read, but it's scholarly and well-researched.       If nothing else, it may lead one to ask: at what point does government  (i.e., police) intervention become inappropriate and a manifestation of a  police state?      The book is from the early '90s. If you think then that  it's dated, note that the with hunt trial, in which a young man in Arkansas  was condemned to death--partially on the word of a cult-cup whom the book  exposes--because he dresses in black and listens to Metallica took place in  1996. No, the threat is still there, and gaining steam!      Finally--and  the only fun I can get out of the real threat the witch hunt represents--is  on the obsession with the game Dungeons and Dragons: picture a group of  leftists terrified that their kids playing monopoly would convert them into  conservative Republicans. As likely to happen.. 
  "Carnal Knowledge" (1971) directed by Mike Nichols with Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel, Candice Bergen, Ann-Margret in an Oscar nominated performance as a sex kitten who wants to marry Nicholson's Jonathan, and Carol Kane and Rita Moreno in the small roles is one of the movies that made 70s so memorable. It is also the movie that keeps reminding me why I love Jack Nicholson of his early years and how grand he was without his "Jackness" which he has developed during all these years. Sandy (Garfunkel) and Jonathan are two college friends and like every straight young (and not too young) man in the world they are obsessed by girls and move from one relationship to another in the course of almost thirty years. Nichols and Jules Feiffer who wrote the play and later adapted it for the screen let us look inside the minds and souls of two educated upper-middle class white males and to learn their very intimate thoughts and secrets concerning their plentiful dysfunctional and joyless affairs and it is not a pretty picture - "Boys begin life not liking girls, later they don't change, they just get horny." The film is honest, uncomfortable, "very slick, very clever". 
 I saw this movie when I was about 15 or 16 and that was a long time ago.  I ordered a copy through Amazon and when I watched it I remembered everything in the film especially Queenie hiding in the woods. I like this as it was directed by Charles Kaufman, brother of Lloyd Kaufman who made the Toxic Avenger. I give this film a rating of 5 stars and as it is a Troma Inc. release, this is one of the best Troma films I have seen 
 Dr. Zachary's book plots the entire process for creating a mentoring culture in the organization.  Her book offers clear steps to identify all the issues that need to be addressed prior to a program design and implementation.  The book provides insight into the levels of buy-in and commitment needed for mentoring to be successful and imbedded in an organization.  Mentoring is a powerful way to engage leadership in their personal growth and development and the advancement of the organization.  This is an easy to read and use guide.  The CD is a great gift offering the forms for the exercises.   
 	I'd like respond to some recent reviews that suggest  Riane Eisler's work is not based on fact and that it lacks plausibility.   It is quite a sweeping dismissal of a scholarly and well researched ten year work, drawing from many disciplines,  from a woman  whose life has been dedicated to helping us understand the mess we are in:  how we got here, how violence is perpetuated,   and how we can get out of it.   Riane Eisler presents us with a roadmap to peace; whether we have the wisdom to understand it and respond to it is something else.  Until violence against children and women has been abated there will be no peace.  Violence begets violence.   	Quoting from Adele  Gettys "Goddess, Mother of Living Nature." "Since time immemorial our ancestors have left sacred images of the female form.  From the caves of Lascaux in France to the Balkans in Eastern Europe the art and artifacts of the Paleolithic and Neolithic, which represent human's earliest myth-making impulses, indicated a deep reverence for life, and, in particular, for the Great Mother."    30,000 year old Stone Age nude figures are the first Western Goddess Representations.  Twenty thousand years later, in the agricultural societies of the Neolithic (8,000----3,000 BCE)  female images still predominated, indicating a remarkable, millennia-long cultural continuity.  And, none were depicted with weapons. This is very important material, for to understand it means to reclaim our heritage.  	In the depths of my own  profound spiritual journey twenty- five years ago, awakening to the loss of the Sacred Feminine,  . . . living in isolation, creating constantly . . . Riane's book came into my hands.   I was amazed and heartened to  learn that humanity had such a history.  Like  many folks,  I had never heard of the Goddess or our pre-history.  Barbara Walker's  "The Crone" also found it's way into my hands about that time.  There is Merlin Stone's well researched book,  "When God Was A Woman," which fleshes out even more this picture of a harmonious,  egalitarian, spiritual  and immensely creative life that spanned thousands of years,  before patriarchy and "father god."     	The most convincing thing of all is that the religion and the temples of the Goddess, in her many names,  are referred to again and again in the Bible.   And, somewhere  in the Koran  it states, clearly with disgust,   that some peoples engaged in the abomination of "worshiping women."   	The research  of Riane Eisler,  noted anthropologist  Maria  Gimbutus,  and more recently James DeMeo, PhD (among many, many others) drawing upon global archaeological and anthropological evidence present substantial proof that our ancient ancestors were non-violent.  In his book, "Saharasia:  The 4,000 BCE Origins of Child Abuse, Sex-Repression, Warfare and Social Violence, In the Deserts of the Old World" professor DeMeo writes, "These early peoples were peaceful, unarmored, and matrist (partnership model)  in character.  I have concluded that there does not exist any clear, compelling or unambiguous evidence for the existence of patrism  (patriarchy--dominator model)  anywhere on Earth significantly prior to c.4000 BCE  . . . . . . and the earliest evidence appears in specific locations, from which it first arose, diffused outward over time to infect nearly every corner of the globe."    	 It has been now a bit more than 2,500 years since religious myths of the sacred marriage of the Goddess and her divine lover faded from Western Cultural consciousness. Today our sacred images and myths tend to focus more on death, punishment, and pain than on sex, birth, and pleasure.   	Riane writes, "One of the challenges of our time is to create for ourselves and our children images and stories of the sacred more congruent with a partnership than dominator social organization.  Images and stories in which giving and receiving pleasure and caring, rather than causing or submitting to pain, occupy center stage.   	For in truth we are living in a dysfunctional and antihuman system that threatens to destroy us all.  At the same time, there is a new partnership system that is struggling to emerge."      	In this time of regression to a harsher, more violent  dominator system, Riane's wise words are needed more than ever. May we pay attention to them.   Janie Rezner, Mendocino, CA 
 Great for beach, flea markets, biking, hiking, you name it!  Comfortable, good traction, and washable.  What's not to like 
 "The Four Adventures of Richard Hannay" gathers in one volume stories written by John Buchan during and after his service as an British intelligence officer during the First World War.  The first two stories were actually written and published as the war with Imperial Germany and her allies progressed, imparting a sense of urgency and uncertainty about the outcome that an historical novel written after the fact might not have captured in the same way.  "The Thirty-Nine Steps", "Greenmantle", "Mr. Standfast", and "The Three Hostages" follow the career of South African mining engineer and British Army officer Richard Hannay.  Hannay stumbles into the spy business through the murder of an accidental lodger in "The Thirty-Nine Steps", set in the time just before the outbreak of war, and is repeatedly called back to the spying businees, often from his military duties, in the remaining stories.  Buchan's technique improved with practice; the stories develop more complicated plotlines and smoother deliveries.    Those familar with the Sherlock Holmes stories will find a similar sort of pacing in Buchan's adventure stories.  Buchan relies heavily on coincidence and exotic settings in advancing his story lines, and some of the stereotypes and language will seem dated to modern readers.  Some other portions of the stories will seem remarkably fresh, as for example Hannay's description of the opposition by some Britons to the War with Germany, proof, if we needed it, that human nature is remarkably constant.  The story lines are engaging, and Richard Hannay is a sympathetic hero, if very much a man of his times.  Buchan, a born and raised Scotsman, is often at his literary best in describing the people, land and simple details of ordinary living of Scotland and England.    Readers are highly encouraged to read the introductory essay by Robin Winks, which provides excellent background on the remarkable life of John Buchan and the context of his writing.  In his description of the "Buchan Formula", Winks makes the case that Buchan is the literary forefather of later writers of spy fiction such as Jon LeCare.  This book is highly recommended to those fans of the spy genre who would like to explore its antecendants, and to those readers looking for authentic period piece stories.  
 With "Winning The Race", Dr. McWhorter has completed a much needed trilogy which describes the impact of a 60's white-leftist alienation upon a post-60's black psychology and sociology. His development of 'therapeutic alienation', as a meme, provides an over-arching backdrop which ties together "new black double-consciousness" and "cultural cults" discussed in his first two books dealing with race(1); what makes the application of therapeutic alienation as an equally compelling socio-psychological explanation of current black-leftist alienation is its historical parsimony. So often, members of the black-left discuss racism from a common political consensus which renders it a peculiarly and unnecessarily "subtle" and "complex" issue while "common sense" is ignored and replaced with theatricality.  Interestingly, Dr. McWhorter makes plain that alienation is not necessarily an exclusively race-based concept as the works of ex-radical David Horowitz make abundantly clear.(2) Yet, one need only contrast Ida Hakim's CURE(Caucasians United For Reparations and Emancipation) with Star Parker's CURE(Coalition On Urban Renewal and Education) to better appreciate the influence of white-leftist alienation and guilt, run amuck, into the present.  To Dr. McWhorter's use of an evolutionary-based concept such as meme as well as his use of social science-based concepts such as skeuomorphy and path dependence, this reviewer would respectfully add a politically-based concept of "Nietzschean ressentiment"(3) to also help explain the effects of a post-60's zeitgeist upon the black community; why a cultural sea change in which seeking after of an "indignation for its own sake" has become infectious; and why "perpetuating of indignation regardless of reality or common sense" has become the dominate leitmotif of black leftist thought to this day. More succinctly, this ressentiment finds expression in yet another theatrical metanarrative by which members of the political Left utilize "master morality" and "slave morality" to encourage the "fetishizing of the evils of the White Man" and the fetishizing of the sins of the West.(4)  As Dr. McWhorter placed a proper emphasis upon anecdotal experiences which have validated the concept of a "meme of therapeutic alienation", this reviewer would also encourage readers to just visit the Internet community at "Blackvoices", to listen to "UpFront With Jesse Jackson"(The Word Network) and/or just tune into "The Tom Joyner Morning Show" to have an opportunity to become well acquainted and versed with this peculiar meme of theatrical gestures; without a doubt, gestures characterized by an alienated, liturgically political psychology which serves as a "balm for insecurities" while "assuaging survivor's guilt"(5); and in terms of therapeutic alienation, this reviewer can't help but note that perhaps the "acting white" phenomena may have a Freudian analog of sorts: that of  "reaction formation".    In that spirit, this reviewer will give a very brief personal overview of an anecdotal instance of the meme of therapeutic alienation with a resonance that is rooted in black spiritual authenticity(6). The example is that of Dr. K. C. Price's, "Race, Religion, and Racism" Series, dating back to 1999 thru 2001 in which racism was discussed for approximately 17 months.(7) During the series which was aired from Los Angeles, California, I participated in a virtual discussion forum addressing the many lectures given; in particular, I developed a thread entitled, "The Role of Victimology: A Liberal Synecdoche?", in which I interjected "black conservative" philosophy regarding race into the forum; referring to authors like Shelby Steele, Thomas Sowell, Clarence Thomas, Alan Keyes, etc. and adding political insights from David Horowitz and Dinesh D'Souza. I also interjected black liberal perspectives from authors like Ellis Cose(The Rage of a Privileged Class) and Patricia Williams. The forum responses, without much surprise, rejected the conservative voice with only a few exceptions.  At this point, this reviewer needs to make clear that I have much respect for Dr. Price as a spiritual leader within the black community--that's why I became involved in the virtual forum--and so my critique is solely directed toward the analysis and "solution"(8) he gave during the series; in hindsight, his "solution" was clearly mired in a "meme of therapeutic alienation".  Because a post-marxist like theme also prevailed at the time, this reviewer found it very important to interject "black conservative voices", in particular, into the discussion forum as Dr. Price mostly led a series which essentially used the spirit of the 60's Kerner Report to address racism in general as well as a particular incident of racism involving a fellow pastor and friend regarding interracial dating/marriage; basically, he repeatedly emphasized the need for whites to "fix it", as he so often put it, as it was whites who "started it". This response(s) clearly reflects what Dr. McWhorter has discussed in terms of a "racism in the air" belief  which has led many to believe in the need for a Second Civil Rights Revolution, the need for an upending of the playing field and the need for complete elimination of residual racism in order for racial healing to take place.  The series had a great deal of historically beneficial information, but in the end, even after much emphasis upon Dr. Price having spent three years in preparation of the series, basically only a politically left of center formulaic came to characterize his racial "solution": recognition of blacks  +  reparations to blacks  =  reconciliation between blacks and whites; interestingly and very respectfully, after reading Dr. McWhorter's discussion of hip-hop, the fact that Dr. Price's son(K. Price, Jr.) has more recently spoken of hip-hop as the language of a younger, Joshua-interracial-generation becomes more clear; that a "Hip-Hop" service is given and scheduled every fifth(5th) Sunday now also becomes more clear.  Lastly, as Dr. McWhorter has also stated, therapeutic alienation is nonetheless slowly losing its cultural grip. Suprisingly, during this year's "State of the Black Union" message(9), a forum hosted by Tavis Smiley, a genuine effort had been made by him to include four black republicans; and while only one black republican participated, this reviewer hopes that Dr. McWhorter, Dr. Steele, Star Parker, Debra Dickerson and others would consider becoming participants in the 2007 forum as this would help to counter the effects of the "law of group polarization" peculiar to this Leftist townhall meeting.(10)  'Sides, it'd be off da' hook. :-)  C-Span Anecdotal Update, 04/29/06: After Dr. McWhorter's discussion at AEI, the two African American responses given during the question and answer session characteristically sought to diminish the impact of black cultural zeitgist, choosing instead to focus on class dynamics and a blurring of structural-cultural effects in spite of sociological data presented to the contrary. Thus, these responses reflect both therapeutic alienation and new black double consciousness so eloquently discussed in McWhorter's analyses.

 I was extremely skeptical.  Have smoked strong European cigarettes (you know, so I can get European cancer but look good doing it) for 25 years.  I had quit for 4 years during that time with a patch, but started back up a few years ago smoking more than ever, 2+ packs per day.  We are vacationing soon at a place where there is no smoking, so I got this book to try and prepare myself. I had no intention of quitting the day I did.  I read the book thinking I would listen to the CD another time, but went ahead and listened to it and have not picked up a cigarette since.  I have re-listened to the CD 3 times just to make sure, plus it is very relaxing. I have the patch ready to put on, but I have not needed it yet.  I sit in my office on the computer with a cup of coffee and remarkably no cigarette !  Give this a try if you are thinking about quiting....I hope you will be as pleasantly surprised as I am that it does work.  She does a great job of letting you know about hypnosis, so if you are unfamiliar or a little afraid, she answers all of those questions and puts you at ease. 
 I'll keep my comments brief because the editorial reviews on this book describe its basic essence. What I want to bring to the reader's attention is this: today there is much debate concerning the role that religion plays in developing moral behavior. This book shows how limited that role may actually be by demonstrating the biological and social forces that shape many of our ethical beliefs.   This book is so rich in information (many of the chapters can be easily read by the general public, but a few require some background in academic research)that I used it as the standard reference when writing a chapter on morality for the book WHY WE BELIEVE WHAT WE BELIEVE, which I coauthored with Andrew Newberg.   This book demonstrates that human nature is equally driven to be both selfish and altruistic, hostile yet compassionate, and I came away from it with a very disturbing sense that we are far more amoral than we'd like to believe.   This book, however, is optimistic, and many chapters show how we can overcome personal and social biases and thus function more compassionately in the world. For example, several chapters refer to techniques that can be used in elementary school to teach children how to recognize and change discriminatory behavior.   Personally, the most disturbing chapter was written by Zimbardo, who conducted the Stanford "prison" experiment in the 1970s. In less than 24 hours, students automatically started to mistreat their student "inmates" in ways that hauntingly reflect the atrocities commited in Iraqi prisons by American soldiers. To some degree, we all little criminals, and once we acknowledge this unpleasant human trait, we can become better citizens, which is one of the goals that religious groups endeavor to achieve 
 "A picture is worth a thousand words," goes the old saying; "Uncommon Valor, Common Virtue" with its 120+ photographs about Iwo Jima and associated verbal explanations provides an invaluable start for one trying to understand the intensity of battle during WWII and the sacrifices made daily by those involved.  Iwo Jima was bombed and shelled for 70 days prior to the Marines landing, using an armada of some 450 ships.  For 36 days and nights during February-March of '45 100,000 Americans and Japanese fought across the 4.5 mile volcanic island.  Nearly 7,000 Americans and 20,000 Japanese lost their lives.  D-Day + 4 brought the famous flag-raising and its photograph - since memorialized in statues, stamps, coins, etc.  The famous photograph actually involved a second flag-raising - a colonel wanted the first flag replaced by a larger one visible across the island.  Unfortunately this led to later (untrue) charges that the second photo was staged.   Regardless, fighting continued on for weeks after the photo - only 1,200 Japanese were taken prisoner; most fought to the death, many trapped by flame-throwers inside caves and bunkers, blown up by naval shelling, or killed in hand-to-hand combat.  Only three of the six flag-raisers in the photograph survived to see it; they subsequently traveled across the U.S. serving as War Bond ambassadors or attending ceremonies (often seated at the rear) after the war.  Sadly post-war life was not good for two of the survivors - Ira Hayes died in an adobe hut on the Gila River Reservation (Sacaton, AZ) in 1954 of alcoholism, and Rene Gagan also died of alcoholism in 1979.  Only John Bradley lived a reasonably good life (until 1994), though he mostly declined interviews.  Every American should spend time with books like "Uncommon Valor, Common Virtue" to better appreciate the sacrifices of our WWII servicemen 
 What a fun read!  Loren Estleman, no stranger to fiction, seems to have had a fantastic time writing a very clever take on traditional Western literary fare!  In "The Adventures of Johnny Vermillion," Estelman takes just about every cliché, expression, description, and atmosphere for which the genre has been exploited, both in pulp fiction and in the movies, and creates a real "tour de force" that is difficult to put down.  Johnny Vermillion, son of a  Chicago wheeler-dealer, wastes none of his young adult life in making a name for himself.  Brilliant, ravagingly handsome, terrifically clever, Johnny decides a life of crime is for him--a life wherein crime actually pays.  But none of the boring, every-day crime, but life with elan, with style, with an esprit de corps par excellence.  He forms the Prairie Rose  Repertory Company, a band of thespians, all with their own stories to tell,  who travel about the 19th century West.  They set about robbing banks at the same time entertaining their audiences with delightful theatre with dramatic results.  It's Shakespeare on the stage and nefarious antics off (like breaking the law!).  But this is not just a story of Johnny and his fellow actors (and each certainly is a "character"!).  Estelman underscores his titled "hero" by bringing in two other elements:  the law (in the form of a Pinkerton detective) and some really bad guys, the Ace-in-the-Hole Gang.  Estleman's characters are ingenious and disingenuous at  the same time, and like well-written stories, these three "plots" are on a collision course, just waiting for the final curtain.  The plots are, of course, secondary to Estelman, who seems to find it a riot to portray his characters in a most readable fashion, and he relies on the stereotypical, clichéd "rules" to do so.  Indeed, it was a "West that should have been," as it goes, "but never was."    Part "Butch Cassidy," part Sergio Leone, part Louis L'Amour, part B movies, the book moves like a thundering locomotive and clouds of dust (after all, it HAS to have some mystery!) swirling in the hot Utah sunshine.  What does it mean?  Who cares. It's such a fun read--and a good spoof .  And what's not to like about Johnny Vermillion!  Clever bloke, him. (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)     
 Roots reggae lovers will not be disappointed with this Fattis  Burrell-produced set of spiritually charged songs. A reworking of Locks'  classic from the mid 70's, "Black Star Liners" shines with his  voice in peak form and the music heavy yet sparse. The Riddim Twins- Sly  & Robbie, provide solid backing along with saxophonist extraordinaire  Dean Fraser and some fine female backing vocals. Fred hits hard with the  opening track "Come Now" which sounds somewhat reminiscent of  Yabby You's "Run Come Rally". The song is a strong rallying cry  for Jah children to unite and prepare to move on to the promised land.  "Throw Down Your Arms" rings out an appropriate warning to  purveyors of violence who as Fred firmly states will feel the wrath of God.  Locks' voice, somewhere between Luciano and Dennis Brown, is in excellent  form with Burrell and the Xterminator crew providing solid framework.  "Don't Wait For Me" finds Locks righteously chastising his lady  for "waiting around for him" because she is suspicious of his  whereabouts. He sets her straight with pure truth, adding that there must  be trust. A terrfic album with every song co-written by Locks. "Never  Give Up" should find strong support as a collection that affirms faith  and provides wise counsel. This reviewer (who is also a reggae radio DJ)  gives a seal of approval on this album...radio and car stereo ready: turn  it up 
 This, M Ward's third CD, places him in the forefront of a modern movement that is clearly progressive while simultaneously sounding regressive, feeling dusty with age, and manifesting a genius that is pure and untempered. His music defies description except to say it is coming from somewhere seeped in the early blues with a Neil Young overlay and the feel of country, blues, pop, and folk.  I am beginning to believe, the more I listen to this CD, that if Neil Young heard it he would say:  "That's it...that is what I was trying to   sound like...listen to those chord progressions and chord changes...that's it". People point to Tom Waits and others as Ward's forebearers but the muse here is genuinely unique and the sounds are those that only a budding genius could make.  The opening rif of "Fool Says" feels like it came from Abbey Road but by song's end you have been dipped in Young and Dylan.  I dare you to listen to "Get to the table on time" and not imagine yourself there as the Ward family calls their prodigal son to come down from the attic for dinner.  M Ward makes beautiful music---sounds like you have never encountered---and he sings along with the melodies as if he can't help himself.  Who could if they had this much soul? It is all coming from a very deep place inside him and you owe it to yourself before you pass---the main issue he is addressing on this CD---to hear these songs because they are the most soulful and melodic tunes you will have heard in quite some time.  This man lives in his own songful world and I can't thank him enough for sharing it with us on Transfiguration.  If you put this CD on your stereo it will be a long time before you take it off.  The more you listen the deeper it gets---just like M Ward, I suspect.  This is genius, pure genius, and you need to hear it.  If when you have given Transfiguration a good listen and find yourself wanting more of the same (yet beautifully different), then go backwards on the Ward Highway to End of Amnesia or forward to Transitor Radio.  You will be very glad you did.  Enjoy 
 You would think that having my fourth child, I would've been prepared for anything, right?  Wrong!  Each pregancy is different and my number 4 proved to be a lot tougher than anything I'd experienced.  Pregnancy Sucks gave insight on many issues that I'd never expereinced before and put a humorous spin on it.  This book would not be for the stauch, first-time Mom who wants a medical diagnosis for every problem.  Although it's written with the help of a medical doctor to elaborate on complex medical issues, it also provides a real world presentation of events that may occur when pregnancy really sucks.  I am so proud to be a 4th time Mom, and I do have plans to have a 5th and final child.  This book was extremely therapeutic to my soul and my mental state gone awry 
 The double CD "Live LIVE" is audio proof that Sister Hazel is one of the best performance bands making their way across the country winning fans over by the truckloads!  I have been a Sister Hazel for years and this collection of live music is basically a greatest hits collection.  I was at one of the concerts from which this music was recorded, and it sounds awesome-puts me right back at the concert.  Live tracks are not my favorite, but Sister Hazel's commentary makes you feel like you are right in the action!  If you are a fan of Sister Hazel this CD is a must have item in your collection.  If you are just a fan of great music being performed by a wonderful band that love what they do and appreciate their fans then "Live LIVE" is the CD for you! 
 I would give it a 5, but it is a pitty that it is a little book. It is ok for a one to one basis, but it looses a bit when working with it in a classroom. If it was bigger, than it would be easier for the children to appreciate better the details. The pupils wanted to stand up to see better. They did love to wait their turn to do so and to touch the spider web. For the rest, it is wonderful: the sounds of the animals, the predictive pattern and more. Through it they also learned to appreciate the beauty of the creation done by a spider and have grown in respect for this animal. Thanks Eric Carle 
 My 4.5 month old son LOVES his Jump & Go. It was a Christmas present from Santa, and my husband and I are happy with it as well. I've seen some of the reviews calling it "dangerous" but I think the only danger comes when parents aren't watching their children. We NEVER leave him unattended in his jumper and we've had no problems. For the first week or so he just kind of hung around in it, moving around in circles. He's finally gotten the hang of jumping and he also realizes that he's the one controlling all of the sounds. The only drawbacks I see with it, and the reason I can only give 4 out of 5 stars, is that the volume setting goes from loud to EXTREMELY loud. I wish there was one more quieter setting. Also, as with any doorway jumper, there IS a bit more potential for injury than with stationary jumpers. But as I said before, if you monitor your child, said child should be fine. I highly recommend this product 
 Give this one a chance in spite of the title.  It really does break down the different types of web sites (and hybrid-types) that make money.  And after such "what do I do on the net?" fundamentals, it does add simple, inexpensive nuts and bolts to get ideas up to speed almost immediately.  Examples throughout, as well as specific resource recommendations.  Good for confidence, as it reveals that internet money-making is neither rocket science nor spam hype. 
 Once again the Numero Group has unearthed some more obscure soul music. The Big Mack lable deserved more attention than it got. With poor distribution and less than sound operating procedures the lable languished in obscurity. Nevrtheless, the music was and still is first rate. Stylisticly the music runs the gamut from novelty like R&B instrumentals to Doo-Wop vocal harmonies to heart rending soul. This fine collection make one wonder what could have been 
 An autobiography of one of Wall Streets most importatnt people of the last 20 years, Jim Cramer's "Confessions..." is a real winner. (in my book)  Here's why:  In so many Wall Street "journals", you don't get the detail and history that Cramer included in this book.  He starts at his child years, and ends in the current.  So many other books like this start and end with the career on wall street.  But there is so much in life that builds up to such momentous events!  Cramer tells it all.    He does it in such a fashion, that with a little refinement and expertise on drama, could make it as a top grade movie someday.  This is as story of poverty, romance, greed, humility, and success that is enthralling.  I always ended a chapter wanting to read more.  It is also a book of heroism as the man who should not have, did!  And he did at almost everything he tried.  It is why many wonder if Cramer has the midas touch.  He's that successful.    This is a book that should be studied and read by any aspiring business professional (such as myself), any investor, or business minded historian who would like to get a shot at one of the most successful men, 1990's and current money managers, and investors that has lived in our time.  The lessons and histories in the book are great and inspiring; and at times entertaining!  And with a great touch, the book ends with a great, suspensful moment in Jim's life that you will not want to miss!  A great read!  Now one of my favorite business books of all time 
 ...which is ok.  I think if they made this game fully controlled by the stylus and touchpad it would make it a bit wacky. Sort of like Mario 64 DS.  And like Mario Kart, you have the 2nd screen as your map.  But you can also use it to use items whenever you like and also jump from area to area whenever you want.  That's really the jist of this game when it comes to NEW features.  Someone wrote "loosely based" off the old 2D side scroller Marios, but actually this is very much based off them entirely.  The only difference is that the environments and characters are in full 3D yet still side scrolling view.  Which is a nice touch watching the 3D models move around like that.  Other then that it's a nice update to the old classics.  Especially big Mario which you never do get much to play with thanks to the use of a giant mushroom.  And vice versa a mini mushroom that causes Mario to shrink (and the only way to access the other levels by defeating the enemy bosses as Mini Mario).  There's also a new shell costume of which Mario dons, but can quickly get out of control if you run to fast and he spins all over.  All in all it's a very fun game, entertaining, but not very hard, which is good for the young folks but those reminiscent of the old days know how hard it was to beat a Mario game back then, and this was surprisingly easy.    Luckily the game is packed with mulitplayer features and mini games to add to the value and they do.  Not all are entirely fun, but the majority do make use of the touchpad and make up for not using it much throughout the game.  Playing 2 player will always be fun of course, unfortunately it's not WIFI so you have to be within range of someone else with the game 
 I had a rare chance to watch a book develop from research to writing to publication in this case.  This book affords insights about the reasonable "middle" on race, America's most enduring and painful issue.  I  hope, as the author does, that we can move beyond racial animosity 
 Without having to spend a great deal for professional whitening systems, these Crest WhiteStrips do a pretty decent job.  I personally would not recomment do the whole 20 day program though, because after just 3 or 4 uses you will see some noticeable results without stripping too much of the enamel off your teeth 
 This book is the terminator to false diets. It debunks your false beliefs about nutrition that have krept in over your life. One of the most important things i learned was over the last 10 years doctors have been taught tons about nutrition not the commonly believed 4 hours often heard from zealots. Don't expect nutrition to perform miracles. This book's strongest feature is it cuts through all the confusion, myths, and anything not tried and true by scientists. I think its a must have. Get this book and get on with your life and apply all that creativity to the rest of your life not your diet 
 Henry Darger was a janitor. He lived in one room. He cleaned a Catholic hospital for fifty years, and then died with a 15,000 page manuscript and yards and yards of artwork, unknown and unpublished, in his room. You can find out more about Henry Darger and his life work, chronicling the adventures of "The Vivian Girls" at the Henry Darger entry on Wikipedia.   "In the Realms of the Unreal" is a documentary about his life. The narrative comes through a few different sources: There are interviews with those who knew of Darger in his last days, including the landlords who discovered his work. There is an old man's voice reading Darger's autobiography. There are pieces of Darger's novel. Then there is a narrator who is about 5 years old, providing a little summary and connectivity now and then. The visuals behind the readings are sometimes photos of relevant locations, like the state farm where Darger spent his late childhood, or the hospital where he worked most of his life. Sometimes they are stills or animations of Darger's artwork.  The life of Henry Darger is fascinating. It's especially intriguing to think that there are people around us who are silently, secretly living these incredibly rich and complicated internal lives. It's sad that Darger was never "discovered," but even that sadness is complicated. I'm not sure what the world would have done with him, had we known what he was about. His was not the type of art that's comfortable to package and sell. Hard to contemplate a lonely old man drawing pictures of naked children, unless you put it in the context of his whole life. Not easy to reduce to a few key words.   The movie was kind of distancing. I came away knowing more about Darger but I felt unsatisfied somehow, like some primary source had been held back, like everything had been too filtered, too disjointed. Maybe it just goes with the subject matter -- Darger was a recluse, not open to interpretation or summary. The most meaningful parts to me were the pieces read from his autobiography. It was surprisingly kind, chatty, a bit apologetic, and patient. No bitterness. No angst. Isn't that strange.  
 We received this book as a gift and my daughter took to it immediately, which is saying a lot, because she does not get that "into" books.  I think she especially likes this one because when I read it to her I can sing the story to "I'm a Little Teapot".  I don't think I would have bought this one had I seen it in a store, but I sure and glad we have it 
 If you're a card collector, this is the book for you.  Every set imaginable is listed by card #, example photo, and value.  It even shows card set variations. For example, the 1916 Altoona Tribune set is actually the same as the 1916 The Sporting New set with a different back.  This has been an invaluable tool in my quest of the complete Pete Rose collection, as well as, giving me a renewed enthusiasm for the players of old 
 I first read Maus II when I was in fourth or fifth grade, but, of course, I didn't really grasp the true horror of it all at the time.  I decided to buy a copy a couple of months ago and see if it lived up to my memory, and I was not disappointed.  Now that I'm nine or ten years older and more attuned to the world and its history, it's that much more poignant.  The insanity of the time period is hard to comprehend, but even in a cartoon, Spiegelman is able to give us some small idea of the reality.  I definitely recommend this book to everyone.  Even if (like me) you're not a fan of graphic novels, this is still worth the read 
 I agree completely with the other review posted here.   I even came by these recordings  the same way he did; I read the glowing comments on one of the single issues and decided to  investigate the whole set.  This is  wonderful music--beautfiully crafted, sometimes lyrical, sometimes  powerful, but always colorful and interesting.      As a conductor Melartin  brought  Mahler to the Scandanavian countires, just as Wilhelm Stenhammar--  his exact comtemporary--introduced Bruckner to the north; and one can hear  the Mahler influence in Melartin's dazzling orchestration.      Melartin  gets a very brief  paragraph in Groves; and, as nearly as I can determine,  these are the only recordings of the symphonies available--perhaps, ever  available.  I'm not going to play "is-it-as-good-as" games.  The  quality of this music, however, raises real questions about the standard  orchestral canon--what's in and what's out.  There is a great deal of music  routinely heard in the world's concert halls which is not the equal of  these enjoyable symphonies.      I don't know much about Leonid Grin, and  it's always difficult to judge performances of marginalized repertoire when  you've never heard it before.  I remember Bernstein took an interest in his  talents some years ago, and I think he now holds a post somewhere in the US  south-west.  All I can say is the music is compelling and  he gets top  notch results from a little known orchestra.       Great sound and a good  price!  (Check out Melartin's violin concerto with Segerstam on the same  label! 
 I've had mine for two years now and absolutely love it.  I primarily use it for my protein drinks in the morning, and it has traveled all over the U.S. and Canada with me.  The only drawbacks in the beginning were that (1) as others have mentioned, it is large and took some getting used to compared to my old corded hand blender, and (2) the instructions on the side ('press button to attach/detach') are misleading; it is not necessary to press the button to connect the pieces, and the first one I had felt like the connections got stripped when I tried to do so.  Fortunately, the retailer permitted an exchange for a replacement.  To attach the segments, simply push them together and it will work fine.  You do need to press the button to separate the segments, and it can be tricky to pop out the plug to recharge it without breaking a nail at first, but once you get the hang of it this is a wonderful appliance 
 I personally believe in the power of daily practice of meditation and focussing on the moment at hand.  Being mindful of whats in front of us is the key to life.  This book helps with the task of living one day at a time and growing each moment.  Highly recommended.  Also, would love if you checked out my book which is similar, "Your Daily Walk with the Great Minds of the Past and Present."  Thanks and enjoy your daily journey 
 To succeed in the Northeast, you need Doyle's HOW TO MARRY MONEY, Molloy's DRESS FOR SUCCESS and Birnbach's OFFICIAL PREPPY HANDBOOK. These books will help ambitious people keep their eyes on the prize 
 I was struck by more than this Bierlein's wonderfully lucid and enthralling style. Even though others had found most of the mythic & scriptural patterns, Bierlein's intriguing evidentiary quotations and disciplined background & contextual analysis gave me goosebumps. He is not only on to something mysterious here but he has courageously related the inspiration he felt as he explored the undeniable spiritual realities embedded in the roots of civilization. Others' comments include: "Religious scholar J.F. Bierlein gathers key myths from the world's major traditions, drawing from the works of Joseph Campbell, Carl Jung, and others, to reveal their common themes, images, and meanings. He vividly retells creation, flood, morality, and underworld myths, among others." Professional and hobbyist archaeologists, adventurers and anyone concerned with matters spiritual must acquire and absorb this important work.  I impatiently await his next fascinating endeavor, due out in early 1998: MYTH, MYSTERY, AND MEANING. -- Dan Gallagher author, THE PLEISTOCENE REDEMPTIO 
 This book is an excellent view of the M&A process from a very different angle.  Many books cover the mechanics of the process, but this one looks at the outcomes for human beings - our most important assets.  I would recommend it highly 
 My daughter is 6 years old, and this is one of my all time favorite books we have ever read.  It captures the sweet and magical love between children and grandparents.  I loved the illustrations and the text is like something taken right from a child's mouth, in the most simple and  poignant way.  In my mind it is a classic and something I will be buying for children for many years to come.  
 This book helped explain what white guilt is and how it developed in our modern society, as well as how it impacts our society, especially in education.  This is the elephant in the room that liberal white people do not want to talk about 
 I have loved this book since I first read it as a child in the early 50's.  It's whimsical, fun, charming, and totally delightful.  I hung onto the book for years, until it got lost in one of my many moves.  I now have it again, and love it as much at 60 as I did at 6 or 7.  And lest you think that it's only for simple minded adults--think again.  My usual reading fare is much more complicated.  I highly recommend it for children AND adults 
 McCarthy writes with wit about the history, current conditions(1964, when the book was published) and tourist attractions in Florence. Her advice is invaluable for finding little-known churches, and her descriptions of life in the city, and advice on when to go and where to stay, are vivid and helpful for any traveler in Italy 
 It's like viewing the series as I did when I first got interested in 24.......one hour after the other and it was a roller coaster ride.  I would stay up all hours of the night saying, I'll go to bed after this episode, and WOW what a hook. Reading this was just like watching season 1.5.........Loved it and am reading "Veto Power" now and have the "Trojoan Horse" to read next.......Couldn't put it down...Jack Bauer Rules...and Jack's Back........Wouldn't you like to have him for your neighbor......a must read...Fan or not...it has the power to keep you glued to the edge of your seat 
 As always Penguin dose justice by the (not that) old clasics. A pleasure 
 Friedman explains how growth is good for promoting a freer, more tolerant and open society. The author gives good reasons for defending growth as the major objective of any government 
 This album best enjoyed in a bathtub with a bottle of red wine.. 
 I absolutely love this DVD!! I started practicing with Bryan Kest and have been a loyal fan since I began. But I have to say that Shiva Rea is a great instructor with a great routine!! The background is beautiful!! The music is inspiring. It helps keep me going. There are a few poses that dont flow but nothing too dramatic!I strongly recommend this DVD. I still havent taken advantage of the yoga matrix, where you can create your own personal routine (I like her routine too much!) But I'm sure that I will love it too! This routine is guarenteed to make you strong! 
 I love this book because it sets you up with all the terminology and where everything is located and how to use it.  It makes flash animation seem easy and non complicated.  I was able to make my first flash animation after I was done reading.  Visual books give you a quick start to begin.  You won't be sorry you bought this book 
 I am very happy with this product.I enjoy a lot of older music not available in stores. I like the ease of being able to purchase hard to find products on Amazom 
 I first bought this book thirty years ago. I now use it as a text book for my Mexican American Culture and Society Class and for my Pre Hispanic life and Religion Class. This book is basic in  understanding the depth of philosophical and religious thought of the ancient Mexican. Portilla is is primarily instruemental in all of his writings in intoducing the reader to the ancient civilizations of this hemisfaire....that was in exsisitance at the same time of the old world....and which we have been so ignorant of for too long 
 the simple words and bold pictures lead babies and toddlers on a fun trip through the four seasons.  this book helps  children to use their imaginations to discover their environments 
 This book offers a progressive perpsective on "traditions" in political thought. It's extremely well written, clear, and concise. Highly recommended for students and general readers 
 I have 5-year-old triplets who just started kindergarten 2 days ago. I bought many books about going to school hoping to ease their fears about the first day of school. Specifically the book addresses many fears that children often have before attending kindergarten. Daughter Bear was very nervous about her first day of school but after meeting another nervous kindergarten bear on the bus and having a fun day painting, playing, etc., she was so excited for school the next day. After reading this to my kids they focused on the fun stuff and remembered they where not alone in their fears. This book was great! We have almost all of the Berenstain Bears Books and love them 
 We love this chair..... we feed our son in it and he sits in it at times when we play. It fits him really well. We started at 4 months in it, and he needed a little help from falling over, but now he does great. DO NOT LEAVE A BABY UNATTENDED IN IT... they will eventually squirm their way into falling out. Love the color, love that it is light weigth. We throw it in the van and take it to Grandmas for play and feeding too. 
 This is one of Van Damnes best.I love his character in theis movie and i love the setting.Great Performance by Van Damne.**** 
 This book, the 'Critique of Judgement', is the third volume in Immanuel Kant's Critique project, which began with 'Critique of Pure Reason' and continued in 'Critique of Practical Reason'.  Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) is considered one of the giants of philosophy, of his age or any other. It is largely this book that provides the foundation of this assessment. Whether one loves Kant or hates him (philosophically, that is), one cannot really ignore him; even when one isn't directly dealing with Kantian ideas, chances are great that Kant is made an impact.   Kant was a professor of philosophy in the German city of Konigsberg, where he spent his entire life and career. Kant had a very organised and clockwork life - his habits were so regular that it was considered that the people of Konigsberg could set their clocks by his walks. The same regularity was part of his publication history, until 1770, when Kant had a ten-year hiatus in publishing. This was largely because he was working on this book, the 'Critique of Pure Reason'.   Kant as a professor of philosophy was familiar with the Rationalists, such as Descartes, who founded the Enlightenment and in many ways started the phenomenon of modern philosophy. He was also familiar with the Empiricist school (John Locke and David Hume are perhaps the best known names in this), which challenged the rationalist framework. Between Leibniz' monads and Hume's development of Empiricism to its logical (and self-destructive) conclusion, coupled with the Romantic ideals typified by Rousseau, the philosophical edifice of the Enlightenment seemed about to topple.  This book is divided into two major sections, the Critique of Aesthetic Judgement, and the Critique of Teleological Judgement.  In the part on Aesthetics, Kant sets up for possible judgements - agreeable, good, sublime and beautiful.  This relates back to the 'Critique of Pure Reason' (and scholar J.H. Bernard indicates that this framework is sometimes a bit of a shackle placed on Kant).  Those things that are agreeable are wholly sensory in character, whereas those things that are good are ethical in nature.  Kant argues that those things that are beautiful and sublime fall between the two poles of 'agreeable' and 'good'.  Beauty is involved in purpose (teleology), whereas sublimity is that which goes beyond comprehension (and can be an object of fear).  This also involves an idea of mind that allows for genius and creative activity.  In the section on teleology, this is a way of looking at things based on their ends (telos), and links to aesthetics in terms of beauty (which has a sense of finality of form) as well as links to scientific purposes - Kant particularly is concerned to explore biology and the telos of the natural world.  This also involves physics and logical principles, bringing Kant full circle back to some of the ideas from the 'Critique of Pure Reason'.  This is one of Kant's master works, and while there is much that modern philosophers disagree with, there is also the sense in which no subsequent philosophy can ignore the developments and implications of Kant's Critique project.   
 I picked one up from a local Target today along with a General Grievous Starfighter and Droid Battle Pack, both of which I've also written reviews on. I'm lovin it.  This set comes with 4 clone trooper MiniFigs, 2 white, one red, and one yellow. The markings are pretty nice. There are only 2 blasters and a set of binoculars for the four clones, but blasters on the speeder andgun turret that you can take off if you need extra. The blasters are new, shaped like a normal clone trooper blaster and nicely detailed.   The speeder is cool. It seats two clones,a driver and a gunner. The turret really isn't anything special. The gun isn't that movable, but it's larger than the other blasters and looks cool for a clone scout. I would have swapped the turret for another clone MiniFig and blaster, butthat's just me.   Basically, you get 4 clone troopers, a mediocre gun turret, and a nive speeder for just $10! It's great for building a clone army since it's so cheap, and it's really cool if you already have a Clone Turbo Tank or Republic gunship. Pick a few of these up, you won't regret it 
 Quite different from the previous Kovacs-books in setting, its world-view is the same: Dark and cynical. If you hang up in the details, of course you may find parts of the story unrealistic, but still close enough to the world of today to make you recognize its relevance. This is after all fiction, not documentary. I was specially impressed by the way the development of the main character in the book is described as the story unfolds: A lot of people having worked hard to achieve something in a dog eats dog world, can easily relate to it. The corporate world and ethics defined in the book is barely a small step away, in fact, the very same, just laid out in a more explicit and morbid fashion. All in all a great read 
 I became interested in Duke Ellington after hearing his music played on JAZZ.  Up until that time I had only heard "Take the A-Train", which is a good piece, but a bit too slick and polished for my tastes, as is much of his later music.  I prefer the early music, which has more of a raw, original quality, and  the not-so-great sound quality of the early stuff makes it even more fun to listen to.  I guess this gives an idea of how the music sounded on a Victrola, with the 78 rpm records.  I believe Perez Prado, the Cuban mambo king of the 1950s, must have been influenced by the music of Ellington, because I notice many similarities in their music 
 The Bob Newhart Show is one of my favorite classic 70's shows and I used to watch episodes on Nick At Nite and TVLand and was very disappointed when they dropped this show from their lineups. Good news for everyone who wrote reviews saying they wanted this shiw to get complete season DVD sets, the show has finally gotten that and so far the complete first and second seasons are out on DVD 
 After seeing these guys live a few times during the glory days, I have a lot of respect for them.  This album is KILLER.  Every track rocks.  For those of you who haven't seen the movie, go check out CLAY PIGEONS, which features "Timebomb" as the opening track.  The soundtrack has tons of other awesome alt/country/punk music on it.  I recommend TOO FAR TO CARE to anyone who likes CMT and country radio.. 
 Great book! Kelton shows us Charlie Flagg's country. You'll like i 
 My husband and I found this book invaluable in raising our son. There is so much information that you need to know: from dealing with varied emotions to working with your child's teachers and peers and helping them relate to the world. Should definitely be a required book for all parents of adopted children 
 In the not-too-distant future, Daisy, a Manhattan resident, is sent to live with her cousins on the English countryside.  At first, the English countryside is something of a paradise.  Daisy forms an instant bond with her cousin Edmond, and she spends her days gallivanting with her cousins.  Until the war comes.  A nameless enemy invades England.  At first, Daisy and her cousins live in a sort of untouched paradise, separated from the war by the countryside.  But then the war finds them, and Daisy and her cousin Piper are separated from the boys.    This book is clever and engaging and it draws you in and then it breaks your heart.  I didn't expect the direction the book took.  It shocked me.  I kept thinking that something would change, that the direction would turn back, but it didn't, and that is the brilliance of this book.  It is a war story, and in war, things often start out kind of okay and then move to awful.  It feels true.  It hurts.  Daisy's voice is incredibly vivid - I can almost hear it in my head even now, a week after reading it.  Daisy, her family, her world - they all stand out in stark colors in my head.  This is one of those great books that lingers in your heart after you've finished reading 
 Today, when there is little but propaganda on TV and at the bookstore, it is astonishing to read a 20th century English-speaking author write in a way devoid of the propaganda.  I doubt that the work could be published as is today were it new, even if by such a well-known author.  Those were the days of free, or at least freeer press.   Because the time span is so great, more attention is paid to 19th Century history up to the end of WW I, where it stops than to older periods.  But earlier periods are treated in ways according to the information available to the non-specialist.  Wells' history is easier to read than that of the Durants and lacks their obvious bias. With the exception of Spengler, Wells' History is perhaps the last history or biography in which the European point of view is taken as matter-of-fact. 
 This was the first book that described what happened to me over 8 years ago... daily I struggle with the path I am now on... between being "AWAKE" and being drawn into the typical BS of daily western life that pulls us deeper into a pattern based... fear driven animal... BARELY SELF CONSCIOUS... except in moments of desperation... it was a hell of alot easier to be a "christ" figure 1000's of yrs ago when all we needed to do was head out to the desert at our doorstep to rise higher... I'd like to see the master of galilee deal with LA traffic!!!... HOWEVER... I am confident that a new "golden" age  (literally) is coming... things revealed to me have just recently been interpreted in their entirety... the path forward for all of us (yes all of us!!!)... eventually... is... inevitably... filled with joy and light... upon becoming CC it is not the end but only the beginning.. the true rebirth.. the awakening... from here the "work" truly begins. I only hope that my will... or should I say "thy will".. can surmount the "man" that seeks to destroy me... "I HAVE YET BEGUN TO FIGHT!!!!!!".  I suggest one that has arrived read Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi... I believe the Kriya technique will bring much change to the individual that is already CC.. and is infact needed.. there are other things as well.. but i wont mention them here (i may write a book on "THIS" subject)... for thse that are CC i leave u this poem .. which to me is the most beautiful ever written about this experience and the noble souls that have arrived here:   THE DREAM OF SIR GALAHAD by MADISON CAWEIN  With the knights Peredur and Gawain he sits, in a chapel in Lyonesse, speaking while the dawn slowly reddens on the sea, gray-seen through the open door.  		I Cast on sleep there came to me Three great angels, o'er the sea Moaning near the priory: Cloudy clad in awful white, Each one's face, a lucid light, Rayed and blossomed out of night.    		II  In my sleep I saw them rest, Each, a long hand on her breast, Like the new-moon in the west: And their hair like sunset rolled Down their shoulders, burning cold, An insufferable gold.  		III  Flaming round each high brow bent Fourfold starry gold, that sent Light before them as they went: 'Neath their burning crowns their eyes Shone like awful stars the skies Rock in shattered storm that flies.  		IV  Dark their eyes were, lurid dark; And within their eyes a spark Like the opal's burned:  my sark Seemed to shrivel 'neath their gaze; As, with marvel and amaze,  All my soul it seemed to raise.  		V  And I saw their mouths were fire, Ruby-red as the desire Of the Sanc Graal:  fair and dire Were their lips, whereon the kiss Of all Heaven lay;  the bliss Of all happiness that is.  		VI  Calm as Beauty lying dead, Tapers lit at feet and head, Were they, round whom prayers seemed said: Fragrant as that woman who, Born of blossoms and of dew And of magic, wedded Llew.  		VII  And the first one said to me:-- "Thou has slept thus holily While seven sands ran shadowy; Earth hath served thee like a slave, Serving us who found thee brave, Pure of life and great to save:  		VIII  "Know!"--She touched my brow:  a pain  As of arrows pierced my brain: Ceased:  and earth, both sea and plain, Vanished:  and I stood where thought Stands, and worship, spirit-fraught, Watching how the heavens are wrought.  		IX  Then the second said to me: "Thou hast come all sinlessly Thro' life's sin-enveloped sea: Know the things thou hast not seen: Filling all the soul with sheen; Meaning more than earth may mean:  		X  "See!"--Her voice sang like a lyre, Comprehending all desire In its gamut's throbbing fire:-- And my inner eyelids,--which Dimmed clairvoyance,--raised:  and rich, As one chord's vibrating pitch,  		XI  Grew my soul with light:  that saw The embodiment of awe, Love, divinity, and law, Orbed and e?ned:  and the power, Circumstance, like some vast flower; From which time fell, hour on hour.  		XII  'Neath the third one's mighty will All my soul lay very still, Feeling all its being thrill As she, smiling, said to me: "Thou dost know, and thou canst see: What thou art arise and be!"  		XIII  To my lips her lips she pressed; And my new-born soul, thrice-blessed, Clasped her radiance and caressed: Mounted and, in glory clad, Soared with them who chorused glad: "Christ awaits thee, Galahad! 
 I have had the honor to work with Greg in a hospital in San Francisco. He lives a life we can only dream about. Here is my fatwa: Keep building those schools, Greg!  J. Scott R 
 (From Planeta Journal) - One of the first guidebooks to focus on the parks and preserves, this book is now in its second edition. It's an invaluable resource for visitors who'd like to get to know Costa Rica's lesser known parks and includes trail directions, dozens of hikes and descriptions of local flora and fauna. The new, second edition of this book includes five new national parks and preserves, plus updated and expanded descriptions of all 40 of Costa Rica's protected areas 
 Forget the fact that the book was written in the 1950s.  It is just as relevant today as it was back then.  The analysis of decision making and organizational design is pretty good.  It's a seminal book worth reading 
 Richard Hawley definatly croons his listeners.  His voice is deep and sexy, his songs are classy.  Tracks 1 and 3 particularly drew me in, reminding me of a solo walk through the streets of London.  I would definatly recommend this CD to those looking for a mellow, simple sound.. 
 This text is "user-friendly", interesting and factual; equally useful for the Biblical novice and the "less than novice" 
 In this, the fifth volume in the series "The Story of Civilization," Dr. Will & Ariel Durant have compiled a magnificent treatise covering the Italian Renaissance.  At over >720 pages, the reader will discover: The magnificent cities of Renaissance Italy (sovereign Florence, Pisa, Venice, etc.).  The Great Artists such as Leonardo, Michelangelo, and more.  The Great Medici family.  Cesare Boria, the model for Machiavelli's master work "The Prince." Rome, briefly resurgent as the "capital of the world," until sacked by French and German mercenaries.  And much, much more including plates and maps.  Although written to stand alone, or in the series, the Durants have created a smooth prose that is easily read and understood by both professional and layperson alike.  Well done!  The prospective reader would do well to purchase this book.  I rate it as five stars as part of the Durants authoritative historical Magnum Opus!       
 Before I saw this movie, I had my doubts right off. I was wondering why the reviews for this movie were so bad. I thought, "Do I really want to waste money on a movie that I won't enjoy?" But being a die hard fan of Charlie Sheen ever since I saw him as the football jock in Lucas, I took a chance. So I spent my money and here is my opinion of GOOD ADVICE. First of all, the supporting cast is hysterical! Jon Lovitz and Rosanna Arquette as a married couple. He plays Barry, a plastic surgeon and she is Kathy, his money hungry wife. Estelle Harris plays Iris, a sweet old lady who works at the paper. Ex Melrose Place alumn Lisa Rinna has a bit part as Veronica Simpson, the wife of newspaper mogul Donald Simpson. The plot is very simple. We meet Ryan Turner (Sheen) who loses a successful job due to insider trading. He is to much of a risk to go work for one of his competators, so he is out of a job. Turner's girlfriend (Richards) is bored and unhappy at her job. She writes for her own advice column, "Ask Cindy." Without telling her boss, or her best friend, Cindy boards a plane to Brazil and no one except Ryan knows she's gone. In need of a paycheck, he assume's Cindy's identity and takes over her column. Ryan is also falling head over heels with Cindy's editor, Paige. (Harmon) In time, everyone is asking "Where is Cindy?" Finally, thanks to Ryan, he has turned this fading column into a popular paper. Now, Cindy returns and the sparks are about to fly! I was not disappointed at all with this movie. It was funny, sweet, romantic, sexy, and smart. With Charlie Sheen, Angie Harmon, and Denise Richards as your leads, you can't go wrong!! 
 4.5 stars.  Angra's latest release, while not as refreshingly energetic as "Rebirth" and not as intricate and creative as "Temple of Shadows", is nonetheless impressive front to back and really grows on the listener with repeat spins.  At first, I was convinced this was the weakest of their last three releases.  But after a few more spins it reveals itself as a superb Progressive Power Metal release that shows a band becoming more and more comfortable with its new identity.  After the band fractured and band members were replaced, their appropriately titled album "Rebirth" gave little doubt that Angra would carry on.  "Temple of Shadows" thereafter solidified their status as one of the Progressive Power Metal elite.  With "Aurora Consurgens" they show they are here to stay with a newfound heaviness and a compact set of ten solid songs that become more interesting with each visit.  Hopefully, Angra can continue this consistency for many more albums to come.     
 This piece is extremely versatile. The handles stay cool, it cleans up beatifully, and I've never had a problem with sticking. I used it tonight to brown chicken breasts, then make soup, and last weekend I used it for a water bath to bake a cheesecake. It's big enough to brown a pork tenderloin, then oven-roast it without crowding, and it's also a perfect width for steaming frozen Snow crab legs. My only regret is that I hadn't bought several more 
 i bought this new christmas in ny pop-up book, having already bought the white house pop-up last year...chuck fischer is an amazing artist, and the care and skill that these books are put together is extraordinary.. 
 This book changed my life when I first read it more than 15 years ago.  My father died when I was very young and that event left me terrified of death.  Then I read "Who Dies?" and realized there was another  way to look at death.  The book also led me to begin working with people  dying and/or grieving.  The book is really about life.  Live it now, today,  because we never know when this precious gift will be over.  Thank you,  Stephen Levine 
 This book, the introduction to the Han Solo trilogy, is all about Han's earliest years as a street urchin getting by on running scams and picking pockets, while dreaming of escaping in order to join the imperial navy.    I loved the secondary characters in this book.  Bria was great as the love interest, and Shrike made a good enemy.  But it was Muuurgh, the co-pilot/bodyguard, that really stole the show.  Just the idea of a large feline species that had a blaster strapped to his hip was awesome.  Crispin did a great job of giving the whole book that "Star Wars" feel.  She even got to talk about places like Alderaan and Coruscant in detail, which I really appreciated.  A great book.  Sometimes it felt like I was reading a children's book, but it was a fun read all the way through, and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the Trilogy 
 or a sunny one for that matter.  P.G always delivers!!  If you haven't read him don't wait 
 Heard FOR LOVE OF THE GAME by Michael Sahara, a posthumously published baseball novel by the Pulitzer Prize winning author of THE KILLING ANGELS . . . you might have to dig some to find it, but your search will be worth the  effort.  This is a short, surprisingly moving tale of an aging baseball superstar who is pitching the last game of the season . . . through a series of flashbacks, you learn about his career and the one woman he loves (but who is leaving him).  The writing is compelling, and it makes you feel that you really get to know the guy . . . plus, it has you rooting for his every pitch and caring about what happens to him.  There's a great ending, too. 
 I haven't read Esolen's Inferno, but his translation of Purgatory was superb--not just the translation itself but the notes, which I'm fairly certain Esolen wrote.  After translating the Inferno, the Purgatory, and then the Paradise, Esolen was stimulated to write a magnificent interpretative introduction to the Paradise which is one of the best pieces I've ever read on Dante.  Esolen's Introduction to the Paradise ranks with Erich Auerbach's essays on Dante in Mimesis and Scenes from the Drama of European Literature, and I prefer it to T. S. Eliot's famous essay on Dante; it is a classic.  Esolen's introduction to the Paradise in this edition is alone worth the price of the book, and I would characterise it as a must-read for anyone interested in Dante and his Comedy.  As with the previous volumes of the Comedy, in the Paradise Esolen again proves himself to be a sensitive and judicious translator, and the notes are again excellent 
 I absolutely love this jacket and just bought a second one. Has stood up through some bad storms and kept me dry. It is fully adjustable with velcro around the wrists and on the back of the attached hood which actually allows you to adjust the height of the hood. The hood also has a nice wide visor which helps keep the rain out of your eyes. There are 2 side pockets, 1 chest pocket, and 1 inside pocket. The jacket can be completely stuffed inside it's chest pocket for backpacking or long term storage, although I have found this is difficult to do and takes a lot of time and effort. It is also very breathable for such a waterproof fabric and any sweat seems to dry quickly. I couldn't find this jacket in women's sizes so I went with a men's medium which fits a women's large with room to layer a sweater underneath. Overall, highly recommended to everyone 
 This book is just the thing if you need a little - or a lot - of motivation to jump start your life. I read it during a difficult time two weeks ago and it made a difference - thank you 
 Great book to follow Breeding for Dummies. Fills in blanks and is very easy to understand. Dwells a little to much on 'breeding is not for everyone' and talking about spaying a neutering. But we all get that and we all hear that and the only reason we buy this book is to learn to breed correctly ie. what to expect in our dog and what to look for in a mate and then how to handle whelping. But overall, a very good book 
 This is the funkiest album ever. Most of the band is back together again, and they are tight. Funk is about the rhythm, and you can tell that Dave and Rocco are having fun. If you have been a TOP fan from the beginning, as I have, you will be excited about the new song 
 When a representative of Random House contacted Angelou with the suggestion that she write an autobiography at the tender age of forty, she demurred, and he lay down a challenge by saying that she might be right to refuse, for writing autobiography as literature is nearly impossible to do. Angelou picked up that challenge and met it squarely, for her six-volume autobiography does indeed qualify as literature.  As has been noted in several reviews of her other books in this series, she writes not the dry facts of her existence but rather the colorful and expressive interpretation of those facts.  Instead of recounting happenings, she paints for the reader her interpretation of them, their significance, and their place in her universe.  History may underlie her writing, but it is the view that Angelou has of those historical events that gives her books interest and meaning.  A SONG FLUNG UP TO HEAVEN is the concluding volume of Angelou's autobiographical writings, and, by itself, it is of limited instruction for the reader. It is quite brief, easily read in a single sitting.  The first short chapters present a skeletal synopsis of her personal history.  The final chapter gives wing to her philosophical view of humankind.  In between, the reader is given a glimpse of the frustrations leading to the Watts Riots and of the despair occasioned by the assassinations of Malcolm X and of Martin Luther King.  This volume also continues earlier books' insightful descriptions of King, Malcolm X, and James Baldwin, adding much to the understanding of these men by the general public.  This slim volume is indeed the conclusion of the other five books that comprise Angelou's autobiographical works detailing the first half of her life.  It is no more logical to begin reading this book without having first read the others than it is to read the final chapter of a novel before enjoying all of the preceding chapters.  If one is to comprehend this book fully, he must begin with I KNOW WHY THE CAGED BIRD SINGS and follow with its successors until he reaches A SONG FLUNG UP TO HEAVEN in the proper course of things.  If a criticism must be lodged against this book, it is only that its brevity is such that it scarcely warrants being published as a separate volume.  It could easily have been appended to the preceding book, ALL GOD'S CHILDREN NEED TRAVELING SHOES.  The fact that the end of the book comes so quickly forces the reader to wonder whether Angelou tired of her writing project, ran headlong into an ultimate publishing deadline, or wished to eke out a bit more recompense from her publisher by forcing one additional volume through his presses.  Some of the preceding autobiographical volumes have been described as having perhaps a bit too much virulence against Whites, perhaps a little too much hyperbole concerning the enduring effects of historical slavery.  Some of Angelou's statements reveal a "reverse racism," to use one of her own phrases.  Of course, the social climate in the United States during much of Angelou's life hardly engendered loving relations between White and Black citizens, yet the non-aggression of a Martin Luther King grew and matured in this environment, making Angelou's strident condemnations of the White population as much a factor of her own personality as of her social environment, and, after many pages, that stridency becomes tiresome. This final volume, however, is free of such hostility and is much more accepting of good people regardless of their color.  In brief, if one has read the first five volumes of Angelou's autobiography, then by all means do finish with this sixth one.  On the other hand, picking this one up and reading it first will deprive the reader of an accurate appreciation of Angelou's artistry, in both its strengths and its weaknesses, as a prose writer and may well leave the reader with a complete mis-perception of Angelou's autobiographical books.  Angelou's autobiographical series is one of those things that really should be experienced in the order of their creation, and doing so will give the reader a captivating view of this most unusual author and poet 
 What a wake up call this documentary shouts!!! Professional scientists around the world all agree that what Al Gore presents in this film is a very conservative generalization of what's in store for us... most all scientist actually believe things will be even worse!!! Though I was aware of most all of the data presented, I didn't realize just how perplex and intertwined the issues just are (i.e. How most all of the suns rays are reflected back into space when we have ice caps & how most of all the suns rays get absorbed by the water; soon the artic will be open seas during the summers). Only thing that bothered me was that completely crappie, not enjoyable cartoon.  Anywhoo... I'm definitely going to show this to friends and family. I leave by pointing to the facts that have been known now for at least a decade... unfortunately we still have people in this country who still believe the world is flat!! 
 Robert Bolton is the president of a company that teaches other business professionals how to communicate more effectively--specifically how to listen more effectively, how to be assertive, and how to do conflict management.  Bolton's communication skills stem from a basic premise:  that people lead with their emotions and that facts are secondary.  I think he hit the nail on the head with that hypothesis.  When people are angry, sad, frustrated, happy, (you name it) and come to tell you about the event that made them feel that way, what they really want first is for you to understand the emotion.  Then (and only then) can you start working on the facts.  The skills and models Bolton presents throughout the book, therefore, focus on helping the reader gain an emotinal understanding of others, then (once the other believes you understand his emotion) does Bolton give skills that deal with facts and figures.  His three main topics are reflective listening (saying back to the speaker what he just said so he knows you understand), assertiveness techniques (which lead with the emotion you're feeling), and skills to manage emotional conflicts.  In all, each of these skills is broken down and communicated effectively by the author.  This reader especially appreciated the fact that Bolton broke each skill down into simple "bite-sized" formulas, encourages the reader to master the forumula, then encourages him to break away from the formula.  Both the skills and the rationale are explained well.    This book present some concerns, though.  Bolton readily admits that applying these skills will be awkward for both the reader and his speaking partners because people just don't tend to speak placing the focus on emotions.  Second, Boltons does subscribe to an "I'm OK, You're OK" sort of worldview.  While he wants his children to have a clean room and respectul appearance, he says that he never asserts himself to communicate these things because he doesn't want to impose his values on others.  While I understand many subscribe to this idea, where is the line drawn?  If it's immoral to express his distaste for a sloppy bedroom, is it similarly immoral to repremand an employee for a sloppy cubicle?  When is it OK to have opinions and worldviews and when is it against the book's philosophy?    This book, although imperfect, is highly recommended.  I've already employed some of the techniques and am seeing favorable results 
 this movie is funny as hell!this was way better than the first one OK the story isn't really that great but it sure is funny!i was so sad before watchin it and now i can't stop laughin 
 I've worked out with Kathy Smith videos for years. I'm about the same age as her and was delighted when she tackled the subject of the menopause. It is a very postive dvd and it made me feel empowered.   I do work out regularly and found the cardio a bit too easy for me but will definately use it on days when I feel a bit tired. I would definately recommend this to beginners and intermediate exercisers of any age. The workouts are short and therefore easy to fit in when busy. 
 I loved Eknath Easwaran's book Conquest of Mind because it was so easy to read.  I enjoyed his message even though it will take me years to discipline my mind to find peace.  I can't help but be motivated, due to this book, to pursue the conquest of my mind.  Mr. Easwaran is a great teacher.  I hope to be a good student.  In this time of war and confusion we need more teachers like him.  Better yet, we need more students.  This book has nothing to due with religion, government, cultural background.  It is a book for anyone who wants to live a more balanced and peaceful life.   
 I haven't watched this DVD yet, but it arrived quickly and in excellent conditon 
 ive been trying to buy this dvd for ages and from many places but i only found it on amazon.com . film was clear and delivery was ok to . 
 I have use a Fannie Farmer Cookbook for years and it is one of my favorites.  I recently bought this edition for my daughter and daughter in law for Christmas.  They both love it.  It is the first cookbook that my daughter in law has owned 
 Edward is an older engine who is extremely kind to everyone. He is even kind to the small engines when they get into difficulties, as well as the big engines even when they are rude or impatient.  Although Edward is the same blue color as Thomas (#1) and Gordon (#4), #2 Edward is a staple on the Island of Sodor--making it into almost every episode and Thomas the Tank Engine book.  Edward comes in two parts, held together by a strong magnet, and is very sturdy. My son has had his for years, and it still looks good as new! (Despite HOURS of playing).  Although he isn't colorful, he's a reliable fixture on the Island of Sodor 
 I have seen many historical war dramas from Far East (mainly China's) and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy.  Yi Soon Shin, however, is a rare exception.  Not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in-fighting between the Chosun political factions (and the second-guessing nature of the king) which causes his eventual death.     Also, the special effects are great.  The battle scenes (whether on sea or land) are realisitic and of outstanding quality.  The only problem that I can find is that the DVD has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the Ming China.  Then again, this is not unexpected since this is a Korean drama focusing on the great admiral.  Also, the entire selection should have 104 episodes.  I don't know why it stops at 101.  If you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject, try Samuel Hawley's Imjin War (which portrays Yi Soon Shin more accurately by quoting original sources).  Any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out Stephen Turnbull's Samurai Invasion (which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the Japanese perspective).    Lastly, anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out Shogun:Total War by Creative Assembly (now in Gold version). 
 This book is essential to anyone who wants to know all the steps that lead to the criation of the Jewish State and its following development.At the same time, the reader is able to see a general picture of Israel's history and get deeper into several aspects of this singular history.When describing Israel's wars against the Arab States, the author puts you as if you were into the scene, generating great emotion.Indeed, it is basic for any zionist or history researcher's library 
 (5-CD abridged set--abridged by Karen DiMattia)  Cassandra Devine, a cynical Washington spindoctor, is frustrated by the American government's refusal to deal with the looming crisis. She vents her spleen on her blog "Cassandra," determined that her generation shouldn't have to pay the bill for the unrestrained spending of the previous generation. After inspiring few minor protests, Cassandra offers a radical solution to Social Security's insolvency--that the government offer incentives to commit suicide by age seventy-five.  Ten years earlier, her father's suggestion that she sign on for a term of military service to pay for her education, landed her in Bosnia where she worked for military public relations: the Spinning Eagles. There she meets Senator Randolph K. Jepperson IV who later, against all expectations, puts forward Cassandra's idea of "transitioning" as a Senatorial bill when all she wanted was for debate to begin about the issue. And thus the foundation is made responsible for the screwball events and nefarious political dealings which Christopher Buckley brings vividly to life in Boomsday, his newest novel.  Boomsday is a term economists use to refer to the day the first of America's 77 million baby boomers retire. Buckley's wicked satire combines truly outrageous ideas within a very real situation.  Financial trouble is looming for Social Security, and it is plausible that this may cause economic problems for the U.S. The generational conflict provides substantial fodder for Buckley's Swiftian tale, and a new section of Washington to lampoon. Cassandra's "meta-issue" spirals out of control as special interest and lobby groups amend and compromise the bill into oblivion.  Boomsday is read by Jeanane Garofalo, who quickly establishes distinct voices for all the major characters. Her adept and consistent voicing ensures that listeners soon forget the book is being read by a celebrity reader (comedian and actress). Of particular note is her rendition of the news report which opens the book. Anyone who gets their news from NPR will recognize her tone and pacing.  While Buckley has created another frothy tale of delight, Boomsday would have provided greater nourishment if he offered some solid solutions to offset his "modest proposal" for the coming Social Security crisis.  Armchair Interview says: How close you are to age 75 might determine how you feel about this story 
 I didn't do the excersizes and I didn't get as much out of the book.  It's tempting to not do them as you can get the concepts from the discussion, but I suspect given the extreme reviews of this book, that doing them makes all the difference.  If you're not going to do them, then buy another book. 
 This was the first book I had ever read by Dietz and found it worth the trouble. I was captivated by the concept of a cyborg army with brains, something you don't see too much of on the silver screen. The intimate scenes in the book, especially the one with Mosby and the emperor/emperor were interesting to say the least. The character development in the book was well done and there were a few suprise deaths in the book, which I like. However, for some reason late in the book I became a little bored. To me it became a little too predictable but was still a good read. I am currently reading the next book in the series 
 Excellent book. Highly recommend it for all beginner geocachers as well as advanced geocachers. Doc Beamont, Texas Geocache 
 These two words describe simply the book. However, for those "busy souls intimidated by the length of his great novels", I must say: "Buy his long great novels, particularly 'The Idiot' and 'Crime and  Punishment'. It will only take you more time reading them but it will be  worth it for sure. Believe me.&quot 
 Most books detailing historical events are heavy on facts and figures and light on side commentary.  Sarah Vowell's approach to her book "Assassination Vacation" is a bit different.  Her tale is as much about her and her twisted, sarcastic sense of humor as it is about Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley and their killers.  I have wondered lately why it is that a few people I know have suggested this book repeatedly.  I regret now that I did not listen to them earlier.  I am familiar with her from NPR and "This American Life".  The author's voice is distinctive and I have caught snippets of her here and there flipping channels.  After reading the book I now understand that the reason I was pointed to "Assassination Vacation" is that my sarcastic sense of humor and ability to link esoteric bits of trivia together into a string of seemingly random connections have met their better in the figure of Sarah Vowell.  Worse yet, after reading about hard to find plaques and assorted adventures on the road researching the sites and historical figures behind these political assassinations, I have a deeper desire to read a bit more.  I actually want to find out a bit more about Emma Goldman and the anarchist movement in America.  Somewhere, someone has written a bit more about the utopian Oneida community.  Also, it seems that Vowell has some more books I have not read yet as well.  I think "Radio On" will be next on my list 
 I am teaching art based on literature.  I just added this book to my art library.  The illustrations are wonderful, perfect for a class on African art or working with chalks.  The text is as lively as the illustrations and the kids just love the three animal character 
 This first edition is probably not where you want to invest your dollars.  The second edition (ISBN 0596100469 )  is projected to be out this month (July 2006) and will cover not only 2.4 but 2.5.   Martelli has been so comprehensive and comprehensible in the past, that you'll probably want to get his SECOND edition if you're serious about Python 
 This is an engaging book about New Zealand, written in a genial and self-revelatory manner, by an author who approaches the topic from his perspective as a psychiatrist, adventurer and successful financial trader. The author seems to have done everything and seen everything of interest on the Islands, in addition to getting to know a fascinating cross section of its inhabitants. He has accomplished the remarkable feat of capturing New Zealand's essence after a fairly brief but intense stay, developing an easy familiarity with the lay of the land and its history, as well as a good feel for the native people and recent arrivals,  commerce and business, all painted in vivid colors, with warmth and affection.  There  are many subtle touches of humor on the pages of this book, pages which whiz by until one, regretfully, arrives at the last 
 This book is incredible! Having to have used it my self, i can honistly say that the information in here is very informative. It goes through all of the major aspects of each verse and chapter, and even throws in some of the smaller points that are very usful for study.   I would highly recommend this book to any one that needs information regarding the old and new testaments. It is well worth spending the money to get it! 
 I read this as a book on tape.  I had heard about this book for years as "a classic" but never could get up enough interest to actually read it.  When I got it as a book on tape I could read it in my car or while laying down relaxing at home.  I found that it IS a "good book" and is worthy of it's stature as "a classic".  Recommended.

 I am a busy FP doc at a military base and I see a considerable amount of dermatologic complaints.  I try to take care of most of it myself (since we have no dermatologist on staff) and find this book indispensable to my daily practice.  I open it practically every day.  For those of you who think the 'baby' Habif is enough, it's not!  Trust me, I tried to scrape by with the 'baby' version for years before I bit the bullet and bought it.  The sections on acne, eczema, dermatophytosis, and rosacea are outstanding.  
 I had never read any of Capote's works, but after I saw the movie, "Capote", I realized I had a big gap in my survey of American fiction and I knew  I had to experience the writing of this interesting  and tormented person.  Other reviewers have gone into detail about the stories themselves and I don't find that very interesting anyway, so I'll leave you to explore that for yourself.  I will tell you that if you like Hemmingway or Fitzgerald,  then Capote's observations and will strike a cord with you.  His writing - clear, emotionally invoking and efficient in word is perhaps not as poetic  as these two, but is their equal in impact.  The stories are rather short and I found myself wishing they were longer if only to  prolong exposure  to his work.  If you have little experience with Capote, you  will not be disappointed 
 The exceptional wordcrafting in West With The Night brings Africa alive and makes it almost a personal experience. Beryl Markham was a most interesting individual and her life growing up in Africa is the beautiful background for this book. I have only reread one book in my sixty-some years and this is it. I enjoyed it at least as much the second time around.  I recommend this book to anyone, especially those interested in Africa, horses, aviation or just splendid writing 
 This book is a proof that food that's good for you doesn't have to be bland. This is a must read for all food lovers out there that want to eat healthy. I love to eat but at the same time want to feel good about what I eat and this book teaches you how to do that exactly!  It's packed with tips and advise on healthy eating and cooking. I  have tried few of the recipes already and they are a winner every time!  Awesome!!! 
 Have you ever wondered what it would be like during World War II if you were younger than 13?  Well this makes you feel just what it would be like.  This book takes you from 2007 to 1943, and you feel like you are there.  You go through all the pain, and sadness and love that was felt back then.  This book is so acurate.  Some of the storyies in it are even taken from lifes of others back then, and combined all together.  I love this book, and if you have not read it, you really should.  If you have read it, you should read it again 
 This is funk 101.  Simple, basic, purified funk. just barely distinct at this point from r&b, it's clean punchy lines laid bare.  Solos are underplayed to perfection so that the groove is always in center focus, as it should be for this form of highly syncopated soul, from which so many present-day styles have sprung.  The Meters pretty much started it all back then, and they still own it 
 This play is odd in that critics hate it, but theater companies love it.  Harold Bloom's contempt for this play is so great that he refused to discuss it in his book on Shakespeare. But, unlike some of Shakespeare's less popular plays, Merry Wives is performed frequently in Shakespeare festivals across the land.    You really have to see this play to understand how well it works on the stage.  Played by an energetic cast it is hilarious situation comedy and easily understandable by people unfamiliar with Shakespeare.  When Falstaff says at the end, with deadpan delivery, "I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass," it brings down the house.  Just reading the play in your living room, you will probably miss much of the humor.  Shakespeare was a man of the theater.  He wrote for production, with little thought given to publication in his lifetime.  You have to see his plays performed to get a measure of his theatrical genius 
 This book is first published in 1999.  Right in the beginning, Drucker defined management as NOT only business management, but management in all kinds of organization: government, university, hospital, army, non-profit organization, etc.  The book is easy to read, just below 200 pages.  The scope and content is much wider than how we think management usually is.  It describes the CERTAINTIES: collapsing birthrate, shift in performance, global competitiveness, etc, and of course, how it affects all kinds of organizations.  It talks about information challenges, the knowledge worker and how one manage oneself in this new century.  Concepts like "individuals will outlive their organization", "how to defines one's goal and contribution" are all interesting topics and issues that everyone have to face, since, this is the REALITIES.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, not just CEO/executives, but those want to know more about oneself, how to behave and contribute in this KNOWLEDGE BASE WORLD 
 This is a beautiful little book, informative, elegantly written, and quite moving.  It reminded me that serving one's country can take many forms.  Whitman had little use for Christian pieties or military rigidity, neither of which offered much comfort to the thousands of wounded and dying young soldiers the great poet visited at their bedside.  What he did offer them was the gift of human connection, kindness, and respect, qualities too often lacking in our American society, then and now.  My one complaint is that Morris often quotes from Whitman's poems without always giving the title of the poem in question.  One would love to be able to turn from Morris to Leaves of Grass and read a given poem in its entirety, but if one doesn't have the exact edition from 1973 he used then one is out of luck.  This is a small criticism, however, and I am deeply grateful to the author for having written such an important, inspiring book 
 In this age of over-testing and over-dependence on high stakes testing to evaluate schools and students, Testing Miss Marlarkey provides a well needed diversion.  Judy Finchler cuts right to the heart of high stakes testing to present a light-hearted and humorous, but sadly accurate picture of how these tests affect schools, administration, students and parents.  Underneath the delightfully drawn pictures and tongue and cheek text, there lurks the serious effects of high-stakes testing and the author cleverly articulates how disruptive and damaging this kind of assessment can be to all parties involved.  I would recommend that all upper elementary and middle school teachers use this as a read-aloud for their students to put high-stakes testing in its proper perspective.  Thank you, Ms. Finchler, for  a common sense reaction to all this malarkey 
 This is by far the best journalistic account of the torture of suspects at Abu Ghraib. This is also the best book to read after reading the books of documents, which give you the vital context for understanding Danner's book. Read them first and then this one - you will then be able to understand what really happened and why. British and US troops really did commit terribe acts against their prisoners, with tragic consequences for the reputation of both nations in the Middle East. Read Danner and the documents books to discove why. Christopher Catherwood (author of CHURCHILL'S FOLLY: HOW WINSTON CHURCHILL CREATED MODERN IRAQ: Carroll and Graf, hardcover 2004, paperback 2005 
 As a student of the history of homosexuality, Yukio Mishima's Confessions of a Mask is one of the seminal pieces of twentieth century gay literature and a wonderful primary source for historians. It is also an easy read and incredibly insightful and powerful book. I highly recommend it 
 This book has been a wonderful addition to my library.  I am using it to train a couple of non-instructional designers on how to design and develop quality training.  It has provided an easy to read comprehensive guide.  The icons throughout the book guide those that are infrequent designers in the most applicable sections of the book vs. those that a professional ID person would need to know.  I highly recommend this book 
 I had good turn around in getting this book. The book is good, I'm just having a hard time digesting some of it. I will master it tho. Thanks Norma Nichol 
 Honestly, this is the best book i've ever read. It was my first Dean Koontz novel and I LOVED it. It was brilliant the way he twined his characters together in the suspenseful plot and I will definitely read more of his novels from my liking of this one. This book has inspired me to read again. Honestly, read it! it's Soooooooo good

 "Juran's Quality Handbook" is a massive tome of great value to quality professionals. It is not smooth reading, nor is it the type of book that can be read quickly. Indeed, to maximize the usefulness of this "Bible," I suggest reading one or two sections per month and try to apply the concepts as much as possible. It will improve one's effectiveness as a quality professional. The book covers every facet of quality I could imagine, so there certainly is no lack of material. I give it 4 stars due to an abundance of long, run-on sentences. This complicates the book unnecessarily, making the reader review sentences twice in many cases 
     America's best selling book, somewhere in the darkness by Walter dean Myers has won a Newbery honor award. As soon as you start to read you will never stop.    A life of a fourteen years old boy named jimmy is holding his own little world. He lives in Harlem. He never saw his father and lives with his mom. Suddenly one day he was walking home from school, he saw a man standing in front of his house. That's when the book starts to get interesting.     I will recommend this book as one of the best book. The writing style is very persuasive. The father of jimmy is very dramatic. You will never know what he going to do next. This book has professional language and easy to read. This book is like more reality then fiction.    It is the best time to try it out. It will probably take you week and half to finish it up. It also has lot of drama. Don't waste your time go ahead and start reading today.  
 I will agree that some special features would have been nice, but it is not enough for me to bump this down to 4 stars.  The picture quality is great!  The transition from video to DVD went very nicely for film that was done in 1969 (that's almost 30 years ago for those of you in Rio Linda).  I don't know if anybody has mentioned this, but this appears to be the FULL length of the original movie.  When it aired on TV some time in the late 1970's, the song, 'Failure Face', was totally omitted.  Probably considered too mean spirited.  In addition, there are a lot of scenes such as Lucy video taping Charlie Brown kicking the football, Charlie chewing on the weed out of the sidewalk, the Kite flying (fight?) scene.  All of these are NOT on the VHS / clamshell version that I bought in the 1980's.    If you grew up with Charlie Brown as I did and miss Charles Schultz, I highly recommend it.  It is great one for kids - be they 9 or be they 40.  I hope that they will continue with the other two Charlie Brown movies and all the television specials to DVD 
 Very interesting. This woman has led a very difficult life, but she never seems to lose her spirit 
 Exellent buy for people interested in deeper journey into foundations of drum n' bass. Highly Recommended  
 This book was written before no limit Texas Hold 'Em became the rage everywhere.  The author does a good job of explaining the game and following Binion's World Series of Poker while covering a sensational murder trial.  Some readers will enjoy as well digressions on the history of card playing and so forth.  My only wish is that his prose was more vivid and exciting--it's a great topic but a little more of a Hunter S. Thompson fear and loathing bite would make it a superb book 
 The book is a collection of articles in various aspect of embedded programming. I found out I already read some of them on www.embedded.com. It is not a tutorial to someone totally new to embedded world, but it is very useful if you already have two years experience (or more). I feel it is a great book because there is something I can learn and apply to my project. It is fun to read a chapter when I have half hour.  I do not give it a five star because it names itself Handbook, but not cover enough topic and lack of further reference if you want to dig deeper 
 CD is in good shape, got here quite fast; altogether, a nice experience 
 This is a sweet book.    The tales (tails?) are Emotionally wrenching, yet uplifting.  I have this book as the center piece in my china closet, I luv it so much.  Sometimes my dog acts like a dog and I forget he's a person.  Reading this book reminds me he is so much More 
 This book has been very helpful to me.  There are many games and songs to play with your child.  When I want to know what the sign for something is it is in this book.  I love it 
 People familiar with Carolyn Kepcher's stern demeanor and grim expressions on Trump's reality TV show will be pleasantly surprised by her sense of humor and her solid career advice. There are plenty of "the Donald" stories, but Kepcher's focuses on practical workplace strategies, from behaving and dressing appropriately in everyday situations to managing difficult bosses, handling office romances, firing employees and more. Kepcher serves up information confidently and unpretentiously, drawing on her own experiences, such as her travails with a nightmare boss when she first joined Trump's empire. This is a great book and I highly recommend it to everyone 
 Now when I heard the title of Game 6, I thought they were going to have a movie that of a bnasbeall game that took place in 1986, 20 years later, but in this movie it does take place during 1 day in October of 1986, when the Boston Red Sox met the New York Mets, (yes I did say the Mets, and not the Yankees) in game 6 at Shea Stadium. The Main character of the movie Nicky Rogan (Michael Keaton) is a Boston Red Sox fan, and also is a broadway writer/director, and it is also the openning night of his new play. Now this guy takes more rides in Taxis then I have ever seen a character in another movie, and this guy also has problems going in his life. The play is at Music Box Theater, and to have your new play open on the same day, as your team is playing in the World Series. This is the game that the baseball went through Bill Buckner's legs, and the Mets went on to win the World Series, but the good news for Boston Red Sox fans, that within 20 years since the game took place, they got to see thier team win the World Series. Nicky is about to be dirvoced from his wife (Catherine O'Hara), and also a theatre critic named Steven Schwimmer (Robert Downey Jr.) is going to be in attendance at the play, and it going to hate it, and he is warned by best friend, that also had a play that was ripped by him (. And on top of that, his dad (Tom Aldredge) is in poor health, and his daughter (Ari Graynor) is fed up with having to take sides when her parents fight, any child would get tired of doing this, but the good news for her father that she is going to see his play, and even tries to get her to bring a date to the show. The best thing I can say about this movie that it is 83 minutes long, so you can enjoy this mvoie, even if you hate movies that run a long time.      
 A good thriller, that was very Grisham.   Delivered on exactly what you read Grisham for.  
 These are very nice engineer boots!  They have that tough guy look to them not to be mistaken for cowboy boots etc while standing and pants hang over them a little.  Quality rubber and leather.  Love mine!   Chri 
 I loved this story! It is a must read for anybody who enjoys an exciting and easy to understand adventure story. The plot and character traits keep the reader interested and the action is quick and intense 
 I'm now in a "Change Management" role with my work, and decided to read some texts on the subject to further my understanding of the topic.  Of those books that I've read, this one has clearly been the most helpful.  Kotter articulates the steps of change in a way that connected with me, and made it real with a number of relevant examples.  It's not onerous to read (<200 pages) but equally isn't "lightweight."  While I would never recommend reading only a single book on the topic,  I would definitely recommend that this be one of the books you read!   
 Professor Spence has set a high standard with exceptional and appealing English language books on Chinese history, and this volume one of his best. It is a sweeping and detailed history, a truly beautiful, handsome book full of wonderful illustrations and graphics.   But it is not the best book ever written on the Taiping movement. That title belongs to the (unfortunately long out of print) 1973 "Taiping Revolutionary Movement" by Jen Yu-Wen. Profesor Jen spent 50 years investigating the Taiping history, and had a master's command of all of the sources availalble in Chinese and English. Jen's book, which is encyclopedic, but extremely readable, was one of the sources for "God's Chinese Son". Ironically, Spence wrote the foreword for Jen's book.  Spence's perspective and treatment, along with his writing style, is detached, and from a discernible Western bias. This is typical of not only Spence's histories, but those of Fairbank, etc. Jen's book takes one much closer to the on-ground, cultural, psychological and physical realities. Jen's chronicle of the military movements is far more detailed. The general dearth of sources available in English that offer the Chinese view of Chinese history is tragic.    Nevertheless, Spence's is easily the best English language Taiping history in print, and still highly recommended.             
 This book brought to light so many things that I never really knew.  Concerning, love, drugs, children and affairs.  It was a great book, but I found the last 20 pages or so to be the most captivating.  This book left me with a sad feeling, because the Kennedy's were finally beginning to truly love each other when JFK was shot.  This just goes to show that life isn't always fair.  This was a great book that I would recommend for anyone to read 
 This was my first album ever.  I was in third grade.  It was this, and Disco Duck, so, you can guess which one stood the test of time.  The other album, Glass Houses, was great too!  I was too young to understand why being a straight A student meant you thought too much, but, I knew that if you got bad grades, you were cool, and some day, I might have a white boy's afro, wear a leather member's only jacket, and throw a rock through my rich girlfriend's glass house.  What do you want from me...I was eight years old when I first heard this album.  Thanks to this album I conned my Grandparents into buying me a sax, and then a key board, and then a leather jacket, and, eventually, drums.  So, thanks to Billy Joel's Glass Houses, my life would never, ever follow a linear path on the road most travelled.  One thing that does stand out, other than the fact that this album still blows away every album I have bought since...the whole star spangled banner playing with the bars and tone sound leading into the song.  No one these days will understand what that sound means, which makes it even better.  When ever I listen to this album, it always reminds me of a simpler time when every house had one phone, no answering machine, no internet, and a TV with 3 channels on a dial that played the national anthem or star spangled banner as we all fell asleep in the living room....you know...when families all actually hung out with each other.  Thank you Billy. 
 Not an adventure when compared to fictional safari tales in which the intrepid travellers fight off fierce lions and savage "natives" in every chapter. Instead, an enjoyable and realistic account of Greene's arduous and near-disasterous trek through Liberia. Greene travelled with his cousin, Barbara Greene, who also wrote an account of their journey--Too Late to Turn Back. Interesting contrasts between the two books if you can find copies of both. I had to order a copy of Barbara's book from a used book store in England 
      Walter Benjamin, the major 20th-century cultural critic, wrote that Alois Riegl was a scholar "who penetrates so far into the historical conditions that he is able to trace the curve of their heartbeat as the line of their forms." It was in the disturbing, pre-World War I conditions of fin-de-siecle Vienna which also affected the ideas of the geniuses Freud and Wittgenstein and the art of Klimt that Riegl came to his insights that "historical context is not a 'container' of objects and events" giving them their distinctive, "historical," quality or identification, but such context rather is a "set of nonexclusive correlates emerging from the artifacts [of a particular time] themselves." This original cultural analysis is reflected in the concept of the "loss of context" and the relatively new subject of "material culture" which are parts of today's postmodernism. Riegl is recognized as one of the founders of the modern discipline of art history. This work--one of only a handful of book-length studies on this important latter nineteenth century thinker--began as a dissertation based on research in Austrian archives. Although Riegl is the primary subject, Gubser analyzes the work in the areas of history, aesthetics, and art history of contemporaries of Riegl's to draw the matrix in which Riegl's ideas were formed and convey the intellectual ambiance and interests of fin-de-siecle Vienna. Advanced students of modernism and postmodernism especially will find the book elucidating on central, formative ideas and developments in these periods 
 This book is superb for a number of reasons but the meticulous research behind it really stands out. There is not an idea or suggested proposition that is not referenced to one - and sometimes - mulitple sources. The tentive conclusions that are laid out are suggested only after exhaustive research and tightly  logical arguments.  It is not just the research and the logic, however, that makes this book so good. The book is well written and conveys the difficult subject matter of emerging, infectious diseases in a highly readable but detailed and informative matter.   The book is also laid out in a very logical fashion. In different chapters it covers everything from the etiology of new diseases to methods of transmission to social and cultural factors involved in their spread to the drama of in-field investigation of new and fiercely lethal pathogens.  The book also explores the most recent research on the evolution of new diseases, with discoveries that may portend revolutions in the understanding the natural world.  In short, this is an indespensible work for anyone wishing to understand the emergence of new diseases and cutting edge science in the modern world 
 PS2 is far from dead!!  Square-Enix has done it again!!!!   First off, I am going to say I love this game!!! I'm a big turn-based/stategy RPG fan. But I would say this gamefs battle system is semi-real-time with strategy elements and I love it!!  I would have to compare the battle system to the likes of Parasite eve and Vagrant Story!!  With the same elements still present from the original Valkyrie Profile.  This is probably the best RPG I have played all year.  I strongly recommend this game to any RPG fan and will definitely satisfy until FFXII!!!  Now for the review:   Graphics: 5 out 0f 5 Simply amazing I knew the old PS2 still had it in her.  This game has some of the best graphics you are going to see on the PS2, you may see some pixilation but hardly noticeable unless you are looking for it...  The detail in the characters, background and dungeons are amazing.  I really get taken back to Vagrant story when I play this game.  And OMG the special attacks look ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!!  Perform a special attack and your jaw will drop.  I canft say anything negative about the graphics in this game what so ever especially being last generation.   Sound:  4.5 out 5 The game sounds great!!!  The voice over are well done!!  Battle cries are wonderful and will take you back to the original Valkyrie Profile unless of course you purchased it on the PSP then it wont take you back very farcLOL     Controls 5 out of 5 Okay I donft thing I have played an RPG with better controls.  You play on a 2D screen side scrolling with outward and inward exits and entrances press up or down accordingly to access them.  Anyone who has played the first one knows exactly how it works.  The first new thing you will notice is the new battle control scheme.  The old is you still have to press X,O, , or  to correspond to the character you have assigned to that button, still works great!!  The new is that now you are able to roam in 3D once you are in battle mode and this works great I explain in the Gameplay section.  L2 lets you find and switch targets, and then you just analog to get there.   Gameplay 5 out of 5 Dare I say umm perfect!?!?!?  First I will address the two things I loved about the original Valkyrie Profile that you will find in this sequel/prequel!  1st thing - I began to get really annoyed by RPGfs now a days that make you have to talk to nearly every single person in a town to move the story along. This is never a worry in the Valkyrie Profile series.  You go to a town if there is something of importance there CG or AI takes over all you have to do is listen/read and then go shopping or if you really want, talk to the limited amount of people in that town, but it is normally just random talk nothing of real importance to the story.  Or you may have to talk to some people to fnd side quest maybe?  Many of the RPGfs I have tried to play lately suffered from thiscI mean who has the time to sit and play a game for hours only to be left feeling like you barely accomplished anything, cause you couldnft find the right person to move the story along?    2nd thing is the battle system, being able to press a certain button numerous times and watch that character spring in to action was always a joy.  Lets you feel more involved in battle instead of just letting you sitting and watching.  The new additions are GREAT additionscfirst the free roaming in battle.  You can move anywhere on the 3D battle screen you want within the parameters of course.  Since you are able move anywhere on the battle screen Square-Enix thought it would be a good idea to allow you to split up your party, and they were right!!  Basically you have a party of 4; but you can split them up into 2 teams.  Imagine this if you willcyou send one team to either fight a separate group of enemies or you can send one group to draw attention and use the other group to attack from behind taking the enemy by surprise and normally causing more damage.  Strategy has been added!!!   Other notable mentions: Special attacks are Stellar, Enemy Bosses are huge, and characters are very likable.  Also while in a dungeon you can still turn foes to crystal and use them to aide you in reaching different areas, but dig this!!  Now you can turn a foe to crystal then shoot that foe a second time to transport yourself to its position. Ex. You see an enemy on the ledge in front/above you but you cannot reach him or the ledge by simply jumping.  So you shoot diagonally at him freeze him shoot a second time and you are immediately transported to his position on the ledge and he is transported to your old position.  How cool is that?  Story (So Far) 4 out of 5, the story so far is great and from what I can tell takes place before the original Valkyrie Profile, I am only about 40% in to it but so far I am really drawn in to it, I cant go in to more detail for the sake of spoiling it, but it is intriguing.   Bottom Line:   If you are an RPG fan you MUST have this title in your library of games, it will not disappoint.  With the combination of the GREAT original gameplay, stellar graphics, intriguing story, and innovative new features this is one not to be missed.  Even if you are not an RPG fan I would still recommend this as a rental.   
 Madonna's protege, Me'Shell NdegeOcello's debut displaying her talents as an artist, musician, writer and producer.  She describes her music as alternative hip-hop as she tackle subjects that black and or r&b artist are afraid to talk about.  Hence the titles, "Shoot'n Up And Gett'n High" and "Step Into The Projects".  She combines jazz, soul, r&b with her diverse vocal range and her rapping/talking/flowing style, similar to Prince.  There's really no category to place this lp under, because she has a concept quite unique.  "Outside Your Door", a slow sexy pleading groove that later Brian McKnight took the piano intro on "Anytime" as the major key for a melody.  Me'Shell attacks her race's reality on "Untitled" with poetry over a live instrumental.  Plantation Lullabies is in a class of its own.  
 good book if you need one with alot of pages that wont bored you. Stephen King pwnes escpially with "Eyes Of The Dragon" its not even about a dragon really dont know why they call it that but anyways excellent book recommend it for ages 14 u 
 After spending more than ten years in the branding and naming industry, it is great to see a good book about how we do what we do. Frankel's book is funny and true to life. Don't approach it expecting to find succint lessons on how to name things but if you pay attention you'll find yourself picking up some insights into the craft along the way 
 Two friends from a French inner-city dream of getting away to the sunshine. They try various means of raising money and stowing away in caravans and coaches to half live out their dream. This is set against their relationships with their families (petty criminal brother, loving mothers etc.). Contains some genuinely amusing moments as well as the tristesse of their lives 
 I had heard this was an excellent recording--and since Gilels is one of my favorite pianists, I bought this despite already owning two other versions of Brahm's two piano concertos. When I first listened to the opening movement of the first concerto, I was surprised. I hated it! I wanted my money back. It seemed way too slow, too ponderous and at times too sleepy and quiet. Then it occurred to me that I had had the exact same reaction that greeted this work at its premiere performance. As I recall, even the conductor didn't care for it, and the work was even hissed. Brahms got over it. So did I. When I listened the second time I couldn't imagine why I didn't like it. The more I listened, the more it agreed with me. This is indeed one of the best recordings of these works. The sound is excellent and has great range. It's full of sparkling clarity--never muddy.  From the angry and intense growl of the opening drums, through the hush of profound poetry that came in gentle waves of love and truth, the range and personality of the instruments is superb.  Gilels playing is very moving. There is thoughtful subtlety and contrast here. The 2nd is full of the dramatic muscularity and passion that people have come to expect from this work. Excellent stuff. The Fantasien, capriccios and intermezzos make this 2 CD set a bargain. Buy it 
 I heard a DJ say that rock is dead -- that all the riffs have been invented and all the themes have been explored.  This disc is living proof that the DJ was wrong!  THE RAW POWER OF THE SOUL SHOWCASED IN THIS ALBUM IS STAGGERING! RUN TO BUY THIS AND GROOVE TO IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER 
 I myself and my son found this book very interesting and gave us a chance to sit, play and learn together. My son is attracted with this book, especially as all pictures are real pictures. I brought the book when he was 18 months he is 28 months now, he still spend hours with this book. I also bought with this My Big World Book and My Big Animal Book, but still this one more attractive with its variety and bright colors and lovely design. 
 Reading over a few of the reviews of this film I noticed one major difference between those who enjoyed the movie and those who, well, hated it.  Folks who read the book this film is based on generally seemed to regard this film as an atrocity.  Those people who didn't read the book (such as myself) either really enjoyed the movie or thought it was a mediocre film at best.  I happened to really enjoy the film.  It isn't the greatest fantasy flick to ever grace the silver screen but, then again, most fantasy flicks aren't out to be the greatest.  The bulk of them simply tell a generic story of a "chosen" one who sets out to fulfill their destiny or sacrifice their livelihood for the good of others.  To say that the film is cliche is cliche in and of itself.  Even those films and books considered to be some of the best fantasies involve a singular hero (Frodo Baggins, Luke Skywalker, etc.) who, with a small band of friends, faces off against terrible odds and somehow manages to succeed.  Lesser fantasy films like "Krull," "Willow," "Dragonslayer," and others all reflect the exact same story as do the great ones.   "Eragon" falls into this "lesser" fantasy category.  It's a very fun, fast-paced film that tells the story of a young boy who becomes the "last dragonrider."  He's expected to lead the war against the wicked King Galbatorix and his legion of evil.  Along the way he develops friendships with shady characters and honorable fellows.  It's a stock fantasy to say the least, but it's still fun to watch it unfold.   I agree with others that say there are plenty of underdeveloped characters.  I also see where many would say that the film is too rushed.  However, with that said, I still found this film to be palatable.  The special effects are well done.  The dragon, Sephira (voiced by Rachel Weisz), is wonderful to look at.  The actors do a fine job with what they're given to work with although some, especially John Malkovich, lack sufficient screentime to really get a grasp on them.  The music fits the fantasy setting very well.  There's nothing that's overly terrible about the movie as a whole in my opinion.  So, if you enjoy fantasy films along the same lines as "Krull" and "Willow," "Eragon" should be right up your alley.  If you've read and enjoyed the book, I'm pretty sure you won't enjoy this movie based on the opinion of others reviewing this film.  I had no problem with it and also have no problem with adding this film to my personal collection.    Highly recommended to fantasy film fans.  Not recommended to fans of the book this is based on 
 I very much appreciate Mr. Harley having written this book and in keeping it up-to-date with subsequent editions.  (I've read thru all three editions and currently own the "Third Edition".)  If you are at all interested in high-end audio, buy this book!  There is nothing else like it.    However, let me warn you:  "High-End Audio" is full of a lot of nonsense along with a lot of great advice.   True-to-form, Robert Harley's "Complete Guide to High-End Audio" contains both the good and bad of "High-End Audio".  That is, he presents a lot of great information, great advice, and he throws in a good dose of total nonsense and mis-information as well.  The problem, for many readers, will be in figuring out which of Mr. Harley's advice is valid and which of his many statements should be discarded as nonsense.    Welcome to the world of "high-end audio".   Enjoy the journey of finding out for yourself the road to audio nirvana!      
 I've been reading Registry books ever since the registry started in Win311, and, although I have painfully figured out a lot of things about it, none of the books I read helped me in doing so. This book explains organization and function of the registry in a clear, no obfuscation way. Although the registry remains a complex and sometimes contradictory beast, this book, with a little work, will make it understandable, and no longer mysterious.    Don't allow the sections aimed at IT porfessionals put you off. "XP Registry Guide" is chock-full of good tips, good advice, and over-all good information 
 I will begin with criticisms of High Crimes & Misdemeanors.  These are nagging little criticisms I make because the points I'll allude to are the sorts of things that would make me roll my eyes a little, or excuse myself for a couple of minutes for a breather if this were a conversation rather than a book.  Ms. Coulter has suffered the fate of all those who seek to insert comic relief or sarcasm into serious material.  Witticisms, sarcasm, barbed ironies, sage observations, facts, foregone conclusions, and research don't always blend perfectly to suit all the people all the time.  Some of the (perhaps a little mean-spirited) humor at the expense of liberals, I found sophomoric and/or repetitive and/or a little snide.  There, I've gone on record with that, and let me say that for me, these irritations accounted for about 12 sentences in the book.  Usually they were the kickers to a "call & response", or a wrap-up rhetorical statement or question.  I tried to bear in mind that I really didn't buy this book for the comedy.  As for the rest of the book, I cannot give more stellar praise.  Without apology, I can say this was, at the time, the only book of its kind I had ever read. In the past month or so, I've since read other Coulter books.  To distinguish myself from several reviewers, I have read the entire book. The bibliography, references and annotations are impressive. I didn't have or take the time to trace down every one of them.  Owing largely to and in addition, I seem to remember someone else taking issue with Ann Coulter's fact-checking and accuracy, and coming away with a figuratively bloodied nose for his trouble. If (as a liberal) you'll allow that the quotes and documentation check out, I'll allow (as a conservative) that there is *always* the opportunity for contextual disagreement or for more thorough research into any given blurb or quote.  To qualify this review, I am mostly conservative, I believe in the United States, I believe in my fellow Americans, and I believe that morals, right vs. wrong and a high standard of ethics can and should be applied to, indeed expected of our political leaders (as well as business leaders, religious leaders, teachers, law enforcement, lawyers, judges, etc., etc.).  The things I don't believe in are persecution of human beings based on sexuality, race, religion, creed, or politics.  I also don't believe liberals are stupid.  I believe select people are stupid independent of political affiliation, but that is a different and longer story...  All this to say, if you feel you should discount OR hearken to my review based on who I am, you now know some of the basics about the person with whom you are already mentally primed to agree or disagree. (Yes, I know I should've just ended that sentence with a preposition...it bothered me)  If, in your mind, I'm still a NeoCon fanatic, hopped up on Reagan Kool-Aid, fine.  I will still do my best to honestly evaluate this book.  The facts and citations Ms. Coulter used to build her case seem airtight. The logic she used, witticisms and criticisms aside, made sense to me. I am astounded at what I've learned. The spin machine she described is leaps and bounds beyond anything I imagined after having seen the movie "Wag the Dog". As a person who tries to whittle things down to the essentials, and then move on, I really can understand how inundation with conflicting stories, viewpoints and assertions basically paralyzes the American voter/citizen. It's no wonder President Clinton wasn't removed from office. By the time the matter was put to a vote, the issues truly at hand had been obfuscated and misrepresented so fully, (most of the nation -in my remembrance- was convinced that the whole thing was about Monica) that no one person seemed to have a credible grasp on the truth.  To clarify, it wasn't about Monica. It *was* about sex, but not that wholesome, middle-America sex, so hale and beautiful.  Notably, not the kind of sex that is correctly omitted from polite conversation because it is a personal and virtuous expression between partners (rather than acquaintances).  Quite likely, though most don't know why, we all feel a little dirty, perhaps a little ashamed for having endured the whole messy affair. Sex scandals (plural) in the White House were definitely something this country could have done without.  Though I wish it hadn't happened, I'm glad I've found out more details about this episode in U.S. history.  The book is nothing if not annotated details, quotations, recorded testimony, and in truth, a highly cogent and damning lambasting of our former President.  You will be indignant, you will be enlightened, and you will puzzle at how these quotes and tidbits escaped your attention during the media frenzy.  If you're willing to admit that there is a surpassingly effective spin machine somewhere between Maryland and Virginia, you will feel justified in your suspicions that more went on than we were told.   Moreover, this book is interesting in that the sex scandals were like a Part Two of Four in the book. I found the pre-Presidency and late-second-term material more interesting, more telling, and foremost more genuinely horrifying.  Truth be known, President Clinton could have adultered, and thus shamed his wife and child, and ultimately the office of President and all who salute it until the cows came home, and he would only have met with mild disapproval from me.  JFK was notorious for just that and more.  FDR had a mistress.  Poor Gary Hart ... I digress.  Public figures have been imperfect, (if not deeply flawed) corrupt, philandering, disingenuous, cloying and base since politics began.  I did read between the lines of the book that, as time passed, the Clintons were getting better at and bolder with their many and sundry misbehaviors. The stakes went up, their skill increased. I was further surprised to find out much evidence indicates Mrs. Clinton was a lynchpin in the whole criminal enterprise (several of them, in fact).  Note that Mrs. Clinton is not just a lawyer, but has been hailed as a brilliant lawyer.  The erstwhile Senator from New York may well be a fairly accomplished criminal as well. Though I can't call these arguments against the Clintons surprising, I am profoundly dismayed at the apparent snow-job (couldn't resist) perpetrated against the American public. Before you vote for Hillary in '08, you should read this book. If you vote for her afterwards, fine. We can agree to disagree ... BUT, if you got your news from CNN during this tumultuous time, do please read High Crimes and Misdemeanors first. I am pliable to suggestions for books or articles that offer a plausible defense against the accusations in this book (that is to say, I am not inviting rabid, Bush-hating emails, etc ... I could be more pleased with Bush too). If the work cites facts and verifiable evidence, not opinion and invective, I will read it thankfully.  Meanwhile, you should read this, see if you agree, try to debunk that which you doubt, and prove to yourself that you're a reasonable, thoughtful and truly impartial seeker of truth.  I surmise you will be stunned, as I was 
 ...and these likely lads were brimming with it.  Before the polished pop of "Perfect Way," Green and Co. made pretty-perfect noise.  These early Scritti songs are thick with playful smarts, and they can make a fan out of nearly anyone.  Newborn singles like "Skanc Bloc Bologna" and the aforementioned "Confidence" will needle into your brain/heart and never give up residency.  Arch, experimental and still totally welcoming.    
 For a person interested in American Indian Medicine People, this Book, and it's companion book - Fools Crow, ISBN 0-8032-8174-9, will read a Treasure of insight, clarity, simplicity & wonder.  This reviewer has been reading books on this subject for more than 40 years, and these 2 books are the true Treasures of this world view.  Fools Crow is a magnificant 
 Innovation and Entrepreneurship is a good resource for categorizing and identifying sources of innovation. Drucker does an excellent job of organizing the key elements involved in innovation and there is a fair amount of real world examples that help the reader understand the concepts. However, most books on this topic usually leave me asking for more concrete examples of the execution of the topics laid out here, and this book is no exception. Innovation and Entrepreneurship is more about creating a framework for innovation that can be used to compartmentalize current practices and shed light on their origins. Drucker accurately points out that the least likely sources of innovation are from new knowledge and bright ideas. The insight into this alone, makes the book well worth reading. If you are looking for a way to categorize and identify the most effective sources of innovation in an effort to budget the research efforts in you corporation, I highly recommend this book. If you are an entrepreneur looking for new sources, you might me better off looking elsewhere, such as Clayton Christensen's The Innovator's Dilemma 
 You'll use it your whole life, finding a date in time when a multitude of discoveries and events occurred, linking them to something personal that happened to you or a friend on that day. Timetables of History will put it all in perspective for you. I highly recommend it as a key reference for your library 
 It arrived in a timely manner and in great shape.  It played just fine and I enjoyed every minute of the story 
 The second film of the animal trilogy (Bird With The Crystal Plumage(1970), Cat O' Nine Tails(1971) and Four Flies on Grey Velvet(1972)] from legendary director Dario Argento brings us a mystery about Franco Arno a blind puzzle maker who overhears a strange conversation between two men sitting in a parked car in front of a medical institute. That same night someone breaks into the institute and attacks a guard. Franco decides to investigate with newspaper reporter Carlo Giordoni.   While Dario Argento himself didn't care much for this film, fans of his seem to enjoy it. While it doesn't rank up there with his best films there are flashes of brilliance like the black gloved hands of the killer. As with any Argento film, the cinematography is fantastic.  Anchor Bay has a good reputation when it comes to picture quality and this no exception. A fantastic 2.25:1 anamorphic transfer which makes the film look sharper and brighter than it has been for years. Also the copy I own is unrated even though Anchor Bay lists this one as PG. I've never seen the PG version and therefore don't know the difference between the two.   Anchor Bay, where's the DVD for "Four Flies on Grey Velvet" 
 McGrath is one of the most well-published architectural photographers of recent memory, and this book does a great job of highlighting his work in a variety of situations. Unfortunately, this book tends at times to become  more of McGrath's portfolio and less a guide to the art and technique of  architectural photography. Worth getting just to look at the photos, but  also get either Gerry Kopelow's or Michael Harris's books for another  perspective 
 I think the book is beautifully done and captures the essence of why so many people love golf and connect with the game! The authors did a wonderful job of sharing reasons why so many of us keep coming back for more. I think the reasons contained within are wonderful and well-balanced, and have already given the book to many other golfing friends -- beginners and low handicappers -- who agree. The photographs are stunning and very well done; we love displaying it on our coffee table. Thank you 
 How do you get a group of people to adopt new strategies of coping with change?  This story provides food for thought.  I recommend you read it along with Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self.  When we use Optimal Thinking, we take the most constructive actions and achieve what is supremely important 
 This is reasonably hard going, as all Yates books are, but it really a great read. Complex and deep. Something to open your eyes to a older (and forgotten) world 
 My daughter loves this along with the first one that was published.  Hours of fun 
 First of all I think it is very important to remember this series is fictional, although based on scriptural truths.   The writing is not the most outstanding, but it is an action series in a lot of ways.  I do not know how anyone who starts at the beginning of it all can walk away from this story.  It's compelling; I think the characters are realistic.  You find your self hating some and cheering for others it is a clear line between good and evil.  It is a fun series lighten up and enjoy it for what it is.  Good Clean Fiction.   
 Ben Forta has compiled an enormous amount of information on ColdFusion and put it into an easy to use format.  One can go through the book in order to be walked through a complete web site construction, or use the chapter guide to find specific information to meet your needs.  One side note; the book comes with a companion CD.  Make sure that you get this also as it contains the last 4 chapters of the book.

 This 3 CD compilation brings hard-to-find dance singles to one collection. Most of the songs are in full 12" extended version. This CD has many artists who were made popular in the 80's. Their music is still heard in clubs but have not been made available for many years until now. If you enjoy the Italo Disco sound of the 80's, this CD has Ken Laszlo, Reeds, Gazebo, Paul Sharada, Gary Low, and many more from Italy. Canada's "LIME" is featured with one of the best dance songs from 1983. "Angel Eyes" put Canada on the map for producing great dance music. One of the best singles on the CD is, "I Got the Feeling" by Two Tons O' Fun (later known as Weather Girls).  Any dance music fan will be happy with this collection since most of the songs have not appeared on most of the other compilation CD's that have been released in recent years 
 I was sort of peeved that I didn't read this book sooner, definately could have helped me avoid so many relational disasters.  Some parts of the book were painful but oh so necessary to read.  It helped me make real changes in my thinking and behavior and gave me a terrific insight into what to look for in those I date.    I read and RE-read so much of this book, it's pages are dog-eared.  You won't regret buying this one.  It helped me greatly.  I'm now happily married and my husband and I both read this book prior to finding each other.  Needless to say, we had much to talk about when we did finally meet and this book was at the center of it.  
 I have absolutely no doubts whatsoever that Charles Dickens, if he lived today, would still classify as an author's author. He's a master of all the things that make for great writing and storytelling. Dickens has an ear for dialogue most authors would kill their own mothers to possess. He also is a master of creating vivid scenery, another sign of excellence essential to great writing and one which many authors lack. Finally, but not least in importance, Dickens knows character development. He REALLY knows how to develop intriguing characters, to the point where many of his books spawned figures that have become literary archetypes. Not bad for a guy who grew up in extremely adverse circumstances. He even spent some time in a factory sticking labels on bottles after his father's imprisonment for debt. Most people wouldn't recover from such poverty, but Dickens did. He went on to a successful career in journalism before settling down as an author of serial novels. This format, which allowed Dickens to write and release his stories piecemeal, made him a great success with the public. The anticipation for the latest chapter or two of his stories often led to near riots. Not many writers can duplicate this feat today.  "The Pickwick Papers" is one of Dickens's earliest works, written when the author was a mere twenty-four years old. You wouldn't know his age by reading the story, though. "Pickwick" is a work that delivers healthy doses of sophisticated humor, keen observations on pressing social issues, romance, and a mature knowledge of human behavior. It's of course fiction, although Dickens presents the story as a true series of events documented by the "Pickwick Club," a social organization founded by retired businessman and all around merry fellow Samuel Pickwick. In the 1820s, Pickwick and several friends embark on a series of journeys through Southern England, a journey that lasts for roughly two years. Ostensibly, the businessman and his fellows take the trips to learn more about their country. Instead, their travels turn into a series of often hilarious events mixed with a few serious scrapes. Pickwick must constantly save individuals from the machinations of one Alfred Jingle, an itinerant scalawag with a penchant for wooing women for their money. In between these adventures, our hero must contend with a lawsuit filed by a former female employee who thought he wanted to marry her, save his friends from numerous imbroglios involving members of the opposite sex, survive a stay in a debtor's prison, and live through a couple hundred other adventures both major and minor.  If I had to list one overarching theme I enjoyed most about "The Pickwick Papers," it's got to be the humor. This book is one of the funniest things I've read in ages. We're talking laugh out loud and laughing later when remembering scenes from the book funny. Much of the humor centers on Pickwick's manservant Sam Weller, a guy prone to uttering some of the most hilarious sayings you'll likely see in any book. Weller's father is even more amusing, and when father and son sit down to write a letter to a lovely young woman who's caught Sam's eye, well, prepare to hold your sides. Also worth a belly laugh or two is the chapter where Pickwick and his friends visit the town of Eatanswill in time to witness the results of a contentious local election. Dickens's observations about party politics and media manipulation are not only highly amusing, but also relevant to our own age. And who can forget the courtroom scenes where the lawyer makes Pickwick, this kindly old gentleman who wouldn't hurt a fly, look like an absolute monster? I could go on and on. If you read this book without cracking up, check your pulse because you're probably dead.  Another element of the book I enjoyed concerns Dickens's ability to write scenes that simply overflow with the joy of living. A lengthy chapter describing Pickwick's stay with some country friends over Christmas serves as an excellent example. The sheer bliss of this part of the book is infectious, as Dickens makes us marvel at the simple delight of spending a few days in the company of good friends, good food, and good entertainment. On the other hand, the author isn't above indulging in an activity he's become famous for, namely showing the reader the depths of human suffering. There is far less misery in "The Pickwick Papers" than there is in "Oliver Twist," to cite one example, but it's still here. The debtor's prison in which Pickwick stays for a time provides the author with a perfect forum for attacking England's tradition of imprisoning those unfortunate souls who cannot pay their creditors. I marvel at how Dickens can balance these two extremes in the space of a single novel. In this way, "The Pickwick Papers" manages to encompass life in both its good and bad aspects.  I read the Penguin Classics edition of "The Pickwick Papers," and I'm glad I did. The supplementary material is copious and helpful more often than not. I didn't care much for the introduction from Robert L. Patten, however, which I thought tried to read too much into the story. I did appreciate the footnotes that help explain the English geography, slang, and popular culture references found throughout the story. Further material provides information on the three illustrators who worked on the story, biographical details of Dickens's life, and even maps tracing Pickwick's myriad travels through the English countryside. Reading "The Pickwick Papers" makes me realize that I've neglected this author's works for far too long. I can't praise this book enough; it's that entertaining and that good. Give it a go as soon as possible! 
 This Bible is perfect for busy moms who may sometimes find themselves overwhelmed with the stresses and responsibilities of motherhood.  Each devotional is a direct reminder that we should strive to apply Scripture to  all that we do and face, not only as Christian mothers, but as women,  daughters, and friends.  The translation, NIV, is simple to understand for  those moms who may be new to reading and applying Scripture 
 Mr. Sennewald continues to provide excellent commentary on becoming an effective security manager.  This book should be helpful to those beginning a career in security management.  It provides thoughtful insight into the many issues a new manager faces.  For those already working in security management, the book provides a concise guide to what works.  The chapter on computers is one of the few places where a more complete discussion would be welcome, as it is too simplistic 
 I am currently going through problems that I believe are related to my Endo.  I had a complete hysterectomy and am still suffering. This sourcebook has helped me feel that I am not alone and has given me the information I need to show my Family doctor what I think is going on. A hysterectomy is NOT a cure for Endo. If you have Endo or know someone who does BUY this book now...do not hesitate.  You will find validation, support, understanding and information that will help you in coping with this disabling disease.  Lesli 
 I LOVED this book!  I can't even remember why I bought it (I have a 3-year-old daughter...a little too much for her), but for some reason I started reading it after it had been sitting on my nightstand for a while, and I couldn't put it down.  The characters were amazing...very quirky and spunky.  To the reviewer who said that the cover art was boring and uninviting...I couldn't disagree more. I think it is charming 
 Given the high octane, big-money state of womens' tennis today, this book is a quaint look back at how things used to be in the 70s and 80s when tennis was more popular, but still much less sophisticated, than today's game. The writing is high quality. The author spoke with Evert and Navratilova at length, including many of Martina's ex's, but not Jimmy Connors, Evert's most famous flame. While their rivalry makes great history, watching it unfold was not the drama this book would like to recall it as. Most matches were boringly lopsided, especially when Evert was dominating the early years. Women's tennis today is much more a game of equals where anything can happen. When Chrissie and Martina ruled, the only question was what time was their final because they were usually in it. Still, the book pays homage to a nostalgic era, and recounts with great drama the slow build of a female rivalry and friendship for the sports ages 
 Citizen explores just what freedom really is as it follows a young man, Thorby, as he matures from boy to man. Starting as a slave sold to a most unusual beggar, Baslim, we see the first aspect that many equate with the absolute opposite of freedom, though we see that in fact 'slaves' sometimes have more freedom of choice than 'free men'. The society he paints here is vivid and believable (though the economics of slavery in a star-travelling culture has always seemed a little dubious to me). Baslim is far more than he appears to be, and puts Thorby through a rigorous education, both academic and practical. How do you become a really good beggar? Here Heinlein falls in with Ayn Rand - whatever you do, do it to the best of your ability, from begging to juggling. Also there are several comments included here about the integrity of the self - lies to others and misleading yourself both come in for some dictums. These are items that may pass over young readers' heads, but perhaps planting seeds that all assumptions should be examined, nothing should be accepted on 'faith', that personal integrity is more important than 'success', that consequences of actions should be examined carefully before committing to that action.   Later, Baslim calls in some favors and sends Thorby to live with the Free Traders, a group of space merchants that keep to themselves with their own unique culture. Here Thorby discovers another aspect of freedom: a person's ability to do as he wishes is severely constrained by the culture in which he lives. The Free Trader society (which owes much to Margaret Mead's seminal ideas, and highlighted by an anthropologist character named Margaret Mader - Heinlein was not usually so obvious with his names) of rigid matriarchal domination and separation into moieties provides security, peace of mind, and the ability through rigid rules of formalism to allow a small group of people to live together for extended periods without breaking any heads, but has as its downside great limitations on freedom of choice. This section of the book may be the best part, as the society is so different from today's American culture that it becomes fascinating in its own right, apart from its effects on Thorby. Thorby himself grows and changes significantly in this part of the book, from first love to determining just how he must balance the demands of duty and personal desires.    The last section deals with Thorby back on Earth, within a society not much different from our own, and shows a third aspect of freedom: the internal courageousness to make your own decisions and act upon them. Freedom is just as constrained by internal timidity and/or defining decisions as by external forces. As this last section offers little in terms of new or different views of society (though it is a good mirror of some of the flaws of a capitalistic/lawyer dominated one), it isn't as engrossing as the first two sections, but is highly important in terms of completing Heinlein's thematic investigation of all aspects of freedom.  Characterization other than Thorby and Baslim is pretty thin, especially for the females that appear in supporting roles. This was fairly typical for his juveniles, as they were basically strong adventure novels with their primary focus on their central character. But the thematic line on slavery/freedom is much stronger here than most of his messages in other books, and as this particular position is also stated in some of those other works (most especially Farnham's Freehold), has to be seen as one of Heinlein's personal beliefs (unlike some other positions he proposes in his books that seem mainly designed to stir up debate).    This book is not Heinlein's absolute best, nor even the best of his so-called 'juveniles' (which are typically better reading than most 'adult' mainstream bestsellers), but still provides an engrossing, fun, and illuminating read. Recommended for all readers willing to look at life styles different from their own.  --- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat) 
 This is the story of a crime in the last century in a rural part of Louisiana.  But it is also much more.  It includes a fine series of chapters explaining the history of the Acadian people (Begnaud was an  Acadian in a whistle stop) and of all the major players and of Louisiana  history.  In a short set of chapters the author gives us both the history  and the interest.  By the end I was sorry to see it finish - but I learned  a lot about both the "crime of the century" and also the context  of the events.  It was hard to put down - even when I came to the end.   Arceneaux did a thorough history but also took care to make it a  fascinating book 
 Personally, the cd was a little too over hyped.  I've heard much better dnb before.  It's a good album with a bunch of solid songs on it, but there are a few that take away from the album 
 Hibbert's "Days of the French Revolution" provides an outstanding introduction to the turbulent and violent decade of the French Revolution.  All the major players, major events and significant decisions are recounted in a riveting writing style that keeps a good pace so as not to be too dry or boring..  While it lacks the depth and detail of other books on the subject, it is my first recommendation to those interested in the event 
 This is a great story.  There is plenty of sporting drama, but what makes the book great is the insight into the obsession with a high school football team in a place that didn't offer much else to its people.  You will end up really caring about them, in spite of their questionable traits.  At the same time, the author does not gloss over the negative aspects of life in Odessa.  He writes this story to examine the culture, not just to chronicle the events of a football season.  Bissinger does a great job of portraying both the positives and the negatives of the obsession with high school football.  He gives real insight into these people, and is sensitive to the effects of their choices on various members of the community.  The sad state of race relations, and the effect of the obsession with winning on the coaches, the players, and their families are major points.    The saddest part of the story is life after football for high school boys; most of them are has-beens at 18.  It must be tough to peak that early in life, to go from having 20,000 people living vicariously through you to wondering what to do next at 18 years old.  You can see that Bissinger truly cares about these people, especially the kids.  Not exactly an uplifting story, but that's what sets this book apart.  Highly recommended. 
 I read the first edition of this book.  John did a great job on that book.  The second edition is even better.  The second edition has tons of code.  This book is easy to read.  You need to be an experienced developer to work with J2ME.  I would recommand this book to anyone who wants to learn J2ME.  This book is a smart investment 
 The book is absolutely marvelous.  It is a reminder of the songs that I learned as a child that still are a tradition in the African-American Church.  It is wonderful to know that I have an additional resource for  preaching and teaching.  I have chosen to share this with many members of  our congregation.  There are so many more songs that could have been used,  but Ms. Warren seems to have picked the absolute best.  God's richest  blessings to you!! 
 My only complaint about this book is that I read it too late! Linda Sawyer, Medford Orego 
 Who's guess that Deepak could hit a hole-n-one on Golf... A+ listen as an Audion CD or download. This is excellent book to kill time on a long drive or to listen to in the background as you work on the computer.   Amazing how Deepak can tie improving your golf game to the challenge of improving your life. I highly recommend but then I haven't found anything from Deepak Chopra that I don't find of excellent value.  Try it, you'll not be disappointed... especially the audio version 
 There is a series of speeches entitled "Character Above All" some of which are very good and some not so good (depending on the speaker.)  This speech was a springboard for the book (if I am not mistaken.)  So, in my opinion, if you get the "Character Above All" tape by Noonan on Reagan and if you like that then you will most definately like the book.  I loved the book and the tape 
 This album is really cool because every single song is catchy. Unfortunately it is probably also their poppiest cd as well, which is unfortunate because if they had the same melodies with faster paced music... this album would be amazing. Some of the songs, although catchy, are kind of boring and sound a lot alike the rest on the cd. The best songs are Responsibility, My Life Story, Buildings Tumble, Two Whole Years, Is The Answer In The Question?, Unsaid, Misplaced Memories & The Next Big Thing. If you like their newer stuff you will also like this 
 Great book.  What I like about George Will's thinking, well in abundance here, is less about his resulting point, but how he arrives at each point.  He is a philosopher, not a pundit.  His sense of history is stunning.  His reasoning is fantastic (almost enjoyable) and, unlike many pundits, he exposes that journey through reason in his writings.  I find him to be the journalist equivient to Justice Scalia: you may not like his opinion, but I dare anyone to engage in a reasonable argument against him on the merits.  In this set of writings, I also find comparisons to William Bennett.  Void of any mean spirit, he has no fear in "passing judgement" where it is clearly needed.  Well done, Mr. Will 
 So I bought the regular length Canterbury socks, and they were too short, so ended up falling down all the time.  I figured that I'd get these, and they'd be a regular dress-sock length and go to just above the curve of the calf.  But, um, no.  The tops of the socks actually come right up to my knee, stopping just shy of bunching up at the joint.  On the one hand, no force on this earth could make these socks sag, which is good; on the other hand, they're a minor pain to get on.  I actually had to get hosiery advice from my wife (roll the top down, put your foot into the bottom part, and then unroll the sock up your leg), which is disturbing.  More disturbing is feeling like I should be donning a tunic and heading off to a Ren Faire.  But if you can get past the oddness, well, you're sure as heck not going to have baggy socks 
 Lots of programs and workouts to fit every occasion.  I have to admit have not really seen other DVDs such as this that are catered specifically to the athlete.  There are challenging workouts and slower versions to fit your taste.  Defintely had no complaints 
 The book depicts a man who towered over the people and events of his time. President Roosevelt was the youngest person to ever occupy the White House at age 42. He was a naturalist, author, rancher, soldier and politician.   The work provides a picture and the reception at the White House on 1-1-1907. The national wealth grew by over $5B/year over the two-term presidency of Roosevelt.  The former president had an irrational love for battle according to the author. He was a flawless diplomat. As presidencies go, the Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt was relatively tranquil. He appointed the first Jewish member of a Presidential Cabinet in the character of Oscar Solomon Strauss. The new president commenced a grand restoration of the White House.   While in the White House, President Theodore Roosevelt received historians, zoologists, inventors, linguists, explorers, actors and journalists until the early hours of the morning. As a teen, Teddy kept a copious diary. At age 13, he lifted weights and had private tutors. At 15 years old, he travelled to Britain, North Africa and the Middle East.   Ted Senior was a wealthy patron who had an elaborate townhouse in Midtown Manhattan. Pictures depict Teddy in 1877 as a Harvard Freshman. He became an Albany Assemblyman during January of 1882. He was described as a perfect nuisance who grew to become the Albany Assembly Speaker on January 1, 1883. The remainder of the work depicts the life and times of Teddy Roosevelt leading to his election as President and many honors during the course of his lifetime.  This book would be a worthy acquisition for historians everywhere 
 For the starting cadaver dog handler this book is a must. I recommend it to all my students. It does an excellent job of detailing the scent imprinting training, establishing a readable alert and the advancement of training. Not only does it cover the handling and training of the dog but discusses in depth the handlers responsibilities and information useful to any agency wishing to deploy the cadaver dog. Excellent information in a basic readable form. Not much experience in scent work needed prior to implementing these techniques. A wealth of information 
 There's no doubt about it: hurricanes are big. They're bad. And they really pack a wallop.  But now there's a way for parents and educators to reduce them to child-size. It's Yesterday We Had A Hurricane, a delightful pictorial exploration that looks at these storms from a child's perspective, answering questions about hurricanes and explaining them in terms that young children can readily understand.  Educators will also love the companion learning and activity booklet entitled The Smart Kid's Guide To Hurricanes   which includes interesting facts about these monstrous storms, tips on how kids can prepare and fun games and coloring pages. 
 Although the narrative is a bit uneven, this book provides a lot of details on the Beatles' disintegration from a legal and business perspective.  It was, after all, a legal and business breakup rather than an artistic hiatus.   The analysis and insights are very good because the book was written nearly contemporaneously with the breakup.  As such, the authors spoke with most of the main players: Allen Klein, John Lennon, John Eastman, Lee Eastman, Neil Aspinal, Derek Taylor, Clive Epstein, investment bankers, etc.  They also poured over the court documents from Paul's lawsuit.  The analysis is helped by the fact that one of the author's was pursuing an MBA and had a good undestanding of the contested stock deals involved with Northern Songs, NEMS, etc. Hopefully someone will republish this important little book.  If you want to understand the Beatles and their breakup, you really have no choice, get this book 
 This is a fine pocket radio for people who need something small and don't want to suffer the interference from using an AC adapter. The Mini300 takes 2 double-A batteries. The FM/AM reception are above average in sensitivity. However, radio newbies will go crazy with the drift, the radio's inability to lock into the desired station. You're better off spending 10 more dollars and getting the Sangean DT 180, which runs on only one small battery, is digital, and doesn't drift.   If you want something for standing alone by your office or bedroom, I suggest you buy the best radio currently available, the Kaito KA2100 
 This history book covers primarily the Islamic Arabian empire, in the period from around 600 AD (the advent of Islam) to around 1500 AD when the last remnants of the empire fell.  A few chapters at the beginning and the end address the pre-Islamic Arabs, and also the post empire period through about 1950.  I'm pretty sure Professor Hitti is an Arab and a Moslem (though I don't have confirmation), and his perspective is enlightening, though occasionally he comes across as a bit "rah rah".  I recommend this book as a good introduction to someone (like me) who doesn't know much about the rise of Islam and the subsequent empire.  The book is pretty short so it is something of a summary, but Hitti has a longer work titled "History of the Arabs" which you could move on to 
 The great thing about the Learn to Salsa Dance DVDs is that they're consistent. The instructors, the close ups, the teaching style, all of it helps you as a student to focus on the dances being taught. Another great thing about volume 2 is that the DVD stands on its own. By that I mean that you don't have to have done the first DVD in the series to be successful with this one (though from some of the other comments posted it seems as though it does help) so they're great for anyone who's looking to start learning Salsa but is too proud to start from ground zero.

 This collection is terrific, both from an artistic standpoint but also from a reality standpoint.  Many people, myself included, have no idea what war was or is like.  This collection brings to light just how difficult these times were and the sacrfices all these brave young men (and women) gave.  It also paints a very realistic picture of what Europe was like during the timeframe and the atrocities that happened there.  
 Someone please pick up this book!  I've already mentioned it to two of my English professor who knew almost nothing about what I consider a true classic.  Just because there is no movie to accompany it does not mean it  should'nt be read for fear of confusing a public accustomed to Dickens'  supposed "classics".  Please take the time to open one of my  favorite books.  I am sure it will surprise and delight you.  Remember, a  "classic" is what we make of it 
 Great story, reads very well.  Very hard to put down.  It's also a very different concept from most books i've read.  
 This is the second volume in what I hope is a long series of "England's Thousand Best..." and it does not disapoint.  It is basically a listing of the thousand houses, all open to the public (though some more accessible than others), that Mr. Jenkins believes to be "the best" in England.  With each listing is a brief description, including an explanation of why Mr. Jenkins put the house on his list.  These alone are worth reading, even if you cannot travel to each house, as some of the reasons might surprise you: they range from famous personages associated with the houses to interesting architectural details to important historical events.  If you are looking for a book that offers historical analysis about country houses or the wealthy, this is not it.  It is, however, a very interesting travelogue that is essential to anyone who wishes to tour around England and would like to scratch deeper than the usual "Blenheim, Chatsworth, Knole" trifecta.  It is also fun for anyone interested in trivia on the subject of architecture or English history, as it is full of anecdotes and facts that one does not usually hear 
 There may be more recent books focused on wine or beer, but this is the  most comprehensive guide to alcoholic beverages in general.  Tired of  listening to a couple of colleagues discussing a subject that I knew  nothing about, I read this fascinating book, and soon turned the tables:  until I showed them evidence, they simply would not believe that Amaretto  was made made from apricot pits rather than almonds!  Many other products,  like Spanish sherry, have interesting details and histories that I had  never suspected.  About the organization, roughly one-third is devoted to  wines (a chapter per country), one-third to other alcoholic beverages, and  one-third to technical advice and appendices on menu-planning, storage,  vintages, etc.  A highly enjoyable and informative book, very nicely  balanced 
 There is hardly a better book I have ever read.  I recommend it for everyone.  Scholarly yet easy to read.  Excellent!  I plan to give it to university professors and work friends alike 
 Plenty is one of my all-time favourite films. I loved this movie.  I understand why many people did not like it, but I think they should have another look. Sure, it is not an easy movie to watch, and Meryl Streep's character is not the most pleasant woman in the world, but that is part of the point. "Plenty" is unabashedly unsentimental, and that is one of its greatest strengths.  Meryl Streep gives one of her best performances, and it's not only because of her flawless British accent. That is just the surface of Ms. Streep's complete, and absolutely brilliant transformation into a very complicated character. She is also sexier than she has ever been on screen up to that time. She looks simply beautiful!!  This film is about as performance-oriented as films get, and it is full of great performances -the entire cast is excellent!!  "Plenty" is a movie about how different life can turn out from the way we plan it. It is not supposed to be cheerful. It is gritty, gripping, and extremely powerful. It portrays the hardships of Resistance era France, and the harsh realities of Britain immediately after the Second World War; as well as the decadence that prosperity can bring, and the disappointments of life, and how the inability to deal with them can destroy a person's sanity.  Of particular note are Charles Dance, as Streep's husband, Sam Neil as her lover, Sting and Tracey Ullman in small but important supporting roles, and especially Sir John Gielgud, who effortlessly steals the few scenes he is in. In one of the movie's few comic moments, Mr. Gielgud corrects the wife of a Burmese diplomat just as he is leaving a dinner party on the nationality of a certain European film director. Just this scene makes the movie worth watching!  I have seen this movie described as an underrated tour-de-force. That is an extremely fitting description. I would add the word classic to that description. This is a film that challenges the viewer to sit through its grim depictions of what life can be like if we don't know how to deal with life not turning out like we want it to. Depicting different eras from the Second World War to the early to mid sixties, "Plenty" is a period piece with painstaking recreations and some incredible locations in England, France and Jordan.  If someone has not seen this movie, I urge them to buy it or rent it and watch it. For a long time, this film was not available in widescreen on home video. Now there is at least one widescreen DVD which restores the film to its stunning beauty and allows us to enjoy its excellent cinematography. To anyone who appreciates great acting, this film is a MUST SEE. No serious film collector should be without this great classic.  If someone has seen it but did not like it, I urge them to watch it again, and again.  I have seen this film at least 50 times, and I could easily watch it 50 times more 
 An excellent account of history, politics, and personalities todo with Pakistan, this book provides indepth analysis of the state of Pakistan as we have it now.   Being a Pakistani professional working overseas and a byproduct of the same society which Mr Cohen concentrates in this book, I read this book thoroughly, keenly and critically. Relating every thing with my life experience in the environment where I grew up, I can sense the depth of knowledge of the author who tells us about the political history of Pakistan.   Somewhat I disagree with the author about the exagerated threat of Islamic fundamentalism in the initial few chapters however in his last few chapters he admits this and put forward some sensible policy guidelines and suggestions for the US foreign policy. Considering the recent developments I can already see the US policy makers taking a serious note of the findings, and taking a few steps towards the right direction e.g. offering F-16 to both India and Pakistan, facilitating Kashmir dialoue, providing aid to restructure Pakistani educational system, and expressing desire to see Pakistan a democratic country.  The problems which are described in this book have been pointed out and discussed in Pakistani press before, however in the absence of real democracy and people power they can't make a difference.   This is a must read book if you are a Pakistani or Indian and love to see your countries as progressive and modern countries.  My congratulations to Mr Cohen on this excellent effort. 
 First of all, all of the people that downed this album, are off the track!!  David is a very talented singer, I had the cassette & it broke & I finally found the cd......  breathe in breathe out should never have been sung by chris cagle, it is DAVIDS song!!!!!!!  Come back David I miss you....I miss your talent... 
 From using only two cordless controllers; this one and the XBox 360's controller, I like this one a LOT more. It's comfortable, small enough to not be too big, and just the right weight as to not be too light. I couldn't ask for a better controller- unless Logitech made the wired controller with the leather handles into a wireless one, then I'd find myself that much more pleased :) Buy this one, there isn't a better wireless controller out there 
 This movie simply put is a religious meditation on the Passion of our most Precious Lord. This book will bring you to a deeper understanding of the movie, so it is a very valuable resource. It is a wonderful investment & at a fair price 
 I came across this cd by accident and what a great surprise!  I usually take a chance and order a "recommended cd" from any number of sources and am rarely very impressed.  This cd is one I listen to a bunch.  Whenever I have it on and friends are over, they always ask me who I am listening to.  I show them the cd, but it isn't one I would copy for them.  I think this is one artist who breaks the mold and I hope people support her by buying her music.  In a time when it seems hard to find something unique worth listening to, this cd delivers.  Hopefully record companies will continue to let her make her music her way, because we don't need any more mainstream "sound alikes."  Can't wait for a new cd 
 I was worried about the quality of this product considering the low price.  I am very happy with the quality. I didn't select this model because magnets will stick, but it turns out to be a handy feature.  I am delighted with this whiteboard 
 I have to admit that I'm a huge U2 fan, and a huge Bono fan.  So my thoughts on this book may be a bit biased.  But on that note, I figure that I-like so many other U2 fans who've read this book-have a greater ability to give criticism.  I've read numerous U2 books on varying subjects, so I guess I was expecting nothing more than a carbon copy, for the most part, of those books.  This was not a carbon copy!  I echo other reviewers who said they loved the conversational style of the book.  It makes me wish more people would do something like this rather than just beefed-up, ghost written memoirs that hardly reveal anything.  But Assayas does a great job at keeping Bono (one who has a tendency to deviate and ramble) on subject.  Bono himself explains how he's a very forward-looking person and doesn't like to revisit the past.  Assayas spends a good portion of the book having Bono look back. Bono himself is a great man.  Yes, he's a rock-star, which is probably why he's so appealing.  He can keep his dignity (and sometimes throw it away) in a world where that's the last thing on most people's minds.  He really cares about the Africa stuff he's always talking about.  It becomes quite obvious after reading this book that his concern for the third world is not just shtick.  It's real. This book got me craving something that I expect will never come to pass: books like this from the other members of U2.  The other three are a bit more closed and reserved than Bono, the incessant front man. I suggest this read to anyone, U2 fan or not. 
   The combination of the full Giles translation of Sun Tzu's famous treatise with a simple direct translation makes this edition really special.  This particular edition has my highest recommendation.  It fills several needs by providing the Chinese Text with a direct English translation together with the fully commented translation.  After you have read the full version with all of the comments and notes, you can really appreciate the rational simplicity of Sun Tzu's thirteen chapters.  Without the background that the full translation provides, most of what Sun Tzu has to say can be easily misinterpreted and applied to all manner of activities.  Having access immediate access to Giles' comments and notes, without having to be burdened by it when you just want to concentrate on what Sun Tzu had to say, makes this particular edition worth every penny.  
 I didn't read the whole book. I just went to web site acne.org and followed the program. Acne is now gone. I suffered from Acne for over 20 years and tried many treatment programs from Accutane, Retin-A, Microdermabrasion and a few others. Dan Kern's treatment program was the first treatment program that actually work for me in the long run.  The cheapest and fastest way I know how to check out the program is to order 1 tube of the 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide (from Dan's Web Site) and try it for 1 week following Dan's instructions. Yes, if you goto the web site, Dan also wants you to get a Cleanser and a Moisturizer. All products are needed but I believe the key product is 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel from his web site Acne.org.  I strongly believe if you have Ance, using the 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel with Dan's instruction, you will have a 95% chance of seeing improvement in less than a week 
 Ah, the Magic Mountain.   It deals with the issues.  The passage of time, the management of people, the different sort of people you might meet from day to day.  Some of the passages go on theese philosophical reveries, which are really great.  These issues are so huge, and they have so many potential connections to things, past and present, that I can scarcely get my mind around some of them.    Invariably, reading this, I'd lose patience and have to pick up something lighter, like statistical abstracts 
 This book lets you learn 28 vowel-spellings using 60 vocabulary words 
 it is one of these books that either you get or you don't if you do get it, you're in for a special journey give it a try you won't be sorr 
 I used this book as a supplemental text in a course I recently taught in a graduate art therapy program. I appreciated its contribution related to adding much needed information to using art therapy interventions with families.  I would recommend it as an introductory text based on one professional's experience with family art therapy that includes many good and creative ways of working with individuals within the family system 
 My grandson is 26 months old and is already singing and loves to listen to music. I bought him this to play with in hopes he will play for real later on. It is a lovely little piano and you will not be disappointed 
 It is a great product, very easy to operate, great size, accepts all my flash card formats. But the resolution could be better and the plastic in the back (ok, no one will look at the back of a picture frame) looks cheap.  Compared with other products I know, I still think it's a great one 
 The book was funny and very interesting.  There were a lot of funny parts; like the mice thought letters were things like: B was a bee, C was the word "see", Hyacinth even gave her mousekins funny names like Laburnum, Larkspur and Lavender.  Our favortie character was Buck because he was handsome and very interesting.  One of the funniest characters we read about was Robin because he made one too many mistakes and he isn't too bright either.  We really liked the book and if you want to know more just read "The School Mouse" 
 It wasn't easy to follow up to "Dark Side of The Moon", one of the most celebrated albums of the 70's or "Wish You Were Here", but Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason. proved with "Animals" that they were capable of recording another masterpiece, but without following the same concept as before. "Animals" is much darker and melancholy then there other albums, it's partly based on George Orwell's political fable Animal Farm and the diffrent songs "Pigs" "Dogs" and Sheeps" are metaphors for diffrent kinds of humans and the capitalist society they live in. It isn't that Waters see the human race as animals, but the whole idea of the concept album is to get a chance to look into this dark and bitter world view. There are only 5 songs included on this album, you may ask yourself, why on earth would it be any use to purchase an album with so few songs when you can get some other with 15 for the same price. "Animals" is not like other albums, it's a journey into another world and all of the 5 songs are part of a concept. They are full of sound effects, guitar solo's and nihilistic lyrics, but it's not very accesable since they lack hooks and melodies, although they show a Pink Floyd in top form making something magical and genuine. "Animals" has become somewhat a cult album, always loved by fans but despised by critics and non-accesable by casual listeners. First song is called "Pigs On The Wing" it's split into 2 parts, the opener and closer of the album. They are both accoustic slow paced songs that only last for 1.25 each, but listen closely to the lyrics, cause they are the keys to the whole concept. "Dogs" which is 17 minutes portraits the selfish business men that destroy their own lifes and people around them with their obsession for their own ego's, careers, and greed. On this song both Waters and Gilmour share lyrics, Waters sing in the beginning and Gilmour the last few verses. There are also some awesome guitar solo's by Gilmour on this one and one synth solo from Rick Wright's (where you also get to hear Dogs Barking), and as a whole I Think this is the best song of the album, especially if you like sound effects, long solo's and Progressive rock in general. "Pigs (Three Different Ones)" portraits the people on top of the ladder, the people with wealth and power. Those people manipulates and make encourage the rest of the society to be competitive in order to remain at the top. This song starts with slow turbid lyrics but continues with some awesome blues-guitar solo just like it's precursor. "Sheep" is the last category. The sheep represent the lowest class of the social system. They are oblivious and exploited and somewhat unaware of what's going around in the society but they are obidient follows that do little to prevent that. The song itself starts slow but shortly get's loud, with synhesizer effects and guitar riffs. The 3 main songs are all over 10 minute each and rather simuar.   Overall, This album takes time to enjoy. If You're a fan of Pink Floyd you may like it cause the sound is just awesome and so are the guitar solo's. But it's far from a sing-a-long album with good hooks or melodies, it rather put it's focus on the sound and on the lyrics, but that is on purpuse. If You are new to Pink Floyd and liked albums like "Dark Side of the Moon" and "Wish You Were Here" or occasional songs from those, don't get this album cause it will be too complicated to get into and it's far from accesable. However, if you're an openminded person with wide mucical range and you have the patience to listen through it several times, it could be an challence. A classic album nonetheless

 As a teenager, I first became interested in the martial arts by watching James West ply his trade in this series.  Although his defensive and offensive moves now look phony and ineffective, 42 years ago they completely captured my attention and imagination.  Initially, I tried my hands and feet at a number of martial arts styles before settling on John McSweeney's version of Kenpo Karate.  (John was one of Ed Parker's first black belts.)  I was the head instructor at his school, Self-Defense Unlimited, in Elmhurst, Illinois, for over 20 years, eventually earning a 7th degree black belt.    As editor of the American Kenpo Karate Association newsletter, I wrote many articles on the martial arts, as well as two books that are sold on Amazon.  And, of course, I learned the value of working out every day and pushing my body to its limits--and beyond.  The bottom line is that Wild Wild West truly had a profound influence on my life.  And as this DVD set shows, it was also one of the most entertaining programs to ever hit the tube 
 He discusses 9 different regions of America, with a map showing the boundaries. He calls them New England, The Foundry, Dixie, The Islands (of Caribbean/Florida), MexAmerica, Breadbasket (midwest), Ecotopia (west coast), Empty Quarter, and Quebec. He shows how each has its own distinctive culture and economic climate. Published in 1981, but still rather a good read 
 Closer to human speed than I recall on their eponymous 1999 CD, but still it generates a sense of bent bluegrass played by Cossacks on methamphetamine.  Minor chords and ancient shadows have hooks in their souls, and they play like demons striving for the light.  Remember to look for the strange attractor that offers an archetypal inner sstructure for the whirling, wild sparks of music.  Focus of the calm center and let the whirling particles around it just fly right by.  Live performance brings hints of Negresses Vertes.  Stand-out:  tr 13-Bride in a red dress (one instrument hands off to another, rotating a formidable pulse of power) 
 I loved this book and could not put it down. The story is interesting and the writing is wonderful. His characters are rich and complex. I'm going to tell everyone I know about  this book. Such pleasure must be shared. Highly recommended. Order one now! Operators are standing by 
 A good read if you understand Virginia Woolf writing style. I found it introspective and thought provoking to get into the heads of the characters as Ms Woolf is way ahead of her time for using psychological and personality issues to convy thoughts and ideas of her characters. The book is one of her shortest so it gives the reader the chance to enjoy her style without commiting to a 600+ page book. She is not for everyone, but I am one of her following. 
 I have been a fan of Amanda Elyot (Leslie Carroll's historical fiction nom de plume) since she (as Leslie) released Temporary Insanity and Play Dates (soon to be a motion picture).  In "By A Lady", where her heroine time travels between 21st century New York City and Bath, England around 1800, she combines her zesty urban sensibility with her background in the classics.  Obviously intelligent and well-schooled,  Amanda Elyot takes us on a fantastic tour of the English class system at the dawn of the 19th Century, hosted by C.J. Welles, a Jane Austen loving contemporary actress caught between two worlds.   The author's deep understanding of human character transcends time, giving the reader her usual uncanny insights into the universal topics of love and class.  One almost gets the feeling Amanda Elyot time travelled herself, as the pull of the two worlds is felt so keenly throughout the book.  A fabulous read and fun peek at English aristocracy, "By A Lady" is sure to appeal to fans of both historical and contemporary fiction 
 The Galactic Campaign Guide is a tool for gamemasters.  Among the things provided here, are a hundred adventure ideas, descriptions, maps and adventure ideas of dozens common locations such as cantinas and so forth, descriptions of several environmental items, such as computer ports and escape pods, planet generators, and GM character generators.  The list goes on.  This book comes in really handy when you need to whip up a quick adventure, location, or character.  It takes some of the backbreaking work out of planning a campaign.  Also, I would recommend this for beginning gamemasters.  The advice here will really help beginners get into the swing of things.  However, if you're an experienced gamemaster, the advice section will probably be common knowledge for you, so you'd only be able to use this for the locations and generators.  The downside of this book is the art.  A lot of the artwork is done in a cartoony style in which the Star Wars world is mixed with the modern world.  You end up with ridiculous art like a Star Wars alien wearing a T-shirt, jeans, and sneakers.  They could have done a much better job with the art.  If you're a beginning gamemaster, be sure to pick this up.  If you're an experienced gamemaster, you could probably skip this one 
 Things aren't going well for Rainie Quincy; a pending adoption has been terminated due to her past alcohol abuse, her investigation into the brutal murder of a mother and daughter continually haunts her, and the foster child she is advocating is obstinate and doesn't trust her. Her ensuing depression leads to alcohol abuse and a prescription with serious side effects, followed by her husband Pierce Quincy leaving her. When Rainie disappears, Sergeant Detective Carlton Kincaid suspects she may be a potential suicide, but Pierce, a former FBI profiler, believes otherwise. His theory is validated when a ransom letter is delivered to the local newspaper. Quincy calls in his daughter FBI agent Kimberly Quincy and her fiancé Mac McCormack, detective with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Aware that kidnap victims are rarely returned alive, the three begin a frantic race to find Rainie while butting heads with local authorities.   Meanwhile Rainie is doing her best to stay alive, but the side effects from the antidepressant she was taking are rendering her body uncooperative. When the kidnapper snatches the boy she had been working with, Rainie's desperate to save both of them, but the kidnapper always seems one step ahead of her.  Gone is a captivating thriller that moves quickly with gut-wrenching suspense and nonstop action. Rainie is an intrepid character the reader will empathize with and want to succeed. This is one good read with interesting, complex characters the author explores in-depth and a plot that never lags. 
 This story is set in Venice a few years after World War II, the main character is (former) US Army colonel Robert Cantwell.  Col. Cantwell is a veteran of the European campaign and commanded an infantry regiment during the war, and is now dying of a heart condition.  This story is the tale of his last few days.  There are two main threads to this story.  First, Col. Cantwell reflects on his life as a soldier, what he has seen, what he has done, and his regrets.  He is somewhat angry and embittered, but is trying hard to put these emotions behind him.  Second, this is a love story as Col. Cantwell has fallen in love with a young Venetian girl.  He is experiencing true love probably for the first time in his life.  He was married once previously, although that relationship ended poorly.  This is an introspective tale, and there is very little `action' in this story (I would say virtually none).  It is really a character study of a man who has seen more than most men should, who is undergoing a great transformation through the love of the young woman Renata, but who ultimately realizes that he and his relationship are doomed by his age and failing health.  I loved this story and thought it was one of the top novels written by EH, although judging from some of the other reviews, there are clearly many that felt otherwise.  This is not, generally, considered to be one of EH's best works.  This book is also an homage to Venice (I would love to have the means to lounge around the city as Cantwell and Renata do in this novel!), and it is a vehicle for EH to comment on the European War and some of the principal actors.  I found this to be a wonderfully engaging tale, better than some of the nominal EH classics.  EH has wonderfully captured the emotions and regrets of Col. Cantwell.  My enthusiastic opinion is not uniformly shared, however, and this book should be approached with caution.  I think the reason that this novel is not generally loved is that there is virtually no `action'.  This is an introspective story from start to finish.  If you are new to EH and looking to read your first novel, you should not start here 
 This shaker won Cook's Illustrated test of martini shakers late in 2005, just before the Christmas season. Branded as a Target shaker, it was out of stock before you could click "buy."  I finally figured out it was the Metrokane Bullet and ordered it asap.  It *does* live up to the hype, on one factor alone.  It doesn't drip or spill when pouring.  Yes, it's stainless steel, it's elegant (if not a little too phallic for some,) it's large enough to mix two *good sized* martinis, and...so what?  Each of the other 5 cocktail shakers I've owned had these things going for them (but with more traditional tapered profiles.)  But they all leaked when I removed the top/jigger measure from the body of the shaker.  The Metrokane is one of the few shakers that has the lid fit inside the neck of the main shaker, so that it is easily removed to pour without any liquid loss or mess.  All parts are well made and fit, but are easily detached for cleaning or refilling. So long as the shape doesn't bother you, this is the best martini shaker no doubt.  Cheers 
 Baker-Jordan covers a plethora of topics that are all important to teaching, ranging from the business aspects to the practical teaching aspects.  Most useful is her information on being a "planning" teacher and examples she provides using major piano curricula.  The book also contains many useful forms and worksheets -- most in .doc format on the accompanying CDROM.   Although she encourages readers to seek beyond the text about learning styles, I am a bit concerned that she hasn't employed nor discussed more learning styles that cover some other issues regarding how students best learn.  Also the chapter on technical tips was lacking, covering only tips for early students and also giving vague details about how to these techniques work and function.  The section would be very helpful if it were boosted and given more attention.  These shortcomings are minor, however, and do not detract from the usefulness of the text 
 I thought this book was very easy to read and understand.  I must commend the author for making technical material so easy to understand even for a novice like myself.  Everything I wanted to know about information security was in this book.  I highly recommend it 
 This book was a real lifesaver when we recently had our first "grown-up" party.  Almost all the appetizers I made came either from this book or Hugh Carpenter's "Hot Appetizers" (another winner).  People kept asking who the caterer was (ME!) and are still talking about how wonderful the food was!  (and I'm not even a very experienced cook) Besides the great pictures, I think the most helpful feature in the book is that each recipe is accompanied by "plan ahead" notes that tell you which parts of the recipe can be made days, weeks, or even months before the actual party.  Very helpful when trying to coordinate a successful event.  When we decided to have another party, this was the first book I reached for - it is indispensible 
 Its rare that a study like this one is both entertaining and informative, but Mr. Lopez's book is precisely that.  We are led through the ages peering at the strenuous relations of humanity and wolf-kind, from primal man's envy of this accomplished, loyal hunter, through his hateful denial of their ties, and finally to its present day nebulous dual attitude of reconciliation and euthanasia.  It can best be summed up in the chapters referring to the attitudes of the ancient Greeks -especially the Arcadians, who first emulated the wolf, then hated and feared him as a sheepkiller, and then looked on him with pity and sadness and guilt.  I also found the descriptions of wolves in Norse literature indicative of the strange envy/hatred/fear man seems to hold for this creature. Meanwhile the wolf lopes on through all of this, steadfast and unchanging - wanting no part in man's world, content with its own.  There is much to be learned from wolves, and this book goes a long way in teaching it.  In the closing chapters everything ties together in a manner that it is pretty amazing and eye-opening, even going so far as to point to the inherent relationship between a cosmic disaster and the decline of wolves.  Maybe that came of sounding crackpot, but I'm not the author - read him for yourself.  Its a great buy, and will stay with you for a long time to come 
 I have a keen interest in North American Football and overtime I have picked up some terms and tactics, but as I am not North American I lack allot of detail knowledge on the game. So I wanted a guide to American Football that would give me not only the fundamentals but more detailed information. Howie's Football for Dummies has a comprehesive coverage of topics, and in addition, the book has historical/evolution snippets and first hand player insights. So I have found this book a great reference for a fan that originates from a different football background. 
 It really is nice to have an external card (on the SP-320) that holds almost 600 pictures instead of the internal card which held less than 50.  In addition, with the USB Olympus Reader/Writer, one doesn't have to change batteries so often. 
 I bought this CD because it was geared toward children,  but it had the beautiful acapella harmonies of Ladysimith Black Mombazo, which I enjoy.  I found the stories to be enchanting, and my 2.5-year-old loves to sing and clap along to the songs.  This is a wonderful CD to have in your own library as a break from nursery rhymes and traditional children's songs.  It also makes an excellent gift for friends and family 
 Maybe the best and more solid terror films of the last 20 years, period 
 What a wonderful continuation of the Fraser saga!  This is a must have for the Outlander fans! Don't miss it 
 Road To Satisfaction  	A Season On The Brink shows the struggles of a great college basketball coach, Bobby Knight, to not have a losing season. The intensity of Bobby Knight can sometimes cause problems and hurt feelings. Knight tries to keep his poise during the 1986 season and clean up a little bit. The way things are going for a while really doesn't help him control his anger. Coming off from coaching possibly the best Olympic team, Knight expects nothing but the best for his Indiana Hoosiers. 	The book can be repetitive at points while John Feinstein the author is explaining non-exciting games play by play; but the close games can get you caught up in the action. You can be thrilled at one minute and then picture yourself in the locker room during one of Bobby Knight's intense speeches after the game. Feinstein did a great job with the details of the whole season and that is why A Season On The Brink is a best seller.  ---Sean Weakley 
 This is the 5th edition of DJ Smith's excellent book on reliability in the real world. Having worked in this field for a number of years, I can honestly say that Mr. Smith has provided a perfect  means of understanding  the principles behind basic reliability calculations, in a way that is  neither condescending nor unneccesarily complex. I recommend this book in  the strongest possible terms to readers interested in gaining a greater  understanding of the world of reliability engineering without having to  trawl through pages of postgraduate mathematics 
 I have always enjoyed all of Oscar Wilde's works, but this is not very good compared with the others, but none the less  still worth reading. The characters were sort of dull, but the plot intresting which made up for it. I'd reccomend this to fans of Oscar Wilde, but if you have just discovered Wilde, skip this and start with either, "The picture of dorian gray" or "the importance of being Earnest" 
 A Geography of Time, by Robert Levine, discusses time as few may have previously considered it in their daily pursuits.  Through personal experience, via a sabbatical, Levine offers keen insights into the rhythms of life as experienced by peoples and places the world over.  Offering "tempo" and what he calls "clock time" and "event time," as points of departure in an analysis of his and his colleagues observations, Levine successfully illustrates how not only "personality types" impact a region, but also how the region impacts the personality as well, thus revealing the symbiotic relationship between the person or persons and place or places respectively.  By traversing not only the globe, but the subject of time as well, Levine has allowed readers to come closer to understanding their world and those of others with whom they come in contact.  Of his main points, Levine successfully argues that we are oriented to clock-time, event-time, or "multitemporality," i.e., psychological androgyny.  [Of this in between time and state of mind, Levine shows that we are better served in such a space than that of being exclusively in one or the other of either clock or event time; especially as it relates to our social, physical and psychological well being.]    Two chapters considered interesting by this reviewer are chapters one and ten.  Due to the foundation established in chapter one regarding "tempo," and the last wherein Levine offers practical solutions to balance our activities and potentially lead healthier and happier lives, A Geography of Time, is not only a delightful read, it is also enormously illuminating.  By providing an approachable perspective for consideration, as it relates to human activity and interaction, i.e., tempo, coupled with personal and collegial anecdotes, Levine has broached the subject of the relativity of time and pace with considerable depth and admirable precision.  In chapter one, "Tempo: The Speed of Life," Levine shows how humans, despite best efforts of social constructionists, still "march to the beat of different drummers."  Borrowing from the field of music, the element of tempo, Levine notices, along with colleagues who have both traveled and lived in other countries, that not only do people have different rhythms in locales the world over, but that there seem to be distinguishable characteristics of and between the places as well.  In asking the question, "what characteristics of places and cultures make them faster or slower?" Levine posits two elements for consideration: "economic well-being" and "degree of industrialization."  With these elements in mind, Levine, in later chapters, develops some rather interesting and amusing ways to determine not only people's level of helpfulness in a specific locale, but also the pace of locales observed.  In chapter ten, "Minding your time, Timing your Mind," Levine successfully answers the "so what?" question.  By illustrating that there are significant and avoidable consequences to certain tempos, he offers practical suggestions for a new way of not only interacting with members from different locales, but also for simply living.  In coupling "lessons" learned in chapter nine, with ideas regarding middle-time in chapter ten, readers will come away from Levin's work with a clearer understanding not only themselves as "paced" individuals, but also how pace affects others in their midst.  With this newfound knowledge, if put into practice, readers are sure to be in a better mental space for having been so informed.  As with any work, it has both its high and low points.  With Levine's A Geography of Time, there are a few that deserve mention.  However, for the sake of space and time, I will relegate my comments to chapters with the most "lows."  That being said, chapters three and seven: "A Brief History of Clock Time," and "Health, Wealth, happiness, and Charity" respectively deserve my attention in this regard.  In chapter three, Levine discusses the "history of clock time," but omits some important elements for consideration.  Having presented good historical information regarding the emergence of both watches and time zones in America, with the latter having ties to the railroad industry, it would have been illuminating to understand more about the socialization process of convincing the mass of people to accept this new way of thinking about the day.  Another missed opportunity is found in the lack of in-depth discussion surrounding the carving up of the day into units of time, i.e., the twenty-four hour period and the sixty-minute hour.  Perhaps a discussion of this element of the social construction of time would have lent more meat to a good beginning to the question of time and its social meaning.  Additionally, given his discussions of "time zones," it would have been equally revealing to read of the need for the creation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), as it relates to globalization and economics.  Not to mention the politics surrounding the choice of Greenwich as the focal point around which time has been socially constructed.  Given that the Giza Plateau in Egypt is the geographical center of the pre-plate tectonic shifting of the earth's land mass; which for logical reasons seems a truer fit for the center of a "time-line," perhaps a discussion of some of the then discussions surrounding this event and its consequences, both pro and con, would have been a more just treatment of not only time in America, but around the globe as well; all of which serve as social tethers to and for time, clocks, watches, and socialization alike.  In chapter seven, while discussing "health, wealth, happiness, and charity," Levine merely makes allusion to that intangible something that gives a place its certain "feeling."  In omitting this element of the place, Levine opts not to reveal the evident, but intangible components of a respective locale.  Beyond stating, "our data strongly support the notion that cities, too, can be Type A" (as in personality).  Perhaps it is in his "silence" on this subject that one may find some substance for consideration.  For him with eyes and ears, this element is quite revealing.  Overall, Levine's work is compelling in that it reveals elements of our daily lives that provide clues as to how we have come to be that which we are: either a clock-time or event-time person, or some "androgynous" realization of the best of both worlds.  In presenting this work, Levine has allowed for a clearer understanding of not only other locales around the world, their paces and people, but also those closer to home as well.  In so doing, he has given the traveler and non-traveler alike, an opportunity to broaden their perspective on different cultures and potentially foster an even greater understanding of new peoples and societies with their time and pace peculiarities.  Should the ideas be both understood and employed by readers, a level of respect will not only emerge for different cultures, but a more profound understanding of one's own culture as well; for this and many other reasons Levine's work should be praised 
 I bought this DVD because I remembered enjoying it during my days as a student in England. Time has not withered Blackadder! Since it isn't 'topical', it's as funny now as it ever was.   There are only 6 episodes on this disc, plus a few extras, but I think it is worth the price. I have watched several of the episodes over and over again. The quality of the writing is good, but I think the strength of it is that the actors are amazingly well chosen. I can't think of a single living comedian who could deliver some of these deliciously dry lines, (usually weakly disguised insults), as well as Rowan Atkinson. Lord Percy is hilariously effete, Baldrick is a lovable dim-witted servant, Queen Elizabeth is a squealing, spoilt schoolgirl, and Stephen Fry is a great foil for Blackadder.  Buy this! You won't regret it. Anyone who appreciates well crafted comedy would enjoy this, particularly if they have an interest in history too 
 The scarf I received was absolutely what was ordered.  My husband, a great Liverpool fan, was thrilled!  Thank you 
 The plot is a bit worn thin, but Peters keeps up the interest with a good  set of engaging characters and her marvelous use of language. Still a  worthwhile investment 
 I gave this as a gift to a friend who is a huge fan. I've never seen a 29 year old so happy as he made the whoosh noise as Starscream flew around in jet form. Great quality, durable, and fun to play with 
 This book, although not excellent, is very good.  One of the first things you notice is how cleanly laid out it is and how the examples are clearly written in plain English.  The graphs and tables in this book are not only  intuitive for the non-chem. background students but are also very  attractive to the eye.  This was a good book and I did learn quite a large  amount of information from it 
 With a great pleasure I read about  "live and times" of Emmy Noether. It was unknown to me, she and her theorem connecting symmetry and conservation law in physics created foundation for gauge invariance theory. And how important this gauge invariance theory is! It governs all forces in nature, except gravity. Second unknown, yet hugely far-reaching woman was Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin: she laid the foundation of stellar astrophysics fusing astronomy and the world of atoms in her brilliant 1925 PhD thesis "Stellar Atmospheres: A Contribution to the Observational Study of High Temperature in the Reversing Layers of Stars".  Like almost any popular cosmology books, this one contains two sections beautifully wrapped up in a symmetry concept: "global" section about large-time and large distance (classical and relativity physics) and "local" section (short distance, timeless high-energy particle physics). I have read many books of this type; still, authors managed to deliver and teach me many new unexpected and surprising facts about modern physics. Like just for example: famous equation E=mc^2 is not exactly correct (take photon under consideration), or: nature is in love with complex numbers and reads them with passion (quantum wave value is: a+bi; and take this: "noncommutativity is an astonishing fact about ordinary rotations - and therefore about nature itself". Fascinating!  Truly full of innovations were times of Noether (she also worked on abstract algebra) and other great mathematicians: Hilbert, Klein, Minkowski and Godel. Here, I clearly got a concept of Godel's radical theorem of incompleteness that crushed Hilbert's view of mathematics! Never I have learned so much about the nature of the symmetry, remarkable gauge symmetries and its fields like in this volume (maybe Victor Stenger's "Timeless Reality" is close but not exactly). Reader who pays attention to details will find a few print mistakes: Figure 29 shows "the second order of quantum corrections" (not "the first" as it is printed), and Coulomb's law equations (page 248 and 249) are printed as only inverse low force (though text correctly explains inverse-square relation). Grab this book, no matter how many others you studied in the past. No regrets, I promise! And wait until LHC will start to operate. Importance of these future experiments is greatly emphasized by the authors. Emmy Noether waits too, at the same table with Hilbert and Einstein! 
 This is the best reference handbook that parents and teachers will fine it useful for students. Algebra to Go, "demystifies algebra for students in 8 grades and up by explaining key and often complex math topics in a way that's clear, friendly, and understandable". It is also a great refresher for parents who may have forgotten a thing or two about Algebra. 
 Some of Loves best material is on here. I take one star for the short tracklist and excessive ending track of 19 minute 
 Michael Haag has taken on a challenge few historians would accept: he has recreated a solid history of a city shrouded in mystery since its inception or formation by Alexander the Great.  And while much is known about Alexandria through novels and movies and war ruminations and social epithets and other sources that border on mythology, this amazingly fascinating city has undergone so many changes since Alexander's time, each new set of inhabitants has destroyed the remnants of the previous owners, leaving us with only isolated antiquities and memories as passed on by word of mouth and fleeting letters.  The occupations by the Greeks, the Romans, the Arabs, the Egyptians, the Italians and the Jews have smoldered in a cauldron of secrecy until the present.  Haag takes us by the hand and the head and accompanies us on this myriad excursion of exploration of ALEXANDRIA: CITY OF MEMORY by wisely emphasizing the writings of three of our greatest artists - Constantine Cavafy, Lawrence Durrell (of the famous 'Alexandria Quartet') and E.M. Forster (best known for his novels including 'Howard's End').  It is primarily through the eyes of these exciting writers that Haag has gathered information from their own novels and poems, interviews, letters, and articles about these famous inhabitants of Alexandria who from before World War I through World War II documented the romance of the city as well as the intense social and political life that nurtured the cosmopolitan importance of this amazing place.  Haag is at his best when he is relying on the writings  from these three men, documents which reveal the wide range of sexuality so compatible with the city (Cavafy and Forster are each discussed extensively regarding their same sex lifestyles and confidantes, and Durrell is outlined by the several wives and mistresses he had).  Weaving these men's lives and influences through the changing governments and attitudes of the city and its populace makes for fascinating reading.  When Haag ventures into the lives of the purely political and commercial giants of the city through the years, the writing becomes less interesting, though equally informative.  In the end, while there are many pages of information that merely begin to slow the reader's concentration and interest, ALEXANDRIA: CITY OF MEMORY is a superb book of history and biography of a place that has heretofore eluded scholars. An additional positive aspect is Haag's use of many photographs of the city from all eras.  Recommended for the patient but inquisitive reader. Grady Harp, September 05  
 Good release and all the songs are good,I recommend this with  Bed time for democracy,Fresh fruit..., Plastic surgery disasters,Get them all 
 Stephen Crane does a superb job of displaying the qualities of Naturalism in this story.  He focuses on the lower classes, deals with an amoral set  of ideas/decisions, displays a blatant attack on false values, a reformest  agenda, imagery that is either animalistic or mechanistic, and a plot of  decline that often leads to catastrophe through a deterministic sequence of  causes and effects.  Crane attacks both the romantic idealism and the moral  posturing of the church in this novel.  The animalistic imagery, displayed  in the Darwinian landscape of Rum Alley, is significant, for it reinforces  the work's naturalistic orientation: humans are viewed as extensions of the  animal kingdom engaged in a Darwinian struggle for survival.  This novel  assails the hypocricy of the priest who offers condemnation instead of  compassion, who claims to help people, yet turns a deaf ear to their pleas  for help, and whose moral posturing encourages others to do the same.   BRAVO! Crane....If you would like to discuss this novel in greater  detail, email me 
 An extraordinary book!  This is a compilation of papers by various authors who have given this subject extensive thought.  Many of the authors are practitioners.  As a student of economic development, culture, and the history of technological progress I was captivated by this book.  It is thought provoking and insightful.  The best book I've read this year 
 Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940, by David E. Kyvig, traces the developments in American culture and lifestyle during this critical period. Using US Census Data, Kyvig calls attention to the demographic changes that occurred over these dynamic twenty years, one of the strong points of this book. Among the technological developments discussed are the automobile, electricity, radio and movies. There are two chapters devoted to the day-to-day aspects of life during that time covering such topics as food, fashion, hygiene, courtship, etc. Kyvig also discusses the impact of the Great Depression, the New Deal and the expanded role of government during that era.      As a former history teacher, this book reminds me strongly of an expanded version of the typical US History chapter covering this time period. It isn't terribly deep, but does provide a solid overview. It is well-written, easy to read, and is a good starting point for people interested in the time period (or for students who need help for a research paper). Those of us who want more detailed information will need to look elsewhere.    
 It doesn't surprise me that "The Phantom" failed at the box office.  It lacked the star power of other films of that time, relied on the name recognition of a hero who isn't as flashy as Batman, Spiderman, or a multitude of other characters, and, honestly, it wasn't summer blockbuster material.  Perhaps if it came out in the dead of winter when most studios toss out their artsy flicks hoping for Oscar recognition, it would have done better.  With that said, I have to admit that "The Phantom" is a wonderful flick to watch.  Granted, it doesn't have flying heroes or webslingers, but it does have a wonderful story to it in the classic vein of those old 1930's cliffhangers.  Billy Zane is game as Kit Walker/Phantom.  He has that classic Hollywood look to him that makes him perfect for the role.  Kristy Swanson (the original Buffy) does a wonderful job as Diane Palmer, the damsel in not-so-much-distress.  Catherine Zeta Jones, James Remar, and the underrated Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa head up a stellar supporting cast.  The real "treat" here, however, is Treat Williams as Xander Drax, the evil mastermind behind all of the Phantom's problems in this film.  He's completely over the top, delivering smug lines like, "Show me the power!" with enough cinematic flair that you can't help but love his devilish character.  The story involves the search for three skulls:  one of bronze, one of jade, and one of gold, that will give their owner ultimate power.  Drax, being the power-hungry man that he is, is on the hunt for these three skulls.  The only things in his way are the Sang Brotherhood, who are responsible for creating the Phantom many centuries ago, and the Phantom himself.  The tale bounces from the lush jungles of Africa (but actually Australia and the backlots of California) to the mean streets of 1930's New York City, and then to the dreaded Devil's Vortex.  It's full of swashbuckling, gunplay, high adventure, and a few explosions.    The cinematography is brilliant, capturing the beauty of the Australian locations it was filmed on.  The blues and greens fill the TV screen wonderfully, and the vibrant purple of Phantom's suit supplies a wonderful contrast to the deep greens and browns of the jungles.  Overall, there isn't too much that's offensive in this flick for youngsters.  The language does get a little bit strong for the younger lot, but if you let your kids watch recent the recent PG-13 hero flicks, I'm sure they can handle this one.  There is quite a bit of violence, including a couple of impalings, but all of it is done in a way that is no worse than most other superhero films.  I highly recommend this flick to fans of films like "The Shadow" and "The Rocketeer," as well as most other superhero flicks.  It might take awhile to get beyond the VERY purple outfit that our hero wears in this flick, but it's all played out with great intentions and a nod to the classic cliffhangers from long ago 
 When Chaz Perrone throws his wife Joey overboard during their anniversary cruise, he thought he had it all figured out.  Hot looks and great legs not-with-standing, Joey was positioned to ruin it all.  But as Dr. Chaz Perrone's luck would have it, Joey doesn't even have the courtesy to die...instead, the formerly expert swimmer manages to keep her head above water, literally, thanks to a floating bale of marijuana and a hot ex-cop named Mick Stranahan.  When Joey comes to on Mick's deserted island, her eyes are swollen shut, she aches all over, but mostly she is furious.  At herself, for marrying a toad like Chaz...and at Chaz, for having the audacity to toss her from a luxury cruiseliner.  Whatever did she do to deserve such treatment?  Joey is determined to find out..... What follows is a deliciously wild romp through the swampy waterways of South Florida...where Joey is determined to get revenge on Chaz, Mick would like to get Joey, and Chaz is determined to emerge unscathed and rich as hell, doctorate credentials intact.  But Chaz's other head tends to land him in trouble, and when he falls from favor with his rich benefactor and his women on the side, he finds himself on the run....complete with a CroMagnon babysitter.  A glorious story of karma....readers everywhere will sigh with satisfaction at the ending.   DY 
 I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend. He thought it would improve my guitar playing. What I noticed almost immediately, within the excercizes is actually a methodolgy for dealing with attention deficit disorder! I have had ADD since before there was a diagnosis for it and the methods in this book are not only helping me with music but are also having a profound affect on other areas of my life. I don't think it was the author's intent to help in this regard, but this "inner game" method has far reaching implications....Thank you!!!.. 
 this is a great PHP book for beginner since the codes is very clear and its easy to read. besides, there has  explanation of the codes so that I know what is going on. However, when I have questions, the author will help me through the E-mail, She helps me alot and I can work better for the PHP. Really thanks for her help 
 For anyone who needs to know anything about grand prix racing, this book tells it all. The great English and Italian bikes, the coming of the Japanese and so on, it's all here. Fantastic photos and priceless words. Worth every penny 
 Gabriel Mesta is a pseudonym of Kevin J. Anderson, used so as to distinguish this book from his heavier DUNE and SEVEN SUNS novels.  But although this is lighter fare, it's also incredibly inventive, and such a clever core idea that it's a wonder that it took a century for anyone to think of it:  imagine if all of H.G. Wells's great novels -- including THE INVISIBLE MAN, THE WAR OF THE WORLD, FIRST MEN IN THE MOON, and THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU -- were all set in one universe, so that before invading Earth, the Martians first went after the Selenites, and so that the sinister Dr. Moreau is the surgeon on hand trying to save a Martian from a crashlanded cylinder, while Wells and his mentor, Darwin's bulldog himself -- T.H. Huxley -- race to Mars in Cavor's sphere.  Ingenious, compulsively readable, and just tons of great fun.  Five stars 
 We know what the matrix is, altogether, since qe have seen the first episode. We know that machines have taken over the world and have decided to control all human life. Humans are slaves serving machines. Nothing very new. In this second episode we enter the final phase of this machine-controlled world : the eradication of human life, and first of all of Zion, the city that is a concentrated vision of human and urban life. The human race is trying to get organized to resist this final apocalypse, but human beings cannot much without machines and their machines are not that good when compared with the machines of the other realm. Yet some human beings, a small team of them are following a prophecy and have the capacity to navigate mentally but in a pseudophysical state from their back world into Zion and the human world. When they thus navigate between layers of material life they leave their heavy and hard bodies behind and enter new bodies that have tremendous powers. It is these powers they need to defeat meachines. This second episode of the saga is interesting because it enables us to meet with the mathematician who has constructed the whole matrix. First he is human and no explanation will be given about how he can survive in the realm of machines, and how he can expand his life into some timeless eternity. Second he announces that he programed everything, including the prophecy that is then a lie, and that Zion and its destruction is necessary to keep the balance of this matrix and that the final destruction that is announced will be the sixth destruction. We note that there is no explanation about this number six, about why and how Zion can survive every destruction. The most surprising is of course the number six, the number of Solomon that has nothing to do with the end of the world. Yet Zion leads us to the bible and the main prophecy we can think of  is the Book of Revelation. But then the number of this apocalypse is not six but seven. In other words we are not in any kind of a meaningful allusion to the bible. The film is only using these allusions to create an atmosphere of secrecy, of spirituality that helps making the film a lot less pure action. It gives some inspiration to what would otherwise be nothing but brutal movement. Third this film transforms battles, fights and action into some kind of 3-dimensional ballets that can be very pretty at times. These ballets can be set in any place whatsoever : in an open square, in the hall of a Renaissance mansion, or on the roof of a truck on a highway. The general impression is that one or two heroes are fighting against a neverending and constantly reinforced army of cloned individuals than can become hundreds in one instant and multiply to thousands in less than ten seconds. Just the time it takes to open a door and to bring them out. And yet these ballets have some beauty even if it is a little bit repetitive hence slightly long. But what can the meaning of this film be ? We will probably come to the final meaning in the third episode. But here we do have a very negative vision of a mechanized world in which human beings are becoming completely dispossessed of their life and of their future. The human race is also tremendously reduced in vision and even the will to really fight for their survival seems to have been tremendously reduced. The future of the world, when it is menaced with utter destruction, lies in the hands of half a dozen people at the most. That does not make a crowd, does it ? Then there emerges from the film a tremendous sense of fatality. Is there any hope ? If we believe the two or three who say yes, but if we look at the real and hard facts given in the film, no, absolutely no. And this fatalistic vision is emphasized of course by the nearly black and white pictures that eare in a way filmed in all the possible shades of grey.

 This book has everything you need to make money on the net...from A-Z! I just got it for Christmas, and already I'm up and running 
 This was the movie we should have had, instead of that one that was all about the game and Anubis.  The writing was really spot-on!  This movie had a lot of real closure and warm and fuzziness.  What is the power to rule mankind?  It's all about what it takes to be a king.  Someone even refers to Yami as Nameless Pharaoh!  We also get to meet a former possessor of the Millennium Ring from 2,000 years ago, and someone else carrying an evil spirit!!!  Cool 
 A must-have for beginning to advanced polymer clay enthusiasts. Witty instructions, complete and thorough step-by-step images, plus lots of extra inspiration images. Sure to thrill any dragon-lover as well. Can't wait for the next book in the series 
 this book was powerful.  i never heard of travis hunter before. i took a chance,i didn't know if it was going to be good or a waste. i was not disappointed at all my husband read it and he enjoyed the book as well.  i think every man should read this book because it shows that man have feelings also and he was man enough to own up 
  Comfort Snowberger is a 10 year old girl whose family owns a funeral parlor and lives on the premises. The whole family works in the business. Thus, Comfort has been to hundreds of funerals. This is not a normal thing for a ten year old girl. Comfort is a very unique and unusual girl.   I was especially impressed with Comfort's voice. It is, like her, unique and unusual. Part of this, I'm sure, is the setting, Mississippi. There is a strong southern flavor which extends to people's names as well. Comfort's brother is Tidings, her  dog is Dismay, her best friend is Declaration, and her whiny cousin is Peach.  Comfort sits in the closet when she needs to think. She visits the cemetery frequently to talk to dead friends and relatives. She also plays normal kid's games and has friends who are normal kids as well. However, Comfort's friends understand her uniqueness. And, it seems, she does not have a wide circle of friends. Comfort is also a writer of cookbooks (how to make food dishes for funerals) and a writer of obituaries, which she reads regularly as well. The most important thing in her life is her dog, Dismay. Dismay is also not the usual dog. He is a funeral dog. He provides comfort to those who are grieving.  Comfort is not like any ten year old girl I have known but I would really like to meet her someday. She has a way of looking at the world that is unlike most people I have known. It would be interesting to spend a day with her, but after reading the book, I feel that in some way I have met her.   Each Little Bird That Sings is a unique story for children. I'm not so sure, however, that it is written at the level that most children understand. While Comfort certainly seems in many ways to be a ten year old, in some other ways she seems far beyond her years. The book had a great deal of humor, but again, I'm not sure that children got a lot of it. Certainly, much of it is at an adult level. I truly enjoyed this book because it took a unique setting with a unique character to go along with it. Growing up in a funeral home is not a common theme in children's literature. I think the author did an outstanding job with such an unusual theme, but did not always target the age of her audience. 
 So it is, Seneca observes, it's not that we are not given a short life, but that we waste a lot it.  Life is long if you know how to use it.  How stupid to forget our mortality.  "Live immediately."  Perhaps better known for his tragedy OEDIPUS,  Seneca (Lucius Annaeus) (AD 4-65) was also a Stoic philosopher.  His reputation as a philosopher is derived primarily from his twelve books of MORAL ESSAYS and philosophical letters. The Stoics emphasized the importance of self-sufficiency and equanimity in the face of adversity, and believed that virtue is attainable only by living in harmony with nature.  Although he may not rank with Plato or Aristotle as a philosopher, or with Marcus Aurelius (121-180) (MEDITATIONS) or Epictetus as a Stoic sage, Seneca nevertheless offers us timeless wisdom for living a meaningful life. (It should be noted that this review refers to the 2005 Penguin Great Ideas edition of ON THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE, translated by C. D. N. Costa, which includes the three essays, "On the Shortness of Life," "Consolation to Helvia," and "On Tranquility of Mind.")   G. Merritt  
 This is a nice overall book and is a good addition to any barbecue library.  The book has a good combination of traditional barbecue, methods of cooking, and more unique non traditional recipes.  There are many good  illistrations for some of the methods that are not clear.  This may not be  the first barbecue book you should buy, but it gives some interesting and  different perspectives 
 Wright has written a wonderful book that, while in no way coming close to replacing C.S. Lewis' classic Mere Christianity, does give us the fruit of his scholarly work, in a pastoral way that is open to many more readers. Wright here is the pastor giving us suggestions even on how to pray (I like especially his suggestion about praying with the actual words of Scripture). Wright's two main themes are really two sides of the same coin: how heaven and earth overlap in prayer, worship, and the Eucharist, and how life in the Holy Spirit means that God's future for us--which involves bodily resurrection and a new heaven and new earth-- is anticipated now on earth when we live in the Holy Spirit and experience heaven on earth in prayer and liturgy. Wright as a traditional Anglican values the Eucharist--that approach is refreshing for Catholic readers like myself, although I think he goes too far in trying to minimize the differences between Catholics and others on the Eucharist, a stance that Lewis was wise enough to avoid altogether. Catholics engage in Eucharistic Adoration. There in one singular, concrete practice is the Catholic difference that cannot be made to disappear with a wave of the hands. With that caveat in mind, I still highly recommend the book to all readers, including Catholics. For a more detailed review, see my blog above for October 11, 2006 
 This is, to put it bluntly, one of the best novels I've ever read. Olds' prose is hypnotic and lyrical, and he somehow manages to give us a compellingly real Doc Holliday who is also strikingly mythical. The book's account of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral is stunning, like nothing you've read (or seen) before. This is a novel that will live for a long time 
 I have always had A LOT of trouble buying into the yarns that ~2,000 years of Christianity have created about Jesus. To me, he seems to be such a simple man. Almost rustic in a way. The Jesus that is presented to the world in traditional, orthodox Christianity is a complex, almost ridiculous character of comic book proportions (or comic proportions).  Thankfully, I found this little gem of a book, the reconstructed sayings of Jesus as culled from the Gospels. It's in the spirit of the Gospel of Thomas, and both books present Jesus in a dry, straightforward and almost sarcastic manner. Q is less mystical than Thomas, which is why I like it more. Jesus speaks of everyday life in Galilee, of the people that he meets in his wanderings (people like you and I) and the situations that these interactions with others bring about. There are no stale, longwinded sermons here. You get the words, straight from the source.  For people who are sick and tired of accepting Jesus as some sort of heavenly Superman, this book is just right for them. Jesus' wisdom is presented here free of the taint and confusion of modern orthodoxy. See common sensical wisdom straight from the traditions of ancient Judaism; there's no mystical crossing with Greek philosophy or other non-Jewish material here.  The defenders of traditional Christianity cry a very loud foul when they see Q. Why is that? Because it presents Jesus as what he was: a man, a very common, everyday man with uncommon wisdom. This simple translation of Q did wonders in reacquainting me with him. I hope that it will do the same for those of you who read it, too

 Barefoot Contessa is my favorite show on Food Network, so naturally I wanted to get the book that went along with the television series. Ina's dishes are soooooo good! I make things from this book all the time for my friends and family. My favorite crowd pleaser is the Perfect Roast Chicken with carrots, onions and potatoes 
 Anybody who gives this 1 star, has no idea what classics are, or what real music is. I'm a diehard hip hop fan and I know what the rolling stones mean to music. I listened to my fathers collection and all there albums are classics to me. I say get the albums before this. Either way you cant go wrong 
 This book is an excellent introduction to the views of Theosophy, which in many respects is not a religion or a philsophy; it is a helpful guide to distinguish and compare theosophy both to the world religions as they are practiced and the "secret wisdom" that is also found in all world religions.  As another reviewer remarked, the Glossary is a very helpful set of definitions for learning further about the theosophical perspective 
 I actually purchased the VHS version of this masterpiece when it first came out and if my memory serves me correctly it was taped at the fillmore in san francisco. Eventually, I purchased the CD. This is a great CD to buy. I strongly urge anyone who reads this to buy this one, trust me. This came out back when mainstream music was still a thing of artistic expression. Now the music scene is dominated primarily by booty-shakin B.S and a bunch of disposable pop bubble gum crap. Buy this cd and also buy the DVD/VHS version and you'll be all the better for it. There is a great clip of Layne(alice in chains) singing "lifeless dead" on it and mike(pearl Jam) laying down a great guitar lick. Great stuff!!!  -we miss you layne-        Thanks for the memories pal...  -Joe 
 This book is very uplifting and an enlightening read no matter what type of woman you are.  One of the best qualities is the author's ability to present the strengths of each archetype and not build a hierarchy of goddesses.  This approach allows the reader to understand different women, as well as conflicting emotions within herself, and see the positive qualities.  I found myself completely taken by her discussion of the Hestia archetype.  In fact, I did some further research on this archetype and now have a collection of notes to pull from.  If a book inspires further investigation, it is definitely worth the read 
 It's a shame that so many of the people who enjoy Lewis's theological works never read his enlightening discussion of the Psalms.  This book does not have the polemic approach of some of his other works.  This is (by Lewis's own admission) not a work of scholarship, being more like one schoolboy comparing notes with another in describing the difficulties met and joys gained in reading the Psalms.  Lewis notes that the Psalms are poems, intended to be sung, and not doctrinal treatises on which to base a system of theology.  He selects various psalms for his discussions, enlightening them with his usual good sense, using illustrations from daily life and the literary world.  Lewis's approach is far more helpful than most others who comment on the Psalms and should be read with interest by those familiar with this part of the Bible 
 The breadth of the author's knowledge about such a wide variety of relevant topics--cultural, literary, historical--spices the book with bits of really superb thumbnail studies and commentary.  Burkhardt is an able  defender of the value of culture and an able critic of those who would  replace freedom with force.  I can see why Hermann Hesse got so much out of  reading him 
 Another review is not needed, there are enough already, except to say this: the reporting is incredible; every page has new facts and new information. Every rat running from the sinking ship has talked to Woodward, and most have blamed other rats further up the anchor chain. But Woodward has done us a real service by not trying to bring too much analysis to the news he is reporting. Therefore, do not trust reviews, do not trust critics, do not trust summaries. Instead, read the whole book. Every page has a new nugget, new raw material, for real analysts, political scientists, historians, to make sense of. This truly is the first draft of history --- so much raw revealing data... 
 The Brothers had experience with Q Jones and others, but they came in with a bang on this project.  "I'll be good to you" is one of the all time great R&B songs. 
 This is by far the greatest acoustic rock album/show out there. definitely overlooked b/c of the 80's cliche that people have about them, but thats not the case. This band is no frills great musicians/performers. a MUST HAVE 
 This book is not some metaphysical hokey pokey stuff. This is based on a true story. I have read this book at least a dozen times and it is a fasinating read. HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommended. Truly a must read.  Dare to make known the unknown 
 This book is important, and maybe even vital, in spite of itself. Lomax is the real thing: He knows his material incredibly well, and even his most offhand paragraphs on anything at all related to African influences on American/southern culture are right on the mark. His field recordings were/are an incalculable contribution to American music. Some of them brought major artists -- Muddy Waters being the most obvious example -- from total obscurity squarely into the mainstream. He was a true scholar, and a kind of cultural hero. That said, this memoir/history was not exactly a joy to read. Lomax has a terrible weakness for lyrical language, but he just doesn't have the chops as a writer; his story is so good he should have been as plain in the telling as possible. His overheated romance with the black American male is often embarrassing. Maybe the best part of the book is a long passage when he simply gets out of the way and we hear directly from one of his subjects for many pages.  It's not that Lomax had no right to do a book like this -- he had every right to. And even at its most purple, what he has to say is crucial if you want to understand American music. I just wish he could have spared us some of his attempts at heightened language and overwrought description. Complaining about white rock musicians, he writes, "To my jaundiced Southern ears .. many rock guitarists are more concerned with showing how many notes they can get off and how many chords they  know tan what the song has to say or how the guitar can speak for them." I would say something very similar about the way Lomax wrote this book -- he should have been less concerned about how  many phrases he could get off and how many words he knew, and just let his wonderful story tell itself plainly 
 As we begin to approach the next century, race is still an important issue that should not be ignored or denied.  As we live in a multiracial society, it is important to take time out and listen to ourselves and others.  This is a provocative book that should be read by all women who take the time to intellectually consider themselves and their role as women and mothers, sisters, neigbors, and lovers.  How will we teach our children and eachother to consider race?  These essays bring forth some  harsh realizations of the boundaries that truly separate black and white women and what must be overcome if we truly want to unite.   It is a good dose of reality that many of us would benefit from not only reading, but thinking about and discussing. The truth is awfully hard to swallow 
 "Lolita" is one of many films based on a famous book, In this case the Russian author Vladimir Nabokov masterwork and controvercial story of a middle aged European professor in USA for work when he get completely obsessed with a teen aged girl he later become stepfather to and starts a sexual relation with. Humbert Humbert the Professor and writer is brilliantly played by James Mason, he will reside at a widow's house, mother of Lolita, Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters), obviously Charlotte will get attracted to the man and she will do whatever she can to let that feeling become mutual, she's been a widow for 7 years and is still young and yearns for a husband to share her life with. Humbert isn't really interested but he's attracted to her daughter Lolita at first sight and sees the marraige as a chance to come closer to the girl. Dolores "Lolita" Haze (Sue Lyon) is a young spoilt and sometimes even rude girl that is innocent and young yet sexy and manipulative (which also was the start for the whole "Lolita" concept ofen used in slang later on) Charlotte sends her daugher away for a while when she's newly wed cause she doesn't want her to get between them. One day she will read Humberts diary's where he reveal some very disturbing truths, frustrated and devastated she runs away from home and get hit by a car and dies. Humbert decided to go pick up the girl and take her for a journey. This is where Humberts real obsession with Lolita starts. And eventually he will become an obsessed over-protective father that will not only have a relationship with his own stepdaughter but also forbid her to have an own life where she can be around friends, have fun after school or even see boys. We will find Peter Sellers in a support role as famous movie star/a police man in disguise and a German Dr.Strangelove sounding teacher investigating them ) All this will lead Humbert to paranoia and after fearing both Lolitas emancipation and the fear of someone discovering the truth he will once again escape with her across the country and put her school and his own teacher job aside. There is only one problem, someone is stalking them. A car is following them and Humberts fears of the reality taking over his fantasy world are getting harder to swollow. Alot of things will happen in the latter part of the film but alot of you would probably have put together the pieces already.  Stanley Kubrick directed this film and it's a very good adaptation of a difficult classic that is both controvercial and hard to make on the screen. It is diffrent from the original book though and feels like Kubrick's free take instead of a faithful version of a classic book. However, most films are and Kubrick's take is defenitely worthwile. All of the actors in the important roles here are fantastic, especially Mason who's stuck in a very strange role as Mr. Humbert. This film is from 1962, so obviously there isn't much explicit scenes or nudity here. I haven't seen the other version of it from 1997 with Jeremy Irons but I guess it's diffrent. I don't think you get a good understanding of what really happens in their bedrooms cause it doesn't show anything of that here, and Lolita seems untocuhed by the consequnces when many other girls in her situation would suffer an emotioanl breakdown. Lolita is still cocky, smart and tries to become independent in one way or another. There are some parts I find a little unrealistic but it's a very strong and fascinating story nonetheless that still is controvercial and disturbing to this day and open for discussion leaving alot of thought in your head after watchng it. It isn't perfect but the acting is fantastic and the story is one to have read/seen... and you get to see what the word Lolita derives from. 4/5 stars 
 A loving floral blend mellow and subtule in flavor.  This tea is a real prize gem while I have never seen this tea at any starbucks it was avalible in gift pact and I was amazed.  Buy this tea and drink it by the gallon 
 This book is easily the most comprehensive, easy to read, well researched book on esoteric spirituality. All of this in the space of 256 pages! The index is thorough (have you noticed that more and more non-fiction books are being published without indices?! Not this one, I am happy to report!)and the chapters are well organized. The book serves well either as an introduction to esoteric/gnostic spiritualities, as a historical survey of the history of those spiritualities, or as an up-to-date series on recent developments in this area of knowledge. Richard Smoley is an authority on these matters and has done a marvelous job with this book. I was especially interested in and appreciative of the section of the book that discusses A Course in Miracles. This one is a "must have" book! Highly recommended 
 Every so often I search online for Rhys Fulber just to see what he's up to and I found out about his latest creation Conjure 1.  This man has more genius than one can ever use in a lifetime.  Both releases are just excellent, however I think I'm partial to the 1st, maybe because it had been so long.. 
 We live in a time where extremes of behavior seem to have almost become the norm. We have a long tradition of separation of church and state, where the rules of church and state seem to operate in parallel with almost no touching. And we seem to be in a time where the most fundamentalist Christian beliefs have become stronger in America while the most fundamentalist Islamic beliefs are being used to build an army for a holy war against America, the Great Satan.   At the same time we see that under the guise of religious behavior we find Mormon polygamous families where the patriarch marries the thirteen year old children of other members of their cult. We find that Catholic priests, once held at the highest esteem are being regularly accused of molesting young boys. We find families holding their children out of schools that teach what they decide offends their religion, leaving their children ill prepared to face a life outside their particular restricted community. We find other families that because of their religious beliefs refuse medical care that would save the life of children.   This book covers these interactions of the church and the state from the standpoint of the United States Constitution and the subsequent laws that have been passed by Congress. It is particularily apt for this time in our history and very highly recommended 
 it is impossible to cover all subjects in a simple book, so there are lots of url links inside book and cd, if you want to read all the book and follow these links, you really need time. You can find lots of linux independent material, like bios hacking, or system vulnerablities. My best book about linux administrative  
 Paulo Coelho will go down in history as one of the greatest authors of all times.  I read 'The Alchemist' first and have become a huge fan of Paulo Coelho since.  He makes you feel that you personally know all of the characters in his stories.  He also writes in a style like no other author.  He makes a reference about a character and then explains it right away instead of making you wait sixty to seventy pages to find out what is going on with the character.  I love 'Eleven Minutes'! 
 As a truly odd individual, I can only fall asleep to the best of horror films... I have to say that this is one the best movies for me to fall asleep to. Let me preface this statement: I'm not making the recommendation to all sleep deprived to watch the new TCM, but it lacks enough emotional involvment early on that I rarly make it to mid-movie before I am peacefully asleep (I will say that waking up to the scary menu music/sound effect is slightly unsettling).  The horror aspect is fun and the old/dirty set is just fine and definitely to my liking. When I do make it through the full movie, I definitely don't feel cheated. As most people will agree, I must watch horror movies at night... unlike most I sleep best to those I know I like enough to buy. Saw kept me awake, but it was not so for Saw II... unfortunate loss of sleep that night. This version of TCM just really solved my insomnia 
 "It's my own fault" on the live disc may be the best 12 minutes of electric blues guitar I've ever heard. It seems blues guitarists are everywhere these days, but at his peak - which just happens to have been around the time he was playing the Royal Albert Hall in April 1971 - Johnny was in a league of his own. No player today I'm aware of comes even close. The 2nd Winter CD is great also, as is the rest of the live disc. Highly recommended. 
 I bought this book because it was referenced in another book I read. I found the book to be witty and humorous. It's a fun and short read, thats great for a train or before sleep.  The diary entries alternate between Adam and Eve and deal with subjects like intimacy, talking (in Eve's case talking too much), and sexual roles (why does Adam name everything?)  Some of the entries were a little dry (hence the 4 stars) 
 IM NOT A BIG BASEBALL FAN SO TO ME THIS MOVIE WAS OK.  THE ACTORS ARE REALLY GOOD AND THEY MAKE IT AN EXCITING MOVIE TO WATCH EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT A BASEBALL FAN!  THE BEST PART IS THE "KISS 
 If I knew how to laugh -- and liked to read -- this would be the perfect book for me. Instead, I had to settle for getting a bit of my stand-up routine included. Too little, I say -- or this would have been a five-star review 
 If you have ever worked with birds that show aggression, this book will be a easy to understand and excellent all-around resource for you.  Great for first time parrot people and experienced trainers alike.  Includes explanations based in science (ethology and behavior sciences) as well as training techiniques.  Sections on bird body language are very helpful.  This book goes into more depth than Good Bird! and is a very useful addition.  I recommend this book to many of my students, and I haven't heard a disapointed comment yet.  I look forward to more from Barbara!  If you've not gotten a chance to check out the magazine, Good Bird! it is also very worthwhile. 
 Eden Ahbez was best known for writing "Nature Boy" - a big hit for Nat "King" Cole.  This album, however, should be viewed as an instrumental album (a Martin Denny style cross between islandesque and jazz music - featuring jazz great Paul Moer!) with a sort of beat poetry accompanying it.  (Bob Keane of Del-Fi Records described Ahbez's lyrics as a cross between Kahil Gibran and Rod McKuen.)  In any event, the lyrics and the music work together to create a very ethereal sound that is absolutely haunting - in a positive way 
 This is a terrific portrait of the unique phenomenon called The Grateful Dead.  It's thorough, but never plodding, and quite lievely to read. 
 I knew next to nothing of musical theory when I bought this book. I only find it lacking in certain areas which have already been refered to by previous reviewers - certain topics are very vague and require going elsewhere for clarification(the case of intervals and how many semitones comprise each interval springs to mind). Faults aside, if you're starting from scratch this book is right for you 
 Gleason Leonard Archer's Introduction to the OT is well done and will satisfy the Scholar and the informed lay person showing depth of research but already good readability. This work is definitively evangelical and conservative. I personally prefer it to K. A Harrison's which I find too liberal on some topic to my taste.  The organization of the book facilitates research work as well as casual reading. However I did not give 5 starts to this book because for a conservative Archer dismissed too easily the 24-hours day view of Genesis 1(see page 201-203) and surprisingly did not spend much time arguing for his day-age view. It was disappointed to see Archer too eager to conform his exegesis of Genesis 1 to available scientific data in general and geology in particular.  Consequently, Archer fails to recognize that creation will never fit the "materialistic view" of science and that his exegesis of Genesis 1 is more influenced by "reader-response" and "science" than it is a result of inductive Bible study. Anyways aside of this "lapse" in judgment Archer's work is a must have and is the best OT Introduction I have seen so far 
 Funny a brilliant. A wonderful portrait of Britain in the austerity years, a brilliant satire of British politics, and a laugh aloud funny plot about what would happen if a small part of London discovered it was really part of medieval Burgundy. With the immortal Dame Margeret Rutherford, at her jowl juddering best 
 This series of the so called new sound emerging here ("electronic soul") illustrates what the frontier between moveable and the edgier could resemble.  Satoshi who apparently thrives to maintain some sort of openness in his choices (this is quite different from the Renaissance series and the GU Nubreed), shifts constantly here between a clear disco like influence ("Sweet things" with its dreamy piano touching the earlier years of Italian dance -remember "I Like Chopin"?-), space funk a la Daft Punk ("Proton Candy", "Concept", Make Me High" where beats are more pulsated supported by harder textures), upbeat and happy house with moog like keys ("Designated"), deep bass club ("ManMachine") as it gears towards the deeper end of electro-house ("Chorgs", "Bar a Thym" with its steady cow bell and distorted/rough waves ). Some tunes are vocal (the sweet and agreeable, airy "Closer to me" and its soft spoken female chorus, "Death Cab..." which follows and perfectly mixed offering a mid-trip break with a more "organic" touch). The electro funk ending has that almost cheesy electro sampling and wavelengths which vibrate through the piece with repetitive key tunes and insisting electro bass.  In all it has that discreet "Tomiie-Touch": subdued, pleasant, not overwhelming. It will fit your needs when you wish for a consistent, gently paced but amusing ensemble flirting with electro sounds carved to the audible and shakeable 
 There probably isn't much I can add in a scholarly vein to what people have already said about Plato. So I thought I would make a few personal observations from the standpoint of a somewhat philosophically literate, 21st century man who is reading such an august classic in middle age.  I came to this book with more of a background in modern epistemology and the philosophy of science than in classical philosophy. So political philosophy isn't exactly my strong suit, but nevertheless I found the book interesting reading in a way I hadn't really thought of before.  Actually, I had read portions of this book 20 years ago when I was a young student first studying philosophy, and I have to say, there is something to be said for having a more mature outlook in approaching such a venerable work. At the time I thought political philosophy pretty dull stuff, and besides, I felt there was no real way to answer any of the important political questions that get debated here, despite the easy way Socrates disposes of everybody else's half-baked opinions and theories.  The fact is, if you move ahead 2400 years and read something like Karl Popper's "The Open Society and Its Enemies," an advanced modern work, you can see how much, or how little, political philosophy has progressed in the last 24 centuries.  Well, that may be true, but at least with this book you know where it basically all started. The best way to decide this issue is to read the book and decide for yourself.  Although entitled "The Republic," this society isn't like any republic you've probably ever read about. Plato proposes an ant- like communism where there is no private ownership of property, philosophers are kings, kings are philosophers, people cultivate physical, moral, and ethical qualities, and the idea of the good takes the place of political and social virtues.  Another odd facet is that the bravest citizens are permitted more wives than those less brave in battle. And then there is the infamous proposition that all poets and artists are to be banished since they are harmful purveyors of false illusions.  I find the Socratic method as a way of moving along the dialogue between the participants sort of interesting, and it is certainly an effective device. However, none of these people, even the famous Sophist Thrasymachus, are really Socrates' intellectual equal, so he really doesn't have much competition here.  (Cheap shot from the "Peanut Gallery"--not to digress too much, here, but if Socrates was supposed to be so wise, how come he married such a shrewish woman for a wife, Xantippe? They joked about how funny and incongruous that was even in Socrates's day).  There was one other thing I was wondering about. If ancient Athens disproportionately had so many towering intellects, relative to its small population (about 20,000 people, most of whom were slaves anyway), you'd think they would show up in Plato's dialogues more. But all we seem to get are second-raters who are really no match for the clever Socrates. Of course, since the dialogues we have were written down by Socrates' most famous student, Plato, perhaps the cards were stacked a little in his teacher's favor.  Yet I would say this is still a great book. Classical scholars say there are more perfect, less flawed dialogues than Plato's Republic, but none that are as profound, wide-ranging, and as influential and important for later philosophy. As someone once wrote, in a sense the entire history of western philosophy "consists of nothing but footnotes to Plato." After finally reading it, I can see why there is so much truth to that statement 
 If you like a teaspoon of New Age mumbo jumbo combined with a mustachioed author's psycho-babble, I suggest you check out Star Jones new book. Phil Jackson has had greatness thrust upon him. Michael Jordan, Stacey King, Kobe Bryant, and Shaq are the reason we know his name. Not his Jerry Garcia, Phoenix University degree, dimestore analysis of the spiritual side of coaching and people management. Make him the coach of the Trailblazers and see how great he is. 
 A Boy's Struggle   	"Pops, I don't think you should do that." Jude said in reference to mixing powder with drugs.  Jude knew one day a customer would find out his father's scams.  Jude was right.  While watching television, Jude hears a gun shot from the kitchen.  When he goes to see what has happened, he finds his father dead and the killer still there.  Jude and the murder talk and Jude agrees to tell no one about what has gone on.  When the man leaves, Jude dials 911.  Soon after, Jude's life is turned upside down.  He is the main suspect in his father's murder.  He is shipped away to live with his mother who he has not seen since he was two years old.  Jude starts going to a new school where kids know about his rough past.  Kids begin to ask for drugs, but Jude says no.  He does not want to end up like his father.  But eventually, Jude gives in, attempting to fit in.  Rumors soon fly about the boy supplying the school with drugs.  They begin to ruin his school career and his mother's chances of being elected mayor.  Anthony, Jude's mother's boyfriend, devises a plan to end all rumors and save his mother's chances.  Jude agrees and ends up being prosecuted for dealing drugs.  Anthony says he will get Jude out of jail after the election, but Anthony lies.  Jude ends up spending five years in prison.  After serving his time Jude is let out and decides to turn his life around.  He also wants to reveal the truth about his father's murder and clear his name.  Jude, by Kate Morgenroth is a superb book.  The characters are easy to connect with, the plot is suspenseful, and the details are amazing.  I would recommend everyone read Jude. 	I found it very easy to connect with the characters in this book.  Jude was made to be a character that a reader can relate with.  I actually cared what happened to him.  A reader could feel the pain Jude went through, the disappointment of his mother, and the betral of Anthony.  For instance, when Jude realizes he was lied to and will really be spending five years in prison, the felling of let down and being stabbed in the back was present and real.  I believe that being able to relate to characters really adds to a books overall affect.   	The suspenseful plot of Jude makes a reader want to keep reading.  With something always happening, a reader will be anxious to learn the fate of every character.  When the book seams to be coming to a conclusion, another thing happens.  Jude will defiantly keep a reader turning pages.  Personally, I found Jude to be a quick read despite the length because I could not put it down. 	The details in this book are amazing.  I felt as if I was in it.  The description brought the book to life.  It was easy to picture the setting and characters.  The description of the dark, small, disgusting jail cell made me feel as if I was there going thought all Jude was. 	Jude is an amazingly well written book.  A reader can connect with characters and feel as if they are part of the book.  Jude is a gripping novel and hard to put down.  I recommend everyone add Jude to their reading list. 	 
 Informative book about the late author for elementary school level children. Also a great artist to study and try to replicate. My students have a blast learning about Jackson Pollock then creating their own splattered masterpiece 
 This book is very funny, because Junie B. keeps saying, "My Grandpa pulled out my tooth!", and then her Grandpa says, "No, it came out when you bit my finger!"  Junie B. keeps saying, "911! 911! 911! Please help!" and then she runs out the door.  I like this book a lot cause it's so funny.  I like this book cause I'm a toothless wonder, too!  And she has a loose tooth in this book, and so do I.  Please read it 
 Tim Burton's "Ed Wood" never hit it big at the box office but has now become a cult favorite, much like its eponymous subject. Johnny Depp brings in a performance of unbridled, blind enthusiasm that has you rooting for Ed to make good. Martin Landau deservedly won an Oscar for his fantastic performance of drug-addicted, decrepit Bela Lugosi. Bill Murray as the flamboyant "Bunny" steals every scene he's in. The rest of the cast turn in solid performances, with the exception of the typical wooden performance by Sarah Jessica Parker. The "Special Edition" offers some bonus extras, the most interesting being "The Making Of Bela", which goes into detail about the makeup used to transform Martin Landau into Bela. 
 Like with many other things in life, I just couldn't decide whether I liked this book or not ;). On the one hand Heffron does a wonderful job of keeping the reader's interest with personal accounts and advice. But then on the other hand the many prompts filtered throughout the book became a bit of a drag, as it required you to stop reading to do long activities.  One practical idea that Heffron stresses is playfulness and simplicity. Returning to the reason you want to write-because you love it! Writing itself is a form of expression, and a form of creativity. What you will write, if it truly comes from you, even if it is a mixture or combination of your experiences or relationships with the outside world, it still will be unique, because these factors are unique to you. Therefore Heffron says that you must not worry about beginnings and endings and rational things like structure and form, those will fall into place in time, and prematurely worrying about them will only serve to clog your creative senses. Instead he says you should return to your youth, and essentially treat the process like you are a kid playing in a mud puddle. "Splash around and play," and let yourself explore your idea without any reservations.   With its many techniques and practical suggestions, I think this book is wonderful for those who are struggling writers, or struggling to be writers. It contains a wealth of information and ideas for innovating manuscripts at all stages-from idea formation to editing the final draft. I think it can also prove to be useful for other types of writing as well, such as articles and research papers. This is because no matter what, a reader is looking for information in an interesting comprehensive yet simple manner. Therefore many of the different techniques and prompts highlighted throughout the book will definitely help to stretch the creativity of someone who might be writing something in a more constrained or dry setting.   Overall a fun book that can certainly be read and reread and applied practically.    
 The days were so long till I got back to the book... LOVED IT 
 Its was surprisingly good. Although I am not a fan of Teri Hatcher but enjoy the show 
 I have no children of my own but have been a nanny for 6 years.  Of all the stories I've read . . . this is by far the best!  I give it to every person I know with children!  Thank you for such a wonderful story, such beautiful artwork and such wonderful sounds 
 Brilliant.Although the film has aged,it's still just as funny all these years later.This is a must for anyone who has ever had thoughts of getting revenge on a boss.The documentary afterwards is great as it offers a lookat how the three girls ended up filming it together.10/10 even after 25 years 
 As a soon-to-be manager of a new call center operation, I found Day's book to be both comprehensive and easy to use.  Virtually all topics related to establishing and operating a call center, then managing its operation, are covered in well written, concise chapters.  In addition, he provides a reasonably good set of appendices with references to consultants, measurement techniques, etc.  The style and language employed by Day are targeted toward intelligent readers.  When jargon is used, though, clear definitions are always close by.  Overall, I found the book to be just what I was looking for -- a one-volume reference to make me aware of all the issues I may face in the management of this new facility 
 Like all really great actors, Daniel Day-Lewis just keeps getting better and better with age.  He seems capable of being in any role and delivering the person he is supposed to be.  I was fascinated by the fact that he indeed does box and is quite good at it as well.  Doesn't surprise me that he is good because this is a man committed to whatever project he undertakes and gives his all.  I have not gone into the actual movie here because so many of the reviews reveal so much of the intensity of this marvelous film.  I don't think it would have made it without Daniel Day-Lewis.  Why isn't he used more frequently?  We are missing a lot of wonderful performances.  Very good movie about a very sad situation that unfortunately still exists today in many places in this mixed-up world, and did exist in Belfast, Ireland until a relatively short time ago.  Thank God there are people that keep trying to come to some kind of resolution when such problems do exist.  This movie goes a long way in trying to give a real overview of everyday life that exists when you are forced to live with violence.  Try this film.  You'll be glad you did 
      In Walter Dean Myers' book, "Monster," Steve Harmon, age 16, is in prison awaiting trial for murder, accused of serving as a lookout during a robbery in which the robbers shot and killed a drugstore owner.  While in prison, Steve, a film student, tells about his life, his case, and his imprisonment in the form of a movie screenplay interspersed with diary entries in which he describes his feelings, his life before the murder, and the frightening conditions in prison.  Is Steve a "monster" responsible for the senseless death of the storeowner, as the prosecutor alleges, or is he guilty only of knowing the crime participants?                	  Weaving handwriting-typeface journal entries, grainy cinematic quality photographs, and fast-paced movie script dialogue with directions for camera angles, Myers has written a unique novel.  As a young adult who finds himself in a violent place in the adult world, Steve is a compelling character.  Faced with what may be a permanent loss of independence, and taking a hard look at his identity and at his integrity, Steve attempts to convince himself that he is not the "monster" the prosecutor alleges.  Readers serve as witnesses to the courtroom proceedings, but find themselves serving as jurors as well.  When reading the story, it is virtually impossible to remain unmoved - we make a decision about this young man's guilt or innocence, and we are anxious to see if the jury in the book reaches the same conclusion.                                    	                        Myers presents questions about Steve, about our justice system, and about the nature of guilt and innocence.  He gives readers no easy answers.  "Monster" is a riveting novel that makes readers think - while reading and after reading the book.

 This cd seriously rules. It's rap that pumps you up, just back up off me. Imp rules and i can't wait for their next cd 
 I think it's possible that Haltzman overstates the disadvantages of men in traditional couples therapy, and overplays the sensitivity stuff. For example, he cites the fact that males consistently tend to do better on quantitative tests and females consistently on verbal reasoning, and uses physiology and brain chemistry to back that up.   But, for instance, if you look at those particular things, it's a bit more nuanced, and sometimes varies across cultures (i.e. males actually outscore females on verbal analogies. Males do have greater spacial ability VERY consitently across cultures, but overall quantitative skills exams seem to be socially influenced, as the gender gap on mathematical achievement test varies substantially across cultures, and in some cases female representation in math and science departments does too. Given the fact that gender differences that are biological probably don't vary a great deal, but societal teachings do, seems to support the role that are social and cultural factors in gender gaps).  I also think he overstates the idea that marriage is feminized--the use of his examples in media was rather selective. In Veronica Mars, a series that gender studies scholars write articles analyzing how Veronica takes on the patriarchy, Veronica's mother leaves her because of drug problems, and she is raised by a  single father.   The principles he's discussing are accurate and meaningful background, but the way it's written doesn't leave the reader with the most lucid impression possible, in my humble opinion (but then again I'm not especially knowledgeable about these topics).  One of the major underpinnings of the book is males have excelled in all of these other things, so why not relationships? Well, probably part of the reasons males have excelled is explicitly because being able to work upwards of 60 hours a week has always been relatively easy for them, and it enabled a great deal of success in all these things, but did not particularly help them with regards to their relationships with their wives. And, so, I don't know that I entirely buy that premise.    Yet, considering all else, I would highly recommend this book to married couples, because the advice in it is extremely sound. And I'd say to women who might be suspicious, I personally cringed when I heard one of the major principles was going to be treat your wife like a client (though I would still go for a business partner model, as opposed to a client one), or to get to know her in terms of who she really is not who "she says she is." Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised. Many of the ideas in the book may actually be to your liking.   However, I thought the ideas in the book were extremely important, and the advice was practical and would be very helpful to many people. Towards helping men, the advice is probably a tremendous assist.  It gives them a broader picture of marriage, and a better idea of their wives' needs. Notable ideas include the significance of just being at home, how that pleases the misses and the benefits of it. Also, how it's important to confront conflict, and not to fear it, that's a less that all married people need, but especially for men. And of course, the live-or-die importance of listening.    But the thing that most impressed me is that it really gives people, but men, in particular, a very solid, coherent framework of a woman's emotional needs. So, they can understand a woman's need for love, affection, and the knowledge that she is cared about immensely, and gives them a real path to meet these needs. They are actually able to meet the emotional support and attatchment that is so crucial to a woman, and for that, this book is absolutely worthwhile. 
 I read only the part where one person interviewed  Kirk in the persona of Kilgore Trout.  This made  a great addition to this book 
 This is the ONLY book in my entire life that I had to restrain myself from standing up on a public bus and shouting out: "Everyone! Get off the bus, buy this book, read every page and LIVE it."  Delicious wit, critical facts & Harry's Rules which are essential to improving the health of everyone...not just men 50 and older.  Get off your bus. Buy it. Read it. LIVE it 
 I enjoyed reading The Mark. It was definitely a page turner. Of course it makes me want to continue with the series. Tim F. LaHaye is a great author and story teller. I actually visualized the whole the thing. I would thank him in person if I could, for a wonderful job done...  Thank you.. 
 Good basic platter for smaller dishes.  Certainly  not big enough for large servings of meat, etc 
 This book covers a subject that is oft-neglected, but is very important to anyone and everyone.  It is engagingly written by a true expert.  As odd as this may seem, given the subject matter, in many places it is near profound 
 "Hammer of the Gods" is an outstanding book reflecting the true spirit of the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.  Though similar to their Norse cousins, here we are given an in-depth look at the tradition through the eyes of the ancient `Anglo-Saxons'.    Herein one finds a description of the Gods of the pantheon of the people: such as Woden, Thor, Frigga, and Heimdall.    We read of the Holy Tides - Yule, Eostre, Litha (Midsummer), Harvest, and Winterfylleth, etc.   We read of the Rites of Life, with ceremonies for birth, name giving, blot, symbel, oath, wedding, and funeral.  Learn of the Runes, runic meditation and divination, and how to make a runic talisman.  The author, Swain Wodening, has done excellence research, combined with 20+ years practical experience in Anglo-Saxon Heathenry, to produce a book that is a "must read" for anyone with an interest in these things. 
 Excellent movie for college students and scholars!  A very good family movie also.  
 I had not bought a Fred Hammond CD since I bought Spirit of David and Pages of Life vol 1, so i was used to the RFC sound.    At first i didn't like this CD as I scrolled through it and I set it aside for about 6 months  Then I decided to make myself listen to it a few times.  I really started to enjoy certain songs first "Lord we need your Love" (grooves) , "A Closer Walk", and especially "I will find a way"(powerful message)   The others are starting to grow on me as well I as really listened to them more.  I usually end up liking these types of CD's best in the long run, they are initially a little more challenging, but more rewarding in the end.  
 I read this book a couple of weeks ago. Today I saw the film "Good Night , Good Luck", on dvd, in which Murrow predicts the coming trend of the media to entertain and insulate.  There is no doubt that after bashing Clinton for eight years and now currently referring to the so called "Clinton scandals", the media has generally for the most part been kind to President Bush. This despite the fact that the Bush administration, the executive branch since 2001, has overstepped  bounds and shredded the checks and balances, or at least attempted to sidestep checks and balances.  So anyone watching CNN or other mainstream  news media since 1993,from the concoction of the "Whitewater scandal" to the Monica frenzy, from the pronouncement of legitimacy to Bush's "victory" in 2000 to the overlooking of events such as the Jeff Gannon story and 2004 Ohio voting irregularities, there's no doubt that there has been a double standard.  However there are at least a couple of things that I would disagree with Boehlert who for the most part has done an excellent job of providing a history of the double standards of the media.  First I'm not really sure that the media is or has been Bush's "lapdog". It seems to me more that Bush is a puppet of other forces and that the media actually holds the upper hand not the government. That is Bush probably has less power than Cheney, and Cheney in turn has less power than the mutinational corporations that the media is a part of. So I'm not sure I agree with Boehlert on who really has the power.  Secondly, I disagree with his analysis of the CBS National Guard story. I would suppose in this cycnical age that if you get outfoxed and entrapped you have something to be ashamed of. But in my view Dan Rather and Mary Mapes got hoodwinked and sabotaged by some clever connivers. So this was not really a scandal on the part of CBS as Boehlert portrays.  The chapter on the Note told me lots of things that I never knew before about the media.  Prior to reading this book I read Eric Alterman's "What Liberal Media?". This book reinforced my dawning realization that something was amiss with the media. Certainly I had noticed back in 1993 that there was  nothing to the Travel Office firing, that the media made this a scandal when it seemed to me properly handled.  In 1996 I noticed that the media was not willing to congratulate Clinton for winning re-election or willing to relent in their scandal mongering. And in 2000 I saw that they just about totally ignored the fact that Gore won the popular vote, this was irrelevant, and they urged Gore to concede.  But it wasn't until I read books like Alterman's and this book Lapdogs that I grasped the total unfairness and preference of the media for Republicans over the Democrats.  I highly recommend this book and it makes a fascinating if somewhat depressing read 
 This has been one of the best books i have ever read by miss Rice.It is simply a ghost story.About a fiddler who was killed and is haunting someone.......but then things change and the hunter becomes the hunted......A very shot simple read.The book is set in modern times with very little reference to the past which is contrary to the vampire chronicles which uses a lot of history...but nevertheless this book delivers!The beginning is superb the middle is a little slow but exciting and the end,well is sad but true and surprising,not to mention relieving and wonderfully satisfying...Give it a shot...  And to put it simple:The book is set in numerous places, including Vienna, New Orleans (which is typical of Rice's novels) and Rio de Janeiro. The novel tells the story of three people: a young woman yearning to become a musician, a ghostly violinist (hence the title), and the ghost of Beethoven...Enjoy...Nigel. 
 Mary Jo McGraw's "how-to" project book offers many creative ideas and imaginative techniques for rubber stampers that both beginners and advanced "stampers" will enjoy! The step by step instructions  and wonderful pictures make projects fun and easy 
 I got this very handy accessory item to go with my digital camera. It's compatable and very handy for taking family pictures on holidays where you can be included in the picture.   I know the camera's have self timers, but who wants to run and be breathless to get in the frame in time before the camera fires.   This way you can take more time to compose your picture and it turns out great. I highly recommend this if you plan on taking pictures at any family gathering-or taking informal portraits at home. 
 As a strong believer in the professional and entrepreneurial potential of women I am glad to see this book. The author presents many fine plans of action to help women propel through their careers and reach their goals. I only hope that the author releases a book for us men 
 I could watch this movie only one time because of what I call the 'disturbing nature' of the film.  It is probably too close to being true. The music, however is well worth owning and listening to over and over and over.  The integration of music with the characters is amazing.  An excellent film, well directed and acted (and played).  Haunting, sad, beautiful.  Deals with the push of the Catholic Church to 'convert' natives to Christianity.  There is a serious question of which were closer to God, the natives with their music or the Church with its pomp, pagentry and blind ruthlessness 
 "I sat at the chair."  "I went on school today."  That is probably what most of us sound like when we start really speaking Japanese, merrily swapping around all those cute little "ni"s, "wa"s, "de"s and "ga"s.  It gets even worse at an upper level when the mysterious "hodo"s and "kana"s start rearing their ugly heads.  Particles are one of the most confusing aspects of Japanese, and one of the biggest road blocks to conversational fluency.  Every student of Japanese could use "How to Tell the Difference Between Japanese Particles."  It is a practical, concise little book that contains a wealth of information.  Unlike Naoko Chino's previous particle book, "All About Particles,"  this volume contains practice exercises and demonstrations of the most common mistakes of Japanese particles.  It is more of a workbook, that should be followed from start to finish.  Chino takes several similar but confusing particles, such as "particles indicating time" or "particles used for comparison," then highlights the different usages of each particle, along with demonstration sentences in both English, kana and romaji.  Like all good Japanese books, the emphasis is on the kana, with the romaji and English doing support work.   After each chapter, there are several quizzes to test your new knowledge.  The book closes with an overall test on the entire book.  The comparative nature of this book, along with the repeated quizzes, make "How to Tell the Difference Between Japanese Particles" one of the most useful Japanese study guides that I own.  It serves a niche purpose, but a very useful and necessary one 
 [...]  Mr Reich's argument is based on sound appeals to reason and  evidence.  Unfortunately, a substantial number of Americans are immune to both.  Fiscal conservatives continue to admire Reagan although his reductions in taxes and increases in federal spending doubled the national debt.  And many fiscal conservatives voted for Bush despite his ballooning of the national budget.  Reasonable Americans do not carry enormous balances on their credit cards, paying banks 18% per annum for that privilege, yet the majority of Americans do.  If so many people cannot manage their own finances, small wonder that they do not recognize Reagan's and Bush's fiscal profligacy.  Many Americans also believe Bush's prevarication that the war in Iraq makes America safer, despite national intelligence estimates that show that our presence there creates and trains ever more terrorists.  Reasonable, well informed people know about the national intelligence estimates; most Americans do not.  Bush claims to be a pro-environmental president.  Evidence shows that he favors more pollution because that aids the power industry.  But again, Bush's relaxation of pollution standards is not generally known.  Many Americans are so naive that they genuinely believe that because Bush is a man of faith, or so he claims, he must be a good man.  Men of faith have, of course, been responsible for some of the most outrageous atrocities in human history, from the wars of religion in Europe to the attack on the US by Osama bin Laden.  But one must know a bit of history to know that.  Would that Americans were as amenable to reason as Mr Reich supposes 
 I give this book the highest rating because it lays out on a room by room and activity by activity basis how to simplify your life.  Like the author says, you can't follow everything in the book, just those things you can do most readily.  There are so many suggestions, that anybody could find benefit with this book. 
 I am pretty picky about books about the southwest, the meeting of cultures, and AIDS, as I find these three areas too easy to exploit, skin the surface of, and capitalize upon.  Add spirituality to the mix, and  chances are you will lose me, as I have no tolerance for the new-agey  stuff, especially if it feels too burgeois, as much of it does.  This book  is so beautiful, i loved it so much the first time I read it, and it truly  changed me the second time.  It all feels real to me, the magic, the  connections, the pain.  Any flaws in plot or dialogue are easily forgiven  in view of the tremendous power and heart of this work.  Alire Saenz is a  genius 
 I have waited for this release since last year when I first got the email from Gospel.com. As soon as it came out in October I brought it. I love this CD, I have purchase 4 copies already for family and friends. This is on the top of my gift giving list.  I have read many versions of the bible since 2003, and to be honest this is the best. I can see the story as it is being told to me. The drama that is accompanied by the reading is fantastic.  I love the way the executive producers surround the angel "Gabriel" with such a voice and the speed of it "wow" very exciting, you can truly feel his sense of urgency when talking to Zechariah about the birth "John" YES Lord!! This is such an anointing project and I am sure many who NEVER would pick up a bible or attend church services WILL be blessed by this audio version of the bible.   As God inspired in the four gospels he meets everyone right where they are and then waits for us to get there. The Bible Experience is living testimony of just that...  Missy  
      I have always loved this musical but could not find the CD in our area stores so went to Amazon and ordered it.  It is a wonderful Cd.  Arrived in excellent condition and much quicker than expected.  I am so thankful that I ordered from Amazon.       Anyone familiar at all with this musical will love this CD I am sure 
  This book is an original, off-beat and moving account of the world as viewed through an unusual lens. It shows the unique vision of the world of synesthetes--people who perceive words as having colors and music as having shapes. But in addition, the book tells of a very personal and touching relationship between a daughter who feels 'different' and a father who appreciates that difference. Recommended for those interested in science, psychology and things literary. 
 This book is funny!  Few words per page. Kids will reread it again and again (they can retell this after you've read it to them once).  They may read it to everyone they know.    Suitable for English Language Learners of all ages.  See if you can get this little gem in a hard cover.  The pages fell out of my soft cover copy.  The pages themselves are durable, it was just the binding 
 The story of Oliver Twist, written by Charles Dickens, is a classic bildungsroman, about the difficulties a child had to endure to survive in the 1800's. Dickens satirizes the atrocious trait of human selfishness by illustrating how it comprises ones humanity as the helpless and vulnerable are victimized for personal gain. Oliver Twist is an orphan from a small village not far from London, who is forced into social conventions by a city council. He escapes his horrible captor, a woman who steals food money for her personal use, but unfortunately lands in the hands of a criminal mastermind, who forces him to pickpocket in the London streets. He luckily is taken under the loving care of a family who gains the information of Oliver's previous captor. Many scenes are dedicated to the fallout of this criminal family which proves that with a positive environment, people are able to succeed in life. Oliver Twist has been around for nearly 200 years and I found it a very good novel, not only for its content but also for its moral truths. It is interesting because it allows children and young adults to imagine what life was like back then and to contrast their lives to Oliver's. This realization allows the reader to see that some people have more difficult lives then others and to not take advantage of them 
 I am so surprised to see the two reviews that are critical of this book.  I would give this amazing book 6 stars if it were possible.  I have been unable to put it down -- it's like a life-changing gift to my mind -- because of its highly intelligent, thourough writing, and the depth with which the author approaches the subject of love, and humanity in general.  This engaging book validates the importance of romantic love, whether lasting or fleeting, and discusses the fascinating intricacies involved in feelings that accompany love as it begins, evolves and ends -- and it does it  with a mixture of warmth and wisdom, like no other book I have ever read (and I read a lot on this subject).    The writing is clear and well organized -- you know immediately that the author is a brilliant, highly cultured person -- not  some shallow pop icon/TV personality, or a mediocre therpaist who has no knowledge of other disciplines.  I would've loved to be Person's student.  She shares her vast knowledge with us in a way that leaves us much richer than before.  Her examples of various love stories are not boring at all (as one of the reviewers stated) -- they are drawn from high class literature and films, and from the history of human civilization -- they are timeless.    With all due respect, I think that the readers who did not appreciate this book must have very short attention spans and could not lift themselves to the level of this book.  
 A very poor title, in my opinion.  It is certainly as much about George Lucas as it is about a dozen others.  It captures a time and a place in our digital revolution.  The mechanical linkages of the past have been replaced by 1's and 0's and this books gives the reader a very accurate and clear representation of how painful that change can be. It is most definately a must read for anyone going into 3d as a profession.  It will make clear the history behind some of the tools you abuse everyday.  So if you use particle systems to render fur and hair, if you paint in layers, if you use an alpha, if you render motion blur or depth of field read this book and you will know who to say thank you to the next time you are at siggraph 
 This book has a great many scenes and monologues, and nearly anyone can find one that works for them. While some of the plays that are excerpted are a bit obscure, I found this to be only a minor setback, thanks to the  magic of online book purchasing 
 The Iron Triangle Screenplay by Mike Baron Black Coat Script Library www.blackcoatpress.com  2004 ISBN # 1-932983-07-4 Large Trade Paperback $15.95 US    "In film and television, thousands of fine scripts by established writers are never produced. The Black Coat Script Library is dedicated to presenting some of those scripts." (Back cover)  Frequent readers of my review work here and elsewhere are very much aware of my strong appreciation and admiration for the efforts of Black Coat Press. As foremost a reader and secondly as a reviewer, I have learned quickly that BCP can always be counted on to provide quality books in terms of appearance as well as story. This new division of BCP is no exception.  For those that do not know and I certainly didn't before receiving this book (one of three and I will be reviewing the rest soon) a "script book" is the basic movie or TV show in script form within a bound book. The best and simplest analogy I can come up with is that if remember reading plays in High School English, this is the same idea. And the effect is the same. Other than scene location explanations, character development and actions are told almost entirely through spoken dialogue. As such, it requires a certain style of writing and narration to make the characters come alive.  It certainly works in the "The Iron Triangle" which the author refers to as "American Beuaty meets Enter The Dragon." (Introduction (page 5) and Back Cover) Set in Fielder's Creek, the action revolves around a small karate school, "Rick's Karate." Owned and operated by Rick Mayer, the school is having serious hard times and placing enormous strain on his already shaky marriage to his beautiful wife, Darcy.  Rick is not that aware of the level of her unhappiness or the multiple reasons for it and he is certainly not aware of the actions of several of his students who are out vandalizing homes and pushing drugs. Using skills he is teaching them in advance of competing in the coming state tournament, they are a part of the rapidly growing crime problem in the small town. The question becomes as various matters take their course resulting in more and more violence and deceit, will Rick figure out friend from foe, in time to save himself and those he cares about?  This was a very enjoyable read and filled with what could be interesting characters if brought to the screen. This murder mystery features numerous fight scenes, which would have to be depicted correctly to raise tension while retaining the overall noir feeling to the work. It could be done and done well and hopefully somebody in Hollywood is paying attention.  Kevin R. Tipple © 2004 
 I got this for my daughter(4) and neice (5) for their recent birthdays. They love this doll. I can't believe how much it is selling for on this site. I paid 2 for $15 at KB's. 
 Very topical. Easy read. Hope people in the know read this and give serious thought to the potential for something like this happening.  Gives good reason why border control should be taken more serious by everybody. Looking forward to reading other books by Mr. Bell 
 I took the risk...it was worth it! I also read Alpha Chiangs book and still think Simons is better organized.   You don't have to jump aroun between chapters. With Simons book you can go from ch. 1 right trough to the last one and really feel human capitalization at work.  It doesnt have as much antiderivative analysis as Chiangs, nor does it have any linnear prog.  Still, I think it still makes a better buy for beginners than Chiangs...the cover also looks better in ones study desk! 
 I think that the book is very good on the fundamentals of manufacturing and a must read. It serves as an excellent reference book in my opinion and is well worth its high price tag 
 I loved that this film version of Matthew was taken word for word from the text of scripture.  I also loved that Jesus looked like he could be Jewish, and that he didn't act like the lobotomized robotic Jesus that I have seen in other some other films... Hey, we take what we can get.  The reason I gave this version 4 stars was that the camera sometimes focuses on that which seems totally unrelated to what Jesus is saying.  Overall, however, I give this film two thumbs up and have recommended it to many others 
 Read this book! Not only was "The Philadelphia Negro" a groundbreaking piece of sociological research in its day (the late 19th century), the book also goes a long way to explain the historical roots of much of what we see today in Philadelphia and other cities in America. Organized simply and effectively into clear chapters, we learn how African Americans really lived in Philadelphia after emancipation; detailing family and household arrangements, employment, education, health and religion. Elijah Anderson's introduction is a fantastic bonus, helping to illuminate the book even more. Everyone living in Philadelphia should read this 
 Jane Leavy does a fantastic job of seeking Sandy Koufax's contemporaries to allow us into the most dominating four years that any major league pitcher has ever had.  What comes across is the sheer physical will over pain like Lou Gehrig, dominating the game from his position like Lawrence Taylor, not taking needed rest similar to Chuck Bednarik, great humility like Wayne Gretsky and down to earth rationality like some many great retired athletes that we never hear of.  If it wasn't for Leavy's book we may have never heard about the private side of Koufax nor the four years of consecutive no-hitters that culminated in a perfect game.  If is amazing that in 1965 right outside of Hollywood only one teenager decided to record Vin Scully announce that game. The Dodgers opponent, the Cubs happened to lose after only allowing the Dodgers one hit more.   Jane Leavy's account of the perfect game is worth the price of admission.  Sandy Koufax was and is a role model and a hero to boys and men alike. Jane does not pry too much, nor would Sandy let her in but we find out more about this very special man.  Simon and Garfunkel said "Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio" but after Lefty's Legacy I cry out for role models like Sandy Koufax today. This is mythology! 
 How many ways are there to get our children to read, eat healthy, and be more active? Answer - NONE, until I found Race Against Junk Food. The story is wonderful, action packed but non-violent, and it gently moves a child's belief system into a mode that encourages a healthy lifestyle. What could be better? Read it with your child and see if you don't become more active and eat more fruits and vegetables (and leave that couch & cheeseburger behind) 
 Malcolm Barber's The Cathars is a generalist scholarly introduction the theology and history of the Cathars.  Beginning with a brief examination of Cathar antecedents and the question of whether there was a conscious continuance of the dualist-Gnostic tradition of the Manicheans or Bogomils Barber then proceeds to offer individual chapters on the history of Cartharism. Particularly helpful was the delineation of the different emphases of different factions of 13th century Cartharism, most notably the absolute and moderate dualism of different groups. This book encompasses both the origins of Cartharism, discusses reasons for its growth. Its main contribution however is its survey of the so called Albigensian crusade. The book ends with a very helpful chapter of the historiography of Cartharism and the (mis)uses to which this story has been put.    This book will be of interest to students of religious history and I certainly found it a very helpful introduction to Cathar belief. By way of criticism however I did feel that the section of on Cathar theology and ethics while good could have been more comprehensive. Nonetheless if you want to learn more about Cartharism then this is probably the best focussed study you could buy. 
 This is one helluva band. And really greased on this early 70s gem. Go get it. It's wonderful 
 Debbie, Wysteria is on Home Free and now it's stuck in MY head!  Not that that's a bad thing... Dan Fogelberg music brings back many wonderful memories/feelings for me.  Souvenirs is great but if I had to be shipwrecked with only 1 Fogelberg album it would be Phoenix 
 good book to read on strategy as it makes you think, takes you out of your comfort zone and is a little zany. I like it. They dont take themselves too seriously and strategy either. It is written and compiled so that the stories are short and to the point and by different authors and thinkers in the world of strategy. Good diverse look at the topic 
 I have always liked Dickens -- I used to say that A Tale of Two Cities was my favorite -- but this work is truly extraordinary.  Like all of Dickens' novels, this one contains an amazing number of complex and colorful characters.  The novel is in the first person, with the voice looking back as an older man at the entirety of his life.  What struck me most about the book was Dickens' ability to write in a way that simultaneously captured both the emotions of a child as the young Davy experienced these events and those of the man who was looking back on them.  With magnificent characters, an interesting plot, and a clear theme, this is truly a masterpiece 
 This book is great for those who want to go into depth about the original 12 steps.  This is one of the original books used by AA in the early days and provided great insight into this organization, regardless of what you may think of it.   I confess that I am annoyed when others use this platfom as a forum rather than for BOOK REVIEWS. Statements such as "...many people.. died because of this ..." are judgements about AA and 12 steps in general, but not of this book.   
 I originally got this book when I first moved out on my own. I had some cooking experience which I gleaned from my mother, but with a limited spread of recipes and without much on-my-own experience.  This book helped me a great deal as a beginner cook, and taught me most of the basics. Years later, I'm a much better cook, and though I rarely use this book's recipes at face value, I often reference it for a guideline to dishes that I enjoy, while adding my own touches. Also, when I'm preparing to try something new, this is generally the first book I go to, even after all this time.  Other cook books have come and gone, but this one has staying power for me, earning it its five stars. A great purchase for a young adult, or even an every-day cook who just isn't very good, or who has a limited array of recipes. It is also a great reference for anyone who just wants a base to branch out from 
 This book offered a clear explanation of what Schutzhund is, and what it isn't.  The training technique is easy to understand, and their mention of what to do with a problem dog is particularly helpful.  A great book for anyone interested in Schutzhund, or even wishing to obedience train a pet 
 This overview of the global film and television industry is highly recommended for anyone with an interest in film, and especially for managers in production companies or the like.  It is very readable and accessible, and helps you understand the larger economic forces that structure your work environment 
 "The Easter Parade" focuses on sisters Emily and Sarah and gives us a window into their lives during a forty year period. Near the beginning of the novel, the sisters seem to have the world open before them, as Sarah marries a dashing Englishman, and Emily wins a scholarship to Barnard. We soon learn, however, that Sarah's husband beats his wife and that Emily is lonely and miserable, despite having a successful career. This novel deftly cuts into the reality that life often is. Yates' worldview is an often bleak and depressing one, which might be why his works have not received much critical attention. However, his superb writing style, his ability to draw vivid and unforgettable characters, and his insight into the human condition makes him a writer to become acquainted with. 
 The anecdotes and stories are great.  The instruction is motivational and helpful.  John Maxwell understands both the business world and the Christian world of being a pastor.  This book is about leadership, regardless of what you are the leader of.  If you are struggling as a leader or are new at being a leader, I strongly recommend this book.  It is also good for those who are doing well in leadership.  This book is loaded with great ideas.  The one negative I found was typographical errors.  They were actually several of these and should have been caught, but this does not detract from the overall value of the book.  
 It is hard to call this a "great book" b/c the subject and content is still very real and very fresh in the mind of Americans.  In the years since 9/11 there have been a number of films and documentaries on the heroism during United Flight 93, however there have not been as many on the WTC.  This is probably due to the fact that there were so many people and so many stories to be told about what it was like in the WTC towers.    I think this book does an excellent job of putting you into the situation that was facing various people at various times and places in the towers.  You feel the sense of panic, and confusion.  You feel the fear and for some the ambivalence b/c they didn't understand the extent of the damage.  It isn't confusing to switch to different people or different stories the book was well thought out and smoothly transitions.  The book also spends some time talking about the safety features of the towers and about the complications facing the firefighters and police of the day.  I can only hope that lessons were learned from 9/11.    I think this is an interesting book to read and even though you know the outcome you still can't help that maybe, just maybe things will turn out differently.  The book has the list of names of the people who did not survive 9/11 so when you are reading someone's story it is easy to flip to the back to find out what happened to them.  I have to admit each time I looked I hoped beyond hope that they survived even when I knew it wasn't possible.  
 EasyMount's EZLCDP-02 was easy to install and provides a great value for the dollar spent.  My 50" plasma is securely attached to the wall and I doubt an earthquake could dislodge it. While it took careful study of the enclosed instructions to assure I wouldn't make a mistake, my skills and normal homeowner tools were all it took to do the job right. I heartily recommend this product 
 Even though the first release of the soundtrack was better, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this CD. I have loved this movie since I was a child, and I loved the music to it! This is one of those CD's that you never get tired of listening to. Anyone who loves Chitty Chitty Bang Bang must have this soundtrack! 
 As the title suggests the songs all have a soft, swaying, romantic tone. From the first song, "Romantic Dreams", thru the last, "Amor", the whole cd is filled with the type music you would listen to while sipping on a glass of merlot with that special someone 
 Made in 1959, Douglas Sirk's Imitation of Life is still just as evocative and as gorgeous to look today as it was almost 50 years ago. It's a real cinematic treat, shameless tearjerker, and an unabashed melodrama that dares to confront head-on issues of racism and the problems of motherhood at the stage when one's teenagers - in this case daughters--are growing up and preparing to enter the world.  Lana Turner has never looked more ravishing as Lora Meredith, a young New York widow who will do anything to realize her dreams of Broadway stardom. Together with her young daughter Susie, they live in a squalid apartment eking out a hand-to-mouth existence, their futures fuelled by unfulfilled dreams.   One day at Coney Island, Lora and Susie meet another a white girl Sarah Jane, who is being taken care of by a black woman, Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore), whom Lora mistakes for the maid.  When told by her that she's the mother, the surprised Lora falters but then accepts it without a question as if it were a natural thing that a black woman has a white child.   The angelic and virtuous Annie asks Lora if she can come and help out around the apartment. Lora is initially hesitant - not because of Annie's race but because she's struggling and doesn't have any money to pay her a wage. Eventually, however, she relents and tells Annie that her and her daughter can stay for one night.   At the same time, Lora meets the extremely fine-looking wannabe photographer, Steve Archer (John Gavin). Steve takes an instant liking to Lora and offers to marry her. But Lora is far too concerned with realizing her acting dreams to be stifled by a man and by marriage. Meanwhile, the saintly Annie is troubled that her daughter is ashamed of being black and tries to pass herself off in school as white.  Imitation of Life follows these characters throughout their lives, with Sirk piling on the sentiment and melodrama every chance he can get.  Lora does indeed become a famous Broadway actress, yet neglects her growing daughter in the process. Steve goes on to become a president of a large photographic organization, but has trouble relating to Lora's need to be independent and famous.   Annie's heart is eventually broken, gradually worn down by years of emotional abuse from her daughter. Sara Jane is so angry at being labeled as black that she repudiates her mother and ultimately runs away. Annie always stays the subservient and loyal maid; whilst her best friend and employer goes on to bask in a lush and international success. The contrast of the mother's compensations from their conflicting daughters is the story's ultimate paradox.  Lora, Annie, Steve and the two girls seem to be victims of each other. They all want to follow their own dreams and forge their own paths in life even when it doesn't seem to be doing them much good. They are also surprisingly oblivious of how manipulated they are by the world around them.   Lora gets her career but she's unlucky in love and terminally insecure as a mother, Whilst Sara Jane - perhaps the most damaged character - achieves her ambition to pass herself off as a white girl, but at great personal cost to both her and her aging mother.   Under Douglas Sirk's accomplished direction, Miss Turner et al acts ornately and elaborately, everything is over emphasized to within an inch of its life, especially Lana's gorgeous outfits, yet the film - clocking in at over two hours - is always compelling and is never boring.   The screenplay is sophisticated, the themes are brave and tempting and the look of the film - the brilliant surfaces, audacious colors, and the spatial complexities of 50s moderne architecture - bring to the forefront a bittersweet world of fantasy, entrapment, and emotional anxiety, and where the price of following one's dreams eventually comes at a harsh and desultory cost.

 I've recently become interested in French cooking and have purchased several cookbooks.  I especially like this one because of the clear instructions, photos, and the authenticity of the recipes 
 I just finished reading this book for the third time.  That's how many times I had to read it so that I could get through the entire thing without crying.  I never cry about stories in books or movies.  This touched me deeply because I have a very good friend that is going through this right now.  Well, they are somewhere in the middle of the process.    It feels so real that I don't know how M. Keyes could write this unless she went through it or someone very close to her went through it.  Or did she just hit on it by accident?    The story runs two threads at once, which you would expect to be confusing but it isn't.  It's like we get to see little bits of the truth as we are able to handle it, just like Anna is remembering/facing things as she can handle it.  
 My two-year-old daughter loves watching He-Man, and it is sweet nostalgia for me to watch it with her.  These are great, imaginative stories with heart and soul...  Much more than the Japanese, flashy animation of today.  I recommend the He-Man episodes to any parent or fan of the original series 
 I think whoever put this DVD together hates the movie and wanted to torture us with a Fullscreen version just for yuks. All menu and DVD extras (including the 3 sing-alongs) show it in Widescreen but the main movie is in Fullscreen. Why? It's nuts.  Hey I don't know if this has been discussed over the years or not but Albert Finney's Daddy Warbucks voice is an impersonation of director John Huston's. It sounds just like him! Close your eyes during his dialog (especially near the beginning when he's more curmudgeon-like) and check it out.  Everything is great about this DVD except that freaking Fullscreen treatment. WHY DID THEY DO THAT ANYWAY?? 
 Auster's The New York Trilogy is compelling, haunting and a beautiful work of genius. All 3 stories are unique and engaging. Auster is the best modern writer in America. --From the Author of the Cyclops Hammer. 
 This is more of a book on software sequencers' intermediate to advanced techniques on a how to use certain functions which are inbuilt in these softwares. It draws heavily from the sequencer manuals as to how something is to be done which is ok, but the real deal lies in the explanations as to why and when should one use a particular function in respect to midi orchestration. The chapters are graded according to basic, intermediate and advanced techniques, as to how and why certain functions are to be used. The chapter on the "Elements of midi orchestration" gives an insight to the actual musical side of midi orchestration as opposed to the technical aspects, which is a good eye opener for more musical composers and producers, but the detail is limited to instrument ranges and keys, and their practical uses. But considering the fact that actual orchestration needs formal training in great detail, I think that this book does justice on the essential aspects of orchestraing and sequencing effectively in a software environment 
 with a well crafted script, good actors at the heights of their powers and brisk no nonsense direction. Emma Thompson has done better work since but Kenneth Branagh hasn't unfortunately.    Too bad really.  Branagh may still be a pretty good director but I think working with Emma is what lent him an appeal and warmth on screen that he has not been able to recapture. His Hamlet was glossy, chilly, unpleasant and too old.  Nevertheless, I'm grateful that we at least have this, as well as his Henry V and Much Ado About Nothing 
 I'm so happy to see this is back in print!  When I saw an original copy of this book at a library sale I picked it up more for its kitsch/coffee table value than potential insights.  But not only was flipping through this a lot of fun, there is actually a lot of timeless wisdom in the "charm" advice -- basically, treat the people around you with respect and kindness, and they will reciprocate.  There's a lot in here that does NOT fall into the timeless wisdom category, of course, but this material is priceless for its entertainment and historic value.  This book helped me understand where my grandma got some of her ideas.  All in all, I recommend it to anyone with passing interests in social culture, womens studies, the 1930s, and in generally being a nice person.  
 Since the days of "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy" and "The Little Drummer Girl," I've followed le Carre's novels with heightened interest. Of late, however, he's lost me with an unfocused style. I picked up "The Mission Song" with skepticism.  Thankfully, I found here a story of undeniable appeal. The first-person narrator, Bruno Salvador, is an interpreter with an uneven marriage and on secret assignment with the British. His personality is more naive, more humorous and satirical, than most of le Carre's protagonists, lending the novel a lighter tone that still manages to make scathing remarks about western politics. The Bush and Blair administrations both get low marks here, and high-minded, white colonization is shown to be a greedy and violent proposition. Bruno, caught in a tug-of-war between his native allegiances and his British ties, must face the truth and consequences of his assignment. Is one secretive coup really intended for Eastern Congo's good? Or is there a more self-seeking motive behind the financial investment of the nebulous Syndicate?  Although we the readers never really doubt the motives of all involved, it's hard not to be swept along with Bruno's romantic (somewhat thinly drawn) and politic questions. This is a conflict that could relate to African scenarios two centuries ago or a decade in the future. It's a timeless tale, told with unflinching social remarks, while still remaining an entertaining story. Le Carre remembers to treat us as fiction readers, and not simply as a gathering of politicos. Once again, my interest is renewed, and I look forward to his next project 
 I'm a junior in college, and my parents bought this cookbook for me as a gift for my first apartment.  My experience with cooking hasn't really gone past heating up chicken cutlets in the oven, so I was a little wary of using an actual cookbook.  But this book is really useful.  The recipes are varied (snacks, "date-worthy" meals, desserts, healthier cooking, etc.), and there are also a lot of tips that can help out new cooks, be applied to other recipes, or adjust the ones already in the book for less ingredients or quicker preparation.  A couple examples... -Blueberry Muffins:  "Don't have buttermilk?  Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice to 1 cup regular milk and let it sit for a minute before adding the egg." -Creamy Chicken with Noodles:  "To serve the basic sauce in this recipe with other foods, leave out the frozen spinach and experiment with a different combination of seasonings, such as cayenne pepper or a hot sauce for seafood." -Grilled Honey & Garlic Spareribs:  "Don't have a grill?  The ribs can also be baked....[gives instructions].  Baste the spareribs frequently with the honey & garlic marinade during the final 30 minutes of cooking."   In addition, the book provides helpful advice on food safety, how to store leftovers, and cooking terms ('simmer' I know, but 'blanch' and 'dredge' were helpful to have explained).  Some people with more experience in the kitchen might find a lot of this book a little too basic, but I appreciate having instructions on how to hard-boil an egg, or to remember to leave a quarter-inch of potato pulp inside the skin when making stuffed potatoes so that the whole thing doesn't fall apart.  I agree with the previous reviewer that this book is by no means for anyone living in a dorm (though it claims to be).  Maybe some colleges have fully-stocked dorm kitchens and grocery stores right near campus, but this book is definitely better for a student living in an apartment with a kitchen, storage space, and time to make actual meals.  There are definitely certain things about this book that some would consider drawbacks, but for a real first-timer with a kitchen, like myself, this book is perfect 
 I know I'm dating myself, but the 70's was a glorius time to be a teenager who loved rock. I bought "Blank Generation" at the same time as Ted Nugent's "Cat Scratch Fever" and wore them both out. It was the age of the anti-hero & I always thought Richard Hell was the first to put the moniker on our generation by calling it 'blank'. (It's my contention that the symbol 'x' was used to represent 'blank', but sometime in the 80s someone interpreted 'x" literally and thus Generation X was coined instead. ) Well, it only counts that we had Richard Hell, as for the rest, we can take it or leave it each time.  
 I have not read all of this book. I pretty much took a look and read most of the good parts. After seeing the film I took a look again and thought the film was beter by a long shot. What is keeping me from giving it five stars is the use of much profanity, a little overuse of blood (mostly in the last third of the novel), and the very sad ending. All in all, not great, but if you are a hardcore Stephen King fan, I would recomend it. And do check out the 1983 movie by Lewis Teague for it is one of the best Stephen King adaptations ever 
 Don't you hate it when a book description isn't completely accurate?  While I wouldn't necessarily say that's true in the case of Lawrence & Nancy Goldstone's The Friar and the Cipher, it does come very close.  Ostensibly, the book is about the Voynich Manuscript, a document that has never been deciphered and which many believe was written by the noted thinker Roger Bacon, who lived in the thirteenth century.  There has been a lot of controversy about this manuscript and its possible authorship, with many people believing that there's no way that Roger Bacon could have written it, or that it must be a hoax.  It appears to be in some sort of code with strange illustrations in the margins.  And yes, the book does discuss the great debate about this, detailing the many attempts to decode it and the many theories about who might have written it.  Was it all a hoax committed by a friend of John Dee, Queen Elizabeth's trusted advisor, back in the late sixteenth century?  Of course, the problem is that this debate begins on page 223 of the edition I have.  The book runs just over 300 pages, which presents kind of a problem.  The rest of the book is a history of Western thought and the constant struggle between science and religion in the Middle Ages, when the Catholic church was all-powerful.  It gives a very detailed history of Roger Bacon, supposedly to give the background to the debate on the manuscript.  It also details his philosophical adversaries, as well as demonstrating how Europe came out of the Dark Ages due to the rediscovery of some of Aristotle's works.  In fact, the book goes all the way back to Aristotle himself, and his differences with Plato.  All of this is fascinating stuff, and if you're in the mood for a discourse on logical thought and its struggles to get through religious dogma, then this book is definitely for you.  I know I enjoyed it immensely.  I just wish it had been better advertised as such.  It covered a lot of ground that I was slightly familiar with, yet for which I had no real details.  The Saracen empire was stretching into Spain at this point, and many of its scholars were well aware of Aristotle and his ideas of Logic.  In fact, many of these scholars faced their own persecution from conservative Imams and other Moslem leaders, as the Goldstones show us in this book.  As Europeans began to push back against this invasion, parts of Spain were recaptured, and these Moslem studies of Aristotle began to spread over Europe.  The Gladstones do a really effective job in giving this history in a concise, yet detailed format.  I never felt like they were glossing over anything and I found these sections extremely valuable.  If you've studied Western philosophy or the history of the Dark Ages, than this may not be new to you, but I found it intriguing.  The authors then give a short history of the Dominican and the Franciscan orders of the Church, and how opposed to each other they were.  They give the story of Francis of Assissi and how the Franciscans were formed, as well as the Dominicans and their noted scholar, Thomas Aquinas, and they discuss the university system as it existed in Europe at the time.  Then they begin to delve deeply into Roger Bacon's biography.  That's when the focus of the book begins to shift.  However, it doesn't move that far at first.  They use the differences between Thomas' thought and Bacon's to highlight the differences between those using Aristotle's logic and those using Church dogma, and it's a very enlightening section of the book.  Finally, we get to the manuscript itself, and where it may have gone (as it disappears from history periodically).  Unfortunately, this is where the book really begins to drag.  We are given fairly detailed passages on cryptology as many twentieth-century cryptologists try to decode the manuscript.  I found I was much more interested in the discussions on Western thought than I was in the decoding of the manuscript, especially after remembering that nobody has ever solved the riddle.  Some of these stories are interesting, but I found my interest flagging as I read about what happened to these various people.  Which brings me to the ultimate problem with this book and how it was marketed (and even titled).  The Friar and the Cipher is a wonderful book on Western philosophy.  However, there's nothing really new in the book when it comes to the manuscript.  It doesn't take sides in the controversy, only saying that it seems likely that Bacon did write it.  They raise questions, but they don't really provide anything new to anybody who has any knowledge of the subject.  The book seems to be a way to gather a bunch of different sources into one volume, sort of a "this is where we're at" kind of thing.  It also is almost a love letter to Roger Bacon.  They ferociously defend him against any of his critics who claim he wasn't what his fans make him out to be.  He has come in for a lot of criticism over the years, and the Goldstones bring it all up and knock it down.  Who's right and who's wrong is not for me to judge, as this is my first exposure to Bacon.  However, one positive aspect of this defense is that they do acknowledge that the criticism *could* be right, but that it's misplaced.  Bacon may not have been the leading light his fans make him out to be, but it was his methods that made him special, regardless of the ideas themselves.  And perhaps that could be a defense of the book as well.  The Friar and the Cipher may not be as special as it could be regarding the Voynich manuscript, but the method of getting there is extremely well done.  David Ro 
 I've had digital cameras before, but this one is has it all. If you want to take really good pictures of your life then buy this camera. The HP Photosmart M527 6MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom has more features than I'll commonly use , but I think all of them will come in handy in specific settings. Easy to use and great photo quality 
 Military and political pundits often advocate John A. Nagl's excellent book, "Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife: Counterinsurgency Lessons from Malaya and Vietnam", as the definitive source for understanding an insurgency and how to defeat it.  It is often quoted and some have implied that if the US were only to follow the British example in Malaya for our current war on terror--especially in Iraq--we could expect a better outcome.  An interesting historical point is that the British did not manage the insurgency in Cyprus, which occurred at about the same time, in the same manner as Malaya.  As a result, the outcome in Cyprus was completely different from what they had originally envisioned.  James S. Corum's March 2006 monograph for the Strategic Studies Institute of the US Army War College, "Training Indigenous Forces in Counterinsurgency: A Tale of Two Insurgencies", contrasts the Malaya and Cyprus insurgencies in detail.  The important point that comes to mind is that in Malaya the leadership made early mistakes too.  However, Nagl points out that they eventually learned from them and put leaders in place who genuinely understood that the conflict was not primarily a military war, but a socio-political conflict.  The Malaya Emergency was managed as a large-scale policing operation, and their military operations were subordinate to the greater political aims of providing security and justice at the local levels where the insurgents operated.  In the end, the communist terrorists were utterly defeated.  Nagle reminds us that in South Vietnam, the flawed US strategy was ultimately about firepower and technology and implies a hugely significant question for the Bush Administration.    Have they learned these important deeper lessons about insurgency?  The administration and Department of Defense are now talking about their soon to be released field manual on counterinsurgency.  This may be a significant advance as far as the military's role is concerned, but the US government as a whole must apply all of its resources and agencies in a coordinated manner in order to defeat the insurgents.  It must be ready to work with outside resources as well, like the United Nations, non-governmental aid organizations, and religious institutions.   Unfortunately, the Bush Administration, the Secretary of Defense, and the other key leaders have not demonstrated much in the way of flexibility or adaptability.  This ability to learn, along with understanding that insurgency is a war of ideas that relies upon the military being subordinate to local political needs are the key points implied by Nagl's research.  Due to the intensity of the internal conflicts in Iraq that have resulted from US occupation, it appears that a counterinsurgency model by itself may no longer be effective there.  However, the principles of counterinsurgency as described above always apply in any war and it is not too late to apply these lessons in Afghanistan.  This is a great book and I highly recommend it to anyone studying the nature of unconventional warfare.  Matt Rowe, [... 
 I purchased this laptop for my daugher 2 years ago and paid almost double the price.  It was well worth every penny!  Over and above any other education tool I have bought for her, she goes for it first.  When taking long car trips, it goes with her.  Rainy days she can't play outside, she takes it to her room.  Very educational & she has learned a lot, especially with the foreign language tutor (Spanish, French, Italian & Porteguese). It has also helped with her keyboarding skills which are very important at her school.  She loves beating each level and seeing how high she can go.  I hope they develop a new product to match her skill level as she outgrows this one.  A definite must buy 
 Keeps you glued to your seat while Mom reads it to you. Really great book 
 Hunab Ku is eminently readable not only because of its straightforward and lucid prose, but for its clever organization. It consists of short essays on the power and meaning of specific primitive symbols that one finds in various cultures--in art, mythology, and oral tradition-symbols that represent ideas and concepts deeply pertinent to the human condition.     The authors have grouped the symbols and their explanatory essays into seven sections. The essays are accompanied by quotations from philosophers, folklore, and great spiritual texts in human history, as well as invocations inscribed in the ruins of ancient temples.      This is a beautiful book, a compendium of ancient insights and fundamental wisdom that leads the reader to contemplate the profound meaning behind the universe and the life that inhabits it. Although it can be read straight through as a sort of treatise on primitive art, many readers will want to keep it by their sides as a frequent spiritual reference-a well-thumbed guide through life's journey.

 I own 5 other versions of this opera and all have pros and cons.  This performance, though, is almost perfect in every way and the best of the lot.  Well conducted, beautifully sung, a phenomenal Don and the perfect Leporello, the sets, costumes and lighting add to the performance.  The sound and picture are fantastic.  Anyone who likes opera, Mozart or The Met should buy this one 
 I saw a preview to this CD on t.v. and I just had to have it. I had been listening to jazz on the radio for quite sometime, it sounds great all the time, before you go to bed or while you're cleaning your room... Anyways, this CD has the best of all the jazz out there, and it can introduce you to individual jazz artists, and from there your jazz collection can grow 
 If you are intrigued by Raistlin and want to know his detailed story, starting at age 6, this book, along with Book 1, are the books to get. All of the questions I had about him, and even some I didn't know I had, were explained 
 Think and grow rich a black choice is excellent in preparing african americans for success. It doesn't take the reader all the way you will still have to add other books to your library like BLUEPRINT FOR BLACK POWER BY AMOS WILSON and BLACK LABOR WHITE WEALTH to kind of balance out your personality. Let's face it you need to strongly desire your goal like a starving man desires food but desire alone does not guarantee success. You also need to know how to anticipate problems before they come up. You should have at least 3 back up plans. Dont give up on your ultimate goals but just be prepared to take the detour road if you have to 
 My 7 year old enjoyed this book as well as I did.  Edwina teaches the lessons of taking initiatives, trying new things, not giving up after failures, and keeping a good sense of humour (and rhyme) through out.  And on top of it all, Edwina speaks for all mothers who believe their best place is by their babies.  A thoroughly enjoyable read 
 This is an easy read, endlessly entertaining, and perfect.  It's a strong character study and will help one assess family relationships.  Loved the book 
 This is Leslie's third Blues CD in a row starting with Blues to Die For, Blooze, and now Blue Me. For my money the second one Blooze was the best of the bunch, however there is alot here worth giving a listen to. Leslie explores the work of Joplin, Ten Years After, and Humble Pie to name a few. All of this with his signature sound (which I love to hear)The piano work on a number of the tunes works well complementing Leslie's guitar. If you like rock and roll blues with that down and dirty Leslie West feel then you need to add this to your collection 
 The history of public school reform in the United States has been characterized by institutional inertia and myriad failed attempts at wholesale change.  Although policy elites, educators, school pundits, and the lay public regularly disagree about why we have intractable schools, David Tyack and Larry Cuban, in Tinkering toward Utopia, argue that a careful and complete understanding of schools as institutions has long eluded those who attempt to effect change in schools.  The authors also claim that incremental change in education is a natural and viable phenomenon, not a symbol of a failed system.  By rendering these arguments through sociopolitical and historical lenses, they present a comprehensive take on the stagnancy of school reform.        Although the word tinkering can connote clumsiness or incompetence, the authors use it in an equivocal sense in order to argue that educational change for better or worse has been piecemeal, largely due to what they call the grammar of schooling.  Radical reforms, such as merit-based teacher pay and open classrooms, have repeatedly failed to make a lasting impression on schools largely because they have attempted to alter the structural and behavioral regularities that are entrenched in the notion of what constitutes a "real school."  The argument, although effective, is nothing new: Sarason's (1971) illustrative example of the "man from outer space" immediately comes to mind.  However, Tyack and Cuban take this argument to another level by diagnosing many failed reform efforts as "too intramural" (p. 108), and incongruent with external forces (e.g., college admission requirements, labor market needs).      How the grammar of schooling was engendered and why it has remained seemingly immutable is the real thrust of the problem.  Like good scholars, Tyack and Cuban do not ignore political dimensions.  They soundly argue that despite the ostensible claim that centralized governance of schools by experts would forever "take the schools out of politics," technocratic control of schools actually had just the opposite effect in practice, for the act of devolving power to a single group has the word politics written all over it.  Furthermore, the structural regularities that exist today (e.g., age-graded schools, egg-crate classrooms, departmentalized high schools) secured their places in the schooling schema long ago by first gaining the necessary political support, and then by demonstrating that they were efficient and easily replicable.  Crystallized school traditions have essentially become the blinders that prevent the universe of alternatives to be considered.      Tyack and Cuban clearly expose their advocacy of the classroom teacher as a critical change agent.  Their argument is lucid and point-blank: schools change reforms.  "Once the schoolroom door was shut, most teachers retained considerable autonomy to instruct the children as they saw fit" (p. 115).  Unsurprisingly, thwarted attempts to introduce change from the outside were typically ones which grossly misunderstood or failed to take into account teacher perspectives.  The authors describe reforms as blueprints meant to be altered, not followed indiscriminately, and they buttress this notion with empirical evidence detailing how reforms have been tempered, marginalized, or even rejected by teachers.  While careful to avoid the emotional arguments such as the oft-cited teacher-as-unsung-hero plea, they extend a clarion call to empowerment of those who work closer to the front-lines of education.    As a caveat, Tyack and Cuban caution readers not to judge the success of reforms by frequency, longevity, and even fidelity of implementation.  Rather, those who understand the value of local differences and teacher concerns, and more importantly, that schools are simply not "wax to be imprinted" (p. 83) but rather highly dynamic and idiosyncratic institutions, will be best able to wield the elusive wand of change. 
 I remember seeing "Pontoffel Pock and His Magic Piano" when I was very young (I was born in 1982), but haven't seen it in ages and the name of it slipped me for a long time (I always mixed it up with "Oh The Places You Will Go!").  I remember being young and liking the magic piano with the colorful buttons--it was like a player piano--to escape, he would push a colorful button and would fly away on his piano as it played a fanciful tune.  Wow.  I am really well-versed when it comes to obscure Dr. Seuss cartoons--and I love them all.  I had a boss several years ago who was a fan of the Lorax, but I haven't seen this one in years.  Finally I figured out the title!!!!  And I can remember liking this one.  I would love to see it again!! 
 This CD's tracks are a good representation of the post-war Django, after he had been exposed to the emerging be-bop style and phrasing. Here, Django and extraordinary violinist Stephane Grappelli record some of their classics with three Italian jazzmen (piano, bass and brushed snare-drum), providing a somewhat different feel from the sound of his guitar-dominated 1930's Hot Club days.  For "generalist" jazz fans, this CD will give a nostalgic taste of rhythms, textures and sounds of another time - delivered by the best. For Django and Stephane's aficionados, these tracks are a gem. Django's playing is red hot yet polished, crisp and precise, and continues to amaze for the sheer richness of his inexhaustible ideas both as a soloist and an accompanist. Stephane once again proves why he was the indisputed genius of the jazz violin - never missing a beat, a quarter-tone or an opportunity to say something fresh, new and heartfelt.  The all-Italian rhythm section is in style and non-intrusive, allowing the two stars to express themselves to the fullest while providing great steady support. The occasional piano solo is delivered beautifully in a very personal style, with techniques clearly reminiscent of a strong classical background.  Sound-wise, a great effort was made to rid the old recording of white noise and hissing. I am extremely pleased with the result - Django's Selmer guitar and Stephane's magic violin come across crisp and clear.   Listen to "Minor Swing" or "I'll never be the same" if you want to get a chill up your spine. This CD helps understand why Django is, to this day, the most influential jazz guitarist who ever lived 
 This CD features the whole Basie band in exciting ensemble work.  Whirly Bird is amazing, same with One O'Clock Jump, Splanky, and Jumpin' at the Woodside 
 When Darkness Falls (2006) is the third Fantasy novel in the Obsidian Trilogy, following To Light a Candle.  In the previous volume, Cilarnen teaches the Wild Mages how to form a circle merging all of their power.  Idalia uses this technique to attempt a scrying of the situation within Armerthalieh and interrupts High Mage Anigrel in the midst of changing the city wards.  Demon Queen Savilla detects the intrusion and launches an attack on Idalia;  however, Cilarnen and Jermayan shield her and then Ancaladar adds his power.  The attack backlashes on Savilla.  Idalia survives the attack and passes on the information that Anigrel is working for the Demon Queen.  Now the Allies realize the full extent of Savilla's plan:  Armerthalieh is being subverted to assault the Allies.  If this plan is brought to fruition, the Creatures of the Light will not have any chance of withstanding the Endarkened.  In this novel, Jermayan and Ancaladar take on the mission of flying pregnant Elves to the Fortress of the Crowned Horns.  Flying to Lerkalpoldara, they find the city under siege by coldwargs, deathwings, serpentmarae, and other creatures of the Endarkened.  Losses are heavy and increasing, particularly among the herds.  Jermayan clears the Gatekeeper pass and the Lerkalpoldarans flee to safety.  Meanwhile, Kellen is checking out the possibility of converting the Elven jewel mine at Halacira to a fortress for Allied noncombatants.  He takes a third of the Allied forces with him to the site, including all the engineers.  They encounter several villages which have succumbed to the plague.  On their way through the Mystrals, Kellen and Shalkan meet and kill a Shadewalker;  obviously they have discovered the reasons why messengers have not gotten through the mountains.  On the other side of the Mystrals, Kellen meets with Rochinuviel, Vicereign of Ondoladeshiron, and learns that Andoreniel, the Elven King, has the plague.  Kellen sends a message to Redhelwar with Keirasti and four hundred Elven Knights to tell him the bad news and suggests that he bring the Allied armies south as soon as possible.  Jermayan notices Keirasti's force in an overflight and gives her a quick ride back to the war camp.  After overtaking Kellen's troops at Halacira, Jermayan also learns the bad news.  He flies once more to the war camp and returns to Halacira with Idalia, Cilarnen, and about a half ton of books and equipment.  Jermayan then flies Idalia to Sentarshadeen to treat the King.  In this story, Kellen realizes that the Demons are afraid of the combination of High Magery and Wild Magery, which is deadly to the Endarkened.  This combination has already accidentally killed one of the Demons in Stonehearth;  maybe Cilarnen can repeat this result in his work with Wild Mages.  They are certainly going to try to do so!  Although this work spends less time in the City of Mages, it happens not to be the case that the city is ignored in this volume.  The final battle occurs before the city gates and involves some of the city militia and mages.  Nor is the ending too rushed, for it contains all necessary indications and actions.  It is the Endarkened who are rushed and they pay for their oversights.  Highly recommended for Lackey & Mallory fans and for anyone else who enjoys high adventure, shocking revelations and magical research.  -Arthur W. Jordi 
 This book is an amazing explanation of how we as human beings percieve God, and it gives brilliant insights on how to get in closer contact to the true essance of God. I was skeptical of reading this book partly due to the title. "How does Mr. Chopra know how to know God!" I thought. But I was amazed how practicle this book was. Anyone who is serious about knowing the true nature of God should get this. 
 Oh what a great novel this is.  Clancy weaves a tale that is believable and complex, seemingly having thought of every detail.  We get to see a character that is thoroughly engaging, despite the fact that the book touches on such a touchy subject as condoning murder.  As reprehensible as it sounds Clancy is able to make you agree with him.  The book could at times get pretty graphic but I don't think it is gratuitous.  Instead, the detail allows you to feel and see what is happening, as well as let you into Clark's world.  I have nothing bad to say about this book, only good.  I would definitely recommend Without Remorse to everyone.  5 stars 
 The instructions are well written and easy to follow, and the patterns are varied enough that you don't need any other doll patterns.... although I have several of Joan Hinds' other books and they're very good too.  What works for me:  I bought one of those slim less-than-a-dollar slip-in photo albums, and use each photo spot to hold a pattern, alpabetically by piece.  (Actually a copy of the pattern; I don't like to cut up originals)The spine is labeled and it's very neat on my shelf.  Joan Hinds' other books have the pattern pieces numbered; and that's even easier to organize.  I have an album for each book, and numbered each page in permanent ink.  Then each piece was filed in its own little spot, visible, safe, and easily accessed.  I found this more efficient than storing pieces by outfit, because several outfits share pieces.  It took me less than 45 minutes, start to finish, including tracing ALL of the patterns & cutting them out.  Overall, a highly recommended book and series! 
 Like so many topics relating to multiple sclerosis, cognitive challenges are hard to pinpoint because they vary among patients and can be affected by other factors as well, such as age or other neurologic conditions.  I thought the authors have done a good job listing and defining elements of the subject: cognition, the assessment of cognitive changes, treatment, and coping and/or managing strategies.    I must insist that fatigue does effect cognitive abilities.  Most of us with the disease will probably agree that tasks requiring cognitive skills are better fulfilled early in the day or after a period of rest.  More tests of this connection will, I believe, bear out the ideas given here.      This is definitely an important read for MS-ers and those who interact with them 
 Faith Hill when she started till now has always done great albums from country to pop it is all good music - great music shouldn'thave to be labeled (If it makes you feel good and you enjoy it get over the fact of whether it is country, pop, classical, jazz etc. just enjoy the music...and as far as one review of this album goes Faith Hill never went out with Troy Aikmen nor did she make a video with him...it was Lorrie Morgan.....HELLO people in America get with the program folks   
 We've been listening to this one every night for 16months, and we still love it.  The music is beautiful, not cloying or sweet.  And maybe it's just because we don't understand the lyrics, but it doesnt' get tiresome or seem condescending like so much children's music does. Not every song is a winner - there's one that's slightly annoying -- but basically, this is music I'd listen to even if I didn't have twins. Plus, as soon as it goes on my kids start nodding off.  Maybe it's just a Pavlovian response, but hey, whatever works 
 When Detective Milo Sturgis is handed a cold case, he asks his pal Dr. Alex Delaware to help him out. Psychology professor Hope Devane had just written a very controversial best-selling book about gender roles in society when she was brutally murdered three months ago. The assumption was an enraged reader killed her and there are no leads. When Milo and Alex start digging, though, they discover that the good Doctor Devane may have had a secret life and several suspects emerge.  Alex goes snooping again - he never learns. Well, actually, he learns quite a bit - he is so duplicitous - Milo's influence, no doubt. We see quite a bit of Milo in this one, which is always good. We see him trying to be gentle with tiny college girls - not as successful as his attempt to be intimidating to high-priced lawyers. We see him go undercover as a soap opera producer and we see him speeding in his lover's Porsche. (Fun times).  Alex's new house is finally finished and he, his girlfriend Robin and the pooch are moved in. I don't like the new place as much as I did the original - and I think Alex agrees. But there is a studio out back for Robin, so she can work from home now so when all is said and done, it's good to be home.  I did find myself wondering just how Alex figured some of this one out, but I guess once they knew where to look, it was all a matter of public record. The bad guy in this one is a real piece of work, but still, you can't help but feel a certain sympathy. He was a creep before hand, but what was done to him ... shocking. 
 This is a great story. It keeps you on your seat the whole time. Will the house go into the Lake? You can't guess the ending... which is good. Highly recommended 
 This book is excellent.  This book is easier than his previous cook book ("Adventures in Jewish Cooking") but the results are equally as good.  We've tried the meatloaf and the Korean Barbeque thus far, and they have been really, really good to eat.  Can't wait for him to write another book 
 Here Evelyn Waugh savagely satirizes an English couple who "play" at assuming wealth and status. Tony Last imagines (goes through the motions) of being a country squire at his feudal estate Hetton Abbey; he becomes so enamored in this that he fails to notice that his totally bored wife Brenda is having an affair with the vacuous John Beaver. When he finally wakes up to the situation, Tony, unable to face it head on, flees England for the jungles of South America where he is eventually taken prisoner by a half-lunatic trader who forces him to read Dickens to him for the rest of his life.    Part farce (the scenes with Tony in South America) but mostly cutting satire, Waugh attacks those people who have the outward signs of good breeding but who lack any inner moral decency that would make them respectable members of society. Tony, like a child following the tenets of a romantic hero, does all the things he believes a country squire must do - only they are meaningless rituals and empty of any significance. Brenda's selfishness and lack of moral bearing are illustrated with her abandoning Tony for the unscrupulous wastrel Beaver. The most biting attack on her character occurs when she hears that "John" has been killed; when she realizes the name refers to her own son and not to John Beaver, she is relieved and takes it as proof of her love for Beaver. Waugh also attacks the English divorce system, which results in a scathingly funny scene involving another woman planted in Tony's bed to "prove" infidelity. Waugh's satirical barbs are leveled with gentle and impassive blows, which only add to their effect. It's a masterful performance, a funny and devastating novel. 
 I started personal development about 3 years ago. I continued to look for something that would help me find my (WHY) what do I want where do I want to go and how do I do this? I wondered if anyone had something a new or simple person could understand. I was introduced to the Passion Test by a friend and It has been the best, step by step how to put your goals in place and brings out what you are most passionate about. I recomend this book to everyone who is looking to pull out that most inner goal. 
 This book is very timely as the conditions of the economies of China, India and the US is on alot of minds these days. I found the author's ideas interesting and thought provoking but I found them puzzling at times. 1)  The author repeatedly states that the rest of the world generates real wealth by producing more than they consume.  Why then in his chapter of recommendations does he encourage Europe, Japan and China increase their levels of consumption in order to stimulate their economies(even going as far as recommending a housing boom for Japan!!!)?  Exactly what level of consumption to production is required for worldwide growth? 2)  The ratio of public debt to GDP is much lower in the US than for Japan.  How is this possible when Japan has followed the very recommendations that the author wants the US to adopt.  Japan produces more than it consumes, encourages savings over spending, it's government supports and directs economic pursuits and yet Japan imploded a decade ago and is still feeling the after-effects and yet the US economy has steadily grown over that time period. 3)  Since the author states that the point of savings is to provide the money for investments which drive economic growth, why does it matter if people bypass a savings account and directly put their money into mutual funds, stocks or any other form of investment?  The author repeatedly states that savings in US are near zero but doesn't take the overall effect of investments into account. 4)  Since China and Japan have vast dollar holdings, how would they emerge better than the US from a dollar devaluing as the author proposes?  Their dollars would then be worthless and the US (The world's consumers) would be unable to purchase their excess production. 5)  The author states that the US government is clueless as to what  companies and industries are crucial to the growth of the US economy.  Yet later, he states that CEOs weild incredible power and influence due to their lobbies.  How did the US economy lose so much market share in certain industries when CEOs, who according to the author are more powerful than many national leaders, could easily have influenced the US Government to support their endeavors.  The author cites Boeing, US computer and software industry and the failure of the US to develop and produce VCRs decades ago and blames the government's lack of support and funding for their decline/demise 
 Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean people still aren't out to get you... 
 Purchased as a gift for an all time super fan of Springsteen. He loved the book. A must have for any Springsteen fan 
 RE: Previous review stating "Thomson is also not bashful about leaving out important contributors to cinema to include seasonal celebrities that were mostly popular in the early nineties". This title was originally published in 1975, then reprinted in the U.S, as hardback in 1976 and paperback - 1979. One should hardly fault the author for not including personalities who would experience their fame 10-20 years into the future 
 Since most reviews are about the item itself I would first like to say that collecting SW merchandise for close to 30 yeras is my top priority. Those of you who also collect will find that for a short but good story book adventure for part V "The Empire Strikes Back", still brings the magic from Sir George Lucas to the small literature side of Sci-Fi adventure for all ages. I am not only saying this because I love the Star Wars Saga, but to be able to see that when kids re-inact the story means that they have read it, processed it and found it fun enough to act it. Those of you growing up in the 70's know what I mean. Now this new generation will never forget the experiance of being able to read a great sci-fi movie and sit back and say !!!WOW!!! this is great and can't wait for the next book to read!! "May The Force Be With Us All"   
 Exodus (the movement of JAH People) was time magazine's album of the century, that should say enough right there. But if you are not convinced buy it and you will be for sure. This album was released in 1977, and was recorded in London England. Bob Marley and members of the band survived an attempted assination in December of 1976, and went into self imposed exile in London. Here the creativity of the band is quite good, and many of the Songs that you know by Bob Marley and the Wailers appear on this disc. Jamming, Exodus, One Love, Three Little Birds, and Waiting In Vain. All the tracks are great on this disc and you can hear for the first time in all of the Wailers recordings that the quality of the recording equipment here is much better. The dummer's (Carlton Barrett) high hat never came through so clear. This album marks the intro of Junior Marvin (lead guitar)to the band. The band was about to gain superstar status and this album marks the beginning. The second disc features some live tracks from the 1977 tour and the songs slected for the release happen to be from the 1977 Rainbow theater concerts, which will also be availble on dvd very soon.  The live performances really come through and prove that the band has a tremendous vibe live and that while in concert they most certainly bring their best.  the Lee Perry tracks are rather rare and are very nice to listen to.  the booklet that comes with the cd can provide more insight into them and how they came to be, but just know that it is not the Wailers backing Bob on them, rather musicians from other bands. At the end is a Bob Marley promotion of the album for radio which is really nice to hear.  If you are questioning yourself about this set or the single disc edition, this set offers a more diverse selection, and the bonus tracks and bonus disc are really a great addition tot he album of the century 
 For those who are still existing under the misapprehension that Wal-Mart is a benign gentle giant, "The Wal-Mart Effect" is a startling expose.  For those of you already blown away by Fishman's revelationary Fast Company article, "The Wal-Mart You Don't Know," the book is not so much an expose as a calm-gone-turbulent ride downstream. At first you're drifting along, enjoying the still waters of Wal-Mart's earnest inception and formative years, soaking up the founder's sunny aspirations and the company's refreshing consumer-oriented mission and then before you know it, an oppressive darkness has enveloped you, a raging storm has rolled in, and you find yourself spinning helplessly in a cyclone at the edge of a 50-foot drop, trying to keep your head above water and find a way to get off. At book's end, you are no longer asking "How did we get here?" but rather "How do we get out?" and "Where do we go from here?"  In true journalistic form, Fishman takes painstaking efforts to present a balanced account, outlining the positives of Wal-Mart's effect--its cost savings for consumers, its distribution and packaging genius, its humble, no-frills headquarters and persona, and its even, unbiased expectations for all of its suppliers. But it is Fishman's disclosure of how Wal-Mart now achieves its low-price policy--the wave after wave of personal story after personal story of the struggling U.S. manufacturers and suppliers, their wage-starved or pink-slipped employees, bankrupted ethical competitors, tax-deprived towns, and overburdened social agencies wrecked in the Titan's tempestuous wake--that is the book's true mark of greatness.  Like a Steinbeck novel, The Wal-Mart Effect is profound in its simplicity. Fishman demonstrates an uncanny ability to make clear that which should already be obvious, but isn't; you open your eyes and say "How did I not see this before?!"  By focusing on Wal-Mart and the mentality it embodies, Fishman shines a brilliant spotlight on our American values--bargains over jobs; excess over ethics, the golden calf over the stony tablets.  If knowledge is power, "The Wal-Mart Effect" is Herculean in its potential to turn back the tide of American blind allegiance to low price at any cost. 
 In a field where back biting is the rule and many scholars simply dismiss the writing of their opponents out of hand, William Dever stands out for his careful critiques of the theories of those with whom he disagrees.  As with his other works, Prof. Dever engages in a point by point refutation of those who differ from his positions.  At the same time, as in previous works, he reveals the political/ideological motivations of many other scholars.  Doubtless, many readers will wish to see this as a political work, but in fact Professor Dever's theory, that the Israelite tribes evolved from displaced Canaanites who merged with other marginal groups would please few ideologues.  Perhaps that is because his primary interest remains constructing a cogent theory that fits with the available data?  Of particular note, Professor Dever does an excellent job synthesizing anthropological and archeological evidence to craft his thesis.    In a few places professor Dever does fall short.  While he does a good job demonstrating how Biblical and archeological data do and don't mesh, his textual analysis on issues such as the bible writers knowledge of Egyptian names seems occasionally lacking.  Still, his easy writing style and crisp prose offer an enlightening and entertaining read for those interested in the subject.   Those of an ideological bent may find much in this book to upset them, but those seeking knowledge will be glad they picked it up.   
 I actually owned and read a much earlier version- listened to the advice- set up my 'Traveling Medical Kit'- and really appreciated the clear and concise medical information- and NOW- an updated  version- many new ideas interspersed with time-tested procedures and meds- If you spend any time at all in the 'boondocks'-or just travelin'- You need a copy of this book- >and get copies for your kids too-when they get out on their own! This manual is good, practical and will prove itself in the reading of it- and  putting into practice it's wisdom- That Dr Forgey- he's something else! 
 This fine film has many stories - one might be the story of individualism versus society where the former is represented by two blackmailing men out to make a dollar and the latter represented by a woman and her three children and absent Navy husband maintaining a family. But the strongest and most interesting one to me centres on the journey the handsome character played by Goran Visjnic makes from criminal to something of a rdeeming figure when he cannot effectively carry through the task assigned to him by his partner in the blackmailing strategy they have devised.  With an excellent music score, strong design characteristics, fine acting by all concerned, this is a very fine film indeed worthy reviewing from time to time 
 Hard To Earn is by far my favorite Gangstarr album of all(even better then Daily Operation AND close to 2nd Moment of Truth).  Guru is just sick when he spits out some of his classic lines like in "Tonz O' Gunz" when he spits lines like "Check your nearest overpopulated ghetto/they greet you with a pistol/not trying to say hello".  And Premier?  BETTER THEN EVER, You thought his production on the last 3 albums where good this is just pure FLOW-goin'!  Not one track bites(sept for maybe track 10), but other then that the production sound in this album is A+ Material.  Not only do Guru and Primo bring it up to the plate with tracks like "Sucka Mc needs a bodygaurd" but they also can take a notch when they bring out some gritty yet dope guests like Nice N' Smooth, ughhhh just everything in this album is dope, dope dope, now lets get to it..     2. ALONGWAYTOGO - 10/5!!!! 3. Code Of The Streets - 10/5!!!! 4. Brainstorm - 5/5   5. Tonz 'O' Gunz  10/5!!! 6. The Planet  - 5/5 7. Aiiight Chill...  N/A but an extreamly dope filler  8. Speak Ya Clout - 10/5! 9. DWYCK  - 5/5 10. Words From The Nutcracker - Lyric wise-1/5, beatwise-10/5!! 11. Mass Apeal  - 10/5!!! 12. Blowin' Up The Spot  5/5! 13. Suckas Need Bodyguards   10/5!!  HOW DID THIS NOT MAKE GREATEST HITS, I STILL DONNO WHY?!!  14. Now You're Mine - 10/5!!   15. Mostly Tha Voice  5/5 16. F.A.L.A.  - 10/5!! 17. Comin' For Datazz -5/5!  Well there you have it, cop this album, its freaking amazing, so many standouts, ugh im gonna shut up now COP IT PYCE OUT IN B-R DOUBLE "O" K-lyn the PLANET   Final score 5/5 stars 
 I purchased this book for myself and subsequently for two others who had an incurable disease.  It is Bible based, uplifting and a rewarding read.  I will read it again and again 
 Yet another masterpiece by Hesse. His keen insight into human nature and his truth seeking passion takes Hesse and his readers deep into the dualities of man and his struggle with himself. A brilliant work of fiction  where Hesse, the mystic, draws his inspirations and his ideas from a wide  range of topics; from world history to mythology and beyond the world of  pure senses. Hermann Hesse at his best in the quest of superlative man and  at the same time deeply conscious of the inherent limitations of human  nature 
 Spectacular!  Book 3 continues to draw the reader (or listener) through the world that SK is so universally known to weave 
 This is the second movie in the fox and the hound series. Just to inform even though on the back of the box it say this is a heartwarming sequl that is half correct. This movie was shoot after the first fox and the hound came out but is not a sequel. This movie is actually a midquel. Meaning the events in this movie takes place inbetween the begining of the first movie when tod and coper are kids and the end of the movie when they are full grown adult animals. Due to some very brief action sequences I recommend this is to ages 7 and up. The story of tod and copper continues when copper is chosen to join a band of singing strays. Will tod adjust to be coppers servants. Will the jealous female ex singer of the band pull apart the friendship between the young dog and the fox find out in the heartwarming conclusio 
 This book blew my mind..the writing is clear and the ideas are exciting.  I thought it would be my summer read - but I was done in a few weeks -- I couldn't put it down. The book gives weight to the psychological, historical, philisophical and sociological aspects of the subject in a balanced and well presented format.  It is a delightful read..complex without being dry for a minute.  I highly recommend this book 
 Professor H. W. Brands is now prolific enough to be considered one of our nations best researchers and writers of American history.  He certainly does it well with The Age of Gold.  Perhaps what he does best, and is most difficult to do, is to integrate this great migration into a much larger historical context of US Expansion, the growing divide of slavery, statehood, transportation and economics.  All of this while concurrently writing both anecdotely and empirically on a migration from both the Eastern United States and overseas toward California in search of gold and fortune.  Brands follows several people, both historically known and historically "insignificant" in their arduous and dangerous journeys with details that, while historically accurate, are candidly quite chilling.    Anyone interested in this period of history should enjoy this book.  It is important to note that Brands could have had many subtitles as many topics where covered.  This book, while focused on the great gold rush, certainly covers other topics in an appropriate fashion.  And unlike some historical narrative writers, Brands does not dumb-down his prose.  If H. W. Brands takes the time to write something, and he has written a lot with more to come, all students of history should take the time to read it.  It is always like taking a full course in history and coming away really loving the professor.  This is one great read 
 This is one of the most intelligently written books on this subject I have enountered in many years. Mr. Sargent presents a practical and historical approach to the Guardian Angel that instantly appeals to both the beginner and advance student 
 Does anyone Know who sings the song when Jenny gets stood up Rick at the restruant 
 Yet again, Travis Meeks takes on new musical ground and power. The red album has to be the best album by Travis.  Absolutely beautifully done.  Plus, Travis plays everything on "Giving In" (one of the stronger songs on the album).  He plays percussion and such on Dancing In The Wind, along with his usual acoustic and electric guitars on all the tracks.  I cannot understand the harshness and bitterness of the one- and two- star reviews.  This album far exceeded my expectations, honestly:  After the Yellow Album, I expected more acoustic grunge, reminiscing (sp?) in the styles of Alice In Chains, Nirvana, latter Pearl Jam, etc.  Not that I would have been disappointed by it.  I loved the Yellow Album, and every track on it.  However, the Green Album blew me away completely.  It had what I expected to a point, but so, so much more.  It had a new bent.  Techno, orchestral, and slightly classical.  So I expected, with the next album, more of that.  That's what I got, but it went way beyond what I thought I would hear.  I did not expect the heavy opening of Hang on to This.  That was a shock in and of itself.  This song pushed the electric side.  However, it was incredible how Travis still managed to keep the most important instrument of the song the acoustic guitar even when the electric hit the front here.  The we go through Fighting w/ Clay and Days in our Life.  Neither are fillers.  Both are absolutely incredible and are truly inspired.  But then we get to what is the second masterpiece on this album, Die Born.  This is such a great song.  the lyrics are positive, talking about standing strong in the face of all problems, even death, as it were.  The instrumentation here is absolutely beautiful, the acoustic picking is incredible, and Travis's vocals on here are uplifting, to say the least.  The Best of Life, another incredible song, about life and wanting only the best.  Again, great instrumentation, and the acoustic guitar here is in the forefront again.  Dirty Road, Where Are You, and Never Drown, are, I guess, the "radio hits" Travis was forced to put on by the label.  And even though he must have been constricted by this, he still delivered three masterpieces in these again inspired and incredible compositions.  Words, an awesome song, comes next.  This is the song that garnered the explicit labels lyrics.  One of the lyrics here is "well what the f***."  Although, to be honest, I can't understand the explicit lyrics label for a couple instances of the f-word (maybe in the 40's or 50's, but now?), but, hey, they've slapped the label on entirely instrumental albums, so what can you do?  Then we get Once Again and Giving In, again musical masterpieces.  Not fillers, just strokes of incredible brilliance from a musical genius.  And finally, we have what I would say is Travis's Opus.  Just Like Jim Morrison had "The End," Travis Meeks has "Dancing With The Wind."  It's incredible.  Brilliant.  Really, you have to hear it to understand, because words can't really express the sheer brilliance of this song.  I have converted tons of people to DOTN just by this masterpiece alone, and I do honestly believe it will be impossible to top, just like "The End" was impossible to top.  This song I could listen to over and over and never tire of it.  The power, the voice, and the strength of this song, I think, culminates every song that came before from all three albums, as well as Travis himself.  What I wouldn't give to see it performed live with full backing band, orchestra, choir, and all.   And again, I can't wait for the Purple album.  The label is slowing down the release?  Why do you need a label?  Do what Zeppelin did (Swan Song) and create your own.  The label doesn't want to sponsor you, Travis, then forget them (obviously I have a much harsher word in mind but, you get the idea...).  You don't need 'em.  Maybe it's just my stupidity when it comes to things like this, but it seems to me you can release it just fine either without a label or under the Independant label.  You're brilliant, Travis.  If labels can't figure that out, it's their loss.  Don't let it be yours 
 This was a good book of Helen and her life in rural Alabama. Being from Alabama myself I have visited her homeplace and it was nice to see where she grew up. I recommend this book for school students and anyone wanting to know more about Helen Keller and her life 
 Many actors want to take a turn at directing and some do quite well. Witness Clint Eastwood and UNFORGIVEN. Then there is Billy Bob Thornton who wrote and directed SLING BLADE. Mr. Thornton plays a mentally retarded man who wacked his mother and her lover to death with a type of grass-cutting tool called a "sling blade". After serving his term in the "nervous hospital", Mr. Thornton's character is released to fend for himself. Back in his home town, he finds a job fixing small engines and winds up staying with a woman and her son. Dwight Yoakum does a fine acting job as the woman's abusive boyfriend. John Ritter is funny and sweet as a gay store owner in a small town. Look for Robert Duvall in a cameo role. This viewer was just awed by Mr. Thornton's excellent portrayal of the mentally challenged man. A bit of an emotional downer but five stars for an all-around good script, good acting and good directing 
 The mysterious candy maker ''Willy Wonka'' is hiding five golden tickets in his famous ''Wonka Bars''. The children lucky enough to find  these tickets will be taken on a tour (hosted by Mr. Wonka himself) of the enormous Wonka factory. The world is searching frantically for the tickets, and the first person to find one is ''Augustus Gloop'' a greedy German boy is addicted to chocolate. The second ticket finder is ''Veruca Salt'' a spoiled little girl who quite literally gets everything she asks for, no matter how absurd her request is. The person who discovers the third ticket is ''Mike Teave'' an irritable boy obsessed with TV. ''Be quiet'' he tells whoever is foolish enough to ask him a question while his show is on ''THIS is the life''. ''Violet Beauragrde'', a dimwitted gum chewing girl finds the fourth ticket, (she had to give up gum-chewing for a while so she could switch to chocolate. And the title character ''Charlie Bucket'' finds the fifth and final golden ticket which was quite a miracle, considering how poor his family was and how little money they had to spend on luxuries such as candy. This motely crew of children are allowed to discover the wonders of Mr. Wonka's factory.  CHARLIE AND THE CHOCLATE FACTORY has delighted imaginative readers of all ages, and will contiue do so for years to come.  
 We each have our conceptions of how the west was in that period when America was coming into itself, and the American or newly minted immigrant, with all his ideals and aspirations, was exploring hitherto unconquered frontiers in search of wealth and opportunity. This is a somber work, and for that reason, refreshing and real.   Blue is a leader of sorts, also kind of a coward, but human in all respects. He rises and falls with the town he exists in. He ekes out a position of modest respect, while also inciting a level of revilement in those with whom he desires closeness. He is in a way a tragic character, but fully human. The Bad Man of Bodie is the dark force of evil in the story, hovering around ready to destroy the meager gains that Blue and his fellow settlers find. One senses Blue's disappointment and self-loathing in his recounting of the rise and fall of the inconsequential town and a rueful sense of what could have been, personally and socially.   This was a very entertaining read; thoughtful, subtle and as satisfying as a cold beer on a hot day 
 I am telling you if u have never read any of gary larson's books or comics, you have to start right now. The things are just pure genius i tell you. I mean some you wont get until you got and read them over but that is the beauty of these things. Haiya if u dont have any buy one today and see what i'm talking about. This is one the best buys u could have 
 I haven't finished it yet but this is a great historical and biblical account of Evangelism in the Early Church.  It brings you back to the bare and pure simplicity of what all believers have been called to do. This is an absolute must for any disciple 
 When every child turns 16 in this country they should be required to read this book. I can't think of any other book that hit me so hard in the gut. Each page was a revelation, a call to humanity. MLK wasn't a saint but he was such a deeply focused, powerful person that his influence will be felt as long as this species roams this earth. Every chapter is perfectly put together, cohesive and augmented by personal papers, speeches, etc. the Editor knows his subject and it shows in the way the book, the story is organized. Simply inspirational. 
 It's kind of ironic because this album is my first Stevie Wonder CD I've bought. But now that I know what I was missing, I don't want it to happen to other people.  Let me list some of the BEST songs that this disc is missing - Isn't She Lovely - Golden Lady - As - Send One Your Love - Ribbon In The Sky - Visions - Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing - Lately - You Will Know etc.  I'm pretty sure there are people who think those missing songs can make up a better collection.   So don't even bother with this one and save money for the Box Set and "Natural Wonder", the LIVE album.  13 bucks was well worth for me to be introduced to the greatness of Stevie Wonder. So I don't regret anyway. 
 What a great bargain and a useful purchase!  It works perfectly, is easy to clean, and can handle a lot of food.  I just finished working on an annual multiple all-day, all-night college student event to raise scholarship money, and we're always looking for inexpensive and creative ways to keep them fed.  We've used a charcoal grill for years, but this time I added this griddle.  It was a big hit.  At night it was cold outside, but all I needed was 5 loaves of bread, a tub of soft butter, some garlic powder, a huge package of cheese slices and I was set.  This griddle made a ton of perfect grilled cheese sandwiches without causing a mess. (Note: using real butter and garlic powder allows you to use the cheapest bread and cheese and still have them taste great).  In the morning, it was fried eggs, pre-cooked bacon strips, cheese and kaiser rolls for incredible egg-on-a-roll breakfasts (with just some cooking spray).   Fun to use.  Great food.  Great bargain 
 For those of you who are not familiar with Neu!,they're a duo from Dusseldorf,Germany. Neu! is made up of two outstanding guitarists Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother.The two created three cosmically wonderful ground breaking lp's between 1971-75.This is their self-titled debut originally put out in 1971.'Neu!' starts off with "Hallogallo",that's ten solid minutes of pure brain floating magic.Some weird sound effects and monitored feedback are combined in "Sonderangebot".Then there's "Weissensee" that is TRUE progressive krautrock."Im Gluck" is seven minutes of more superb feedback with sound effects of water and seagulls nearby,unreal!"Negativland" tends to show case Neu's industrial side.Needless to say,a brilliant lp and that was produced by the legendary record producer Conny Plank.Totally ignore the rather primitive cover art.As it turns out,Neu! has been an influence on several of today's artists such as Stereolab,Sonic Youth,late '70's David Bowie,Red Hot Chili Peppers and Johnny Rotten.Highly Recommended 
 Nora Roberts never disappoints her readers. Her books are filled with humor, romance, intrigue and, in this case, a little bit of the supernatural. Loved this book, and the subsequent books in the series. I'd recommend all three. Roberts presents a story with strong women as the main characters and lets us follow them through their own insecurities and their own personal challenges. It's a great journey for the readers to experience 
 By the time I was about 5 chapters into Invisible Heroes, I had begun to strongly recommend it to friends, students and clients.   I'm certain that, where both physical and emotional healing are concerned, this is one of the most important and valuable books written in the last 20 years.  And I'm confident that value holds whether the reader is a trauma survivor, a psychotherapist, a medical practitioner or an interested member of the general public.  Belleruth Naparstek writes with compassion about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Equally important, she explains SIMPLY and EASILY what the latest medical diagnostics reveal about how our bodies' own biochemical and psychophysical responses can lock in PTSD in ways that just talk therapy or just drug intervention can't sufficiently overcome.    Most importantly, Naparstek offers very specific information about how, and why, guided imagery can be a functional, healing intervention to support the hard work of OVERCOMING PTSD.  And she provides a series of guided imagery scripts, developed through extensive work with private clients, 9/11 survivors and VA Hospital trauma groups, among others.  The scripts can be used on their own, or in concert with counseling and medical intervention.  This book is GOLD!  It provides a functional path through hell into healing.  If I could afford to, I'd send copies to the 100 people I care about most. And to every VA Hospital, domestic violence center, homeless shelter and free clinic in America.  And I'd be grateful to be able to do it.            
 Navajo Police Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn is challenged once again in this unique mystery, another masterpiece from Tony Hillerman. 
 I needed a quick way to ramp up on VBScript for work and have a lot of programming experience so did not want a dummy type book. Great coverage of basics on the language. Only beef is would have liked to see more on how to use ADO and DAO with databases like Oracle and SQL Server 
 My husband borrowed this book from the library, but he liked it so much that I bought it for him on his birthday and he loved it, because he can keep it and refer to it anytime (it was very difficult to get it from the library due to its popularity) 
 This was a great fun read for the beach.  I loved all the characters in this book.  This book was fun, witty and had lots of action in it.  It is a great intro to the Plum series. It makes you want to get the next one in the series right away. If your looking for a fun very fast read look this one up, you will not be disappointed.   
 With all the great names associated with this movie, this is one that when ever it played on TV, I felt it a sure addition for my personal collection 
 This book is a must for all beginners moving into the world of management, and I highly recommend it as a refresher course for those of us who have been doing it for a while. I do not have an MBA, but I do have a number of years' real-world experience in management, and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is very light and easy to read, and although much of it seems like it should be common sense, there are a number of things that are easy to forget, and it's worth the refresher. I skipped some chapters because they were too basic, but I probably read 2/3 of the book (in the matter of a business trip) and actually did learn some new information 
 The history of the everglades is fascinating. I would recommend strongly to anyone interested in the Everglades. 
 Cliff Jacobson is one of the authors of a great series of camping books called the "Basic Essentials". He is popular because he writes in a homey accessible style that gets you interested in the subject and teaches you in simple terms anyone can grasp. In the series are books on camping basics, cooking outdoors, map and compass, shelter, weather, canoeing, fishing, first aid, and more. They are great little library to have but if you can't afford them all, buy this one for all the basics. Cliff has put together a book that has information from all of these and a little more. Some of his "secrets" are really helpful tips you may have heard before if you are an experianced camper, but you can bet there will be some new ones too. An all around great resource for the experianced or rookie camper, I highly reccommend. 
 Excellent. The best book I have seen on the subject 
 An absolute classic. Anyone who negatively criticises this album certainly doesn't understand the concept of melody or harmony. In the guitar world there's good noodling and bad noodling - this is a masterpiece, the perfect balance of technique, melody and soul. The end of the shred genre came about with the 90s pop/punk movement - those who "sucked and were proud of it"... It was actually a good thing - it filtered out alot of fret w*nkers as the guitar scene was very watered down.. Vai wannabes, Satch, Van Halen wannabes... the list goes on - BUT the good players also got a rap in the process. Nevertheless the true players are still going strong and have never sold out regardless. Vai is one of them... If you don't understand this album I urge you to give it another listen or two. Every note counts..   
 Ms. Biafore has taken a subject which can certainly be incomprehensible, and created a manual that is not only readable, but understandable as well.  My company has nothing to do with financial information, but I certainly wouldn't be able to function without Quickbooks, and now, Ms. Biafore has given me the ability to work quickly through the items requiring my attention, check things that might bite me later, and move on to my primary function, finding ways to make money for the company.  Thanks 
 The great writing skills of James B Stewart can be enjoyed in all of his books and certainly also in this one. He book reads almost like a thriller, but it is always clear that Stewarts has his facts right and well documented and got the criminals dead to rights.  The book is structured as the first part being seen from the side of Boesky, Milken etc and the second part from the law enforcement, which is another feature that makes it very exiting to read 
 Loved the extensive amount of information from UFO's and other mysterious happenings....good rea 
 This book paints a picture on the birth and growth of osteopathic medicine in the United States.  It illustrates the successes, disappointments, and the many trials that osteopathic medicine has endured since its inception.  Additionally, it gives the reader an insight into the influence of the American Medical Association and M.D.'s in general.  I think that this is a must read for future M.D.'s and D.O.'s alike because it provides a tremendously well written description of these physicians.  
 'The Heart of a Woman' is as extraordinary as its author. A brilliant lady who overcame incredible odds to make life for others, especially woman, a place where they did not have to feel like "second clas citizens" 
 Note: This review refers to the book "Her Stories" and NOT "Second Cousins," though for some reason reviews of both books appear on both product pages.  "Her Stories" is a delightful collection of nineteen stories from African American culture, retold by award-winning author Virginia Hamilton. The stories are divided into five categories: Her Animal Tales, Her Fairy Tales, Her Supernatural, Her Folkways and Legends, and Her True Tales. Each story focuses on a female, African American protagonist, and is about 3-4 pages in length. Hamilton's writing is vivid and colorful, yet remains simple enough that younger readers should have no trouble. The stories would also be great to read aloud. While Hamilton has translated the tales into contemporary language for easier understanding, she leaves a few conventions from Creole, Gullah, and other forms of speech that are best read aloud for full effect.  The book is also a great study in African American literary and oral tradition, and is suitable for adults as well as children. Each story is followed by commentary from the author, providing the history of the tale, how it reflects African American heritage, explanation of any unusual aspects of the story, and any additional points of interest. Some of the stories are based in history, and others are entirely ficitonal. Some bear likenesses to more familiar tales as well - "Catskinella" is an alternative form of the popular Cinderella story, and "Little Girl and Buh Rabby," comes from the tradition of Brer Rabbit stories.  "Her Stories" is also beautifully illustrated, bringing out the best in each tale. At the end of the book Hamilton has included some reflections on her own childhood, and how her mother influenced her decision to compile stories about strong African American women. This book is perfect for anyone, young or old and of any culture, interested in reading traditional folklore 
 There are no simple dualities in this story.  Things don't simply stack up in white vs. red conflicts.  McNickle has created a cast of white and Indian characters who line up across the spectrum of "purely"  Indian and "purely" white.  The motivations of each character are  complex and frought with cultural misunderstandings, good intentions, and  understandable anger and frustration.  This is a novel about the  complexities of understanding across cultures and languages, and a warning  against the failure to do so 
 This is a very popular and well written text on logistic regression. The topic is very useful to biostatisticians. Hosmer and Lemeshow have taught some short course out of the text which have been well received. The authors are knowledgeable and thorough. The book is very much oriented toward real applications and does not require advanced mathematics 
 Don't let the cover fool you, this is a really great book, easy reading.   Written in plain English, not clinical or overly scientific.  Taught me  alot of things I wasn't aware of before and will use in caring for my  kitty.  I now look at my kitty differently and watch his body language with  new insight. I would recommend it for all cat owners especially first time  owners 
 The human institution known as Lord Whimsy is tooo brave, too refined, too insightful for this epoch. A man of wit/ charm/ taste; Who could have predicted his astonishing insights amongst the garbage heaps peddled by the Amazon Empire? Huzzah! B-b-b-buy it 
 This book has a lot of great principles for taking action today and making your tomorrow better 
 I didn't think you could do another psychological drama that was that new or different about people who overcome buried emotional problems, finally face their repressed and dysfunctional pasts, and now have a chance for a better life, but Streisand managed it with this film based on the Pat Conroy novel. But Nick Nolte in the lead role must overcome the demons from his own parents' upbringing as well as another terrible secret still hidden in his own unconscious. In addition to Streisand's capable direction, the film wouldn't have been possible without Nolte's superb (and possibly best) performance, who really carries most of the film on his capable shoulders. I'm also reminded of Nolte's role in the later movie, "Damage," where he played another tormented, dysfunctional character, but unlike in this film, that character never confronts his demons and goes into an apparently inexplicable downward spiral. Overall a fine film and a surprisingly good cinematization of the original novel 
 Outlaw Mountain continues the story of Joanna Brady, sheriff of Cochise County, Arizona. I have to admit that I've read all seven books in this series and it continues to be one of my favorites. The characters are well developed, plots are well thought out, and the books are just plain fun and exciting. Another plus, at least for me, is that the main character of Joanna Brady is not perfect - she's a struggling, working mother who goes through so much that is familiar territory for the rest of us, it makes her character very believable and identifiable.   As always in this series, we are once again taken to Bisbee, Arizona in Cochise County. For those that are unfamiliar with the Arizona region, Bisbee is an old mining town that's within driving distance to Tucson. The background and details given on this small town, from the surrounding landscape down to details about the Copper Queen Hotel has made it intriguing to the point that I want to vacation there - I have to see this area first hand! The fact that J.A. Jance can encourage this type of "want" is testimony to her fantastic ability as a writer.  Jance captures the reading audience from the very beginning with the murder of an elderly woman in a gruesome manner. Now don't get me wrong, most murders are gruesome, but the details that Jance uses make it so - the details aren't gory or bloody, but they do leave a lasting impression on the reader. This is a perfect example - before Alice Rogers is killed, she is chased into a grove of Cholla cactus and pushed into them. These cacti have long needles that are very painful when they come into contact with humans, this I know from personal experience - my hand felt like it was on fire for hours. This is the gruesome detail that I mentioned previously.  Joanna Brady now must not only find out who killed Alice, but also why this person wanted her to suffer so horribly. This investigation leads us through many interesting developments with new characters and old alike. The subplots are interwoven into the main story line with such precision that at times you don't realize it's not part of the big picture. We see the relationship between Butch and Joanna take on new meaning, we see more into the relationship between Joanna and her mother, we even see more into Dick Voland - a chief deputy working under Joanna.   The killer didn't come as a surprise to me (maybe I read far too many mysteries to be fooled anymore), even the illness reeking havoc with Marianne Mulcayea (Joanna's long time friend and local minister) was not an unknown idea to me. Even so, there was never a dull moment while reading Outlaw Mountain. In fact, I haven't found one book in this series that I haven't absolutely loved and I encourage everyone to read them! I do suggest that you begin with Desert Heat, the first in the set and continue in order. It's not mandatory to understand each new book, but it will help you to feel as if you're part of the story and somehow fit in with Joanna Brady and her group of friends and family.  Now for the negative - yes, I actually found a negative with this book! It's a first: J.A. Jance actually made a mistake in this one. She referred to Arizona Game and Fish as Arizona Fish and Wildlife. Ok, so it's not a huge mistake, and I am nitpicking, but it is an error. I haven't ever found a blunder in any of her books - either major or insignificant - until now. It was almost like getting two surprises in a box of Cracker Jacks - it didn't change the flavor, I just knew it wasn't right. If this is the only inaccuracy made by Jance in this series, you can see why this type of research combined with incredible plots, strong characters and great development are what makes these books hit the bestseller list every time! 
 This is a great collection of stories.  Varley is outstaning in his characterizations and unique ideas.  Each story is an example in excellent writing.  Bring this one back 
 this cd is better then then Hot and Wet. Very good songs on this cd. Very Hot! 
 I have been thinking about how to phrase how I love this CD... but... Well, let's just say... once again I anxiously awaited the new release... I was like a little kid in a candy store when I recieved the CD and it hasn't left my CD player.  As I listen to the music I am once again in awe at the way their music changes and evolves and still remains true to their own sound.  I have always been a lyrics kinda person... doesn't matter the music, if the lyrics suck .. then... I can't listen to it.  Edwin McCain Band manages to combine both.  Edwin McCain and his fellow song writers write lyrics that can make you laugh and then, touch your heart to tears.   Edwin's lyrics have the ability to put you right into the moment.  Whether you are sitting by him on the plane looking at "The Kiss" or with your head in your hands "Losing Tonight".  It is the versatility of the lyrics that wins Edwin a place in his fan's hearts.  Then, add Craig Shield's sax, Larry Chaney's guitar, Dave Harrison's drums, and Lee Hendrick's bass... oh.. and of course Pete Riley's guitar and you just have a sound that compliments the lyrics to perfection.     Congrats to Edwin McCain Band... they did again!!!!    
 This is one of the best books in management. Some might find it a bit too mathematical, but the insights and general theory are one of the best contributions to the field of management 
 As a novice astronomer I really enjoy the sharp, steady view with these binoculars. The view is fairly steady even with the I.S. off - depending how stable you are of course. My binoculars cost more than my telescope !! And my telescope is a decent one too. But I think they are worth it. You see so much more in the night sky than what the naked eye can see - by far. They are of course great during the day too. Their weight is not much of an issue for me, although each person is different depending on their viewing habits. I think a hard carry case would have been the best but it's not a big deal for my use. I recommend this pair of binoculars to anyone who is serious about great quality and performance 
  In 1989, one U.S. senator began compiling information on a subject no other member of Congress wanted to look at-- the environment. He began bringing up the critical problem of climate change just when world scientists began to worry, at a time when the term "global warming" was foreign to members of Congress. Some politicians and lobbyists would've liked it to stay that way. To garner more attention to the crucial environmental problems that were being ignored by his fellow Congress members, he decided to write a book in order to spread the message of urgency to the general public. It worked and sparked a new interest in the environment. Earth in the Balance became the first book written by a sitting U.S. Senator to make the New York Times bestseller list since John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage (Wikipedia). That senator, of course, would go on to press some of the boldest environmental initiatives ever undertaken in U.S. government as an eight year vice president, Al Gore.   The winner of the 2000 election's popular vote and author/narrator of the recent An Inconvenient Truth book and documentary film, Al Gore has spent the greater part of his life on a mission to educate the public about environmental issues. In 1989, Gore presented his synopsis to a publisher, originally titled as "The New World War" (Maraniss 239). The book was unique in that it would not be ghost written and would not require the standard advance that most prominent public figures demanded. In fall of 1990, Gore began writing the book, which would result in a 711 page draft that would be later cut to just over 400 pages. "Portions of the manuscript came from speeches and op-ed pieces he had already written, and he was aided by a full time researcher and a hefty supporting group of scholars" (Turque 229). Included were many graphs, computer-generated mosaics, and pictures to firmly illustrate the environmental problems at hand. Gore had wanted the book to be like a tour around the Earth, in and out of its environmental problems. We see this same style even more so with his recent book An Inconvenient Truth, which consists mostly of pictures and graphs to best demonstrate the urgencies of global warming. Earth in the Balance, which included around 20 illustrations and pictures, was first published in 1992.    "We feel increasingly distant from our roots in the Earth," (1) writes Gore in the Introduction. "Are we so unique and powerful as to be essentially separate from the Earth?" (1) This is Gore's thesis question. The opening pages have resonance of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, which he directly alludes to on page 3, both bringing up the proven harmful effects of DDT and Agent Orange and paying tribute to the ever so influential mother of the environmental movement.    Early on in the book, Gore establishes his stance on faith and science. He never blames science or separates it from his faith. Conflict between the two happens to be a common misperception of people whereas most people believe it is either one or the other. Gore includes faith and science together and establishes in the Forward of the 1993 Plume edition, "We are people of faith and of science, who for centuries, often traveled different roads. In a time of environmental crisis, we find these roads converging." Eliminating this science vs. faith stereotype in the beginning invites everyone and brings them together, something politics certainly does not do.    In the first two chapters, Gore also emphasizes education of the crisis, something he has continued to do with his global warming lectures, which have now led to the training of more lecturers and a massive environmental initiative of education. An emphasis on global warming is also evident in the first two chapters when Gore writes, "The north polar cap has thinned by 2% in just the last decade," (23). Gore goes on to explain why the 600% increase in levels of atmospheric chlorine is one of the reasons why global warming and air pollution are already problematic.    The economy is the subject of Gore's tenth chapter where he brings up the power of industry and our relationship with technology. He mentions the genesis of Love Canal, which had devastating ramifications, all because industry was thinking about convenience and profit, and not about the future. These thoughts carry over into chapter eleven where Gore writes, "I wonder whether America's political paralysis might stem in part from the coexistence of two powerful but clashing media for communicating political thought" (211). Politics do end up being the ultimate problem in battling environmental problems, as Gore reveals.  The League of Conservation Voters described Al Gore as the "environmental Paul Revere," in reference to the success of Earth in the Balance (Turque 235). The book had garnered up so much well deserved attention that it was essentially the reason why Clinton chose Gore as Vice President from a list of 40 candidates.    When Gore had begun writing Earth in the Balance, he also had the desire to produce a television series based on his research. Many knew that "Gore would be an effective narrator, more educator than politician" (Maraniss 246). This series never got off the ground because Gore turned to concentrate on his position as Vice President where he helped strengthen the Safe Drinking Water Act, adopt the toughest smog standards ever, accelerate the cleanup of the worst toxic waste sites, expand Americans' right to know about environmental hazards in their communities, and preserve millions of acres of parks, monuments and wilderness" (White House). Researchers at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government examined the environmental policy record of the Clinton/Gore administration and "determined that environmental quality improved overall during the decade" (Research Matters).    As we near 2007, our environmental problems have grown worse because of a turn for the worse. Our foreign, economic, and domestic policies are no better. What we need is leadership. Al Gore warned us of the political consequences to the environment. His warnings are in writing in Earth in the Balance, if we should ever look back in regret and wonder. A must read for anyone who cares about a safe, healthy environment and a better future. A must read for every American.    
 i use this on my lap top and televisions.  clean your screens once a week with this product to keep them looking great.  it does make quite a difference.  
 The last time my husband read a book was high school.  So when we were in the book store and he couldn't put this book down and kept reading me passages from it, I said, let's just buy it.  He read the whole book in 2 days and was laughing out loud at parts.  The author writes like he's your buddy.  We both enjoyed this book and actually learned some things too.  It was a great addition to all of the pregnancy books we read.  I highly recommend it for all the Mack Daddy's out there that are going to be dads soon 
 I loved this book very much, and I was surprised how much information it gives you. I love Mark Cotta Vaz and I read his decription books. The book is exellent exept for one thing, it is not very detailed. It has the best pictures from the Star Wars Special Edition and it covers everything. I would definatly recommend this book 
 This book is a must-read for any aficionado of the Victorian novel, and will amaze readers who know Trollope only through the Barsetshire novels and wonder if he had the ability to step back from Victorian society and subject it to rigid scrutiny. The Way We Live Now is far more bleak than most of Trollope's work, yet not irredeemably so. The clear moral focus is still there as is Trollope's acute understanding that there is good and bad in all of us. For all the withering portraits it includes, the main characters are never caricatures. Even moral touchstones such as Roger Carbury are shown in all their murky complexity while they guide us through the still murkier world of speculation, vanity and avarice. And secondary characters such as Lord Nidderdale and Georgiana and Dolly Longestaffe are absolute gems. This is a masterpiece of the first order, one to read again and again and cherish. It brilliantly describes "the way we live now" and has wise counsel as to "how we should then live."     
 This book was very very well written. I enjoyed every part of it . Off the chain, work that thing out Turkey and stay strong until the next strong wind blow 
 My primary interest in the Tyrannicide Brief was to gain a better understanding of the fluctuating migration patterns to the New World.  TB was very useful in this regard.  TB also gave me new insight in the then prevailing view that monarchs were above the law and could not be held accountable in any way by their subjects.  TB rightfully focuses on legal reasoning and processes and, thereby, can be a slow read 
 Goodman has created a helpful guide, extremely well-written with frankness and humor. She takes readers through the steps of feeling frustrated with life in a cube to considering alternative escape routes. Of course her own story will inspire readers, as she herself went from cube to freelance status, while managing to live comfortably and even make mortgage payments.  The best part of the book is the section on living the freelance life. She gives down-to-earth advice on organizing the ridiculous amount of paperwork that goes with the freelance life. (I got some good ideas I can use right awway!)    I also liked the section on interviewing for information. She's listed steps from dazzle (write a nice simple request) to prepare to saying thanks. I couldn't agree more.  Additionally, Goodman has some excellent resources in the back of the book. Any career-changer would benefit from readings the books she recommends.  This book will be most helpful to thirty-somethings - those who have worked for five to ten years and are now asking, "How can I express my creativity in the world?" The Anti Guide makes a great companion to a book that's similarly targeted, This Time I Dance, by Tama Kieves. Kieves focused more on the emotional and psychological elements,while Goodman deals with practical implementation.  My own career clients tend to be 45-60. While they'd benefit from some elements of this book, I find that senior executives and experiened professionals need to choose different networking approaches.    I have just three quibbles about the book's content.  First, career consultants often encourage clients to shadow someone who's in a career they're considering. I would rather encourage my own clients to talk to half a dozen or more people in a field to get a broader perspective. I wouldn't give up on a field based on a single shadowing day  and I'd investigate further if a day appeared to be a "wow."  Second, Goodman recommends creating a website if you're a writer - and I agree completely. But you need to create a money-making website, which calls for copy as well as design. It's not reasonable to expect a whole treatise on the subject but I'd have liked to see some links to sources that can help.    Finally, I agree with Goodman that readers should be cautious before hiring a career coach or consultant. Again, I believe this advice makes moreo sense for the younger reader.    Goodman encourages readers to talk to HR departments and experts in fields of interest.  My own experience is that getting through to an information source requires a referral and HR folks are in the business of recruiting and screening.    These days, you should expect to pay for mentors, especially if you're going off on your own. You might take a continuing ed class at the low end or hire a consultant at the high end, but you pay. I agree with the advice to buy an hour at a time and avoid long, expensive commitmentes. But thes packages work for some clients.     In summary, Goodman's book makes an excellent contribution to the field. And the writing is so good, it's a fun read for anyone.     
 I bought this book knowing that it would provide advanced information related to residential plumbing.  I was surprised to see that not only did it provide you with all of the advanced information one might need to do a serious residential plumbing project, but it also covered all of the basics, something which I sorely needed.  It is an excellent textbook-style manual on residential plumbing and a thorough reference manual for those who already know the basics.  
 Book arrived in perfect condition, and it arrived earlier than i expected.  Also, it's a great book that everyone should read.  
 Can't say enough about this bitty slicer. Perfect transition between the 8" Chef's Knife and the 6" Utility Knife. Perfect when you want the control of an 8" Chef's knife but don't need the heft of a full Chef's knife. Perfect for smaller hands. Ultra Sharp so be careful. Beautiful and classic finish. Highly Recommended 
 My 3 year old grandson loves Batman and Scooby Doo, so this couldn't have been better.  He watches it over and over and is thoroughly entertained.  It can fill up a rainy afternoon with fun and enjoyment.  
 Dr. Vitale and Dr. Weill have written a thoughtful, fact based, believable book.  Not e-hype, this book should be read by any executive or technical leader who is entering - or reentering - cyberspace with their business.  "We have moved" is the teaser line on the cover art but what Weill and Vitale clearly show is that "we have dispersed" is more accurately the case.  If you are in the process of developing your business strategy for the new millenium and the next decade, the clear diagrams and examples given in this book will give you the facts necessary to recognize not only where you currently fit, but what it might take you to get where you want to go.  These two professors have had a unique opportunity to immerse with business leaders and interact with hundreds of consultants over the past two years focusing on the ebusiness space.  The results of these interactions are distilled into this cogent work.  A must read. Also look at another book co-authored by Peter Weill and Marcia Broadbent entitled "Leveraging the New Infrastructure" which provides additional actionable thought on the technical side of e-business 
 This is a book I give as my special baby present.  It is beautiful, holy and inspiring.  
  I first heard "So Come Back, I am Waiting" when I was listening to KEXP.org (a fantastic Seattle radio station) and I didn't pay too much attention to it until I thought I heard the word "Abecedarians". Now, I already feel like I'm one of, hmmm, maybe 1000 people who have some idea of what that word means (a derogatory name for a group of early Protestants who denied all human knowledge, including speech) and was amazed it'd be in a song shortly following the word "wisteria" in a gorgeous, tense epic about a serial killer.   I couldn't get the song out of my head, so the next day I bought the album and, seven months later, I'm still listening to it and still discovering new ideas, themes and lyrics.  
 Very nice selection of poems, including Christina Rosetti and Robert Louis Stevenson.  The illustrations are pretty, but like others by Wilkin they are subdued, not likely to jump out and grab the attention.  That's not necessarily a negative, though.  My two preschoolers enjoy hearing the poems and also enjoy the pictures 
 With help from Sherrie at Linksys online chat customer service we got this to work with Windows Vista.  It was the the same work around that I used to get it to work with XP.  Its a bit messy.  Utility does not work well but printing is fine 
 "Backbeat" provides a fascinating and alternative viewpoint of the pre-stardom Beatles. Ian Hart's jealous, sarcastic, and insecure Lennon is both fresh yet seemingly correct. Liverpool and Hamburg lay at either ends of the bridge between the sappy 50's and avant-garde 60s, and the film moves us across that bridge at the frenetic and raucous pace of the cover tunes of the then-Beatles' playlist. Hart and the actors playing McCartney and Harrison bear a less superficial and more unnerving resemblance to the young Beatles, certainly not in the way of a Vegas revue, and all the better for it. It's probably a good thing though that Stu Sutcliffe quit the band, if quite a sad thing he died so young. His continuance with the Beatles is one counterfactualist scenario I'm glad not to imagine 
 This is an engaging historical fiction novel. Set in post World War II Europe, it is also published under the titles David, and I Am David.  With the help of one of the prison gaurds, 12 year old David escapes from a communist labor camp in Bulgaria with no idea what to do other than go to Denmark. The story weaves in many important themes, such as freedom, beauty, truth, and love. There are many intriguing characters, like Johannes his fellow prisoner, the family of Maria, a Danish lady in Switzerland, and a dog named King. As David crosses countries and borders, his understanding of life, God, and the aforementioned themes grows as his journey progresses. Through it all he is determined to remain true to himself. Truly an engaging read, and a good study on physical and cultural geography for kids 
 Although at times a bit overly cynical for my tastes, this was a highly entertaining read.  It was erudite, witty, and very, very originally observant of human behavior and motivation.  I recognized myself throughout, sometimes painfully so and sometimes amusingly so.  I especially enjoyed the skewering of academic fakery, surely the most profoundly comical of all forms.  A great read 
 This book is full of recipes from Paula's show - which is a great time saver (and ink saver) if you're like me and print a lot of her recipes.  This is typical Paula fare - southern cooking that is easy, tastes good, and relatively quick-cooking.  It's comfort food.  Her recipes are adaptable for a low-fat diet - I know because I do it.  If you're the type that considers yourself too refined for this style of food or cooking, then this book is a waste of your time and money.  If you're a laid-back person who likes food that is low on the fuss factor, uses ingredients that are easily accessible and don't cost a fortune, and typically taste great, this is a great addition to the collection!   
 This book brilliantly explains how to provide structure to your thinking. I've made it mandatory reading for all employees in my strategy consulting firm 
 after seeing brokeback mountain, i decided to see more of ang lee's films and came upon this gem that perfectly shows the same type of sad melencholy used in brokeback. the film takes place in the 1970's and centers around two family's the hoods (consisting of kline, allen, ricci, and mcguire) and the carvers (consisting of weaver, wood, and that one kid) who go through many events that boil together one night during an ice storm.  the husband of the hoods is having an affair with weavers character, the kids are exploring sex and drugs, and allens character goes from shop-lifting to cheating on her husband too. the film plays out in two parts, the first hour or so is mainly a comedy while the last hour plays like a drama that leads to a very sad ending. truly a great ang lee film, must check it out if you loved brokeback 
 I ordered vol 1 and 2 the same day, and watched them both the same day they arrived. This and Bleach is quickly becoming my favorite shows. Naruto vol.2 contains 12 episodes with extras and cutscenes for the next vol. which is due out in May. The downsides to the series is the volumes are too short and, at the beginning of most episodes they show the events of about the last 2 to 5 mins. of the previous episode which is pointless and I really dont like that. But that doesn't hurt my rating at all. This one kicks off with Naruto making his grand entrance when Sasuke is trapped in the cyrstal ice mirrors fighting Haku. This is a pretty long battle with a very good ending. The next few episodes introduces several more characters and starts a new chapter. The story is developing very well. With more humor than action, but unlike a lot of anime its actually funny. I highly recommend this series if you never seen it. If you like Inu-yasha, and Dragon BallZ, then there is no reason not to like this. I also recommend Bleach and the New Guyver. 
 Love this game. Great story line. Just make sure your computer can handle it 
 The book shows how the greek people were the first to concentrate their attention on the perfection of MAN and his place in society. Jaeger traces this fact from Homeric times through Plato and explains it through many outstanding writers such as Hesiod, Solon, Sophocles, and many more. He shows the powerful Ideals of the greeks in all their beauty which continue to live on in the world today. He reveals how Poetry, Philosophy, Rhetoric, Politics, Medicine, etc. have their basis in the quest to reach the highest standard imaginable for man and society. The space contributed to Plato is subtantial and the first volume is really only an intro to Plato by the authors own admission. That's a four hundred page intro! But it all leads to the greatest of inventions...Philosphy. I enjoyed the whole book, but the second volume "the search for the divine center" was the best part explaining many things about Plato. To understand in greater depth the influence of these ideals on the western world I recommend reading a book (which I read first) called "The Classical Tradition" by Gilbert Highet whom is also the translator of this book. That book reveals how most of the surviving great works throughout western history were written by authors who were well aware of the greek world and their ideals including many writers in the Christian tradition. Jaeger wrote a short book called "Greek Paideia and Early Christianity" which shows that connection very well. He has convinced me beyond doubt of his statement that the ancient greeks are the educators of the western world 
 Very humorous take on the trials of the yakuza.  the only thing i didn't really care for was the way Kakihara died....it was sort of sad considering the whole movie was building up to his confrontation with Ichi.  Kakihara had been waiting all this time for Ichi...getting all excited for a final bout.  Waiting for Ichi to kill him.  Then he ended up falling from a stairwell. Which is why it got the 4 star instead of 5 star rating 
 An excellent source for comprehensive information of IT Systems Management.  Leveraging his diverse experience, Rich Schiesser offers wide ranging, yet detailed sections ranging from technology topics to managing IT employees.  A good touch is his use of worksheets to help you put his effective ideas to work 
 We bought the first Crane elephant for our baby's room, and when the cool mist filter humidifier in our bedroom started making weird screech noises, we bought another to replace it a few months later.  We've never had any trouble with them and the convenience of no filter requirement is great.  I tried to find an ultrasonic humidifier with a more "grown-up" design to go in our bedroom, but they all seemed to be twice the price of the Crane, so since it works great and the price is great, it's elephants all around 
 This is a great book for getting the fundamentals of Qabalistic Magick down.  By the end of the book I felt I clearly understood  the nature of each Sephira, symbols associated with them etc.  If you can avoid being put off by the Christian bias and black/white magick attitudes you can learn a lot.  You could read this with almost no knowledge of the Qabalistic system and still get a lot out of it.  Despite her clarity in some areas Dion Fortune tends to get caught up in unnecessarily long-winded descriptions or explanations if the topic is a difficult metaphysical one. Overall her writing style is beautiful - if a little old fashioned.  Read this if you are interested in the Book of Thoth/ Thoth Tarot as Crowley already assumes you know this stuff, it will definitely lead to a deeper understanding of the deck.   
 Adidas makes very nice summer sandals.  This is the cheapest that I've seen.  I buy them for my kids every summer...They last all summer and beyond, unlike other sandals.  My kids think they are cool too 
 This audio book is vintage Rumpole, full of the usual Mortimer humour and wit. I thought that the reader's voice was a bit younger and less gravelly than I expected at first, judging from my experience with several other Rumpole audio books. However, I soon became accustomed to this very minor flaw and thoroughly enjoyed this book 
 With the popularity of Puff Daddy's and others use of sampling other's songs to create new material, it should not really matter in the case of Milli Vanilli, who really stirred up a hornet's nest in the early 1990s.  Ok, so they said they were singing their songs but in fact they were merely lip-syncing.  What it all adds up to is two frontman performing (lip-syncing and dancing) to music and words in which they chose to do and made had a good routine for.  Having found out this duo does not take away from the music itself, Milli Vanilli have made a name for themselvs as performers even if they did not actually sing the material.  Track Listing 1. Girl You Know It's True  2. Blame It On The Rain 3. Take It As It Comes 4. Baby Don't Forget My Number 5. Dreams To Remember 6. All Or Nothing 7. It's Your Thing 8. I'm Gonna Miss You 9. More Than You'll Ever Know 10. Girl You Know It's True (NY Subway Mix) 
 Miss Page is one of the most versatile singers of all time.   I know many folks that have this CD and they all love it. Even her current CDs of the 1990s and 2000 are fabulous.  Her voice is deep and rich. She is still THE SINGING RAGE.  Over 100 million records sold, she continues to sell today.  YOU GO GIRL !!!  Dolfanren 
 You'll never meet a more unique character than Jimmy Porter, a 20-something British Archie Bunker.  He's filled with rage at the absence of ... something ... and spews forth venom, sarcasm and utter misery  relentlessly.  Sounds horrible, right?  Well, it's fascinating.  I couldn't  put it down, and I'd like to see the current revival of the play in NYC.   I've seen a few people like Jimmy Porter, people who have so much  potential, energy and creativity, yet for one reason or another it's all  squandered.  They fail to surround themselves with people of equal passion,  and the result is that they hurt the ones around them, who are more at  peace with themselves.  The question is, how does someone so young get this  way 
 A must-have for every home reference library. Entertaining as well as easy to read. Pick it up and read any topic of interest in a short clip of time or read it cover to cover. Great common sense with a twist 
 This is absolutley the best time travel novel I have ever read! (That's actually not saying too much, being only 14) Heinlein combines the idea of Cyrogenics with Time Travel, I realize that it's funny that I never had read about it happening in another novel.(Heilein was wonderfully creative) Yes, it is a bit out of date, but I like Heinlein's 2000 better than ours. This is a read I would say is most definatley O.K. for newer Heinlein readers, unlike some of his later novels. 
 I read with much appreciation on Feb 4, 1989, Robert Leckie's one-volume history of World War II:  Delivered from Evil.  So I did not think I needed to read another history of that war, since life is so short and since I lived thru that war with extreme attention to its course.  But when I saw that Victor Davis Hanson (even though I am no particular fan of his ideology) said this was the best one-volume history the Second  World War, I decided to read it.  I am glad I did.  It is a much more carefully composed account than Leckie's unfootnoted popular book.  This book is well worth the time I spent reading it, albeit there are 920 pages of text, a 23 page bibliographic essay, 31 maps and 75 pages of notes.  I found on many pages things of high interest which I did not know or had forgotten.  Furthermore, I found that his opinions were well-reasoned and convincing.  The edition I read was published by Cambridge University Press, but I found no bias in favor of Britain, even though the author, born in Germany, lived as a youth in England before serving in the US Army after World War II.  Even if you think you know all there is to know about World War II I submit you will find that reading this book will be a pleasure and well worth your time 
 This is a perfect release for someone like me--I saw the films in my teens and never paid the slightest bit of attention to them thereafter. I haven't ever bought a tape or dvd of any of the Star Wars stuff, but was intrigued by the idea of finally being able to see the orginals. The theatrical release on the bonus disc doesn't look too bad--especially at night in a dark room. I have a 26 -inch LCD: it looks fine if I leave it with bars on all four sides, and loses something when I zoom in.  I really enjoyed the commentary on the 2004 SE disc. Carrie had the most interesting things to say, and I was amazed at how much thought and effort the sound guy and the other one put into their work. Lucas was o.k.  Bottom line: If you bought the SE in 2004 and only want the theatrical if it looks great--don't buy this. Perhaps everything in the commentaries is well-known, too, to the real fans.  But if this is the first and last Star Wars purchase that you intend to make--then go for it. I loved seeing the orginal film (and sorry George, but I don't think it would have been half as good without the John Williams score), and I enjoyed the commentaries quite a bit.  One interesting bit of trivia--I think that other than Leia's, the only lines spoken by women in all three films are those of Aunt Beru in the first and a female diplomat of some sort in this one.  The commentaries continue the trend:  men spend lots of time on "we couldn't do what we wanted" to justify the changes and take up most of the time, while Carrie's interesting stories about the actual shooting of the film get the short shrift.  I didn't notice it so much on the first two--but she's given progressively less to do as time goes on in terms of commentary.  What a shame--she's pretty interesting 
 As a synthetic chemist, I consider this book as a masterpiec 
 This pad has performed as expected and the extra length on the sides makes it easier to tuck under the mattress to keep it from moving. However, the photo gives the impression of covering more of the bed than it truly does. Take the measurements seriously - don't rely on the photo. I needed to play with it to see where on the bed it would be the most effective 
 In this sequel to Shadow of a Dark Queen, author Raymond Feist takes us back to his magical world of Midkemia. Time is growing short now, as the Kingdom of the Isles braces for the coming invasion by the Emerald Queen's army. Erik von Darkmoor is feverishly training new soldiers, but will the Armies of the West be ready? And, as for Rupert Avery, his live of dissipation and intrigue are starting to wear him down, but he is caught in a larger intrigue, and much is going to happen to him that he has never expected.  Raymond Feist's Riftwar books all great great, with epic adventure and magic, while his later books enjoyed a somewhat smaller scope. This book is definitely an epic book; indeed I would say the greatest of the epic books. This is a story of a war that spans an entire world, and even includes demons and gods in a war of winner-take-all!  Overall, I found this to be a great story. I loved its huge scope and high stakes - it is the grandest of grand adventures! If you want to read a story with a large scale adventure that will leave you on the edge of your seat, then this is the book for you. I loved this book and give it my highest recommendations! 
   This book is a 'must read' for all sincere spiritual seekers. Brian Hines has a gift for making difficult subjects or obscure authors more understandable with his insight, wisdom, and humor. He takes the jewels that are Plotinus' teachings of the 3rd century and polishes them for the 21st century reader. I highly recommend this book - a catalyst to be used to further one's growth and understanding of truth, leading to the mystic's goal - Return to the One.   
 Blessings is one of those rare novels which takes a single-word title into seven-dimensions of meaning in a delightful story about family love.   Before introducing the story, let me outline the "blessings" references to help you appreciate the subtleties of this book.  1.  Blessings is a place, the country home of the Blessing family.  2.  The Blessings are a family that has had its ups and downs and sees its extinction coming.  3.  Blessings are those gifts that we receive from God every day that we take for granted . . . like our families, the beauties of nature around us and our health.  4.  Blessings occur when a new child is born . . . something we often call a blessed event.  5.  Blessings are ours when others show love and appreciation for us.  6.  Blessings can move us to live a better life when we are inspired to turn to goodness.  As the story begins, an unwed couple is sneaking up at night on Blessings, the home of 80 year-old Lydia Blessing.  Startled by a security light, the father takes their baby to the bottom of the stairs to the garage apartment rather than the main house.  There, handyman Skip Cuddy discovers the little girl and takes her in.  He finds himself totally charmed and challenged by this baby.    Soon, Lydia Blessing realizes that Skip is parenting a baby alone and agrees to help him tend Faith.  From that awkward beginning a strong bond develops among the three of them.  Strengthened by this chance to nurture Faith, Skip and Lydia discover new depths of love, understanding and respect in one another.  How well will these bonds endure when the world's expectations and perceptions intervene?  The answer to that question is what makes this a grand story.  Many will be disappointed with the story's ending, finding the transcendent focus of the conclusion to be unsatisfyingly spiritual . . . rather than tangible.  For me, the book's main weakness was a tendency to over draw characters and situations which made the story clearer . . . but less convincing.  If you read it more like you would a fable, you will undoubtedly rate the book as a five-star effort.            
 I just love this album!  Karen's voice is just beautiful and some of the less popular songs on the album are so good they should've been more popular back then.  I would recommend this album to anyone who loves the carpenters 
 I am not going to write a review defending or attacking the practice of technical analysis, which is roughly defined as the use of historic trading data, especially prices, volume, and open interest, usually visually displayed as charts, in order to predict future prices of securities, currencies, and commodities.  If you believe in pure market efficiency or fundamental analysis only, you're not interested in technical analysis and should stop reading right here.  If you are interested in technical analysis, this is an excellent place to start.  Description: Murphy's basic text, updated substantially from its first edition, walks the reader through the fundamentals of the most common forms of technical analysis.  Each major topic typically receives a chapter giving basic definitions and an introduction to the subject.  Topics covered include but are not limited to: *	Dow Theory, the beginning of Western technical analysis *	Basic chart construction (i.e. how to draw a bar or candlestick chart) *	Classical charting formations and techniques *	Trends, how to identify and draw *	The use of volume and open interest *	Japanese candlesticks *	Point and figure charting *	Oscillators *	Elliott Wave theory *	Time cycles Murphy's text addresses specifics of both futures and stocks.  The book was originally written for the futures markets, but material salient to stocks, such as market breadth.  This book is part of the curriculum for the Market Technician Association's CMT (Chartered Market Technician) Level I exam because it gives an overview and introduction to many major technical analysis topics.  Opinion: Murphy's book has long been one of the classics of technical analysis literature.  This book will allow the reader to quickly become familiar with the field; even experienced traders often keep it on their bookshelf to refresh their memory once in a while.  The major flaw behind this book is that, due to its encyclopedic breadth, each topic receives only an introduction.  It is unlikely the novice technician would be prepared to trade off Japanese candlesticks or Elliott Wave counts using only the material in this book.  Murphy's book is, however, an excellent place to start and specialty books can be purchased later for any topic in which the reader is especially interested 
 The fitness industry is so much into isolation of muscle groups, when in reality this has no functional carry over into your daily activities.  Be it a sportsperson or the weekend warrior, this book is so easy to understand and the concepts will make you a stronger person from the inside out.  And guess what - if you still cannot forgo the bicep curl, you will find yourself lifting a heavier weight with less effort - that's functional training! 
 Having been born and raised in a small community in south Georgia, I have seen first-hand much of what was described in this book.  I found this work to be incredibly interesting and moving.  Have attitudes evolved and changed for the better in this area?  Yes, fortunately.  Are there still traces of this?  Yes, unfortunately.  But with excellent works such as this, we can only hope that the sad attitudes and discrimination that is so accurately described in Ms. Greene's work will become a part of our distant past 
 I read this book the first day it came out and couldn't put it down.  At last there's a manual explaining how men think.  
  	Joey has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  He can't focus, can't be understood by most, can't ease his tension, excitement, stress, and anxiety much at all.  Joey lives with his alcoholic, trouble-filled mother and dying, smoking-fiend grandmother.  Joey's father is out of the picture: his parents are divorced, and his father never was and will probably never be the father every dad should be.  Occasionally, when Joey's mother and father do see or even exist in each others presence, conflict and violence break out almost instantaneously.  Joey has gone through numerous schools, none ever working for him.  Joey has two friends: his Chihuahua, Pablo, and a blind girl named Olivia, who is the only other student in his "school"- a devout Christian woman who teaches Joey and her daughter in her home.   To just name a few examples, most can obliviously conclude on the apparent difficulties that lie in Joey Pigza's life, every single day.  However, in the final book of the Joey Pigza trilogy, Joey goes up against all odds and shows the world his true character- not the dysfunctional outcast he appears to be, but the kind, positive, humble kid he actually is, with a helping hand and a heart of gold to all.  	With a "Mr. Helpful" label taped to his forehead and a smile on his face, Joey Pigza takes you through his last story in What Would Joey Do?.  With more pressing issues arising and more problems being solved, Joey discovers real facts of life.  In this final book, he tries his best to make himself the best person he can be- less of a problem-starter; more of a problem-solver.  Not only does he help others, but he also realizes that he can and is able to make choices on his own; that he is responsible and mature enough, ADHD or no ADHD, to function and live like every other extraordinary person.  What Would Joey Do? and the Joey Pigza trilogy is by far one of the best young-adult series I have ever read, and I would recommend it to anyone of any age who loves a great read on overcoming weaknesses and living life to the fullest.    
 Very nice sound, cheap and very easy to instal 
 This is a great book.  It helps you know the little things to do when raising a foal.  The things that most people wouldn't think of are in this book.  Its a good book for beginner on up through experienced 
 This is a great portable grill for the size. The 14" one would be fine for 1-2 people, but not more. This grill can handle more charcoal and has enough room to allow for 2 heat zones.  The hardest part is finding one! I finally found one on eBay but, you better hurry! 
 I saw this film five years ago when it was first released in mexico and i remember that in that point in time mexican cinema was non existent, people just did not want to see mexican movies, this at that time broke all box office records as the most profitable movie ever produced in mexico and is directly responsible for the success of future movies like Amores Perros, Y tu Mama Tambien and The Crime Of Padre Amaro, this movie is a milestone in mexican filmmaking and a must see 
  Hoot by Carl Hiaasen is a fun read for all ages.  The story is about Roy, the new kid at school, who is subjected to bullying by Dana, a notoriously mean, bad to the bone lout. That bullying leads Roy on an adventure he never anticipated where he finds an unlikely ally in a no nonsense girl named Beatrice, who is one tough cookie and more than a match for the dreadful Dana! Enjoy the satisfaction when the the tables are turned and Dana finally is on the receiving end and gets what's coming to him! Humor is a staple throughout Carl Hiassen's books and Hoot is no exception. Sometimes you just have to laugh out loud! Given as a Christmas gift along with Hiaasen's 'Flush' to our oldest granddaughter, she has told us she enjoyed both books enormously. It is going to make it hard this Christmas to find books this entertaining to give her! She is an avid reader. You know you did good when a fourteen year old says, 'you always give me the best gifts' and includes these books in her list! 
 We bought this product back in 2005 and used it during an international trip through several airports. It worked as advertised in all the jumbo jets, and elicited generally positive reactions from other passengers and flight crew; however it could not pass through the aisles of an Embraer commuter plane that we had to take on a short leg of our journey. In order to secure it correctly on the airline seat, you may have to get a seatbelt extender from the flight attendant.  Having this car seat/stroller is great if you are travelling with small kids; they sleep comfortably in it and makes for more efficient transfer between gates. I share the observation that others made regarding its inability to take bumps... for that reason it is not a good choice beyond travel and maybe use within a shopping mall. As a car seat it was OK, it just takes some getting used to. We never used it in a rear-facing configuration, so I cannot rebut comments made by other users as regards their problems in that mode. 
 Diogenes the Cynic...an encyclopaediac work, a perceptive examination of philosophy. We should emulate the cynic, his lifestyle and shock the world by living "in accordance with his principles."  On education..."the ultimate goal in the training of the youth is to prepare them to function as slaves in the work force; smoke in the world of ideas, where philosophers and ideologues mask their own deceptions in webs of complex concatenations of words and phrases that are unrelated to the real world; smoke,..."

 This is a great book that exposes many ugly, but important-to-know facts about our nation and world.   I got in in CD form, which has the added benefit of actually being able to hear the voices of people Amy has interviewed or gotten media clips of.  This is sometimes heart-rending (e.g., as you hear the guns going off in East Timor), but lends an important dimensionality to the news that's too often cleansed of its significance here in the US.   She's a persistent and intelligent journalist who sometimes pushes the envelope in terms of politeness, but I'd much rather have someone who pushes for answers from those in power b/c she's strongly dedicated to what is best about this country than someone who is tepid and a journalist in name only who refuses to ask hard questions.   This is the way journalism should be done and often IS done in other countries.   You cannot listen to or read this book without questioning our entire corporate "journalism" structure and its sorry effects on our democracy.  You'll be hooked on Democracy Now and similar programs once you experience "real news reporting" like this.  
 I thoroughly enjoyed browsing through and then reading this beautiful tribute to the legendary work of George Hurrell.  As compelling as Hurrell's photos are it is the author's indepth knowledge and understanding of Hollywood and Hurrell that set this book apart.    Mark Vieira's own photographic artistry is based on Hurrell's techniques, providing current-day enthusiasts with authentic glamour photography of their own. 
 I find this book one of the best introductory books addressing the essentials of critical thinking.  The author discussed the elements of critical thinking in a very easy and comprehensive manner that broad range of readers can absorb easily.  The chapters that discuss the assumptions and the credibility are really so valuable.  Above all, the charts that summarize each chapter are so valuable to revise the whole story in a few statements.   I do recommend this book for the readers searching for the easiest way to teach themselves the basics of critical thinking.  
 My wife and I discovered the Pump and Grind Pepper Mill several years ago, and have found it to be a wonderful tool for the kitchen and on the road.  It is ideal to grab when you only have one hand available.  We love the look, the construction, and the Amazon price.  We recently found an wonderful spice - Grains of Paradise, a peppery spice with a touch of heat and citrus - and purchase another Pump and Grind just for it.  We currently have three, and will probably own more, as they are ideal for people who like to use different peppers.   We both do a lot of cooking for various events and have found these to be a great way to bring several different kinds of peppers in a small, but reliable package. We miss the adjustable grind, but find it not to be too much of a drawback.  Beside, the WoW factor when you pull it out the first time is almost worth the price of admission - which by the way, is great on Amazon.  The price usually runs one to three dollars less than the market place, and when you factor in Amazon Prime - what a deal   
 The names Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth and Honus Wagner don't resonate as much as they used to.  As the decades go by even the old-timers among us haven't been around long enough to remember them.  They've pretty much become historical, iconic figures, like the stoic-looking George Washington on a dollar bill.  It's a bit of a sad reminder of the inexorable march of time, but what a great relief to know that this treasure chest of a book is around to keep their memories alive.    The author got the idea for it in 1961 when he read that Ty Cobb had died.  Realizing that many of Cobb's contemporaries would soon suffer the same fate, he set out to meet as many of them as he could and record--literally with a tape recorder--their stories for posterity.  Twenty six of them are recounted here.  Some of these guys are hall-of-famers, some of them not even close, but all of them--every single one--had a load of interesting tidbits to share.  Baseball was a different game back then.  America was a different place.    The first great thing about the book is that you get at least several takes on the great ballplayers.  One of the fellows, for example, playing Detroit, talked about being a little nervous about Cobb, whom they had all heard would sharpen his spikes.  A Detroit player, however, mentioned that Cobb never sharpened his spikes.  Not that they didn't discourage the other team from thinking so.      Walter Johnson had an arm like a bullwhip, but he was a nice enough guy and a friend of Sam Crawford.  Late in the game, if his team was ahead by enough runs, he'd toss a meatball in to Crawford and let him belt it.  He never did that for Cobb, though, who he hated.  Cobb could never figure out why Crawford was able to hit him.    Honus Wagner is recalled by many as the best of all of them, with great quickness, great hitting and great fielding.  A couple of the fellows recall that you could usually count on bits of gravel to be flung at you along with the ball he had just scooped up.  Tommy Leach described him as the best fielding third-baseman, shortstop, first-baseman and outfielder in the league--he played all of them--and since he won the batting title eight times between 1900 and 1911 you couldn't really argue that he wasn't the best hitter in the league, either.    For some odd reason, there aren't that many memorable gems about the great Babe Ruth, although there are at least a few.  Harry Hooper (a guy I'd never heard of and a hall-of-famer) remembers Ruth in the first year he came up with Boston as a, "big, overgrown, green pea."  "Nineteen years old, poorly educated, only lightly brushed by the social veneer we call civilization, he was gradually transformed into the idol of American youth and the symbol of baseball the world over . . . If somebody had predicted that back on the Boston Red Sox in 1914, he would have been thrown into the lunatic asylum."  Along with these detailed sketches, including a ton of characters I haven't even mentioned--Germany Schaeffer, Rube Waddell (who didn't like to wear underwear), Lefty O'Doul, Dazzy Vance--the book is also, naturally, loaded with baseball anecdotes.  Some of the more famous plays of the time, for example, are recounted in different ways and with different perceptions.    Take the "Bonehead" Merkle play.  For those of you who don't know, what happened was this.  The Giants were tied with the Cubs for first place with one week to go in the season.  In a game against each other, in the bottom of the ninth of a 1-1 game, the Giants had men on first and third with two outs.  Merkle was on first.  Birdwell hit a single to center, McCormack scored from third, and Merkle . . . ran to the clubhouse.  Without touching second.  The Cubs retrieved the ball from center field, Evers tagged second, and the run didn't count.  Because of the crowd on the field the game had to be replayed on a later date.  The Giants lost it, and lost the pennant.  From then on and forever more, Fred Merkle became "Bonehead" Merkle.      But it's actually a little more complicated than that.  For one thing, Merkle was only nineteen.  It was the first game he'd ever started for the Giants.  And running into the clubhouse when the game was over was something all the guys did--whether touching second was necessary or not--because of the crowd pouring onto the field after the ushers opened the gates at the end of the game.  The players ran off to get away from them.  And Evers never did tag second base with the ball that was hit out to center because someone had heaved it into the left field stands.  Fred Snodgrass doesn't think he ever tagged second with any ball at all.  The umpires weren't around to know this, though;  they had already left the field!  Funny how the mists of history tend to simplify things.  The detail in this book brings these stories back to life.  And there are a ton of them recounted.    Along with all of this baseball lore, you get a pretty good glimpse of America a hundred years ago, too.  People were more humble, but in general confident, and much more direct.  It's fascinating just to consider their nicknames:  "Wee Willie" was the nickname for a short guy, "Specs" was the guy who wore glasses, "Chief," (at least two of them) were American Indians, and, "Dummy" was the guy who was deaf and dumb.  Nobody meant anything by it;  nobody apparently took offense.  Stuff like these speaks volumes.        Here's Jimmy Austin:  " . . . they didn't have clubhouses in most parks, especially not for the visiting team.  We'd get into uniform at the hotel and ride out to the ball park in a bus drawn by four horses.  They used to call it a tally-ho in those days.  We'd sit on seats along the sides and ride, in uniform, to the ballpark and back.  "That ride was always a lot of fun.  Kids running alongside as we went past, and rotten tomatoes once in a while.  Always lots of excitement when the ball club rode by, you know."    Yep.  Thanks in part to this book, we know all right. 
 Currently pregnant, I hesitated to read this book because I didn't want to become more paranoid than I already am about various environmental problems.  I was impressed by both Steingraber's voice - the intimate telling of her own story is funny, telling, and compelling without any of the other details - and with the unremitting rigor with which she marshals her facts.  Instead of being overwhelemed by information on one or the other side of various US environmental debates, I found that the author brings a very well-researched and sensible perspective to the conversation.  Beautifully written as well as informative - well worth my time 
   For those of us that love flowers... well the basic plot of planting in a dingy city will bring much enjoyment.  But there is much more in this book than beautiful flowers.  There is a theme of enduring and the main character, Lydia Grace, models for us that we can bloom where we are planted.  And in a simple way, she models for us that getting busy with a healthy project can be a nice way to cope and persevere.  Her flowers, which transform her Uncle's bakery, are a great example of how we can touch others.  When we let our own life flow and gently pursue our passions maybe we help others more indirectly than if we try too hard to please or try to become something we are not.     And speaking of being authentic and real, Uncle Jim in the story demonstrates for us that we all express our emotions and feelings differently!  And not only is this more than okay, it is what makes us better.  Uncle Jim never smiles, even when Lydia touches his life, and it is just how he is.  Lydia's concern for her Uncle Jim reminds us that we should and CAN care about others, even in the midst of our own trying times!  Lydia is far from home, in a dingy city, and maybe she is too young to realize the depressing facts of the hardship around her.  Or just maybe... she models for us that we need NOT get worn out and broken from hard times; instead, we need to keep on living!  And when we carry on with the things we love we can possibly inspire and help others.  Lydia does just this - especially when she transforms the roof with her flowers. She touches lives and leaves us with a feeling that there is strength in unity and that our individuality makes us better, more balanced, and needs to be celebrated. 
 This was a birthday present for my great nephew. The book comes with stars to put on the ceiling of the room which he just went crazy for. He finds the book challenging as he is in the 1st grade but reads 3rd and this is a 5th grade book. He loves it and it goes really well with his telecope. I recommend this book for those children who are into the sky 
 William Carlos Williams' "Imaginations" collects five complete works of the great american poet. As excursions into experimental literature these five examples cannot be beat. The compelling and lucid  examinations of the working imagination by one of the best acrobats of the  imagination. All originally published in small editions and finally  available again as they were before being hacked up into selected works and  anthologies. "Spring and All" contains many of William's  best-loved poems as they appeared with the original experimental prose that  was in itself a manifesto of imagination. "The Descent of Winter"  is poetry, fiction, criticism and personal journal all in one and is  exquisitely beautiful and deeply insightful as a portrait of an unusually  gifted artist and man 
 i always watch horror movies now adays with a negative outlook, just cause they all seem to be either holywood shlock or just plain ametuer hour garbage, (see my reviews of the graveyard, 13 seconds, and shatter dead). so needless to say i was supremely suprised and pleased at the end of my viewing of the feast. yes it is a low buget film, no cgi or any supremely fancy effects. which really doesnt matter in a film like this. if done right, a low buget film can be better than a high budget super cgi special effects-a-thon. cgi i think has made a lot of film makers lazy. no longer do they have to work hard at detailing the environment, creatures etc. all they have to do is imput data in a cpu and presto, you got your movie effects. (im sure there is more to it than that but you get the point). cgi just doesnt feel as personal to me. i mean watch some of the making of videos of some of the older horror classics like the thing or dawn of the dead trilogy or alien/aliens. you could tell that these people cared so much about their product and busted their chops to make it to as close to real as possible. and in the end i think that piece of heart and soul the filmakers put into their product really shines through. thats what the effects were like in this movie. cool looking, nothing fancy, but well made. this movie i felt had a lot more character to it than half the movies out there now a days like i know what you did last summer trilogy (i cant believe they made a 3rd one) cry-wolf, continual sequals of final destination, etc. i mean dont get me wrong, these are pretty much all popcorn movies, which theres nothing wrong with that really. i guess everyone goes to the movies for one reason and thats to be entertained, and these movies i guess serve their purpose. the difference is do you want to leave the theater like:  1: yeah that was good  or  2: I CANT BELIEVE THAT, THAT WAS AWESOME!!!!  this movie i think falls in the 2 catagory for me. it might be in the 1 catagory for some others. it might not have the most earth shatteringly original story line (we have been making movies for about 100 years or so<---historical accuracy questionable----so pretty much all the fresh ideas are takin and have been done before)but this movie had enough fresh ideas, and innovations to differenciate this film from the others out there and it did make me truly enjoy myself for the 90 minutes it took to watch this film, and the next 180 minutes of repeat viewings.   4.5 star 
 I owned the original version of this until my nephew trashed the disc.  Some people would like to call this kind of music dated. This is a comment I find odious. "Dated" is a purely subjective, relative term. Sure, their sounds use old keyboard technology, with limited 8-bit tone generators that we would consider low-tech in today's digital sound scene. But I beg to differ. That "low-tech", 8-bit quality was a special sound of its own. Few other kinds of music create such otherworldly sounds. I know the makers of these early synth instruments tried to imitate the sounds of actual, non-electronic instruments, and fell short because of the limited technology then. But then the sound quality that comes out is unique. When you hear this kind of synth sound being played, you know what it is, what era it came from, how unique it is, it has an IDENTITY. Dated my butt.  People like music for different reasons. Some like the lyrics. Some like the skill of the vocalist(s). Others like the instrumentation and the resulting soundscape. I am the last one. Music is music... SOUND that creates a soundscape to appeal to the listener's ears. Whatever the lyrics, whatever the voice of the person, those should fit the instruments, not the instruments to fit the vocals or whatever... well, that's my opinion.  While this early sound of Depeche Mode has faded out somewhat, it still remains an essential album for the collectors of 80's music, wave and electronica. It's one of the great ancestors of today's electronically based music, and remains a classic for ages to come. And for 80's buffs like me, we simply "Just Can't Get Enough" of it. 
 If you want recipes for old fashioned candy and such, this is a good reference.  However recipes have changed radically in the last decade so the use of butter as a main ingredient has gone down in favor.  Also classic American cooking tends to  be fattening and bland.  New cookbooks use fresh ingredients and different methods of adding flavor besides using butter and flour.  However the art of candy making and canning is not as prevelant, so I find this book useful for those aspects.  Unless you are a triathelete though, I wouldn't want to live on the recipes here.  American cuisine has come a long way and the classic Joy of Cooking demonstrates that to a tee 
 The book was short and very sweet. Though tragic, it was a coming of age for women caught up in superficial relationships.  Why is it that we don't know what we have until we lose it 
 I love this book so much!!! I refer to it quite often and use alot of the ideas in it. When I first started homeschooling my son everyone made me feel like I was doing something wrong. But It was the best decision I think I ever made. And the Moores really validate the many feelings homeschool parents have 
       Mike Leigh's organic masterpiece, Naked, is a raw, unflinching character study of a man on the run from himself and everyone around him.  The setting of his journey takes place in the midst of poverty and loss of social identity during the thick of the Thatcherism era.  With Naked, he integrates the environment into his narratives much more deliberately than most others.  We get a sense that Mr. Leigh has a lot to say.  He delivers biting commentary on society, and how it affects the relationships of its characters.  All of the characters could even be viewed as a fragmented alter ego of the director, acting as translators for all his pent up anger and honest views of society under Thatcher.  In a sequence of literary symbolism, in which the main character, Johnny, wanders through the grim, decaying streets of London, happens upon Archie, the Scotsman with a tick, who is pacing around violently, repeatedly shouting (for his girlfriend) "Maggie!" But, nobody answers.  That minor narrative device, speaks volumes about how Margaret Thatcher (i.e. Maggie) doesn't respond to her people, due to the lack of involvement on the wellbeing of the middle and lower-class society.     The environment, in which he creates, becomes a crucial factor in transcending his message, and by doing this he creates more depth and universal meaning in his stories.  A process that defines this realism is his approach to creating his narrative through lengthy improvisations during the development process.  He never reveals his intentions to the story until he captures, and then creates the characters, in an organic manner.  Although Naked is a fairly heavy movie by mainstream standards, its subject matter is highy socially relevant, emotionally moving, tragically beautiful and strongly acted by its leading and supporting characters.  David Thewlis's performance is simply brilliant.  The collaboration of Leigh and Thewis during their extensive creative process and character developement conjures up a truly realistic and unforgettable character study through improvisation.  Mike Leigh planted the seeds, but David Thewlis' breathed life into Johnny and immortalized him.    If you are passionate about films, this movie should not be missed.  One of the best british films of all time, in the prominent era of British independent cinema.   
 This is a great investment! Duane starts out with a great slide guitar in "Statesboro Blues" You almost feel like you are at the concert. I also love the 20 minute "You don't love me"....It just makes you want to get up and dance, especially during the guitar break."Elizabeth Reed" is a 10 minutes of jazz.... and what blues concert would be complete without T-Bone Walkers sexy "Stormy Monday" Gregg Allmans voice sounding smooth like melted butter 
 Security Analysis is the most important book ever written about the subject. It should be mandatory to read this book prior to getting any security license.   Sven Klein, Santa Barbara, C 
 There are many good books on flyfishing, but only a very few that make it to great.  This is one of the latter.  For this book, McGuane received the coveted Roderick Haig-Brown Award for Literature from the Federation of Fly Fishers.  The Longest Silence is the finest book on fly fishing that I have read. 	The style of a novelist is brought fully to these pages, offering a wonderful sense of place that all successful novelists must have.  For this died in the wool trout fisherman, even the title essay, which is on permit fishing, was a wonderful read.  I have never seen a permit, have no strong desire to catch one, and probably will never try, but even that essay on a subject so foreign to me, rang as true as any essay can.  McGuane's talent is absolutely marvellous 
 It's hard to outdo yourself when you're Gordon Wood, but he nevertheless proves himself yet again with this book.  So many books on the founding of America focus on the war itself or the political problems facing the writers of the Constitution( i.e. slavery, states' rights, etc).  Others, like Jack Greene in "Pursuits of Happiness", make further inroads by laying out the conditions and developments which led to the mindset of the 1776 American patriot.  But Wood goes even further, brilliantly outlining the development of the social thought of the day, the social thought which, in its time, was more revolutionary than any war of independence.    Perhaps Wood's greatest point in this book is that America's social revolution was natural, and occured over the space of decades.  He rightly lends creedence to the idea that this slow introdution and infusion of values and institutions was crucial to making them stick.  In contrast, we have the French Revolution, where an entire society was "re-moralized" head to toe, imposed from the top down, in the space of a few months.    Wood's title is a bit misleading.  We today think of the word "radical" in negative terms, the image of rabbles of unbathed psuedo-anarchists burning down fast food restaurants.  It is not Wood's intention to compare the mindset of 18th Century America with modern armchair revolutionaries.  But for its time, the mindset of 18th Century America was indeed quite radical in comparison with that of continental Europe.  The fact that this mindset arose peacefully and naturally, and not forced by elitist do-gooders, is perhaps what makes it so radical 
 Overall, this was a great book, but there were several drawbacks.  The author writes in a very scientific way, and puts so much information into one paragraph-long sentence that, having no time in the middle to pause and  recollect and sort what you have read, in some places it was very difficult  to understand.  Because of this, several chapters were very slow reads for  me.  The author also employs the use of many large, scientific words, and I  found myself constantly running for my dictionary.  Although this did  present a problem in some cases, the book very educational and i feel all  the wiser for my persevering through it.  If you have the time and patience  to go through it slowly, it is well worth the money 
 Laura may be Pa's little half-pint, but, living on the prairie, even being a child doesn't stop you from having to take part in daily chores to help the family. However, when Pa and Ma decide to pack up the wagon and head west, Laura, along with her older sister, Mary, finds herself excused from the daily regimen of quilting, and slaving over a hot stove all day, and instead finds herself smack dab in the middle of an adventure under the blue skies as the Ingalls family set off for Kansas territory. Kansas territory is full of wide-open land lush with wild animals, and perfect acreage made especially for settling on - and that's just what Pa intends to do. While the trip is bumpy, and often dangerous, as there are rapids to cross, and horse thieves to avoid, the Ingalls family find the perfect spot to establish their homestead, and Pa gets to work building a house fit for a king, and his four queens, while Ma spends her days cooking meals, and Laura and Mary divide their time between watching Baby Carrie, helping with chores, and playing with their beloved Jack. However, once the cabin is built, and the Ingalls family finally begin to feel settled, trouble comes lurking in the shape of the government and Indians. Laura finds herself frightened at how close the Indians travel to her new home, and is even more terrified when they demand things of Ma - such as food and tobacco. What was once a dream come true, is now turning into a nightmare - not just for the children, but for Ma and Pa, as well. Now, Pa, with the help of their new neighbors, and friends, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Scott, feels that it is up to them to learn more about what the government plans on doing to protect them from the Indians, while, at the same time, staying on the Indians good side to prevent a war from starting.  While the first two LITTLE HOUSE books - LITTLE HOUSE IN THE BIG WOODS and FARMER BOY - kept the prose peaceful and light, and stayed away from turmoil, LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE begins to introduce the dangers of frontier-life to readers, illustrating not only problems with the government and the Indians surrounding them, but also bringing talk of sickness, such as malaria, to light, giving readers a more accurate - if not slightly harsher view - of the world of Laura Ingalls. As in previous books, Laura Ingalls Wilder illustrates each and every aspect of prairie life in an easy-to-understand language that can be enjoyed by readers of all ages, male or female. Her descriptions of the hardships she encountered as her family crossed the Kansas territory are nerve-wracking; while her ability to recount everything from how, exactly, Pa built their home from scratch, and the excitement of having real glass windows in their home (something we often take for granted) brings a sense of joy to the reader. Those who read the two previous installments will love the addition of new characters to the tale - such as the kind-hearted Mr. Edwards. I also adored the character of Mr. Edwards on the LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE TV show, and was ecstatic to see him introduced to readers on paper here. His jovial personality, and bright outlook on life, along with his tenderness towards Laura, Mary, Baby Carrie, and even Ma and Pa are splendid, and really bring his kind spirit to life. The perfect way to relive the innocence of simpler times.  Erika Sorocco Freelance Reviewer 
 The Wailers had perfected their groove, and what a groove it was. Heavy, heavy, heavy. This groove apeared in full force in their live shows - Live at the Rainbow is a beauty. Tough and driving rhythms non-stop, the Wailers demonstrate why their brand of reggae conquered the world. Nice little mini-documentary comes with the live concert DVD.  Funny thing though - Aston "Familyman" Barrett was in many ways the "engine" that drove the Wailers sound. But the camera seems to avoid him in the concert footage. He's barely seen at all. Its like he's not there. Wonder why. Familyman is The Man, and it would have been nice to see less of Bob and more of him. Actually, the way the concert is filmed is a little too Bob-centred, but who cares, the music is kicking 
  Marcus Honeysett has written an engaging and important primer on postmodernism, a subject that typically resists lucid introductions. While other books by evangelicals put postmodernist thought into historical and intellectual context, they often lack the requisite apologetic critique so evident in "Meltdown." Yet a successful Christian apologetic requires the refutation of the postmodernist denial of objective truth and normative rationality. This is because apologetics must appeal to rational arguments to defend the objective truth revealed in the Bible. Without objective truth (or what Francis Schaeffer called "true truth") and rationality, apologetics has no tools with which to work.  "Meltdown" is an extraordinary book for at least two reasons. First, the author's assessment of postmodernism (the philosophy) and postmodernity (the set of contemporary cultural conditions in the West) is dead-on. Unlike not a few evangelical authors, Honeysett discerns that postmodernism is not our great liberation from modernist metanarratives. Rather it is a truth-denying, authority-denying philosophy set against the truths authoritatively revealed in Holy Scripture and in Jesus Christ. Instead of fruitfully opening people to all kinds of spirituality (Christianity included), postmodernity discourages rational discourse, is hostile to Christian truth-claims, and encourages relativism and philosophical pluralism. Against the flow of many evangelical trendsetters, Honeysett has not made his peace with postmodernism-and for this we should be grateful.    Second, Honeysett states his case in an understandable but intellectually responsible and deeply challenging fashion. This combination of being both accessible and accurate on challenging topics is indeed rare. (He also exhorts when needed, which is refreshing in a book not lacking in academic substance.) This is no simple task when dealing with such daunting themes and authors as complex (and often opaque) as Derrida, Baudrillard, Foucault, and Butler. Honeysett navigates the conceptual terrain deftly, summarizing difficult material without over-simplifying, analyzing it logically (often exposing internal contradictions in postmodernist theory), and assessing it biblically. He shows a knack for discerning just where postmodern thought collides with Christian truth, why this matters (and not just to academics), and what we should think about it.   It is encouraging that postmodernism is vigorously opposed by a number of Christians, especially among those leading the renaissance in Christian philosophical work in the analytic tradition-a tradition that is antithetical to the continental waters in which postmodernism was spawned.  Yet too many evangelical theologians have been accommodating to postmodernism in significant ways.   Honeysett's treatment of Jean Baudrillard (who is something like an updated French nihilistic version of Marshall McLuhan) is, to my knowledge, the only Christian critique of this important thinker who challenges the very notion of objective reality in our media-saturated environment. Baudrillard has recently emitted some egregious statements about the twin towers of the World Trade Center committing suicide on September 11, 2001,  which some have taken as grounds for dismissing him without reflection or critique. But despite his penchant for flamboyance and his tortuous prose, Baudrillard is a thinker with which to reckon.   Honeysett also keenly assesses key aspects of postmodern culture, which is every bit as important to understand as postmodernist philosophies. Few may read the philosophers, but all imbibe the culture. First, Honeysett investigates the postmodern ethos of the university culture-something he knows well as a thoughtful campus minister-and shows how to respond to it with integrity and intellect. I especially appreciated this advice in light of my twelve years of involvement in campus ministry. Sadly, evangelical campus ministries often fail to engage the intellects of students, leaving them prey to "arguments and every proud obstacle raised up against the knowledge of God" (2 Corinthians 10:5).  This must change if Christianity is to win a fair hearing on intellectual matters.   Second, in discussing "postmodern Bible reading," Honeysett rightly argues that too many Christians have swallowed a postmodernist rejection of all objective authority, which has corrupted their understanding of the Bible as God's authoritative revelation of objective truth. The answer is to return to Scripture as the ultimate source for truth; it should not be deemed a subjective, self-help tool. This cannot be underscored too strongly. A popular and contemporary evangelical writer claims that a strong view of biblical authority is merely a modernist invention that postmodernist Christians should throw off as an aberration.  This leaves the Christian in the postmodern ocean with neither an anchor nor a rudder for navigating the intellectual storms of the day. The question of biblical authority is a crucial issue at all times. Postmodernism has not rendered it a moot point.  Third, Honeysett notes that postmodern ideas have similarly undermined a biblical understanding of the church, which is too often viewed as more of a consumer item than as an institution founded by the divine Son of God for his glory (Matthew 16:13-19). Since American evangelicals are notoriously weak on ecclesiology (given their proclivity for individualism, innovation, and parachurch entrepreneurialism), this reminder comes as a needed tonic.   Fourth, Honeysett forthrightly attacks postmodern influence in culture as "immoral," because it rejects God and fills the void with the autonomous self and its God-denying principles. Although he does not quote him, Pascal's warning fits the spirit of Honeysett's critique. "When everything is moving at once, nothing appears to be moving, as on board ship. When everyone is moving toward depravity, no one seems to be moving, but if someone stops he shows up the others who are rushing on, by acting as a fixed point"   Fifth, Honeysett observes that a leading engine of the postmodernist rejection of truth and authority is television, in both its nature and its content. Christians should, therefore, engage it critically and carefully and not be swept away with its unreality (as Baudrillard warns). Honeysett is one of the few evangelicals who understands that communication media are not neutral, but invariably shape their content according to their form. As McLuhan said, "The medium is the message." As long as evangelicals have their minds shaped by the medium of television (which favors the graphic over the textual and the titillating over the edifying), they will remain intellectually enfeebled and unable to discern and disarm the deceptions of postmodernism.  Honeysett concludes this rousing and thoughtful primer by emphasizing the need to proclaim the "authentic Jesus" in a postmodern world of pluralism, syncretism, and outright hostility to the gospel. The authentic Jesus must be presented to the watching world in terms of a fully biblical and philosophically defensible concept of truth, a concept that cuts against the grain of postmodernism. While so many evangelicals scavenge for food among postmodernist philosophies, the worldview outside of Christianity that is gaining the most adherents has no truck with postmodernism whatsoever. It wins converts and promotes a view of civilization based on the concept of authoritative, universal, absolute, and objective truth. That worldview is Islam.   My hope is that Meltdown will be read and discussed by high school seniors in preparation for college, Christian university students and campus ministers, and by anyone who wants to make sense of the postmodern world and speak to it in the name of Jesus Christ, who is nothing less than the Truth Incarnate and the only hope for erring mortals east of Eden (John 14:6).  
 Tom Selleck and Don Ameche give a sterling performance in the flick.   Tom especially should of got an award for his part.   Superb, don't omit adding this one to your DVD library.  
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book by Ben Barnes, even as a diehard Republican and former Republican congressional aide. It is well written, concise, and tells a story that moves along quickly and keeps the reader's attention since there are no extraneous details to bog one down. The story is one of Barnes's meteoric rise through the ranks of Texas Democrat politics, after graduating fron the University of Texas, as state house member, Lieutenant Governor, and candidate for Governor - all the while serving as a sounding board and kitchen cabinet member for President Lyndon Baines Johnson and Governor John Connally. It is also the story of how the LBJ and Connally Democrat machine in Texas ultimately gave way to the John Tower/George H.W. Bush/George W. Bush/Karl Rove Republican machine. Barnes also tells the interesting story of his part in the controversial placement of George W. Bush in the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War.  There is very little Democrat partisan posturing, and such occurs only at the very end of the book, where I think Barnes could do a better job of admitting, reporting, and codemning (despite his experience as a target of the Richard Nixon enemies list) the politics of personal destruction that both parties have practiced. I would have also liked to see Barnes report more about the conversion of John Connally from LBJ Democrat to Richard Nixon Republican given how much time he spent with Connally as a political crony and business partner.  It seems to me that Barnes tells some wise political lessons that national politicians of all stripes can learn from - keeping discourse and debate civil, reaching out to those on both flanks, building individual relationships, establishing personal trust and integrity, and choosing policies from both conservative and progressive spectrums in order to attract the broadest possible coalition - especially in an era where an undeclared war (in Iraq) threatens to undermine current Republicans much as it did the Democrats and LBJ in the 1960s.  I can understand why LBJ thought and spoke so highly of Barnes, who clearly has a gift and passion for politics. His stories are fascinating and include many sagacious political observations that those interested in history and public policy can learn a lot from 
 This series of books from Night Shade are outstanding for their depth and the quality of the final product. If you are a keen collector these books will become prized additions to your library 
 We fell in love with this push toy at the store after our little guy, who at the time was only 7 months, started pushing this around.  We have watched him tackle crawling and standing up really early so he's been an old pro for a couple months at those things and we were looking for a good push walker.  This is by far the most sturdy one we tested.  It works great on our carpet and on our hardwood.  It doesn't get going too fast out from under him yet and it does have little things for him to spin if he's sitting on the ground.  Eventually we'll get him a ride on push toy but this is a great start.   Everyone comments on it when they are over about how cute looking and durable it is.    
 As I reflect on the playwright "Our Town," I just want to make clear on how good of a message it gave out.  The message that I got from the book was to live life to the fullest.  You never know when you're going to die, it could be today, tomorrow, or next year.  Life is too short, but over all I felt that the book was a great piece of writing.  The playwright was well written and the message was put into the writing very well 
 This is a great reference guide! My husband and I are Disneyland fanatics - we live about 15 minutes away and go at least every other weekend. Now that we have a five month old daughter, we have found the book to be even more invaluable (example: both Disneyland and California Adventure have these amazing baby/child care centers with changing tables, high chairs, private booths for breast feeding, facilities for warming bottles and teeny tiny potties for the little ones). However, unless you know they're there, you might never find them. Thank heavens for this book. The information regarding the best time of year to go and which rides are suitable for which ages is also invaluable. Before our daughter was born we took our four year old niece to the park a lot. The guides in the book for age ranges were much more accurate than our own judgment of what she would enjoy and what she might find scary. If nothing else,the statistics for the "Chuck Bubba relay" are worth the book's weight in gold. How else could you possible endure going on Dumbo 15 times in a row? As for information regarding ride closures, I would check out www.mouseplanet.com just before your trip - they have a weekly update of what's going on in the parks, as well as lists of ride closures and special events. Our best advice for visiting Disneyland? DON'T try to do it all in one day. If you're tired or your kids are tired, take a break. Because we often go to the parks in the late afternoon/early evening, we have seen literally hundreds of miserable families who are worn out and getting on each other's nerves by the end of the day, and this was supposed to be their "dream vacation." 
 I love it. What a lovely tribute to Marvin and his music. My boss even likes it.   
 The best resource of it's kind for anyone interested in getting back to the "roots" of Shakespeare. If Amazon allowed half stars, I'd take off half a star for it's price.  It's too expensive to be accessible to students, the people who could get the most usage and benefit out of this fantastic book 
 Stereo it's not, but it's the real thing. Listening to the Original Broadway production brought back all the joy I had when I first heard all those memorable tunes. The CD has cuts from the movie version, but they pale in comparison with the performance and voices of Robert Alda, Vivian Blaine and Sam Lavene. No one could reproduce the humor and power of Vivian's "Adelaid's Lament" or "Take Back Your Mink", or Stubby Kaye's "Guys and Dolls". All was as I remembered; a thoroughly enjoyable classic 
 I completely disagree with the last comment. The book does not "omit" anything that actually happened. It does however "omit" the fantasies that have been propagated by historians like David S. Wyman. In his book "The Abandonment of the Jews" he falsifies many historical events in order to further his own agenda.   What Rosen has done is eliminate the dramatics from the actual historical event. Yes, obviously the Holocaust was a tragic event, but victimizing an entire race, while criminalizing the leaders is a very black and white way to approach the subject.   I would also like to note, that this book is written in a very scholarly manner. The average reader would not pick this book up so clearly this book was not written in hopes of "lucrative" gains.   The author also tends to grasp military history which many historians tend to neglect. This is clear in the sense that many authors ask why the US did not bomb the rail road tracks leading to Auschwitz. Anyone who understands military history knows the uselessness of those efforts at the time, the technology simply was not there. On top of that the German army could certainly fix a railroad track! So many books on the holocaust are critical about things that would never have been done.   Thank you to Rosen for setting the record straight. This is truly a masterpiece of the highest caliber of research. There is no agenda for this book, it is a clear representation of historical fact. The book was greatly needed, and hopefully will find success 
 Vince Vaughn is good at playing characters with different personalities. He plays a man who is an industrialist but in secret is a extortioner and a murderer. Danny, his stepson discovers that he has murdered Ray Coleman, a guy who makes his living doing shady dealings. Danny isn't believed because he has been known throughout Southport as a menace who has been in trouble with the law. The only person who believes him is his father.  John Travolta already proves how talented he is in the movie. He plays a third-generation shipbuilder in the city who struggles to maintain his business and have a good relationship with his son. He is the only one who believes Danny and is willing to unmask the man that is "the pillar of the community".  This movie is a good movie overall 
 I have really loved this set.  It looks great, cleans easily, and I love cooking with it.  You really need to use a lower heat setting when cooking, but once I got used to that I haven't had any problems 
 This was my first Patricia Highsmith book, and I, too, picked it up because I had seen the movie "The Talented Mr. Ripley". I couldn't find that book, so started with this one. It took a while to "get into" the story, but I was quickly compelled. The one drawback: too many french phrases that I had to spend time either trying to figure out from the context of the sentence or look up the meanings from the on-line french-to-english dictionaries. Some words just weren't there. Mon dieu! Aside from those irritations, I found the story to be fascinating, particularly with Tom's relationships to those around him. Heloise, for instance. Sometimes, it seemed like she viewed him with antagonism or thinly veiled contempt. Her responses were too cool at times. Not like a wife. Why don't they sleep together? Is there more about their relationship in previous books? I thought the relationship with the friend that came over from England was also interesting. I so enjoyed the scene where they witness the Pritchards falling into their pond. You could truly sense Tom's utter delight that his nemesis was going to drown! I loved it! And how he had to tame his obvious enthusiasm so that his friend wouldn't find him totally reprehensible! Brilliant writing. I will definitely read more of her books and am sad the series is over 
 This is beyond bad, beyond atrocious, beyond -- words fail me.  It is impossible to describe, other than to say that it's metal like you never heard before and hope never to hear again.  It's metal that your mother would like - that's how bad it is.  And yet, it's utterly compelling.  No head-banging, long-haird, stuck-in-the-70's metalhead should miss this CD.  I mean, Dio duets with Pat Boone - is that a disturbance in the Force, or what? Like an auditory train wreck, you really won't be able to tear your ears away from it (at least the first time).  And then you can give it to your very sweet 80-year-old mom.  
 In this portrayal of the famous ballad of Mu Lan ,or Fa Mulan as some call her, a story of a young woman who saves China is depicted.  She puts her life in danger to protect the life of her father by taking his place in the  draft.  This very moving and heart warming poem is very well written and a  must read if you are interested in the story at all.  Its good to see the  real work that the movie was based on.. 
 This is a great book on ribbon flowers.  The author explains how to make the flowers so it is easy to follow and you have a flower like hers when you finish.  I highly recommend this book 
 I don't think this author hit one out of the park with "The Crisis of Islam."  Most of this book was written before the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the downfall of Saddam Hussein, and it is obvious that Bernard Lewis was proposing that we should indeed invade and take down this repressive regime.  As Professor Elhadj puts it in his book, "The Islamic Shield,"  "...on April 9, 2003 the US army won the battle against a tattered Iraq.  But, Iran, without firing a shot won the war for Iraq."   Perhaps the Iraqi invasion wasn't such a good idea, after all.  I would definitely recommend "The Islamic Shield" over this book for its pragmatic suggestions on how to deal with terrorists.   Bernard Lewis is less interested in practical approaches to countering fundamentalist regimes, than he is in the history and philosophy behind the (mostly) unequal relationships between Muslims and non-Muslims.    The inward flow of oil to the West and the outward flow of money to repressive Muslim regimes are the roots of much evil in the Middle East.  As the author puts it, "The custodianship of the holy places and the revenues of oil have given worldwide impact to what would otherwise have been an extremist fringe in a marginal country."  Saudi Arabia funds and controls the education of Muslim minorities in many countries, most controversially in the West, because of the reluctance of governments to involve themselves in religious matters--at least before 9/11.  The extremist Wahhabi sect is providing indoctrination in "private schools, religious seminars, mosque schools, holiday camps and, increasingly, prisons" all over the world.  The profound inequity of wealth in the Middle East has "created new and receptive audiences of Wahhabi teachings and those of like-minded groups, among them the Muslim Brothers in Egypt and Syria and the Taliban in Afghanistan."   How can the West counter this form of 'muscular' Islam and win the hearts and minds of its adherents?  Indeed, is it possible?  The slaughter of innocent, uninvolved citizens seems to have become the prime objective of the madrasa-trained terrorists.  How can we or moderate Muslims counter that bias toward bigotry and violence?  Better education is certainly one of the keys, which is why Iraqi terrorists are slaughtering professors and the Taliban is busy blowing up schools that the British and American troops had rebuilt.  Bernard Lewis also advises us to stop supporting repressive regimes--even to the point of throwing them out, as was the plan in Iraq.  He believes that "the war against terror and the quest for freedom are inextricably linked, and neither can succeed without the other."  I too would like to believe that's what we're fighting for in Iraq and Afghanistan, but somehow that credo seems a bit oversimplified now that we've been in Iraq for almost four years.  Read "The Crisis of Islam" so that you can make up your own mind on this life-or-death topic.  
 get this gun but dont even concider getting the elecric version its a huge waste of cash. there like $70 -$80 and they only get about 20 feet of range when u point it at a 45 degree angle up. yeah its that bad. but this gun shoots good 
 ... but my brother lent me his copy of the book after he lost 16 kg on the diet and I thought, what the heck, let's give this a go. When I actually reading the book I was surprised- my conception of the atkins diet had been very misinformed.   what more can I say?  I cut carbs. I Followed The Program and didn't run off and follow my own twisted version of the diet. I exercised (60 min walk a day plus 3 hours intense workout per week)  and voila  lost 21 kg in 4 months  maybe you can too if you actually stick to what he wrote?  hope so   
 I bought this after fidning my 2nd child who is 4 months old caught under the headboard bumper that came with his bedding.  This is my 2nd child & I have never been told of this danger.  I highly recommend this bumper.  It comes in 2 pieces, the shorter one goes across the front railing that you move up & down, the longer piece goes from the last slat on the headboard to the last slat on the footboard.  There are only 2 gaps which are where the handles for the railing are.  I was also able to weave a few places along the sides to make sure he couldnt get underneath.  I love that it's wide so that it reaches down to the mattress, it velcros at each end across both the top & bottom for a tight fit, it will collapse if an older baby tries to step on it but is still very tight & that it's very breathable but still has a little cushion to it. I just wish that I had known of the danger of traditional crib bumpers.  Thankfully I heard my son screaming when I did.  HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT, or one like it to avoid suffocation hazard from stuffed bumpers 
       this movie was funny and it was emotional movie this movie is a good family movie 
 BEERSPIT NIGHT is an interesting entry into the volumes of Bukowski letters published by Black Sparrow. This is a venture between two people who were involved with Bukowski and Martinelli professionally and personally:  John Martin, publisher of BSP, and Steven Moore, the editor of this book, respectively. The correspondence is lively, Bukowski seems to have met his match, and enlightening. Bukowski, as Moore states, reveals more of his artistic and literary leanings with Martinelli than he did with anyone else he exchanged missives with (Martin and Bukowski's widow may be the only other people to have seen this side of him). The book appears to have been a labor-of-love for Moore, who knew Martinelli, and Martin shows his usual loving care with this book as he has with every other Buk book. The only problem I have encountered so far (at only 1/4 of the way through) is Moore's decision to leave much of the original purposeful misspellings and colloquialisms of both Bukowski and Martinelli. It becomes quite tiresome, like spending hours trying to solve word problems. And, for some reason the footnotes are not numbered, so many a reader may actually pass them over not realizing they're there.  Those who think they know everything about Bukowski might discover some revelations in these letters 
 This book was so wonderful I doubt I can decribe it. It's about Billy the Kid, Benjamen Sippy and Joe Lovelady. Sippy and Joe are Billy's proctectors and companions. My favorite charictor is Katie Garza. Billy was a little rough for me, but, then again, he was a bit diffrent when he died. Billy's death shocked me, and not all deaths do. What shocked me was not that he died, as anyone who has read the book will know, but HOW he died. This is a great book, that no one should pass up. -A McMurtry Fa 
 My hat is off to Michel Lacroix! I was surprised to find "Gay Men's Fiction" next to the title though. I, myself, am a stay-at-home mom from Texas and I truly thought it was a story that crossed the boundaries of such a classification. The story was vividly told- the characters came alive in my head and I found myself racing back for another chapter just to get better acquainted with them!  I loved being transported to NOLA, surrounded by these colorful creatures and their naughty exploits. Some characters were developed with a brilliant depth; they had a devil-may-care bravado on the outside and then tender moments of almost breath-taking sadness. The story had a timeless, honest quality about it. Again, it transcended the sexual borders of its subject and was beautifully and simply, a love story. It is so much more than just a gay man finding himself- it is for anyone who has ever struggled with the expectations of family or society. It's a study of the chains that come with wealth and privilege. The themes are for every gender, for all of us who feel pressure to conform. I just happen to have the skeleton of a domineering father in my own closet!  A skillfully crafted story, Alex in Wonderland is a sincere depiction of Southern gentility and how one man rises above the phony trappings of a modern aristocracy. I'm hoping it will be a series and that Alex will return tout sweet!! 
 I very much enjoyed this travel book! I especially like the lead-in, Stanley does not just drop into Mongolia - he leads the reader across Asia and into Mongolia through history and beautiful transitions. It is tough to believe he passed up so many female opportunities. But I am hoping he was just being British! I enjoyed his positive humorous outlook on all the people that crossed his path 
 Personally, I thought this film was brilliant!  When I first saw it a few years back I admit that I didn't like it much, it seemed rather stupid to think that a robot could 'become' human, but on viewing it again years later, I can safely say that I missed the whole point of this film.  Andrew is a robot to begin with, but one with feelings and the ability to learn. He wants to learn, wants to talk, wants to create, and through some mistake when he was being created he can. His unique ability, mixed with his owners kindness and help allow him to grow up like a real human, by learning, having memories, caring about his family etc.  This film shows Andrew's aim to become human, and follows his life from when he first became the 'machine' of the Martin family, to when he finally fell in love with their youngest daughters grand child, and becomes human to die beside her on their death beds.  It is a sad movie, with a few tear jerking parts (especially at the end) and it asks a lot of questions which we don't often think about, like can robots have feelings, can they love, and can they become human? In the end, what does defy whether you are a human or not, is it being born with the right, or can you earn the title.  This is a definite 5 for me. true, it is a very long film and the start can drag on a bit, but it is a beautiful tale that I believe everyone should watch at least once 
     Management of workers to accomplish organizational tasks predates even the bible. Virtually every field has a organizational structure and management philosophy - even if they don't explicitly state it and some may not even know it! Prior to the modern age, most people simply managed in whatever ad hoc way they thought was best - no one really studied how effective different methods of management were. But as organizations grew in both size and complexity, effective management became synonymous with more profits from higher productivity and less waste.   Dr. Wren traces the evolution of management history and thought - exploring the early ideas of what people believed was effective and how these philosophies changed as more ideas came into the field and as technology changed the way we work. This book is for anyone serious about understanding management philosophy - where it's been, where it is, and where it's going 
 After reading this book, I can very quickly set up dynamic web sites built upon a MySQL database. In one weekend I created a new website that displays information from a database. The next weekend I built in a content management system so my client could update it on their own. I'm very impressed with the quality of this book series and the author, so much so, that I will likely purchase the other books by Ullman as reference. Well done 
 Simply one of the best books I've ever read!  You have to read it to understand.  It's written from the perspective of a living dinosaur---a raptor---by an author who loves dinosaurs and has an incredible ability to recreate the world in which they lived.  Read it and you'll never forget it!  Has my highest recommendation 
 i love denise, she always gives me a good work out, and this tape is no different. if your looking to tone up your arms i would highly recomend this work out tap 
 I felt the fear coming out in Freeman's 'Lay This Body Down'.  This true story gives you an idea of what blacks had to endure in the south before the civil rights movement began.  It's a chilling account of how 11  plantation slaves were brutally murdered by the hand of one of their own  and the white plantation owner.  It confirms through the fact of  peonage-slave labor, and brutal punishment, just how unjust the south was  in the early part of the 20th century.  There are gruesome details that  left me a bit uneasy, but....justice does prevail.  As unsettling as this  true story may be, it is a subject that should be recognized and  remembered 
 I love how the text reads, even more so than the brilliant illustrations.  I love to read this text first and then play Heather Forest's musical adaptation of this story (see Heather Forest's Sing Me a Story) 
 This album has a good tracklist, but several key tracks are missing, including Woodstock, Ohio and Country Girl. Actually, I'd get the group's first two albums (CSN and Deja vu) instead, but that's just me 
 Michael Ruhlman has a key to the secret lives and passions of some of the world's greatest chefs.  This tripartite work lets the reader into the lives of several chefs, some inspired and some not so inspired.  Although of passing interest, the middle part could be left out and the book would probably be improved. The book culminates with Ruhlman's long standing relationship with Chef Thomas Keller, owner and chef of The French Laundry during the time that he was writing Chef Keller's two cookbooks.  Recommended reading for any serious foodie or anyone ITB.  (... 
 This was a wonderful book, beautifully written by a magnificent actor.   The stories and the memories were so real, and honest.  I could only have  hoped that the book was longer and that Gabriel would have shared more with  all of us.  Then again, everyone needs to keep some memories their own.   Thanks for sharing your touching and humorous look at life 
 I ordered this based on a review I read on Justin Roberts.  I had never heard him actually sing before.  My daughter loves this album, and I find myself singing right along as well.  His songs are catchy, humorous, and tell about life from a kid's point-of-view very well.  I highly recommend it 
 As a theatre student, I found Hornby's book to be, at first irreverent, and at times absurd (with all those references to Freud and the "oceanic feelings," "the pleasure principle").  Honestly, you have to read the book to get the connections!Anyway, as I  continued to read, I kept an open mind. I read the book not as a Method  actor, but as a kid who enjoys learning and reading about a variety of  viewpoints. In the end, I found the book to be incredibly worthwhile. I  learned a great deal from it. He asks many questions in his book, such as:  Is acting an art form? Can anyone act? He makes references to  Brecht,Grotowski,and Diderot. He obviously is a very learned man, who had  an eclectic range of sources available to him. By far, his annototated  bibliography was extremely helpful when it came time for me to research the  craft on my own. Yes, he puts Strasberg to shame, but I believe it was  Stella Adler who when Strasberg was laid to rest, muttered, "That man  set American theatre back 100 years.&quot 
 The 2nd book in the series is just as good as the 1st one, following the mission from Romulas, the Titan crew start their mission to explore the furtherest part of our Milky Way Galaxy, the run into "alien" species that is "harvesting" the "star-jellies" from the NG "Encounter at Farpoint" and that is not all they find, they find more interesting species.  Now Riker and the crew of the Titan must find away to re-balance the hunt for the species native to this area to survive 
 We just checked this book out from the library and I'm planning on buying it now. It is a very cute book with great illustrations. My 3 year old wants to read it over and over. I would highly recommend it 
 The music seems very haunted. Aphex's more ambient textures mixed into the heavy hitting techno terrain make this a strange listen. It doesn't really sound dated......just a bit outside of time really. Very dislocated - almost like the guy surfing out on seashore on his own at the back of the cover ( you'll notice him - he's practically circled around ).   All in all, I can't think of anyone else who would make this sort of album. It is ( without wanting to make a pun ) totally out on it's own 
 There isn't one song i dont like on this album. Never dead is my favorite song. and i like saliva the next best 
 This CD features two Beach Boys albums from late 1963/early 1964.  Surfer Girl was the Beach Boys' third album, and the first one to be (officially) produced by Brian Wilson.  It features the hit songs "Surfer Girl", "Little Deuce Coup" and "In My Room".  There are also some great album tracks, most notably "Catch a Wave" and "Hawaii".  But the album also features some "filler", like "South Bay Surfer" and "The Rocking Surfer".  Shut Down Volume 2 was the Beach Boys' fifth album. (Shut Down Volume 1 was a various artists album featuring two Beach Boys songs.)   The hits this time around were "Fun, Fun, Fun" and "Don't Worry Baby".  The most noteworthy album cut is the classic "The Warmth of the Sun".  This album also features a fair amount of filler, including "Cassius Love vs. Sonny Wilson' and "Denny's Drums".  The CD has three bonus tracks, which don't really add anything significant to the CD.  While these albums are far from perfect, it's good that the Beach Boys "two-fers" are back in print 
 this is just another great olivia story.  my children love the slightly spooky part (when olivia finds the missing toy and the culprit) and i love the toy as repaired by olivia.  falconer is a genius 
 A very gifted watercolor artist, Gordon MacKenzie's talents as a teacher really come through in his book.  He has saved the watercolor artist from many pitfalls, with his in depth guide to paint characteristics and qualities of different paints by brand.  The book contains many helpful tips on techniques, as well as "how to" lessons. The Watercolorist's Essential Notebook contains many examples of Mr. MacKenzie's own work 
 Seven years before Guillermo Del Toro gave us "Hellboy" he gained himself a beachhead on the American horror movie front with "Mimic", 105 minutes of chilly, goopy, genuinely creepy high-tension nastiness that does what most New York apartment dwellers don't wanna do: checks behind the fridge.  Ever heard that expression, "for every one you see there's 100 more"? If you've lived in New York City you have: whether you live in a luxury high-rise with a doorman or a Bowery flophouse with communal toilets, you're going to deal with roaches. The city is infested. And for every one you see---every crawling, skulking, mottled brown little soldier trundling out from under the fridge---you can bet the little guy has one hundred buddies just waiting for the lights to go out.  Click-clock-click.   "Mimic" plunges right in to its icky little tub of spooky goo with what has to be the world's Worst Scientific Idea ever: in order to combat the virulent child-killing Strickler's Disease, which is spread by a New York cockroach plague, entomologist Dr. Susan Tyler (played with panache and conviction by Mira Sorvino)and some research pals from the CDC engineer a special hybrid bug.   Named the "Judas Bug", this little devil is a special combination of Mantid and Cockroach. Its modus operandi? It's awfully good at mimicrcy: drop it off in a cockroach hive, and it will draw the Strickler-infected roaches and poison them. Problem solved, New York's children saved.   Or are they? Cut to three years later: New Yorkers are disappearing in droves, and mysterious, shrouded figures are lurking around the subways and back alleys. Oh, and they like to make funny noises as they stalk their victims, noises like "click-clock-click". Sorvino gets back into the action when one of the Night Terrors comes clicking around her lab when she discovers a new specimen of super-sized mantid in the New York subway system, and things don't let up from there.   Let's cut right to Mimic's stylish, sleazy, richly atmospheric buggy heart: Guillermo Del Toro ("Cronos", "The Devil's Backbone", "Blade II") is a consummately gifted director with a fine sense of style, and "Mimic" gets its hands dirty from the start, delivering on the spooky, buggy fun, serving up gorgeous camera angles and a knack for the perfectly creepy shot. the sequence where a mildly autistic boy encounters the shrouded lurkers in a decrepit church, for instance, is one of the more genuinely horrific scenes ever committed to film. And best of all, "Mimic" has no bones about shredding cute little kids if it needs to---how often do you get that in a film these days?   The acting is all first rate, from a competent job by Sorvino to nice turns by Charles Dutton and the Giancarlo Giannini, and even a nice hot slice of gratuitous F. Murray Abraham, who classes things up a bit. But style and ghoulishly good atmosphere are the real stars of this spookshow, and Del Toro delivers the goods in creepy-crawly spades. All of the set pieces, particularly the climactic scene in the subway, are beautifully designed, and add to the film's sleazy, rotten, infested atmosphere.   For a nice paranoid jaunt into the crawling darkness, you can do far worse than "Mimic": just take along a super-sized can of Raid.  Click-clock-click 
 This is a wonderful resource for virtually anyone seriously committed to getting into better shape and/or improving his/her athletic performance.  Incorporated in one book are elements of weight training, Swiss Ball routines, pilates, plyometrics and "core training," as well as common sense advice on diet. The program is particularly good for individuals participating in competitive sports, as well as those simply trying to improve their health and/or lose weight.  I would NOT recommend this book to someone whose primary objective is to achieve large muscle mass gains, since that is not what the strength training routine is geared towards.  I would recommend this earlier book to the more recent "Core Performance Essentials," which in my view appears to be little more than a watered down version of "Core Performance."   
 Sean Watkins is already known for his musical abilities, being one third of the Grammy-winning group Nickel Creek. However, with this release Sean shows off his other talent, as a songwriter of incredible skill. There wasn't one track on this disc that I didn't enjoy, some were simple in their composition, others were much more complex, but they all had one thing in common: they were solid and provided a great listening experience.   Sean began with the piano when he was only six, and took years of classical instruction. He found the guitar a little later, and at the tender age of 16, he made it to the final round of the National Flatpicking Guitar Championships in 1993. Bluegrass was one of his first loves, and still means a great deal to him. However, Sean wanted to explore other avenues and genres, and has set out to do just that. Releasing his first solo album in 2001, an instrumental work, Sean has progressed to adding some fine vocals to his composing.   His interests take him through numerous genres, and that is reflected in the compositions on this release. 26 Miles is a testament to talent and what can happen when an artist doesn't get stuck into a genre, but explores what each has to offer. Each track is a work of art, and combined, you get a CD that you can listen to for years to come and not tire of. Although, I do hope that there will be a great deal more to come from this incredibly gifted musician.   On Ice begins the experience that is Sean Watkins. This song was one of the Game songs, that is, it was written in one day. This is an exercise Sean and his band developed to pass the time. They had to write one song a day, then play them for one another. The title was thought up the night before and they all had to write something suitable for it. While Sean didn't expect anything worthwhile to come of it, this is a track that contains the valuable "hook." The beat is fairly simplistic, but the lyrics hold worlds, and Sean's voice is the perfect vehicle to convey them.   Out of the thirteen songs on this release there are three instrumentals. N.M.I. (New Medium Instrumental) is one of them. It is a fast paced jazz kissed track that makes you stop and pay attention to it. This isn't a song to fade into the background in an elevator or office, like so many instrumentals are, this one delivers itself with a potency that is rare and wonderful to behold. Sean put a soprano sax and a fiddle together, and they fit like long lost lovers.   The title track, 26 Miles has a hint of hip-hop within its rhythm. It's a catchy piece, and started while Sean was walking on the beach. He'd apparently heard that if you stand next to a large body of water, you can see only 26 miles before the horizon bends. I love the oceanside, so this became a quick favourite.   All thirteen tracks are brilliantly put together, and you won't be disappointed in this CD. Even the accompanying booklet is filled with some great touches, pictures and brief explanations for each track, as well as the lyrics, and a look at some of the musicians and at Sean himself.  26 Miles is a must have for any music lover.

 A great supplemental tool for teachers! I had terrific fun with my 6th grade math students  when reading them certain passages in this book. Many of the topics covered, such as factorials, hexidecimals, triangular  numbers, pi, primes, etc. are not generally covered in the middle school  very well or at all, and this book serves as a great launching tool for  discussions that kids enjoy and think about long after class is over.   Also, many topics go in depth and will challenge even the best high school  math students and take them in many directions that traditional math  education does not 
 My view of the world clearly owes a lot to Newton - especially as I have a scientific/engineering/mathematical background. Regretfully however, if Newton stood on the shoulders of giants to get his better view of how things are, I am struggling to get to Newtons waist. And as for Einstein.....  I enjoyed this book for its explanation of scientific and philosophical matters in a clear way that neither avoids complexities not swamps the reader in them.  But most of all I enjoyed the book for learning of the man - his strengths, his weaknesses, the things he indulged in, the things he avoided.  other recommendations: 'The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan' by Robert Kanigel  'The Man Who Loved Only Numbers : The Story of Paul Erdos and the Search for Mathematical Truth' by Paul Hoffman  'Newton: The Making of Genius' by Patricia Fara      
 Blood of the Prophets is an excellent example of the Mormon fraud. Mormonism is no more a Christian denomination than is radical Islam. Read this book to learn the truth about the dictator Brigham Young and the basic philosphy of the Mormon Church that survives today. The only thing that has changed is that the current Mormon leaders are probably not ordering hits on innocent people or descenting members of the Mormon Church. The corruption and anti-Christ character of this global monstrosity goes unchanged. I was an ultra-active Mormon for over 46 years. I was a  High Priest and Mormon temple worker in this fraudulent religion before I began to study outside the box of "approved Mormon dribble", where I readily discovered the truth. If you want to learn the truth about this era of Mormon history read this book 
 I love this book.  It has only 60 pages, but there is a wealth of information about the good doctor and the inspiration behind his books.  The writing style is easy to read and the full page illustrations are delightful.  I imagine the good doctor standing behind Maryanne Weidt (author) and Kerry Maguire (illustrator) saying 'tweak it a bit here or there; yes, now you've got it!'  I came into Dr. Seuss later in life (not during my childhood, but during my children's) and with each book I read, I enjoyed them more.  I have to admit, that I was not a fan while a child, but grew into the books - my favorite being 'Oh the Places You Will Go'.  I love reading Dr. Seuss books aloud.  I never knew Dr. Seuss' own life story, and this small book answers all my questions in the most delightful way.  I highly recommend it to anyone - child or adult - who would like to know the background of the famous author 
 Burt Lancasters showbiz start as acrobat is on display in this spirited adventure. Nick Cravat plays his mute sidekick and matches the young actors impressive moves, if not his million-watt smile. Lots of action and color fill this picture, and children should love it 
 This is one of contemporary fictions first books. It was written in the early eighties before Bridget Jones became a household name. It is a thoughtful novel about the breakup of a marriage. It is a quick read, but its not an earth-shattering premise. I recommend it for the beach or the bathtub 
 Director Jules Dassin, banished to Europe after being blacklisted from Hollywood for Communist sentiments, displayed superlative film directing acumen in his raw and tense masterpiece "Rififi".  Filmed in black and white, the movie was cinematographically awesome winding through the streets of Paris.  The plot was based on a meticulously conceived and flawlessly executed jewel heist masterminded by Tony le Stephanois played by the haggard looking Jean Servais.  The film is highlighted by a lengthy scene where the four man team works to secure entrance to the jewelry store in total silence.  Tension mounts as their predetermined time limit becomes exceeded and local shops are beginning to open for business.  Local police patrols become suspicious when they discover a car stolen by the gang outside the store.  The gang makes a clean getaway however Cesar la Milanais the safecracker played by Jules Dassin himself, decides to help himself to a ring not part of the booty in the safe.  He foolishly gives the ring to a sexy nightclub singer Viviana played by Magali Noel that he is smitten with.  This proves to be the downfall of the whole caper.  Soon all the well thought out plans come tumbling down.  Dassin once again proves in "Rififi" that he is an unquestioned master in the genre of film noir 
 In the Prologue to SOUTH OF THE CLOUDS, author Seth Faison tells a story about Farmer Yang's discovery of the famed terra cotta warriors near the city of Xi'an. Like much of this revealing look at the China few Westerners ever see, however, Mr. Faison's narrative is more than just a retelling of history. After years of being unrewarded and forgotten, Farmer Yang was hired to sign copies of tourist books about the excavation site. As Mr. Faison soon discovers, there are two Farmer Yang's working at competing stores. Which one is real, or is either of them the true discoverer? Mr. Faison finds the truth, but in doing so, we learn that the real Farmer Yang is being paid a paltry 280 yuan a month, about $35, for his services. Thus, in his first fourteen pages, the author demonstrates convincingly that we are embarking on a true insider's tour of a fascinating country.  In SOUTH OF THE CLOUDS, Mr. Faison describes his experiences as a student at Shaanxi Teachers University in Xi'an, then as a journalist in China for most of 1987 to 1999. He cuts his reportorial teeth at the Hong Kong Standard and the South China Morning Post, then moves to the New York Times where he works as a roving reporter out of Beijing before being elevated to Shanghai Bureau Chief.   Mr. Faison's writings are loosely connected vignettes, drawn from the wealth of people and events he experienced during China's economic and cultural opening in the 1990's. As a result, his stories range widely over the Chinese terrain, not just geographically, but also politically and culturally. We see up close and from the inside the events at Tiananmen Square in mid-1989, DVD piracy in Guangdong Province, the Falun Gong sect in Yunnan Province, the Chinese government's actions in Tibet, illegal immigration to the U.S. from Fujian Province, homosexuality in Shanghai, and transsexuality in Beijing. In each instance, however, Mr. Faison gives us more than just reportorial narrative. His are intensely personal stories, first-hand accounts of Chinese life told by the people who have been living them. We meet a policeman in Xi'an, a gay professor in Shanghai, a video pirate in Guangdong, a renowned transsexual choreographer, a Fujianese woman who risked everything to help send her husband to New York, and a Falun Gong practitioner whose life was changed by their version of qi gong.    The author's personal story connects these various threads into a whole cloth. As Mr. Faison learns more and more about Chinese culture and life, he grapples with issues in his own life: a sense of not being sufficiently masculine, fear of emotional closeness, need for acceptance as a Westerner in China, and a sense of meaning and purpose. His slow discovery of China coincides with his own discovery of self, a journey that leads him through sexual relationships with Chinese women, a near addiction to sauna massages, an intense relationship with the transsexual Jin Xing, and a flirtation with Buddhism resulting from a trip to Lhasa. A return visit to Tibet in search of the opportunity to witness a Whitmanesque sky burial appears to create the necessary epiphany, the "St. Paul struck by lightning" moment, when the author realizes he is ready to move on to the next stage of his life, to accept himself for what he is and to commit himself to another person.   SOUTH OF THE CLOUDS is an engaging and highly readable story of China, its people, and one man's struggle to understand both that world and himself. Mr. Faison gently recaps China's recent history through the stories of individual citizens, exposing everyday elements of Chinese culture as well as selected aspects of its underside. Having lived in China (Suzhou) off and on since 2001, I can attest to his deft touch in bringing the character of the country and its people to life. I sometimes felt I could see the people he met even as I read about them, imagining their faces and body language and behaviors.   As almost anyone who has spent real time in China will say, the experience is life-changing. Seth Faison illustrates how and why. I heartily recommend SOUTH OF THE CLOUDS to anyone seeking a deeper understanding of modern China and the life and culture and hopes and fears and dreams of its people.    
 It's hard to believe that kids would get excited about punctuation. But they do, when they read this book. A third-grader teacher I know is reading it to her class, and the students love it. One girl enthusiastically explained to me how that little tiny mark known as the comma distinguishes between something you eat at a baseball game and a furry friend who just over-exercised ("big hotdog" versus "big, hot dog"). This is the kids' version of the adult bestseller, and I highly recommend it 
 I purchased this breathalyser because I never really knew how many drinks it took to be over the limit.  DUI is vicious and extremely expensive.  Not a risk I was willing to take anymore.  So, now I know when it's safe to drive.  It works great.  I leave it in my car and use it weekly (along with most of my friends...usually for fun).  So, if you have ever wondered where you were "legally" at, here's the answer.  Don't get a DUI, it's stupid and not worth it.  Spend the money on this thing!  It's a good investment.  P.S.  If your wife is like mine, she'll be thrilled!  
 Yippee!  Not too often am I able to write a good review about a dating books for older women.  In fact, I can't remember the  last one that I liked.  But finally, a good one!  "Flings, Frolics, and Forever Afters: A Single Woman's Guide to Romance After Fifty" by Katherine E. Chaddock and Emilie  Chaddock Egan is a winner.  Here's what I liked about it:  This book was clearly written by two women over fifty who have been there and done that.  They know what they are talking about and know how to write -- yea! Chaddock and Egan do not talk down to their reader and do not infantalize us with cutsey cartoons  or think we won't see through shallow information.  This book is PACKED with information.  Granted, once in awhile, the authors do slip into some not-so-adorable labels like "The Pin Cushion" and "The Violin Player," but hey, none of us are perfect.  There's too much good in this book for me to pick out illistrations.  But I did particularly like what they called "the nightie slide" (pg. 174) for finessing the "getting naked" part.  I did NOT like "The Magnolia Principle - the full court girly push."  Could be because it came from a woman who lived in Oxford, Mississippi.  I'm in Florida now, but Mississippi is too recent in my memory to be able to romantisize Southern Belles.  So, I liked "Flings, Frolics, and Forever Afters" and recommend it to any single woman over 50 who is stepping into the dating fray.  It'll help, believe me!

 This dictionary is SO POWERFUL!  I literally will not go shopping for beauty products unless I have it with me as a quick reference.  I'm sure people at the mall or drugstore look at me like I'm insane, but I don't care because I have so much more money in my purse now that I'm not wasting my money on false claims on what a beauty product will do. For instance, why should you pay $30 for a pretty bottle of designer face cream.....when all it is composed of is a base of cheap, man-made mineral oil and water!?!  READ THE LABEL!!!  I highly recommend the next time you have the urge to buy that next luxury bath or body product, stop, get and read this book first, and then decide rather or not that product is worth all that money.  
 One of the best documentaries I have ever experienced. I use the word "experienced" on purpose, as the movie goes beyond being mere "entertainment", it forces the viewer to become so involved in the story (or case) that you become a thinking, analyzing participant. Andrew Jarecki made an achingly beautiful film, and his care and commitment to present the most unbiased version of events is evident. The dvd comes with an extra disc, containing lots of additional footage, facts, information and updates. After watching all of it, accessing the DVD-ROM content AND after listening to the commentary track by Jarecki, you will hit the internet in search of even more information of this compelling case. That is the truth. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
 For those with a narrow musical mind, (i.e. the 'top 40' variety) this would be an unbearable CD to have to sit through, but for those with more open musical tastes, particularly in the lineage of ambient, acid techno , then this CD is for you. The soundscapes and musical textures on this masterpiece are eerie, haunting, beautiful, intricate, complex and dark. Hats off to Dougans and Cobain , the musical geniuses behind this production. I particularly enjoy the track 'Glass'. But the songs as a whole fit perfectly together and mesh well. For those looking for something similar, try Tangerine Dream's 'Ricochet'. This is the only album I can compare it to in terms of eerie, haunting, beautiful, intricate , complex and dark. And TG did it back in the 70's...live! Even the album cover , like Dead Cities, is ominous. Good stuff.... 
 I read the first book, and think this one is equally great, if not better.  It was a blast to read about all the silly things the author put in the book.  Very fun.  I've even used some of the examples as ice-breakers at big corporate meeings, with much success.  Kudos to the author.  Keep it up!! 
 It's funny how fate steps in isn't it? Until recently I had never picked up a Nora Roberts book. Public Secrets was given to me as a gift, by a good friend, and I am forever gratful.  I have never read a more powerful book in my life. It is the kind of book that you come across once every five years.   Emma is a strong character. You see her grow from a tiny, scared child into a strong, independant woman that any parent would be proud of.  Emma has to overcome a lot. But as they say, what doesn't kill us, only makes us stronger.  This book is fantastic and I suggest that everyone read it.  Nora Roberts is an insperation to aspiring writers like myself. 
 Island is the first Laymon book I have read.  I bought it well over a year ago and finally got around to it.  I enjoy H.P. Lovecraft, Richard Matheson, Jack Ketchum and some Stephen King stuff so I figured I would give Richard Laymon a try and Island promised to be pretty scary...  The high points of this novel are the pacing and atmosphere.  It really did creep me out--I actually had my front door open for the nice breeze and at one point actually did get up, close and lock it while reading Island.  It DID deliver on chills and thrills.    The low point of Island, to me anyway, is the seemingly irrational and/or unrealistic actions and reactions of the characters.  This is especially annoying in a book that does not involve any kind of fantastic or supernatural elements, I mean we are supposed to be reading about something that would not be impossible to imagine even if it is improbable yet some of the interactions between characters are borderline ridiculous.  Part of the effect of the book was initially lost on me due to some of the dialogue and certain aspects of the character(s) personalities, one of them in particular.  What I didn't realize until afterward is that there may have been a reason for this character to act this way or have thoughts that seem outrageous to me given the circumstances.  Either way, despite some of the silliest moments, this book was very difficult to put down and I was most certainly dying to know what was going to happen next; it's truly a page-turner and I had to actively stop myself from skipping ahead to take a peek at pages to come.  Immediately upon finishing Island I was going to give it three stars.  However I ended up sleeping on it and am giving the book a solid four stars for one particular reason: I predicted ultimately how it would end, I was right, yet it still got under my skin.  I have been thinking about the book for a couple of days now, can't seem to get it out of my head, and it creeped me out enough to make me force myself to take a break from horror books for a week or two.    I pretty much had a feeling of what might happen in the end but it was one of those things where I thought to myself that maybe I was wrong because it didn't seem to be going that way at all.  Ultimately my prediction was correct and although I would have liked to see just a little more build up to the conclusion rather than the abruptness it had (in my opinion), it certainly sealed the deal in terms of my being able to label this book "creepy" and it most certainly was the factor that keeps this novel burned into my brain.  
 This is a very cute book.  My son gave this to his Grandpa for Christmas so they could read it together.  It's a really neat book for a Grandpa and Grandson to read during their special time together 
 I live in the S.CA mountains at 6000 ft, and since moving here I have been at a loss in terms of turning out a decent oatmeal cookie. I have made several attempts, with different recipes, but to no avail. The end result was, sadly, always the same: a flat disc.   I had almost given up on my cookie baking when I found this book. I just finished baking up the oatmeal cookie recipe, and they turned out perfectly...just like what I remember from my old days in Orange County. There didn't seem to be enough of the ingredients including sugar and flour when I was making the recipe, but what do I know, the recipe turned out a beautifully plump batch of cookies. I am going to try a cake next and report back. What a thrill to successfully bake again.. 
 I really like the Hard Candy Lip Gloss Ring!   Fist off, the cute packaging makes it both fun and easy to wear (I like clunky things like that). The ring fits my finger, which is about a size 6.5/7 or so.  Secondly, the actual gloss is pretty good. However, that's also the reason why I only gave it four stars. The gloss doesn't last that long, and certainly doesn't taste that good. It isn't extremely shiny, however it is pretty moisturizing.  All in all, I recomend this as a cute gift topper or stocking stuffer for anyone who wears lip gloss or cute rings like this. I personally think it's worth it just for the container, but the actual gloss is nothing to write home about 
 It's always good to know how to avoid surgery if you can.  I need knee replacements so this was especially interesting to me.  Good information 
 In "Indivisible," one of the vignettes that compose Bynum's mesmerizing new novel, one of the characters reminisces about a children's story of a tailor who stitched his shadow to himself.  "And she knows that, as with all things sutured, the two leaves cannot be separated without destroying them both.  She is certain of it.  Yes she persists in pcking at the edges; she delights in seeing how the wound seeps, where the scab has been lifted away by a fingernail."    This vignette is emblematic of how Bynum's novel operates.  The "real" and the "unreal" or "dream-like" are sutured together throughout the book. Can they be separated?  Probably not, but we readers keep trying, we keep "picking at the edges," trying to sort out the separation.   Bynum seems to be suggesting that reading is not so much a creative act as it is a destructive one.  Trying to separate the real and the dream in this novel would, if we could do it, destroy the book.  But, of course, none of the novel is "real."  It's all a verbal representation on a series of pages.  Some of the words represent "real" things (e.g. Le Petomane, a unique musical performer who actually lived in France a century ago), but in the novel, those things aren't the actual things, merely verbal constructs of them.  So as we read and try to figure out what is a dream and what is "real," we're being drawn into the story, seduced into believing that at least some of it is "real."  Or at least that some parts are more "real" than the "dream" parts.  And that act of believing is a creative act of reading.    So Bynum's great accomplishment is to involve us in simultaneous acts of creation and destruction as we read her novel.  A careful reader can't help but do both, for we cannot do one without the other.  This is an exhilarating novel to read as a result 
 A challenging aspect with absorbing great literature plays is to find out why the title was named so, whether the title is hidden metaphorically or literally visible.   The title for Miller's first successful play, and not as well-knows as Death of a Salesman, derives from a line "they were all my sons", when the main character, Joe Keller, refers to the twenty-one P40 pilots killed because his company knowingly shipped out cracked cylinder heads.     Although sent to prison for 14 months, he was exonerated, because he shifted the blame to his worker, Herb Deever, who still sits in prison.     The emotional drama is lengthy and considered in the book series Best American Plays from 1945-1951 edited by John Gassner.  The themes run gamut from family, employment, greed, betrayal, denial, lies, anguish and most of all, responsibility.  The plot evolves, a twist here, and a  turn there!  Pain, sorrow and confusion permeate the mood.  And like Miller's plays, there are lengthy emotional monologues.    Set in the back yard of a home in an American town, it takes place in one long night and it opens with family keeps remarking on the tree planted for their 27 year-old son Larry, missing-in-action  for 2 years, and some presume him dead.  The broken tree keeps popping up throughout conversations as it is symbolic of the demise of the family.    The night the tree breaks, the chain of action begins.  Larry's girlfriend Anne is expected to come back to town, but now, she is about to marry Chris Keller, the other brother.  The tension & conflict arises because, once childhood neighbors to the Kellers, Anne and her brother, George, now an attorney, are the children of the man, Herb Deever, the one who was forced to take the blame for the death of twenty-one pilots.    Like most plays, they are always better than the movie versions, (if any).  If you see an exact play performed, then it is worth it. ......But the books are always better....MzRizz  
 I found this book to be completely accessible and user-friendly. The author 'speaks' in terms and in a language that encourages you to read on. I recommend it 
 But to others that have read and enjoyed the book, I ask you this..  When Tender Branson is heading toward oblivion in a 747, he says that Fertility had told him that he already knows how to rescue himself if he chooses to, But "I'm too stupid to know how."  This has left me curious.  What do you think Fertility meant to happen to Tender 
 My seven-year-old son says that he wished it were more entertaining.  I guess I feel somewhat disappointed that he races through to detect clues to determine the frauds without reading the artist write-ups.  But it's a good introduction to art history and appreciation and it certainly captivates those who love to read mysteries 
 Heavy, big, full of pictures, interview-type amazing book!I am a huge fan of Monty Python but I learned a lot from that. I could only say, buy it! 
 Another one of Clive Cussler/Paul Kemprecos' winners!  Fast moving and a good read 
 Many people are quick to criticize this man, frankly I don't really care if he has been to jail or not. This book is great, full of great tips and common sense. I found it very educational and inspiring. Lots of info on natural remedies and weight loss. I recommend it to anyone with an open mind looking for a natural way of living 
 No scholar here, (if I were I'd have written a book) so this book was very enlightening. Thrilled for the info. Wish it was mainstream knowledge 
 I had originally heard "Drive Away" on a radio station and I was instantly blown away.  Upon seeing the music video for it, I decided to buy the CD.  I was hardly disappointed.  The emotion that goes into the CD is amazing and it's definitly a CD to sit down and enjoy.  I saw the band in concert and met Jonah after the show and was amazed by how down to earth he was. Give Gratitude a chance and you won't be disappointed. 
 What can you add to such glowing reviews?  I'd just like to share that you can now purchase this book in a lap-sized board book format.  That's wonderful, as many people have pointed out that the detailed illustrations are better when viewed in the larger format.  For those of us who want our babies and toddlers to enjoy unrestricted access to their books without cringing at the thought of the pages being ripped, the lap-size is the perfect solution!  I'm finding more and more of these available now, including "The Napping House" and the bedtime favorite "Time For Bed. 
 Between the ending of the First World War and the beginning of World War II, the United States rapidly became an increasingly urban culture as people left their farms to seek work in the cities. The economic  enticements of industrialization during the 1920s, the devastated Midwest  farming and economic restrictions during the years of "The Great  Depression", the migration of blacks out of the South and into the  industrial belt of the North to escape poverty and racial discrimination,  all contributed to this changing demographic. Even though the standard of  living improved for many American families during this period, by 1941 only  half the population enjoyed the modern conveniences that are nowadays taken  for granted. For many Americans, daily life was hallmarked with economic  uncertainty, unpredictable jobs and wages, labor unrest, and stock market  mishaps. In The Uncertainty Of Everyday Life 1915-1945, history professor  Harvey Green (Northeastern University) recounts an era of unprecedented  changes in American culture and the impact of those uncertain times on  employment, home life, gender roles, education, religion, recreation. The  Uncertainty Of Everyday Life 1915-1945 is a superb work of insightful,  informative history that is exceptionally well written and highly  recommended to students of American history and popular culture 
 This game is one of my all-time favorites. I could play it over and over again and never get bored! Fun to play with the whole family, this guessing game rocks 
 When I first heard a song from this album (Sliding Doors) I was driving on I-5, on my way to Pasadena.  I pulled off and bought the CD.  I give it half a star over the 4 rating, and it would it be worth 5 if the boys had axed "Right Kind of Girl".  There is something painful about the 'siamese cat' line.  Probably I just don't get it.  "Your Big Night" is Steely Dan adeptly finessed into the 90s.  "Star Behind" may have been inspired by The Moody Blues or the Hale-Bopp cult troop, I dunno, but I like the pulsating yet dreamy arrangement.  My fave track is "All Dreamed Out".  It is a Satin Doombox 
 I recomend this book to every new mom. It explains everything that is happening and I knew what to expect before I went to my Dr's appointment. It told me things my doctor didn't. 
 This was one of the better books on bar management. I recommend it! Covers money, how to do the financial spreadsheets to get a business loan in addition to the fun stuff 
 As a Marine I spent two tours in the Nam.  My first trip over was in 1966 and my first assignment was Chu Lai. I was there when this took place.  The author has done a fantastic job of researching the background and recreating the events of what took place.  This story takes you there and places you in the middle of the action.  It is a must read for any Veteren or anyone else who just want's to know what it was like to be in the Nam' 
 In her Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series Hamilton pioneered a unique synthesis of horror and eroticism.  In this first volume of a new series, Hamilton takes sex to new levels.  On the surface, Merry Gentry is a lovely young woman making a living as a private investigator in Los Angeles for a firm that specializes in supernatural problems.  Merry's magical talents are enough to keep her employed, but nothing to write home about.  Especially if home is the high court of the Faerie world.  In fact, Merry is a faerie princess on the run from relatives who would kill her in an instant.  She fled the Unseelie Court after realizing that Queen was turning a blind eye to her son's attempts to assassinate Merry.  But now Merry's running is over.  An unfortunate encounter with a magical substance called Bronwyn's Tears has revealed Merry's true identity to the world.  She is forced to return to the Unseelie Court to face the wrath of the Queen, her aunt.  But three years has changed much at court and Merry just may have a way to save her life and help her friends.  Although the Anita Blake books contain uninhibited sex, in this book Hamilton outdoes herself, creating a supernatural culture that thrives on sex and pain.

This book is a promise of great experiences to come

 The speed of business has increased. The rate of change continues to accelerate. That is why Dave Gray's book is so fundamental. By using "smart" visuals, it quickly conveys the meaning of core business concepts such as value proposition, positioning, competition and more. This is a must in your collection. Chances are it is the only one you will find yourself going back to... for fun 
 I have a 60 minute drive to and from work every day so I "read" countless books on CD.  Mostly, I listen to these books to stay awake so I'm always looking for something fast and exciting that I don't have to think hard to comprehend at 5:30 am.  This book was the perfect fit.  The characters are developed, but not too deeply where it's confusing who is who, etc..  Unlike other thrillers that I've read, you really begin rooting for the main character because of the opening scene.  Big F is a great character too that always keeps you guessing.  I recommend this book definitely as a way to get the blood flowing a little bit in the morning or at night 
 This is a wonderful book with amazing vintage black and white period photos.  The book mostly focuses on the building of the skyscraper in the 30's and my only qualm with the book is the lack of current photos of the building, but that is a minor critisism and should not reflect on the overall excellent quality of the book.  The Chrysler Building is a pinnacle of Art Deco style and I love it.  The history of the building is so interesting and story of the spire is such a quenticential New York moment.  I recomend this book to anyone who loves the romance of the skyscraper and this one is magical 
 This is one of those very dramatic dramas that seem to stay with you after you watch it.  Three sisters have very conflicted feelings towards their father who is growing more and more disorientated as he ages and continues to be an alcoholic.  What happened in the past to make this father resent his daughters so much and why do they feel the way they do?  If you like family in distress movies then this is sure to peak your interest.  Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange have a very good on screen chemistry.  
  This is definitely the best album the Silk Road Ensemble has yet produced! It's consists of a variety of moving and beautiful themes with great orchestration. The pieces are so varied and beautifully arranged for the instruments. The orchestration is clearly Western influenced in a way or another.  Although I wish that It would contain some Kurdish and Arabic music, the Silk Road Project is a very nice idea that could be one of the means of achieving mutual understanding and respect between the different peoples in that region as well as broadening the horizons of the Western listeners. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 
 With relevant and interesting anecdotes, Cech describes the fundamentals of plant medicine making in this comprehensive book.  Any beginning herbalist will appreciate how Cech covers the traditional/folk methods as well as scientific methods of making herbal medicine.   The love and respect Cech has for the plant world shine through.  Reading this book is like being an apprentice to a knowledgeable and experienced herbalist of the highest caliber 
 Can YOU help. Gladys Aylward's life story has been a source of insipiration for many and I'm currently researching the possibility of producing a TV documentary about her life. I'm trying to track down some of the Children who treked across the mountains with her or anyone who worked  with her for a short while and can tell her story.  I would love to hear  from you if you could assist me in any way. Thank yo 
 Cultural Psychology deals with the intersection of the individual mind and culture, two topics that are often left to be treated by separate disciplines whose ideas are not easily shared.  Cole disagrees with the division of mind from culture, and offers up a bridge in the form of cultural-historical activity theory.  This approach describes the co-construction of individuals, culture, and material environments.  It involves studying mediation through artifacts, in context, through everyday activities.  The book is ripe with ideas.  Two that I found most engaging, and which I think help explain Cole's project, are his emphasis on studying activity (such as learning) in everyday context and his example of learning language.  Cultural artifacts need to be considered within their social, cultural, and historical context of consumption and production. Yet, context is not a simple concept. Context flows from the past and future as they interplay to create the present.  It is social structure, individual human thinking, and our physical environment interacting and shaping each other.  Cole also points out that an important result of looking at culture and mind in mediated context is that we cannot expect all individuals to either express culture in the same way or to have internalized the same parts of a culture.  A person creates meaning based on previous experience and knowledge, changing constantly along with new experience.  This is why, Cole points out, that looking at individuals along side the study of culture is so important.  They cannot be separated from each other.  Cole emphasizes this through the study of language and communication.  A child, isolated from the world, will not develop language.  Language is a practice that exists between two people in a physical and social environment, and develops over time.  As a child learns language, they make sense of words through activity and context (in all its variations described above). This means that the experience of language is not consistent from one person to the next.   Yet, as children develop their own nuanced versions of words and sentences, they still share a common enough structure - as a result of the shared tool of language - for meaning to be shared between people.  Language is constantly reconstructed and recreated as it is used.  It cannot be fully understood outside of the context of use.  Cole practices what he is suggests in how he writes the book:  he explores his ideas through his personal history with the subject, the history of related ideas, modern day debates, descriptions of analytical tools, and examples of its application in the field.  Cultural Psychology demonstrates the power of the cultural-historical approach to understanding people, culture, the process of communication, and the environments in which we live 
 This book's best feature is a color quiz that turns out to be a powerful tool for understanding your own psychological makeup--both the long view and the present-moment snapshot.  I first took it in 1993, then again in 1997, and was shocked to see how much this test revealed to me about me, now that I can look back at who I was then and who I am now.  It was eerily accurate!  So I highly recommend this book, not only for people studying color theory, but for anyone who wants a deep personal profile and insight--all by yourself, in the privacy of your own roo 
 I found the book to contain several tips and tricks that were new to me and I have been using Eclipse for over two years now. I would highly recommend this book to new Eclipse IDE users to help you get a leg up on learning the Eclipse IDE. I found this book well worth the price and will be looking for more pocket guide books by O'Reilly to add to my bookshelf 
 Each time I read Difficult Conversations, I learn something new that is practical.  A must read for anyone looking to improve their understanding of family, friends and others 
 My 4 month old loves this book, she gets so excited when I read it to her.  If she's fussy and I recite it to her, she stops fussing.  Great book!  Very cute 
      This is an amazing service! For only 2 bucks i can watch what i like for the moment. In this case it was HG WELLS. Great biography 
 As a Paediatric Occupational Therapist I find this book a valuable resource in my department 
 Having taught myself to crochet I spent two months experimenting with making socks and landed up with a method that results in no seams or bumps and is reasonably soft. This book might have helped a little with the process but it is one of those books that lays out a pattern and off you go. Fancy patterns for sure and nice for the distaff side. I was hoping for something very plain with more attention given to custom fit and comfort. I stuck the book on the shelf perhaps I might give it a hook sometime in the future 
 I saw this masterpiece when it first came out, 1971. I have not stoped thinking and talking about it since. The devil you think of are not the devils you will see. It will leave a mark on you. This is not a light film. You won't forget it. Expect a wide range of emotional reponses, widest range of any film I have seen   with the possible exception being the Kind Of Hearts with Allan Bates.    This film is a realistic rendition of the harsh reality of life for the common people of early France. It is relevant and contemporary in its portrayal of the relationship of church and state then and now. Shocking, disturbing, sadistic, and a brutal harsh reality.   If you can stomach history as it was, do yourself a favor and see  The Devils, uncut of course.  Super acting and great sets. You will think and feel as if you were there 
 I love this cookbook!I have never been a very good cook,but with this cookbook I'm getting pretty good I think.I have bought many books on this subject and this is hands down the very best if you are lacking funds and want to feed your family healthy nutitious meals.I have been using it for about a month and have already started saving money(and time).I own the first edition of this book "Not Just Beans"and i'm thinking about getting this one as well because there is new information in it.When I have some exta cash I probably will.Tawra makes the whole process more fun and it becomes a game to see how far you can stretch your dollars.So often with these kind of books it feels like drudgery,not so with this book!"Miserly Moms"is good also, but if you can only buy one,this is better.Thanks Tawra,for helping so many of us with your great advice.Look at Tawras web site "Living on a Dime" and it will give you some idea of whats in her book.She is  someone who wrote a book based on personal experience,and these methods really work 
 Not something I could watch over and over, but it was a very good movie. If Spider-Man 2 didn't also come out in 2004. Incredibles would have been the best superhero movie of the year.  A job well done 
 This well-written book is an interesting diversion in the course of the 20th century in America. In Roth's alternate history (though I'm sure he would despise that genre term as much as TC Boyle rails against "science fiction" in his preface to "A Friend of the Earth,) Roth imagines what if Charles Lindbergh had run for and won the presidency in 1940. Lindbergh was reputed to be a vicious anti-Semite, and in this piece of fiction, Lindbergh subtly sets out to assimilate the Jews into pork-eating, Saturday-working Americana.   The story is told from the POV of young Phil Roth, the author's doppelganger. Roth has done this in other books, and it's an interesting conceit. It certainly answers that question that all writers occasionally get, "Is {insert a character's name here} really *you*?" The only thing that it obfuscates is that Roth is, of course, *all* the characters. All characters require, as Marge Piercy so nicely put it, a "blood sacrifice" to bring them to life.   The end of the book is, IMHO, problematic. While there may be some historical support for the tactic Roth imagines, I found it a too convenient motivations to explain away some of the preceding events. And, while it might explain the imagined actions of a fictionalized character, it does not explain why people (fictionally) followed him. I don't find it startling that Hitler was a murderous anti-Semite and conceived the Final Solution, but I find it horrifying that so many Germans blithely allowed it to happen. I think the end of the book could have delved a little deeper into Lindbergh's Willing Collaborators.   TK Kenyon Author of RABID, coming in Spring, 2007 from Kunati Books 
 A Quantum Leap of reading.  How his man managed to take old pictures and form a believable, and personal, story around each one is an amazing feat.  I found myself wondering if he did travel back in time - was it possible - could I do it?  I even tried the self-hypnosis he told about - picking the civil war as my target.  No -- didn't work for me - yet!  Would I love to do it!  The ending of this book shook me - he turned a time travel into a mystery and then the last pages shake you around the other way.  It's amazing.  Read "The Mirror" , read Diana Gabaldon's time travel series -- but please don't miss including this book as your number one, best dog eared copy of your library.  You won't be sorry 
 If I were to start my own religion, this would probably be the most sacred text.  Dr. Seuss possessed powers of pure imagination unequaled in all of children's literature, and this book is the most inspiring, mind-expanding example of his divine gift.  Even more important than Cat in the Hat or The Lorax, every baby born into this world should be given a copy of On Beyond Zebra.  Buy it and give it to a child you love today 
 Michelle Richmond is a gorgeous writer, with exceptional insight into the human condition. San Francisco is a beautifully evoked character in this tightly wound, compelling story. Don't miss it, or her last book, "Dream of The Blue Room," also a must-read 
 I was simultaneously frustrated and enthralled by Spindle's End...overwhelmed by details, yet compelled to keep on reading!  I positively loved the character development...come on, in the original most of us heard, Briar Rose has no character, she's literally a sleeping beauty and nothing more.  In McKinley's retelling, we get a richly developed and individual character...and this development extends to all the main and secondary characters, including a large cast of animal characters.  The fairy-tale locations are all superbly drawn and in reading this, one can slip easily into the story as if it were an old friend...but what is wonderful about this story is also what is frustrating about it.  There is such a cacophony of details that at some points in the story it hurts to read, but for me, this is easy to forgive simply because I loved the way McKinley drew the characters giving them life beyond what we'd normally expect based on the bones of the original tale.    Briar Rose is swept away from her name-day celebration when Pernicia (the wicked fairy) places the curse upon the child by Katronia and swept away to the far end of the kingdom where she manages to live in relative safety until close to her 21st birthday...the time when Pernicia's curse is set to take her life.  Along with way Katronia is helped by a menagerie of animals who nurse the young princess...from cows and goats to bear and otters...an interesting twist that seems to have a lingering effect on the young princess.  As she grows up, she is more of a tomboy that she is a princess, talking to animals and becoming friends with the grizzled smith and ultimately leaning to be a healer of animals, even apprenticed to Narl the smith.  In all of this we root for Katronia, Aunt, Narl and Rosie while sympathizing with the King and Queen (who have no idea where their princess is, but maintain the ruse that they have her in hiding), and sharing the same curiosity as to the location of Pernicia and her reasons for cursing the princess...for this is one character that is black and white, she's evil and beyond a sparse few details, we see very little of her and know almost nothing of her, her life/history, or motivations...this was disappointing, because she has the potential to be such a delicious, juicy and evil character and she is not.    The ending was interesting and confusing in some places...and, I think, I little more drawn out than necessary, but I LOVED the twist on the kiss at the end.  I thought that was a well done touch that was also a bit of a surprise!  Overall, I give it an A-, it's a bit long in the tooth with the details and the ending could have been polished a bit more, but what carries this story is that it's faithful to the original fairy tale feel whiling brining both the land and the characters to life in a way that is unique and fulfilling!  McKinley is a master of brining us inside a character (or cast of characters) that were previously only flat and stereotypical, definitely going on the shelf as a keeper!

 Gave as a gift to my son and his wife and they rave about it. They like it's compact size, light weight, carry strap and especially the swing out arm so their toddler can climb into it herself 
 As a marketing professional who has probably read too many books on the topic, I've found these books to be functional only to either educate or entertain, but rarely both.  In "First in Thirst," Rovell brings a storytelling ease to a wonderful and insightful look at the rise of one of America's greatest brands. This wonderful "beach book" quality is not diminished by the lessons explicitly outlined as the culmination of the Gatorade story 
 Although I knew things were going to get dicey in this chapter of the series I wasn't quite ready for what happened in this one. Sorry I'm not going to give it away, just know that the events will set you back in your seat.  Enjoy 
 Hemingway's acknowledged masterpiece about Spanish Civil War guerillas was censored both in print and in film.  In print, the four letter words were cut and stilted pseudo-Spanish substituted.  That defect of course remains in this pretty much faithful transmission of the text; it is what gives it a funny archaic sound most do not understand.  Also, 2 key scenes were cut from the cinema release, to make the story less "brutal" and to emphasize the romance.  These episodes were  Pilar's telling of the execution of the fascists in her village, and El Sordo's final stand.  Thankfully, this version restores both magnificent scenes, making a much tougher, grittier film that is worthy of Hemingway's realism.  One could only rate the prior version 3 stars, at best.  This however is a first rate American film now being seen for the first time, 60 years later.  The plot is very simple.  An American joins the anti-Franco guerillas in the mountains to help them blow a key bridge.  The guerillas suspect him and have their own internal problems.  The Yank falls in love with a girl who has been brutalized by the fascists.  With pluck he sticks to his mission until the film stops.  The romance was tough going in the book, rather euphemistically treated.  You could not deal with that realistically at the time, either; Hemingway's story pushed the limits of its time.  Cooper and Bergman made the coupling palatable for an American audience then, and reviews here still attest that it works now.  Fine; I visualize it much more differently but am confident that EH's idea still would not sell, albeit for different reasons.  In any event the romance provides a plot engine to take one through part of a key historical event of the 20th century.  Hemingway got over there as a partisan of the Communist opposition, but the novel was balanced enough to infuriate many prominent American reds in the media of his day.    People should read the book, of course.  This film is however, a sincere adaptation and faithful to the spirit of its day.  Ultimately, Cooper's signature performance nails just the right tone for this presentation of what critics of the day called "grace under pressure." 
 There is no disputing that Capote is a God.  All of Truman's work is excellent, but this book takes the cake.  A page turner that will have you questioning the security of your own home.  Warning: If you live in a rural community and decide to read this book you may find it difficult to sleep!  
 I was looking for a book to read to my 3-year-old son to help him adjust to attending all day nursery school twice a week.  Based on other customer reviews, I chose this one.  This is just a sweet book where mommy is reminding her little one Owen that even though they are apart, while he is doing all his school activities - whether it be making a new friend or making a mistake - she is thinking about him and loving him throughout the day.  The book ends with mommy picking up her child from school, and reading together at night.  Now at our bedtime reading, my son says "I want to read about Owen".  Also, I've used the book for other issues such as sleeping alone ("See?  Owen sleeps in his bed all by himself.") - it has really helped!  I highly recommend this book 
 I thought this was a very good book and would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of book 
 I love quilting books (or books with quilting themes in it). I love Emilie Richard's books simply because she is a thorough writer and she always introduces a new character from a previous book, so you feel like you are among friends. Her books has a way of drawing you into the story ~~ or in this case, a story within a story.   It starts out with Kendra almost losing her life in an attempted carjacking attack. Six months later after extensive therapy, she decides that she needs to go and live in her husband's grandmother's cabin. She takes Isaac's quilt, called The Lover's Knot ~~ with her as well. Isaac remains behind in Washington D.C., and Kendra fearing the end of her marriage, decides to recuperate away from the city and in the mountains. Little did she know that she would find a new home among the citizens that live in the tiny town. And little did she know that she would discover Isaac's grandmother's deep secret.   Isaac was given up for adoption as a child. He didn't have an easy childhood as his adoptive father was mentally abusive. So he didn't want to know anything about his biological family because he thought they were just as bad for giving him up for adoption. Turns out his grandmother Leah had a story and that story haunted two of her friends for years. It talked about being relocated from their home which has been turned over to the government to make a park. It gives a bit of history as well and Leah shares her stories through letters.   It's a bittersweet novel and a very wonderful one. Kendra and Isaac find themselves through history and simple daily life in the country. It's a big contrast to the high-power living in a big city ~~ and very relaxing.   Only Richards can write like this ~~ full of warmth and sunshine and hope. Her novels have always made me curl up on the couch and relax with a cup of tea on hand. It's wonderful, cozy and engrossing. Always.  10-3-0 
 This thing sat on my shelf, half-read for the longest time.  Only the notice of the upcoming release this November of Pynchon's next got me motivated enough to dig into it again.  It's not that it isn't brilliant.  No one else around can dazzle you with so much wit and wonder.  The first encounter with the talking dog is as magical as anything you'll ever read.  And it's not like this is the only Pynchon novel that takes some effort to get into.  There are plenty of folks who have had to to take a couple cracks at V or Gravity's Rainbow before catching the wave.    But Mason and Dixon is a lot of work, if for no other reason than the effort it takes dealing with the mid-18th century prose style.  (Can you imagine the effort it took to produce it?)  John Barth's Sotweed Factor is  similar, and yet somehow infinitely more accessible (and highly recommended!).  Pynchon's gift for rapid exposition is not necessarily suited to the constraint on verbal glibness.  Especially in a work this voluminous.  And yet the darn thing is consistently challenging, if one has the patience and energy to put into it.  It seemed to me that the beginning and ending were the best parts, but this could very well have everything to do to the enthusiasm one brings to a new book, and the emotional satisfaction one gain's when reaching towards the conclusion.  One thing for sure, for once Pynchon truly has plotted out and delivers a conclusion worthy of the whole work, as opposed to suddenly rushing out a trap door and leaving the reader in a state of suspension (which of course is also one of the many delights of his first three novels).  This time one gets the sense that the author has a good deal of affection for his featured players.    This book is a great as you want it to be, if you're willing to work at it.  I'm just looking forward to the next one being a little more nimble.  (Meanwhile, I've got a couple months to see if I can make more of a dent into The Recognitions. 
 More then Harvest, more then Zuma,After The Gold Rush or all three together, Tonights The Night is the album that even after all these years with each listen gets better and better and better. Harvest's magic has faded and sounds outdated, Zuma still rocks hard but now falls short, After The Gold Rush is beautiful but lost some sparkle. Tonights The Night is the Neil Young Album for me. Its the one that with all the drugs and booze being passed around during the record still managed to come out an amazing piece of art!  At first listen I thought well this is a pretty good album, and a really good Neil Young album. Then I listened to it again and thought wow this is a great album and an amazing Neil Young album! Ever since I first started listening to this album I felt it was Neil Youngs best and most pure. No super glossy production, no overly excessive noise just a honost album.   Some complain about Neils shotty voice in certain spots on the album but I think it adds to the authenticity of the music and what Neil and the band was going through at the time and it shines bright through the music especially on songs like 'Roll A Number' and the title track 'Tonights The Night.' Though some instruments may be slightly out of tune but the music still sounds great, I mean listen to Aerosmith's 'Mama Kin' the guitar solo is flat and we still love it!   For me personally if you want the best Neil has to offer then look no further then Tonights The Night because this is the album. This is the one that gets the job done, the beautiful lyrics and ballads, the nice folk songs, the angry rockers, its all here and there is really nothing like this album. Harvest was good but it doesnt hold a candle to Tonights The Night thats for sure 
 My friend recommended this book to me and it came at a perfect time when I was looking for something to get totally engrossed in.  Warning:  Do not pick this up if you do not have time to finish it!  It's a page turner.  March Murray returns to her hometown in MA after being away for 19 years.  She knows that she will have to face her past and most importantly her first (and only) "love" and she's not sure what will unfold.  The book takes a turn towards the end.  Great character description - you'll feel what the characters are feeling

 Ah, the search for a perfect bra.  It can be as challenging the quest as the quest for the Holy Grail, if not more so.  I mean, with the Grail, you don't have to worry about sizing.  I hesitated to order this bra for a long time, as it appears to be pretty ugly in the photo displayed here, but I am pleased to say that in person, it's actually rather pretty.  However, be aware that there are 4 hooks in the back, so forget about your amour quickly unclasping it in during a moment of passion.  These hooks and the stretchy, sheer fabric provide substantial support though, and the wide straps are comfortable and won't leave whiplash marks upon the shoulders.  Unfortunately, the bra is cut rather narrow at the upper sides, heading towards the underarms.  Depending on your build, this can mean that the sides of your breasts will squish out, which is unattractive and indicative of a poor fit, so ordering a larger cup size than normal might be necessary 
 Paperback was a little more tattered than I expected but super fast shipping 
 This book is simply fantastic. It contains a large amount of Houdini's writings from articles, books, etc. It contains Houdini's famous "Margery the Medium" pamplet where he exposes her false methods,  explains in Houdini's words how he escapes from a straitjacket, and also  tells about an illusion that Houdini was thinking about performing, but  never did. A wonderful book with many pictures and illustrations 
 I say as interesting as Wuthering Heights and as good as Jane Eyre because, in my opinion, Wuthering Heights is slightly better than the other two, but Wildfell Hall gives just as much, if not more, food for thought.  Anne Bronte has unfairly, almost cruelly, been over-looked until very recently. People who do not enjoy Victorian literature might find this book dull, but, barring that possibility, it is a well-written, ambitious work with plenty to engage the modern mind. It is so incredibly different from her earlier piece, Agnes Grey; much darker, more complex, and more accomplished --- the progresison of Anne's skill between the two is staggering.  In terms of narrative structure, it almost rivals Wuthering Heights in complexity. Wildfell Hall has a tripartite narrative structure. Anne Bronte introduces us to the enigmatic, reclusive Helen (the tenant of the title) through the eyes of Gilbert Markham (a foolish, immature, but somewhat charismatic gentleman farmer), who is repulsed by her eccentric, obstinate manner, but who cannot deny the bond forming between them. Helen, new to the neighbourhood, raises first the suspicion, then the ire, of the insular local community (which is drawn in a dry, humourous style not unlike Jane Austen). When events come to a head, Helen finds the only way to exonerate herself is to offer up her diary for examination.  The core of the novel is Helen's diary, which covers the years of her life before coming to Wildfell Hall. This is a remarkable tale of deception, domestic abuse, and the dangers of keeping women naive and ignorant. Helen has suffered through ignorance and naivity, and is now a wise women in control of her own life. Anne Bronte seems to channel Mary Wollstonecraft in her calls for more and better education for women in the 19th century.  I will make no comment on the third part of the novel, only to say that the narrative voice returns to Gilbert for the denouement contained therein. The end is problematic for some, but I think Anne leaves it open enough for multiple theories and ideas regarding it, many of which have recently been published in scholarly articles.  This is the most feminist Bronte novel (yes, more than anything Charlotte penned). It absolutely explodes the Victorian myth of the Angel in the House, and savagely attacts the 19th century assumption that women must be kept innocent and ignorant for their own good. Indeed, Anne anticipated so many modern developments in this text that I would go so far as to say that it is the Bronte novel which has remained most relevant in today's society. It is also the Bronte novel which created the most critical censure upon its publication (likely because it so strongly attacked the status quo of the time).  The aforementioned Helen is one of the most captivating characters I have ever encountered. She is strong-willed and independent-minded, but in no way perfect. Indeed, she is deeply naive when we see her at a younger age, but Bronte does not condemn her for her faults. Instead, she shows how, through conflict and experience, Helen has grown into the "tigress" she is later described as being.  Anne is often criticized for simply retelling the story of her brother Branwell's decline in this novel. Those who have studied Bronte biography and who have read the book, though, would see that such charges are, in a word, ludicrous. Anne is also often criticized for moralizing and writing long religious tracts, instead of proper novels. Again, I feel this charge is patently false, for although she undoubtedly had a moral purpose in mind while penning Wildfell Hall, within the text itself there is very little moralizing. The characters are incredibly well drawn. They are three dimensional beings who evolve throughout the text, and in many instances Bronte uses parallel characters and situations to show that different people react differently to similar things. As for the plot --- while the set-up is a bit slow, once things get going it is an absolute page-turner.  This is a book that any fan of the Bronte sisters should read. Indeed, even if you aren't a fan, give it a try --- several friends of mine, who generally do not read 19th century literature, and who do not formally study literature at all, picked up this, Jane Eyre, and Wuthering Heights, recently. Which was the unanimous favourite among them? The Tenant of Wildfell Hall 
 This is without a doubt Funk's most accomplished album to date. Less frantic, more melodic than his previous stuff and just a bit more accessible.  For me, this is most certainly one of the best albums of the past two years. I'd rate this as high as Nautilis' 'are you an axolotl?' album, and if you're familiar with the genre, that's saying something 
 Coming from a very religious family and having been educated in Catholic Schools and following the Christian faith most of my life, I already thought I knew what the war between good and evil was, especially with studying history and philosophy in college.  I found this book very easy to read, most noteably the parts between Buddha and Mara, the Buddhist's counterpart of Christ and the Devil.  Other areas in the book I found difficult to follow, especially since I haven't studied Buddhism indepth as I did Christianity.  But what the book tells its readers is how evil is everywhere, how easy it is to fall into a cycle that is acting as an agent of evil, how to break from it, etc etc.  If you have ever seen Star Wars, more specifically The Empire Strikes Back, you can see parallels between Yoda and Buddhism, especially where when it gets into a meditation on how to be at peace with oneself within a world filled with obligations, stress, problems and chaos.  This is an easy book to read and would recommend it to those who are interested in meditation, becoming at peace with theirselves, and finding out who they are and where they are going.  
 this book definitely helps me see the germline technology from a panoramic angle, so that I realize that we make a rational choice before everything really happens is the responsibility of all of us human beings. Read it, enjoy it and think it through 
 A book loaded with memorable characters, conflicts, and dialogues. Okonkwo, with his tragic persona, remains a character anybody, irrespective of culture, can identify with. Chinua Achebe has really set the standards for the modern African novel with this book. The Igbo culture and the impact of Christianity in African are some of the elements that coalesce in making this book one of the best novels of the twentieth century. Thought-provoking, captivating,and informative. Simply brilliant!! Only a gifted storyteller can pen such a work of creative imagination.                                             --Dike Okoro                                               Milwaukee, Wisconsin                                               USA 
 This book contains only the best of the best of U2. You can understand some of the decitions of the band or event the songs just to take a look to the book. The best book of U2 ever 
 This is one of the funniest books ever written. Jean Shepherd recounts his early years in a steelmill and oil refinery town in northern Indiana. The time is the late 1930's to 1940's. There is a sensible mother, a good-hearted father with an incredible vocabulary of cuss words, and a younger brother with an amazing ability to whine. We begin with the arrival next door of the Bumpus family, slovenly hillbillies with a million dogs that send our hero's father into explosions of outrage. We go through disaster after disaster until we reach the ultimate when our hero takes Wanda Hickey to the high school prom. I laughed so hard that I difficulty reading. Shepherd's mastery of description of small-town America in the 1940's is a pleasure to read, and it never stops being outrageously funny 
 I just got my PB200 and we've been blending and grinding the heck out of everything!  This little gadget is AWESOME!!  We've made smoothies and ground coffee, ice, cheese and spices.  It works terrific.  Everything has come out perfect so far.  It's so simple to use, and clean-up is a breeze.  I'm pleasantly surprised.    I bought this specifically because of its portability and the larger containers with storage lids.  I take smoothies to work every day and needed something that would be able to make them fast, without a lot of hassle and mess.  This little blender is perfect for my needs.  The containers are the perfect size and the motor does an excellent job mixing drink mix, fruit (fresh or frozen) and ice together.  The only thing I would suggest at this time is that the manufacturer look to putting together a bigger set with more containers and useful pieces.  One note of caution, there is a drawback to purchasing this item...be careful who you let see and use it.  Mine's already been hijacked!  
 "I was replacing a portable Sony devise that I really liked, but busted one of the speakers. This is a very attractive unit, with excellent sound. I can even plug in my mini disc player. It is very portable with a nice black bag. I was very pleased at the sound of this small unit. Includes earphones, an adapter to play other devises besides IPODS and Universal outlet (powers up the IPOD while playing)...also runs on 4 AA batteries."  
 Great magazine.  Keeps NYers informed of what's going on in the city and has a great crossword puzzle, to boot 
 I can't get enough of this book!  I'm amazed that the first copyright of this book was over 25 years ago!  What amazing wisdom to be able to keenly right for wives back then that still holds true today.  Linda Dillow does a fabulous job of combining pratical wisdom in balancing life with the need to realize that God is fully in control.  With two toddlers living in my house, I found the Priority Planner to be a saving grace for balancing all my roles.  And her straightforward speaking about our attitudes toward our husbands was eye-opening and humbling.  I'm sorry for the wife above who was beaten by her husband, but I do not believe that it was a product of this book.  Integrating the suggestions from this book will not make you a doormat; you must trust God to protect you from that.  But it will free you up to live according to what His scripture dictates.  Very practical and insightful.  Thank you Mrs. Dillow for your wisdom and advice 
 If you liked the African American Heritage Cookbook: Recipes and Remembrances From Tuskegee Institute and A Taste of Freedom: Recipes and Remembrances From Hampton Institute, you will love, CELEBRATING OUR EQUALITY another cookbook in this, recently branded, African American Heritage Cookbook Series.   Selected by book of the month clubs and organizations such as Reading is Fundamental, books in this series are more than just  cookbooks.  They also trace the unique history, heritage and contibutions of historic black colleges and universities (HBCUs).  And the recipes, which, for the most part, are regional to each area, are as delectable as the history.  CELEBRATING OUR EQUALITY concentrates on the delicious offerings of Washington D.C., home of Howard University.  Where available recipes unique to the college or university are used and clearly identified.    Otherwise, the history of the recipes is the collective history of a courageous race of people who took the scraps offered to them and built an enduring monument to survival and a legacy of learning.  Aptly titled, "CELEBRATING OUR EQUALITY," the third cookbook in this series focuses upon the contributions of Howard university, the nation's first black university.  Where A Taste of Freedom explored the historic black struggle for freedom and education, CELEBRATING OUR EQUALITY chronicles a newly freed people's continuing battle for equality and justice.  Established in 1867 to educate African-Americans freed by the Civil War, Howard University is credited with being at the forefront of the civil rights struggle.  Nine of the ten attorneys who argued Brown v. Board of Education, which ended public school segregation, were either Howard University professors or Howard Law School graduates.  Most noted among the latter group was Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American to sit on the United States Supreme Court.  Founders, supporters, students and teachers lend their vivid accounts of life in the early years at Howard.  And interwoven into this fascinating history are recipes that are sure to warm the heart and nurture the soul.  Filled with intriguing anecdotes, and accompanied by over fifty vintage photographs and illustrations, CELEBRATING OUR EQUALITY is at once a powerful tribute to a venerable American institution and a salute to the accomplishments made by a people who turned their hard-won freedom into a chance to change the course of history.  Watch for the next cookbook in this series, which pays tasty tribute to our nation's historic black colleges and universities 
 Regent College has done us all a service by reprinting Charles Williams' best novel. Oddly enough, it's the one many readers have missed because it wasn't reprinted when Eerdmans brought out the various editions of his other half dozen novels. This is thinking man's(or woman's) Goth; there are more ideas in one chapter than in an entire Stephen King novel. Another difference is it's the Good and not evil that is truly terrifying (evil is a shade or shadow of the Good). The occultic plots are somewhat drawn from Williams' involvement in The Order of the Golden Dawn, a secret society headed by A.E.Waite, best known for the Waite Tarot Deck. Its members variously included poet W.B.Yeats (known for his poem, "The Second Coming") and Evelyn Underhill, author of Mysticism. At one point, Aleister Crowley, the self-styled "Great Beast," attempted to wrestle control of The Golden Dawn, and one can only speculate what the outcome would have been had the many converts to Crowley's "Magick" have stumbled on Williams' books instead. Instead of "Mr. Crowley," would Ozzy be singing "Mr. Williams?" Instead of buying Crowley's mansion and opening occult bookstores to propagate his teachings, would Jimmy Page have renovated Williams' tiny flat and opened Golden Dawn branches all over England? Would "Stairway to Heaven" be about the Web of Souls and Exchange and the Way of Affirmation and vicariously bearing burdens and the Holy Graal and coinherence and all the rest of Williams' dazzling ideas? Who knows? But this reader joins the many who, having encountered Charles Williams, will never be the same 
 As the centuries long battle between religion and science unfolded in the 19th century, science became the clear winner in terms of intellectual prestige. But that fight, while leaving science victorious in the realm of the intellect also left lingering prejudices within science towards religion. As science moved forward offering us ever deeper knowledge of the cosmos, life, and ourselves, science also began to ignore its former nemesis. Despite the awesome significance of religion in human life and history, the social sciences have relatively little to offer on the role of religion in human evolution and the reasons for or mechanisms whereby religions tradition are transmitted from one generation to the next.    It's not uncommon to meet fantastically educated people, with strong knowledge in the physical or social sciences, who not only know nothing of religion but seem to insist that there's nothing worth knowing. For these people, human religious behavior is looked at as some kind of quirk or anomaly, an embarrassing hold-over from a dark past that we'd all just hopefully outgrow. Such people tend to comfort themselves with the old baseless superstition that religion is the "opiate of the masses." But considering the importance of religion in human history and the astonishing grip religious belief holds over the lives of billions of human beings, it's probably safe to assert that disciplines such as psychology and sociology are fundamentally grasping in the dark if they are unable or unwilling to seriously come to terms with role of religion in the lives of individuals and societies.    Rappaport's book provides the most thorough and penetrating look into human religion that I've ever come across. Combining insights from an astonishingly wide array of fields, Rappaport demonstrates the role that religion has played in human evolution and how and why humans evolved to become religious beings. In the end, he makes a fascinating case for the role of religion in human life and why our survival as a species depends on understanding that role.    This is unquestionably the most intellectually rigorous and powerful book I've seen on anthropology and human evolution. As the review below by an anthropology student shows, this book is not easy reading and certainly isn't recommended for people with little background in these topics. However, dedicated students of the social sciences who have an interest in these issues should be able to make it through with some patience. Those who do will be richly rewarded. I've read some fascinating and brilliant works on these topics, but nothing I've come across approaches the raw analytic and synthetic power of Rappaport. He truly was one of the greatest anthropologists and arguably one of the greatest social scientists that the United States has ever produced.   
 How did this terrific movie slip under the radar?  It's about the nature of art, the power of music, the mystery of friendship and love. Most of all, it's about how our fears prevent us from experiencing the immensity of life.  When was the last time you saw a movie tackle issues like this?  The widescreen production is ravishing to watch. It's rare to see an art house film executed with such first-class grandeur. The acting is also uniformly excellent. And the score is luscious.  If you liked THE PIANO or AMADEUS, prepare to be blown away 
 When it comes to discovering the spirit of Provence, never mind Peter Mayle, nor even the wonderful Marcel Pagnol.  Alponse Daudet was responsible for bringing the exquisite subteleties of the Provencal character to the notice of Northern France as early as 1872.  The novel is written with such hilarity, yet such sensitivity, that it makes you desperate to retell it to anyone who will listen.  Simply hilarious 
 Jill hits the target on the mark with her hilarious take on both weddings and divorces.  Anyone who has sat through a truly awful wedding or divorce (or worse, been a direct participant!) will find themselves cracking up over the stories within.  I found myself chuckling the next day at work while retelling these tales within my head!  This is the perfect gift for your girlfriends that 'get it'!  
 This is really good book on a complex subject. The Popular Front was an effort by the French Left to unify in order to fight fascism. It was also an opportunity to lessen inequality in French society. It ultimately failed because it was a negative alliance rather than a positive one and because some of the politicians lacked the patriotism to forget their differences even momentarily. Jackson does a good job of navigating the reader through the complexities of French politics in the 1930's. He also helps us to understand the major personalities involved. He is particularly adept at describing the strengths and weaknesses of Leon Blum, Maurice Thorez, and Edouard Daladier, the three leaders of the Front.  Additionally, the book describes the high hopes of the working class and some intellectuals when the Popular Front was victorious and how these hopes were dashed. There is even a brief look at Popular Front cinema. Anyone interested in French politics in the inter-war years or in the question as to why France was so thoroughly defeated in 1940 should read this book 
 The Deluxe Edition is quite nice in that it has holders for the different cards and money 
 My one real disappointment was the article by Dr. Hancock-Stefan.  While writing from the "maybe" evangelical position, he nevertheless reduces the maybe to a "maybe, but why would you wan to?" kind of critique.  His viewpoint is heavily colored by his experiences with evangelism in the Romania, and Protestant inability to make any traction against a monolithic ethnically orthodox church.  Yet, it seems his concerns lie mostly with volk Orthodoxy rather than with the theology of the living Church.  His (sometimes accurate) claim that Orthodox Christians are disinterested in the faith and have no personal relationship with Jesus Christ is far too one handed; he chooses to paint this picture of Orthodoxy as if it were authoritative while holding up Evangelicalism as the paragon of having a personal relationship to Jesus, though never choosing to see that among Evangelicals there are in fact just as many who have no personal relationship with Jesus and no interest to acquire it, despite a public face otherwise.  I know; I used to be one.  Thus, rather than being a "maybe" from an Evangelical perspective, this article quickly degenerates into a solid no based on unequal points of comparison 
 As someone who has worked on the other side of the table in eminent domain for government agencies for over 20-years, allow me to unhesitatingly endorse Orange County Register columnist Steven Greenhut's book Abuse of Power: How the Government Misuses Eminent Domain. For this book to be authored by a journalist is unusual because, while it is an expose mainly of the abuses of condemnation, on many aspects it reflects an insider's knowledge of the eminent domain game. Any good journalist knows the formula for writing a popular book -- champion the little guy against big government or large corporations. But Greenhut's book is not just another tale of victimology meant only to make money selling books. There are entire shelves of popular books out there that make out some bug or plant as the victim of development as an excuse to steal someone's property. There are many guidebooks to help government agencies in taking property for redevelopment projects that short change the small property owner because there isn't enough money at stake to hire an attorney or appraiser. There are innumerable regulations that can invisibly transfer the bulk of the value of vacant land for the benefit of others without just compensation. Greenhut's book is an antidote to all the above. It is a highly readable 300 pages with 417 endnotes and a helpful list of resource organizations for property owners. Greenhut is on to something big - really big -- in his book. Government property acquisitions for redevelopment projects are predicated on the buy low - sell high principle to make the project pencil out. Greenhut points out the upsidedown definition of "blight" in redevelopment projects as the absence of something, namely tax-producing commercial development, not the presence of slums or hazardous conditions. Thus blight becomes the absence of what Peter can gain at Paul's expense, not the presence of something owned by Peter that hurts Paul. Conversely, there are abuses by hired gun lawyers and attorneys on behalf of property owners at the expense of the public. But the Constitution was meant to protect the small property owner from the abuses of government. The large property owners, developers, monopoly utility companies, and public agencies have their armies of lawyers and appraisers. The small business owner, vacant land owner, the small church or synagogue, or widow is often left defenseless against the predations of government. But now they have Greenhut and his book. It has taken someone with the coincidental name of Greenhut (green=money; hut=house) to expose the "milk-cow" system of eminent domain that feeds lawyers, appraisers, judges, developers, and monopoly utility companies and railroads at the expense of the property owner -- that is unless they have the wherewithal to fight. This book gives them that wherewithal. Property owners need to read it; government agencies should heed it; attorneys should feed it to their clients; academics need it for their classes; and the media should learn to lead with it.   
 This book is so fantastic! But it has some errors. We Korean say, "dirt on diamond'. First of all, in p68, there are wrong photomicrographs about muscle types. 2nd one is of skeletal muscle, not cardiac muscle as typed in this book. And third one is of cardiac muscle, not visceral or smooth muscle. But still I really love this book as a professor of anatomy 
 I remember going to visit my cousin Don in Texas when I was in about the eighth grade. He said "You've got to listen to this new guy.   I've never heard anything like it."  The guy was Jimi Hendrix and the record was Are You Experienced.  Over the next 3-4 years Jimi Hendrix would rewrite the vocabulary of the electric guitar.   Yet IMHO he would never be as revolutionary as he was on this record.  He is both iconoclastic, yet commercial.    This remastered and expanded version of the Hendrix debut album is a revelation. The sound is great and the bonus tracks flow seamlessly. Essential listening 
 Mine is Van Morrison Moondance, Greil likes Astral Weeks, we both like this book.  Its a must read if you are into music criticism.  Its a must have if you need help finding a good cd 
 The WG311T that I recieved worked out of the box with Ubuntu Linux 6.06 LTS (provided I had network-manager-gnome installed). This card consistently receives a good signal and operates at 108mbps very far away from the gateway.  The only reason I am giving this wireless card four stars is because many Windows XP users have had trouble with it 
 Great book. Good for newcomers to vegetarianism or Vedic cookery. I've had and used (as does my wife) this book for many years. From samosas to halava it is very comprehensive and usable. Also it is well done, the pictures and  line art (of Krishna and the cowherd boys etc.) is also very nice. I once  saw the author, spoke to him briefly at the Hare Krishna temple in  Philadelphia -- a very humble devotee! Haribol! All glories to Prasadam 
 Like the other reviewers, I love this book!  If you love your stuff, want to keep it, but need great ideas on how to "contain the clutter" and beautifully display your rooms, this book is for you.  Each chapter contains several ideas for organizing the different areas of the home.  It covers many decorating styles and tastes.  It's all about functional yet beautiful furnishings that work for your lifestyle.  I can't say enough--buy the book and you will see what I mean 
 I would like to thank GOD that i picked up this album. this album is so hot, i never get tired of listening to it. I've introduced this cd to people that are not saved, and they be feeling it. I've been a fan of their music for years, but this one is on another level. You know a cd is hot when you have BOOTSY COLLINS on it, Good choice. So many songs on this cd you can bump in your car and people on the streets will move to it. One of my favorite songs on this cd is "GANGSTA'D UP". That song is for the systems. I hope on their next album they bring back BOOTSY COLLINS. Everyone must get this cd. Do not hesitate on picking this cd up 
 Reading the life of Sid Korshack  also covers an interesting saga of mob history, involving the creation of Las vegas, the entertainment industry and politics all comingled together, which the mob's hand reached into and used to great advantage for the purpose infuencing their criminal interests. There is a great amount of detail documented in this book, which at times begs belief, at the extent of the connections weaving through this mans life, blurring the line between criminal enterprise and the supposed gatekeepers sworn to uphold the law, who have no trouble acting in concert. Put together in a strong compelling narrative, a great read which flows nicely and has a definite ring of truth to it 
 This book not only is a good read but gives you nice thick cardboard patterns to use!  It's a great instruction book with easy to understand terminology.  You will also find an interesting read on Eleanor Burns background and childhood.  I gave this book as a gift to my friend.  It's a book that we will both be sharing.  
 In this wonderful novel, poet Eileen Myles drives into her past's parking lot and sees not dull gravel but "thousands of eggs."  Each of her paragraphs confirms an immense fertility.  Abandoning the linear presentation of time, Ms. Myles connects remembered instants with heart logic, with synaptic precision.  A Massachusetts childhood, a mad grandmother, the oddest assortment of odd jobs, the motley pavements of New York -- all shine in this startling, funny, rigorous book 
 let's get one thing straight - this is a fantastic cd.  i've been looking for the "i'll be" single for months on end when i found this cd in a second-hand store, mint condition.  i bought it for a bargain price and i was blown away by each song, right from the start.  "wish in this world" and "go be young" are great songs, while "promise of you" and the two ballads are prom-worthy love songs... i cannot say enough about edwin mccain, i just wish that they'd come down here so i can hear them live 
 This is an excellent and heartwarming book about growing up in South Dakota. Brokaw, easily the most intelligent, fair and personable of the network news anchors, goes into what made him what he is today -- growing up in America's heartland, the struggles of his father and mother, his life growing up, and his temporary descent into idiothood -- before pulling back and marrying his college sweetheart.  An excellent and highly literate book! I heartily recommend it to anyone who likes biographies 
 This album, when released in 1970, was phenomenal!  All the tracks are great, but especially David's Song and One Day At A Time.  Perfect Joan Baez 
 I'm working on an evangelism project at work, so I've started making a dent in the stack of books I have on my desk.  Out of the Salt Shaker was a refreshing read - well written and engaging.  The stories are, by far, the most influential part of the book.  I agree with another review that said Pippert makes it sound so easy, with people just pouring out their hearts to her.  However, it is encouraging that there are situations when that happens.  I'm sure she has a multitude of stories about her attempts at evangelism not working.  She does include a few of these throughout the book, which gives a more complete perspective.  My only complaint about the book was that sometimes it was a bit redundant.  I might have only noticed that because I'm outlining it for my project, and would find myself typing some of the same things over and over again.  For those just reading the book as a tool to help them with evangelism, it is probably good to have that repetitive nature to burn the ideas into your brain.  I think Pippert's ideas for evangelism are easy to understand and encouraging.  The book made me want to seek answers to questions I have with my own faith, in order to better equip myself to spread the gospel.  Best evangelism book I've read as of yet. 
 a) You will come away with a much better understanding of our country, it's founding fathers and what they went through before they became "rebels". b) It will make you more proud to be an American than you already are...it's truly inspiring. c) Jeff makes history SO much fun. d) It's a wonderful story, by an EXCELLENT author 
 This short tale for young children is based on an old Indian story from the "Hitopadesa." In ancient India, a wise man saves a mouse by magically transforming him into other animals. Finally, the mouse is changed into a tiger but becomes too arrogant, forgetting that he was once  a mouse. The book is illustrated by woodcuts and it won the 1962 Caldecott  Medal for best illustration in a book for children 
 This book is a real good complement to the classic "Case Study Research" from the same author. Some of the concepts of the other book were not aboslutely clear (although the book is very good), but I was really able to understand fully after reading this one. Don't buy one without the other!!! These two books have everything you really need to know about case studies. Good luck! 
 This book does the best job i've seen covering all the aspects needed to make the move from windows to linux administration.  It also makes for an excellent reference for someone just starting out in linux that need a foothold to get going.  I just wish I had found this book 3 years ago when i first started playing around with linux, it would have made my life so much easier.  I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in linux 
 This "dual biography" impressed me in many different ways.  First, it is a lovely tribute to a wonderful mother who was extremely devoted to her children.  I'm so glad the author kept the first part of the book in his mother's own words--it made me really get a sense of her.  Second, it provides  a description of black life (both in the South and later, in Indiana) that I found extremely compelling.  Third, the last part of the book tells of some of the experiences the author has had in his field of education that are very insightful.  This book really got me thinking about what is would have been like to be in Maggie's shoes.  She was kind and wise and I learned much from her experiences.  My life is richer for having "known" Maggie 
 This is a fabulous book, I remember it from my childhood and my family still refers back to it to this day. There is just something so endearing about the concept and execution that is uniquely Newell. The illustrations are vintage and expressive. The text hilarious. Only a curmudgeon wouldn't like this book. I'm glad to see it available again 
 Oddly enough I thought that Nirvana, the band that Dave Grohl drummed for from '91 - '94 was the greatest grunge\punk\alternative band of all time. When Dave decided to be a frontman I was a bit concerned since he was such a great drummer and I thought thats where he belonged. When Dave released the Foo Fighters self-titled debut album it went platinum even though Dave didn't have a band and the album was just made up of demos written by Dave during the Nirvana era. There is no question that Dave learned some things from grunge god Kurt Cobain, but in this album the student becomes the master.   This album is much more powerful and melodic than Daves first, now he has a band! Dave Grohl has now decided to be lead vocalist and rythem guitarist with Pat Smear, a person who used to tour with Nirvana on lead guitar and some other great musicians on rhythem. A songs that really stands out is 'November Stars' which in my opinion is the albums best song, mainly because its a ballad! I've really never heard a ballad from an alternative band before. Dave is one of the most talented musicians ever, like Alice Cooper said before me, quote "Dave... What a drummer and then he puts down the drum sticks and decides to be lead singer" unquote, that alone makes him great. This is probably the second best Foo album next to 'Theres nothing left to lose'. Buy it if you like Nirvana, grunge, late eighties\early ninties music, alternative or just rock in general 
 Lauryn Hill brought a new era of music around by blending more sounds together.  She has done something amazing here: even though she's venting through this album, the listener is not left depressed or angered.    Her album doesn't provoke extreme emotions but it does make you think.  Her lyrics cover a wide expanse of human experience.  I keep hoping that she'll come back and blow everyone away with another album 
 This is a great book with easy to follow instructions!  A must have for every knitter 
 Rather than treating Philosophy and Psychology as diverse subjects it is quite refreshing to see that there are still authors who introduce the subject of the mind to students of Psychology as the deep and absorbing  subject that it really is, and show that they do still walk hand in hand,  no matter how scientific one of them may have become. Even though David  Braddon-Mitchell and Frank Jackson appear to assume that their readers have  a grounding in Philosophy as well as Psychology, they do so in a way which  would encourage a mere novice to widen their knowledge, this will therefore  make the subject of Psychology far more interesting and forfilling, and  thereby make the complicated subject of the Human Mind more clear. It is  additionally encouraging by the inclusion of a comprehensive glossary so  eliminating over-referencing like other texts, but at the same time leads  inquisitive students into fresh fields where they can 'graze' on the  klnowledge of the subject to their heart's content. Each school of  Philosophy is clearly expalined and compared to it's sister, and  subjectively ctitisied. It moves from the pre-history of contemporary  Philosophy of Mind - Dualism and Behaviourism, and early versions of the  identity theory of mind, through discussions on functionalism in its many  varieties, consciousness and quili, instrumentalism and the autonomy of  Psychology, to topics such as eleminative materialism, individualism and  the problems of content and representation. The text according to the  authors, was viewed by students of the Philosophy of Psychology before  printing, this gives an air of originality to the book, which in turn would  be an ideal undertaking for other authors of literature relating to the  ever complex subject of Psychology. The nature and level of the discussion  within the covers of the book make it and ideal foundation for any  undergraduate, and graduate, course in both Psychology and Philosophy. This  book is an up-to-date introduction to, and account of, the transition of  Philosophy from a dry and sometimes non-understandable subject to a  cognitive science where investigation of theories is possible. It clearly  provides students of Psychology, and Philosophy, with a clear and coherant  picture of the human mind, which can only be expanded 
 I guess my favorite character in this immensely entertaining and instructive book would have to be Alexander Csoma de Koros a "Hungarian vagabond" (as Charles Allen characterizes him), born in Transylvania in 1784, who "had been obsessed from an early age with the idea of discovering the origins of the Hungarian people."  As Allen explains "of the various theories about their origins, the one he favoured was that they were descendants of the tribe of Attila the Hun whose original homeland lay somewhere to the east of the high Pamirs."   His quest led him, almost by accident, to the culture and (more important) to the language of Tibet.  He compiled a Tibetan-English dictionary, making himself virtually the first Western master of this vast and complicated civilization.  Aside from its intrinsic merit, Csoma de Koros' inquiry into Tibetan culture made him a player in a remarkable historical enterprise: the recovery of Indian Buddhism.  Buddhism was born in India (or at any rate, on the India-Nepal border).  Yet it virtually vanished from its homeland and by the time the British arrived, its culture languished in obscurity and its monuments stood uncomprehended.  Aside from Csoma de Koros, the recovery of the history of Indian Buddhism can be traced in large measure to the work of a handful of British imperialists, mostly young men somehow connected with the British East India Company, most of them exemplars of the tradition of amateur scholarship.   Perhaps the most famous is Sir William ("Oriental") Jones, who mastered Sanskrit and grasped the insight that the language of the Brahmins must somehow be related to Greek and Latin.  Mostly they worked by a kind of triangulation, working from Tibet, Burman and Celyon (where Buddhism did survive) back to India, where it did not.  The enterprise crystallized about 1836, when scholars first saw that these diverse traditions derived from a common source.  Allen's story is rich enough in character and incident to prove almost unmanageable at times-I found myself assembling my own character-list on the inside flyleaf.  But it is a marvellous yarn, well worth the effort.  Csoma de Koros, by the way never did find Atilla (apparently the Hungarians are not descendants of the Huns after all).  He died in Darjeeling, trying to reach the "Yoogatrs"-the Uighurs, now identified with Xinjiang province in Western China.  He never himself became a Buddhist.   Yet in Japan, of all places, in 1933, he was made a bodhisattva, canonised in the grand hall of Tokyo University.  As Allen reports, "a bronze statue of [him] meditating in the lotus position can be found in the Japanese Imperial Museum. 
 I picked up "Don't Leave Me This Way," from the library one day this week around 4 PM. I started reading immediately, slept from 10 to 6, and finished at 11 AM -- still in my nightie and robe. Needless to say, this was a book I was not able to put down! Not being a medical professional, I read from the point of view of someone/or one who may know someone with a similar crisis in the future.  What I learned from this insightful book is 1st: attitude is everything; 2nd: you know your body better than anyone; 3rd: doctors make mistakes; 4th: always get a 2nd IMPARTIAL opinion; 5th: a loving,caring support system is essential; and lastly: "There really are angels." I heartily recommend "Don't Leave Me This Way" to anyone and everyone.  PS: I wonder if "Dr. Jerk" ever admitted his mistakes. 
 _Beyond Good and Evil:  Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future_ is a translation of _Jenseits von Gut und Bos_ by the tormented German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, first published in 1886.  This edition is translated by Walter Kaufman and includes notes by him, some of which are useful and some of which are less so.  _Beyond Good and Evil_ was Nietzsche's seventh book written after his _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_ and is an attempt to systematize his philosophy.   This book is divided into nine sections with a preface at the beginning and a poem at the end.  The book details Nietzsche's opposition to Judeo-Christianity, his radically aristocratic philosophy for "free spirits", his atheism (although some might say that Nietzsche does indeed have a "god" only a god that is much different from the Judeo-Christian conception) and nihilism, and his thoughts on Germany, England, and France (Fatherlands).  The book also includes epigrams - short pithy statements by Nietzsche which he believed to sum up his philosophical viewpoint.  Nietzsche challenges the prejudices of philosophers including such concepts as "self-consciousness", "free will", and "either/or" thinking.  Nietzsche also provides a history of morals in which he seeks to move "beyond good and evil" overcoming "slave morality" and adopting the morality of the masters.    This book begins in the preface famously with these words, "Supposing truth is a woman - what then?" in which Nietzsche explains that while the philosophers have grappled with truth they fail to understand it in the same way that they fail to understand woman.  (Nietzsche's thoughts on woman are certainly interesting and much could be said about them.)  The first section of this book following the preface is entitled "On the Prejudices of Philosophers".  Here, Nietzsche argues in a series of separate sections against the prejudices of the philosophers and metaphysicians, against Platonic philosophy, Kant's "thing-in-itself", and the "causa sui" as well as Christianity.  Nietzsche mentions the ancient Greeks including the Stoics, Socrates (his relationship to Socrates is complex), and Plato, as well as the German philosophers Kant and Schopenhauer (while Nietzsche was originally infatuated with Schopenhauer, his infatuation grew less especially after his break with Wagner).  Nietzsche seeks a philosophy of the future for "free spirits".  The next section of this book is entitled "The Free Spirit".  Here, Nietzsche explains the "new species of philosopher", the "free spirits" and contrasts the false free spirits (the levelers) with the true free spirits.  Nietzsche mentions the French Revolution, Voltaire, Stendhal, and "modern ideas".  The next section of this book is entitled "What is Religious".  Here, Nietzsche discusses the soul and God (belief in which he regards as weakness) as well as Christianity and such Christians as Pascal and Luther.  Nietzsche also discusses modern unbelief, particularly among modern (at the time) German middle-class Protestants.  Nietzsche firmly opposes Christianity as a religion of weakness for the "herd animal".  The next section of this book is entitled "Epigrams and Interludes" and consists of various short remarks and poems by Nietzsche.  These remarks cover a wide range of topics covering his thinking on religion, morality, women, and the new philosopher.  Perhaps two of the more famous ones are as follows:  "Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster.  And when you look long into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you."  and "Jesus said to his Jews:  "The law was for servants - love God as I love him, as his son.  What are morals to us sons of God!""  The next section is entitled "A Natural History of Morality" and shows the development of morality as the values of the herd came to prevail.  Nietzsche notes how the Jews "a people born for slavery" (Tacitus) brought about an inversion of values, in which the meek and lowly came to replace the proud and great as the highest values.  Nietzsche mentions for example Cesare Borgia as the "man of prey" and contrasts him with those slaves who revolted against the powerful.  The next section of this book is entitled "We Scholars" in which Nietzsche distinguishes between the true philosophers of the future, a high world into which one must be born or cultivated to, and the values of the herd animal.  The next section of this book is entitled "Our Virtues".  Here, Nietzsche contrasts the noble virtues with such ideals as hedonism, pessimism, utilitarianism, and eudaemonism.  The next section of this book is entitled "Peoples and Fatherlands".  Here, Nietzsche brings to the fore his thoughts on the Germans (represented perhaps by Richard Wagner and other "anti-Semites", who he castigates), the French, and the English (who he has little good to say for).  Nietzsche contrasts these peoples to the "good Europeans" who represent the philosopher to come.  Nietzsche's relationship to the Germans and the "anti-Semites" remains problematic.  The final section of this book is entitled "What is Noble".  Here, Nietzsche distinguishes between the aristocrat (representing the master morality) and the slave and lowly.  The book ends with a poem entitled "From High Mountains:  Aftersong" which expresses his profound loneliness with much sentimentality.  This book provides an excellent introduction to Nietzsche's philosophy of aristocratic radicalism.  While Nietzsche is best in his rejection of herd values and the plagues of modernism brought on by the French Revolution, socialism, and liberalism, his rejection of Christianity, his remarks about the Germans, and his remarks regarding Platonic philosophy seem to me to be weaker points in his argument.  Nietzsche remains one of the more important thinkers of the Nineteenth century, and his philosophy would see its pinnacle in the Nazi state (an arguable point perhaps).  This book is perhaps a first attempt by Nietzsche to formalize and systematize his philosophy following his _Zarathustra_ and thus remains a most important part of his works and a classic of modern thought. 
 Garry Wills has a vast knowledge of the history of the Catholic Church, and uses it to great effect in this book. He says "The job of a loyal Catholic is to give support (of the Church) that is not uncritical, or unreasoning, or abject, but one that is clear-eyed and yet loving." And he does just that in this book. "Why I Am A Catholic" makes fascinating reading 
 Krauss's loveable characters break your heart and they journey they take heals it in a strange esoteric way.  This is what reading is all about 
 Cassidy feels left out. She can't run or kick or swing a bat as well as her friends Jeff and Nina. Feild Day is going to be a nightmare! And to make matters worse, Cassidy finds a creepy old doll in the school basement. he tries to hide it away but it keeps coming back 
 OMG, what a treat.  Just received a selection of Lindt Lindor Truffles as a gift, now I'm looking to buy more.  If you haven't tried these you are in for a surprise: words can't express the delicious sensations you can receive when you eat one of these.  I happen to like the White the best, wanna order me a box 
 True that the first version of this book--appeard some time ago, that does not diminish its usefulness to the layman or person interested in the history of the popularization of cosmology--which is a steady business with many competitors.  To find one such book so clearly written is valuable in itself, even as a landmark in this stream of such publications.  As such, it belongs on any amateur astronomer's bookshelf, as well as any true scholar who wishes to place more recent findings in their appropriate context.  I can add one personal note, my father, Dr. Ralph A. Alpher, commented to me when Dr. Weinberg's book appeared that this was the first book to have the history of cosmology through 1977 "right."  And he was in a position to know...on that basis alone, I'll recommend it--if you can find the early paperback edition, it is a fun and short read, also.  Highly recommended 
 I love this album, but i can't seem to find this junt down here in the M. That's just how bumpin this album really is, i can't find it. Project Pat, M.C. Mack, and Scan Man put it down on this junt. This is a straight up classic album, and there probably will never be another one done by these same artists. They all tight. Another good job by D.J. Paul and Juicy J. Get this junt 
 Cite It Right has given me confidence and peace of mind in my research as a writer. I finally understand all of the tricky guidelines that my teachers fuss about. Bibliographies and citations used to drive me crazy, but referring to this ultimate reference book has provided me reassurance in my citing. I know I will use this book through the rest of my college career. 
 This memoir is a brutally honest account of a young girl's burgeoning sexuality.  I can't begin to imagine the soul searching and courage it took to commit this story to paper. The accounts of the other kids in her school and neighborhood were downright harrowing, a reminder of just how cruel children can be.   The author's descriptions of her family life were bursting with colorful detail.  Growing up a single child, I couldn't help but feel envy at the full house and close relationship the author obviously has with her siblings.    I definitely recommend this book 
 The premise of the book is simple: in no other period in history were there two systems claiming the same civilizational and cultural background (Western Judeo-Christian tradition) but at the same time set to fight each other to death. The means, strategies, individual battles and aims of that struggle are all put before you in this book in a way that has no equal.  One day, when time allows us to look at post-WW2 times from greater distance, I think we will realize that if one wants to understand that period, one should not look at the official political history - but rather at this subliminal 'popular' history. Forget Reykyavik summit or even Cuban Missiles Crisis. The history was made in the Nixon-Khrushchev kitchen debate or in Nureyev's leap to freedom (he was the dancer who defected in the title of the book). David Caute gives you a peek preview of what historians will write about the times we lived in.  He has no qualms about claiming victory - the West won and was always set to win. It was only a question of when the facade on the Potemkin village called USSR will come down.  He has a very broad range, going from ballet through exhibitions to sporting events. If you want to read about the reception of Waiting for Godot in London and Paris, it's there.  He knows lots of details. Example: I personally come from a smallish city in what used to be Czechoslovakia (Liberec, about 100.000 pop.). Caute knows that Vaclav Havel was there during the Soviet invasion in 1968. This is something that only Lokalpatrioten (such as myself) are aware of. Needless to say, I was impressed. These little details and stories make it really interesting.  He does not mind getting mad at his own, so to speak. Like, he ends his book with a strong and witty polemic against the various Kremlin Studies/Cold War Studies/Soviet Studies and other pseudosciences in which wackos and useful idiots inhabit parallel universes where Stalin is a hero and Kennedy a villain. That last chapter alone is worth the money.  Finally, let me add another personal testimony: having lived on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain as a youth, I often struggled to put all the pieces together to make sense of what was going on. Caute supplied them all and the whole picture emerged. Reading the book, I would slap my forehead thinking 'So, THAT's how it happened!'. Every such moment freed me some more from the lies I was spoonfed as a kid and I am really grateful to Caute for that 
 Excellent book, I buy this book and give it to my friends, every woman should own this book 
 First the good.  These stories are worth reading anyway, even if not trying to improve your French.  Can't believe I never read Micromegas before!  Can't believe it was written mid 1700s!  So the selection of stories is an excellent one and the practice and vocabulary building comes quickly. For that reason, I'd unquestionably buy this again.  The bad.  I know enough French to know that the translations are atrocious.  Though I am not fluent in French, I believe I could have done a better, truer translation (with help of a French dictionary).  Beautiful phrases are translated into mundane English cliches and some unknown French words are, on some occasions, "translated" into the identical (and equally unknown) word on the English side. Did the translater not have access to an English dictionary or did he not know what the French word really meant?  So -- definitely a useful buy for learning and practicing French and (particularly if you can read most of it in French) interesting stories as well.  Just try not to refer to the English counterpart more than you must, such as for the periodic word translation.  
 No one teaches you to be a CEO, but this book offers a rare peek behind the scenes in other corner offices. The book gives real-world examples of issues faced by some of the world's top executives, and walks you through how Alexander coached them to solutions that substantially increased their effectiveness. He brings a refreshingly human approach to leadership issues. I hear his fee is $1,000 an hour, so this book seems like a pretty affordable way to get his help 
 I come back to this fairy tale for adults every few years and read it again, to revel in its humor, whimsy, sad accuracy about the human condition, and vibrant imagination.  Bridge of Birds is one of the books that stays in my personal library -- it's never donated or discarded 
 Sheldon was at the top of his game when he wrote Master of the Game.  It is a classic Family Saga/Epic that spans decades. Many writers tried to duplicate Sheldon's success with the same formula but so many fell short because Sheldon was one of, if not the best when came to writing family drama.  This is an excellent read, one I can guarantee will not only hold your attention anc capture your imagination, it will not allow you to put it down, until you're finished.  
 Except for one or two things my experience with Microsoft Office Standard 2007 FULL VERSION has been good. The coolest part is the new interface.  It takes some getting used to but it is worth it 
 If you really like Qigong and are interested in practicing it this is a wonderful book to begin with 
 This book should/could be required reading for ALL women throughout the lifespan!  The author, in a clever but straightforward manner, de-myths the impossible images and roles women feel compelled to fulfill.  Her unique "coaching" approach can teach anyone how to analyze, cast-off, and adopt a love for her own self: body, mind, and spriit 
 Bill Engvall has long been my favorite comedian on the scene.  Forget that he's country; forget that he's "blue collar."  Bill Engvall is a sarcastic storyteller of the highest caliber; his sarcasm and irony are honed to a point--which you could use to roast weenies over an open flame, but only if you eat 'em with Slim Jims and a few cans of beer.  On this album, Engvall bypasses his "here's your sign" bit for some real, genuine humor.  He covers scooters ("You feel the need for speed?" he is asked, to which he replies, "I DRIVE a scooter!"), Slim Jims, the great herds of chickens that used to roam these lands, talking fish, boobies, naked arguments, NASCAR advertising, painful passing of gas, and Bad Weiner Day.  It's a diverse album full of laugh-out loud moments, and other subtle jokes ("Thank you to all who understood that one," Engvall quips at one point).  But, as he says near the middle of the album, "Hey, you all paid to see it."  And it was worth every penny 
 I installed it in my new computer with the easy to follow steps and I find that it gives me wonderful protection.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  I am very satisfied.  I feel my computer is very well protected 
 a lot of people brush this book off saying it didn't truly depict raistlin as they knew him later on.  I see it as a perfect example, as in chronicles, during the circus troupe where he was actually happy again.  He really isn't as evil as the books lead you to believe he is.  He just has a huge problem with people who are like what he becomes.  People who prey on the downtrodden, people who attack the weak to gain power for themselves.  People like the kingpriest, fistandantilus, although he obviously reserves some scorn for them (things they did he kind of took personally).  Anyways, it's a perfect depiction of Raistlin, seeing as how he was Weis's character, and she knows him best.  Not many people also understand the relationship between the author and their characters.  Raist needed growth, and in this book, he got it.  It shows all those little things he never wants to talk about, all the people that made him so spiteful and bitter.  I wish he woulda stayed in those red robes.... 
 This is truly a good book. It is short, simply written, and very informative. However, it is a little technical for the average Gardner. I personally picked-up this book to gain general knowledge about soil, and I found everything I asked for and more. Nevertheless, there were things that I felt were not explained enough, but that's not the fault of the author because I am neither a master gardner nor a farmer. In the begging of the book it almost seemed like the author was one of the environmentalist extremists, however as I continued reading I found the author to be a responsible writer with no extremism. As a matter of fact, on several occasions the author offered advise to non-organic farmers. Overall, a great book and coming from my non-farmer background I would give it 4 stars 
 Ondaatje's writing is sparse and moving.   I can't say whether the history is correct, I don't think that was the point.  Another reviewer fussed about the character's unlikely political allegances, again, I don't think that was the point.  The story is about the unpredicatble, powerful forces of love in an uncertain and turbulant time. 
 someone mentioned that he's under-rated, this is very true.  Having talent doesn't mean you'll be mainstream as Tech N9ne proves, I suppose his lyrics are too raw for the mainstream, instead people with weak rhymes, cough, 50 cent, cough, dominate the rap industry.  The mainstream rappers make catchy hooks, and rap poorly over beats that we've heard millions of times.  These mainstream rappers are making millions and millions so they're rapping for money, the underground artists are rapping for money too, but mainly for the passion and love of rap.  Not all mainstream rap is bad, but unfortunately great albums such as these often get overlooked and in turn slip through the cracks, never to be heard by a large audience.  I'm sorry to interject my opinion and go on a rant, I just feel that some of these unknown artists deserve the success that the mainstream rappers undeservedly have. Get all of his albums because any fan of rap, real rap, will like what they hear. 
 This toy is a favorite.  I love the tune, it's stuck in our heads and we all bob our heads along to the quacks. My daughter also walks around the house saying "wack wack wack"  and also does it whenever she sees a bird of any kind. It has really cracked us up!  The red connectors get bent easily, so watch how you leave it in the box, but it will fix itself easily too. The ducks did fall over a lot in the beginning. She would actually get mad at me when I righted them for her. As a result our ducks have no paint on one side. But now she does it herself and manages to pull them along just fine.  It was very loud when we first got it but I think the batteries are dying and I'm very sad that I can't figure out how to replace them. I used to dread putting the toys away because something would hit it and it'd start quacking, amplified by the toy bucket, and wake everyone up. Sometimes the string gets wrapped around a wheel and doesn't get pulled enough to quack, but my daughter will supply the sound effects just fine. She loves to push carts and drag stuff behind her so I'm sure this will last... but I miss the quacking! 
 After nearly three years, we seem to have accepted the common wisdom that the intelligence was manipulated and Bush/Cheney convinced the American public, and especially the Congress, that Saddam was a threat that couldn't wait. Funny, but that's not the way I remember it.   There were a lot of people who questioned the cherry-picked intelligence at the time. Richard Clarke, for instance. And Brent Scowcroft. Most of the rest of the world, as represented by the United Nations, wanted to continue weapons inspections. With Saddam boxed in by no-fly zones, weapons inspectors, and a ton of spy technology aimed at Iraq, he really wasn't much of an immediate threat, and most people knew it. Still, it is interesting to revisit those pre-war days, just to make sure I didn't imagine the whole thing.   Hans Blix spent a lifetime as a diplomat, and as you would expect, he couches his criticisms in pleasant-sounding phrases. Much of the time he does just that, but every now and then, he lets fly with a real, unadulterated opinion. Near the end of Disarming Iraq, he "suggests" that Tony Blair and George Bush and their advisors misled the public by asserting categorically that weapons of mass destruction existed. In the world of international diplomacy, I suppose that is what passes for a slap in the face.  In the run up to the war, there was a lot of behind-the-scenes maneuvering and endless analysis by pundits and the press. It is fascinating to be able to read one inside player's report on what was said in those private meetings. I was surprised to find that Blix has great regard and admiration for Condoleezza Rice. I was less surprised to find that he has respect and perhaps pity for Colin Powell, and no use at all for Dick Cheney or Paul Wolfowitz.  Blix is thorough in describing the history of arms inspection and the history of the U.N.'s dealings with Iraq. Certainly this is useful and important information, but for me the appeal of Disarming Iraq is the description of what was happening in the weeks and days before Iraq was invaded in 2003.  Blix's accounts of his meetings with Cheney and Wolfowitz are chilling. Cheney coldly threatens him by telling him that if his weapons inspectors don't find some evidence and fast, Cheney will not hesitate to discredit Blix. Blix's meeting with Tony Blair is less chilling (Blair offered him crumpets), and the meeting with Bush, revealing.  Blix, in ultra-diplomatic mode here, writes of how Bush's manner contrasted sharply with that of Cheney's, how he makes a "boyish impression" and "frequently changes his posture in his chair." He told Blix and ElBaradei that he was no wild Texan bent on war, that he would let the Security Council talk about a resolution, but not for long. Bush "mentioned the League of Nations." You get a picture here of Bush, impatient and fidgety, making non-sequiturs about the League of Nations, and eager to get this useless meeting out of the way.  It isn't surprising that congressmembers and senators would like to think (or would like us to think) that they couldn't have known what was really going on, but even people like Blix, who says he thought Iraq had weapons programs, could see that in March, 2003, there was no need for an invasion 
 I have deliberatly taken some moths to read this book. It has the energy,it has the insight, it tells-it-like-it-is, its your private rich mentor buddy coaching you through your life.  Though, its directed to a more specific high-tech start-ups, the advise is worth its weight in gold.   No book on enterpreneurship is self contained, and ones appreciation is always the result of a comparision on whats out there. Guy starts well by letting the energy burst out and make meaning, if your are going to do it, do it so the world is a better place. this is consistent with the test of joy mentioned in Big Bucks.  Design, design well, design something beautiful and unique, In chapter 9, the art of branding, guy tell us 2 If you have something's thats gold, you can make a lot of mistakes with it and still succeed.  if you don't, you have to do almost anything right". this should be your action mantra, how manny people do you know who had to be perfectionists because they lacked the golden touch 
 Over the years I managed a staff, I grew concerned about the ignorance of basic business behavior among employees.  Asking a new staff member to read a book like this might head off some future conflicts.  Worth a try... maybe even highlight some sections that you feel are most important 
 I'm a real fan of this show.  If I were not and I saw this movie, it would make me a fan of this show 
 This is a truly romantic movie.  I laughed, cried, cheered, and sighed along with Danielle's  ups and downs.  I would say that this movie is even better than the Cinderella fairytale since it realistically portrays the class differences that would have been evident between a poor servant girl and a royal prince.  Love truly does conquer all.  I especially loved that the evil step mother and step sister got what was coming to them at the end!  Ms. Barrymore outdid herself 
 Jonathan Culler's 'On Deconstruction' is a remarkably lucid analysis of the theory and practice of deconstruction.  Not only does Culler introduce the whole concept of deconstruction step by step for beginners, but also analyzes the most complex aspects of Derrida and De Mann's work for the more knowledgeable reader.  This in fact, is the beauty of the work.      The reader's journey into the murky field of deconstruction begins with an analysis of reading.  Focussing on the reader-response theories of Stanley Fish, Culler illustrates how reader's have been seen to take a more active role in the production of meaning in texts in recent years.  The role of the reader has gained importance also in the world of feminist criticism.  Culler attempts to analyze what exactly it means to 'read as a woman'.      So far, so good, even for the beginner.  A reader with virtually no knowledge of deconstruction can begin to develop an idea of what the theory is actually based on, reading strategies and the production of meaning.      The final two sections, which deal with deconstruction itself are more difficult to grasp without a background in literary theory and terminology.  Culler addresses topics such as 'graft', 'traditional hierachies of thought', and the now notorious 'differance'.  Yet still, his analysis is clear, thorough and comprehensible.  His final section, giving examples of deconstructionist criticism, is interesting in the way that it shows the complexity of the topic.  Few of the works he cites have anything in common with each-other, and the meaning extracted from various works proves to be both thought-provoking and original.  Isn't this, after all, the whole aim of deconstruction.      Fornovices in the world of post-modernist literary theory, this book is still extremely useful (especially if read more than once).  Those readers with a background in the subject will also benefit from Culler's extremely detailed analysis of the mysterious world of deconstrution 
 simply put... the performance- superb! edit and mix- fair... for me how an album is pieced together contributes to the performance/cd as a whole. more attention should have been placed on the applause in between each piece. i found myself constantly having to adjust the volume to hear the music and then to turn it down in between pieces. a minor annoyance but one that can deter one from listening. 
 Our book group read and loved this book.  So much to think about and discuss -- a sort of female "River Runs Through It," because of its sumptuous references to occasions -- the food, the drink, the making of  gatherings.  The group admired Smith's extraordinary courage -- taking a  young family abroad, bearing twins overseas, undertaking family life on a  remote 163 acres of Montana's wildest.  They loved her language: a  "solitary dune girl" now "summer's white-haired child."   This is an earthy, generous, candid, poetic story -- of universal appeal 
 This book is very imformative and easy to read.  It has alot of insight into families as well as history.  A good read for anyone studying family, marriage, history or a fan of Al Gore 
 Enjoyable on many levels: as a coming of age story, as a portrait of a strange subculture (both repo men, and LA punks of the early 80's), as diverting light science fiction, and as a simple slice of Americana. Not one of the greats by any means, but it stands up and bears multiple viewings.  
 If you are an individual investor, this book is for you. It is an easy read and helps you get started quickly. Jason defines many of the market measurements you should watch, value and growth oriented. He also summarizes strategies from many of the successful investors like Peter Lynch, Warren Buffet, William O'Neil and others. At the end of the book Jason provides a few strategies that have worked for him and his "stocks to watch worksheet" which I now use to track my stocks 
 This book is all you will ever need (and you WILL need it) to plan long trips.  I find that planning food rations for long trips is one of the biggest logistical challenges.  Not only can the planning be difficult, it can also be difficult to figure out which foods will keep your body energized and healthy over long periods of time (i.e. not Ramen).  When you are on a high altitude expedition or on a long-distance backpacking trip this is very important.  This book tells you which ingredients to bring along, how to break up food during the day (i.e. 10% of your food should be breakfast food, 25% should be lunch food, etc.) and which foods work well for each category.  Included in the book are two worksheets which you can photocopy and use for each trip.  The worksheets are basically formulas - you plug in the number of people in your group, the number of days you will be travelling, the quantity of food you want to take each day (the book also makes good reccomendations about how many pounds of food you should eat each day) - and then the book tells you how many pounds of breakfast foods, dinner foods, etc you will need for the entire trip.  Once you have all of the basic ingredients, the book also has a great recipe section which tells you how to put together all of your ingredients into tasty meals.  The book is small enough that you can take it with you on your trips (maybe 6 inches by 8 inches?).  If you're really nitpicky you can cut the "cookbook" section out of the book and leave the rest at home  to save weight.  I'm glad that I finally got around to writing a good review for this book, and someday I need to get around to writing a thank-you letter to Claudia Pearson for writing it 
 Booth is a master at bringing words to life. You can't help but feeling like you are right there with him as he travels through Japan.  Seeing, smelling, hearing, tasting, feeling what he experiences.  In "Looking for the Lost," Booth reveals the subtleties of the Japanese people, their culture, and their land that at once demystifies Western stereotypes of Japan and envelopes the country in a totally different kind of mystery.  I found nuggets reminiscent of my own visit to Japan.  A delight to read!   
 This CD rocks!  If you liked the movie and the music, this is the CD for you.  Latin music, Richard Gere in a tux, what's not to like?  The caution about playing it in your car is because the first time I listened to it was in the car and it's really hard to dance and drive at the same time (although I tried! 
 This is a remarkable book to reach students.  I first read it looking for items for my classroom bibliography for Asian-Pacific month in my high school Creative Writing class.  Not only is this very factual, but it allows many voices to "speak" about their individual experiences prior to, during, and after the horrific event.  I teach honors students as well as emergent English students.  All were fascinated and rave about the book.  This one was taken home for parents and siblings to read.  I am  requiring this book and James Clavell's The Children's Hour in my curriculum this year.  They are good, cautionary pieces, easily understood and small enough to not daunt the reluctant reader.  I believe world events DEMAND these be required reading by all thinking people 
 I thought this was a chick flick but i actually really liked it 
 I'm not a Catholic and knew nothing of Thomas Merton, but came across this book by following links of "customers who bought this, also bought..." and by reading Amazon reviews.  I was not disappointed.  Reading like a novel at times, this book is an autobiography of a faith.  I was very impressed with the author's search for a faith, his many trials and searches in the wrong place, and his determination to find somthing "bigger than himself."  This book written over 50 years ago is dated in ways by theology and politics that seem out of place now; however, the overall impact of Merton's search is well worth the effort to read.  This book is for someone who is searching for a deep quiet faith -- one that is found through searching, reading, praying and worshiping quietly and individually.    This book is not in the same category of many popular Christian writings of this time.  Thomas Merton's faith is one that was found in an ancient church and many ancient writings.  It was a faith found through traditional liturgy and reading.  I don't think Merton would have been comfortable in many of the modern churches (both Protestant or Catholic) that attempt to mold worship to meet cultural demands.    Thanks to all the reviewers who so aptly described this book and caused me to want to read it.  I hope others will find it equally as inspiring 
 these are cool; i like them.   better than plastic stays.  and i prefer the shiny metallic finish to gold or bronze color.   i just with the pack came with more of the 2.5/3.0 inch stays instead of the 2inch stays.  p 
 This was a wonderful movie when I was younger and first saw it!  I am so glad to have watched it again and still feel the same 
 Wow!  This book is great for people of all ages!  It gives you specific guidelines that you can use on a daily basis to learn how to handle life's ups and downs with grace and with a positive frame of mind.  Very practical and easy to understand!  Thank you, Blair 
 The indignant and arrogant demands for ease of understanding expressed by so many reviewers here exemplify the passive, anti-intellectual customer service-based epistemology that Spivak educates us against and that drives todays globalizing and enslaving culture.  Her book is profound and urgent 
 As a member of the military who has done some military self defence traning and also a martial arts trainee, this book was excellent.  The techniques and advice are straightforward, useful and 'real world'.  The only downside is it doesn't come with someone you can practice with (a must to really learn how to apply the techniques instinctively and explosively) 
 O'Rourke delivers some of his best stuff in Peace Kills: America's Fun New Imperialism.  In this book, long time traveler and heavy drinker turned fake family man P.J. O'Rourke writes about his visits to Terrorist hot spot Egypt, he discusses nation building in Kosovo, he walks in recently conquered Baghdad, and he takes on hippie protestors marching in Washington D.C.  P.J. O'Rourke has authored numerous works of this kind; they're basically the observations of a storied traveler pretending to be a serious journalist in some of the most dangerous places on the planet.  Some of his other work in the arena includes "Holidays in Hell" and "All the Trouble in the World."  It almost makes the reader wonder what P.J. did to make his assignment editors so angry.  That's what also makes most of his works so much fun, O'Rourke approaches deadly situations with humor and pith.  In the funny department, this is O'Rourke's best work.  His opening essay discusses why American's hate foreign policy.  This essay has got to be the best work ever for P.J.  It is so dense, nearly every sentence brings either a thought or a laugh, and despite how funny the essay is, O'Rourke finds truth.  American's do hate foreign policy, and we should.  O'Rourke also dissects that the stances of other nations, and makes a humorous case for unilateralism.  However, O'Rourke doesn't live up to expectation.  The final essay of the book, the climax, his description of conquered Iraq, is a huge letdown.  I doubt it's for any fault of O'Rourke's. he just wasn't exposed to anything more exciting than aid truck queues.  This is still a must read, and it beats any of O'Rourke's other travel tails of mayhem.  
 I am confused by some of the other reviews of this book. Not just by the low scores, but also with the comments therein. The majority of the complaints about the book seem to be directed at Heinlien's political views and his adamantness derived therefrom. Now this is all well and good, everybody is entitled to their opinion, but the weird this is... THERE ARE ALMOST NO POLITICS IN THIS BOOK! Okay, so what is the book about then? Well, it's exactly what you'd expect, it focuses mainly on Robert's writing career. Sure, there are a few political meanderings here and there, but they are extremely few and far between. Such off-target reviews are almost enough to make one wonder whether or not these people actually read the book. Instead, this book consists of a large body of letters that were written before and (usually) after the publication of a Heinlein opus. From his first published stories, to his juveniles, to his controversial adult novels, they're all covered here. The letters show a lot about what went into the making of his works, and also shows some other interesting things, such as the trouble that RAH seemingly always had with editors and getting his words out like he wanted to. There is also a picture and sypnosis of the original version of most of the stories and novels that RAH put out. There are also letters on various other topics (such as travel, house-building, domestic life, etc.), plus a short biography of Robert (written by his wife), and a highly convenient bibliography. My only complaint about the book is that there is almost no mention made of his books written after I Will Fear No Evil. True, this isn't his best work, but they are important, and do indeed contain some fine novels (JOB, Friday). Perhaps, due to the author's deteoriating health at this time, there weren't really any letters written. However, one wishes whatever there was was included so as to make this book complete. Thus, it's not perfect, but certainly not as bad as some other have apparently made it out to be 
 This looks like a really cool anime. I might just order the boxset or get in a store if its possible. This created by from the creater of my favorite anime Sakura Wars. So it must be really cool 
 Jurgis Rudkus of Lithuania comes to Chicago with his family and fiancee to fulfil the American dream, but their ignorance of everything from the English language to the necessities of living in a modern capitalist economy leave them open to every kind of exploitation. The family is slowly destroyed by overwork and poverty, and Jurgis finds two avenues of escape over time. One is to join the corrupt elite of unionists and the local party machine which is itself partly responsible for the deaths of Jurgis' father, wife and children. But that eventually fails, and finally he is saved by a rendez-vous with the Socialist movement. In the last few chapters Jurgis quickly disappears as the focus of the book turns from his personal life-story to a vision of a rosy future with the Socialists being voted into power in the city, and, it is implied, eventually across the country. I don't mind so much that Jurgis was saved by Socialism. The book could have served as a searing indictment of the meat-packing industry and of capitalism in general if it had been a straight tragedy, but it is understandable that Sinclair wanted to offer some hope for the reader as well. Also, the hero Jurgis certainly can be said to have deserved some kind of salvation after all his trials and mistakes. But what I can't forgive in the book, from a literary perspective, leaving aside the political and historical aspects, is the way he is not only saved by a crude Socialist deus ex machina, without any kind of personal struggle to redeem himself, but the way his whole personality is abandoned, to be swallowed up in this supposedly greater reality of international socialism. After all the heartbreaks and false hopes, the reader is left to be consoled with the most dreadfully tedious lectures by Puritanical socialist cameos, some of whom appear only in the last chapter. I have tried to see how perhaps we should view the victory of socialism as somehow encompassing Jurgis' own salvation, as well as the salvation of the working class. No doubt this was the author's intention. But the ending is so terribly impersonal it leaves at least this reader disappointed. Compare the exquisite beauty of the opening chapter, where we are led in medias res to see Jurgis' wedding feast, held in Chicago, but conducted according to Lithuanian traditions. Gradually, we are brought to the awareness of the terrible reality which surrounds this fantasy, the reality of the working man's struggle with his existence. There Sinclair achieves a brilliant synthesis of the personal struggles of his characters and the wider message of the oppression of the working man. But I wonder whether he was either carried away with his political zeal, or pressed for time by his publisher, because that personal aspect is quite lost after Jurgis attends that fateful socialist meeting. Other reviewers seem to agree with me that without that final burst of anti-individualist propaganda, this would have been a five-star work 
 THIS IS THE STORY ABOUT ONE OF THE LEGENDARY PITCHERS OF THE GRAND OLD GAME. A TREMENDOUS ON THE FIELD SUCCESS AND OFF THE FIELD FAILURE. HIS 1926 WORLD SERIES IS LEGENDARY AS IS HIS STORIED CAREER. BUT HIS OFF THE FIELD DRINKING AND EPILEPSY IS VERY SHOCKING AND GUT WRENCHING. I WONDER WHAT SORT OF CAREER HE COULD HAVE HAD IF HE DIDN'T HAVE TO FIGHT THE DEMON OF ALCOHOLISM. ALEX'S PLAYING DAYS ARE DONE IN GREAT DETAIL, JUST WISH MORE WAS AVAILABLE ABOUT HIS PRIVATE LIFE. BUT A WELL DONE JOB BY THE AUTHOR. A MUST READ FOR BASEBALL HISTORY FANS 
 If given the opportunity to be the 666th customer review of Stephen King work, my advice to you is two simple words: Take it 
 Speaking across a generational divide, I find "Writing Dialogue" helpful for self-editing. I am too annoyed by the tv culture to sustain interest in author's clever essays. But I do look at tv in spurts with better informed, purposive ear.  It is bending the ear to picture scenes that instructs my writing. Helpful, but annoying in my sixties. Grandma Write 
 I loved The Electric Company when I was growing up in the 70s and 80s.  Why they took it off of television is beyond me.  My husband and I loved watching the DVD and reminiscing over our favorite characters and sketches. Morgan Freeman is my all time favorite from this show. My 5 and 7 year olds were automatically hooked on the show after one episode!  But I do have one complaint about this particular DVD.  There is the offer to buy this AND the Best of Electric Company together.  My advice...don't buy them together!  They fail to tell you that the five episodes on "Best of the Best" are also included on the 4 disc set, so you will have 2 copies of these five episodes if you buy both. But the entertaining and educational memories from this show are priceless; I wouldn't return them for anything!   
 I discovered the Old 97s by getting into other Bloodshot artists awhile back, and I kinda traced the line to the 97s.  This album, though, made me wish I found them earlier.  Different from their earlier work, but gripping.  Unlike many albums where a song that is catchy the first time gets old fast, the pieces on Drag it Up can be a fixture in your CD player and stand up to repeated listenings.  Great lyrics, great melodies, and a very good flow to the album overall.  Fantastic 
 This is why I purchase audio books. I can't stop. Great adventure is still alive and well. 
 I absolutely fell head over heals for Orson in Fear Nothing, and, I really like Chris, Sasha, and Bobby, too.  So I made a bee-line for part two - Seize the Night.  Once again Dean's heroes are complete - funny, thoughtful, and ready to go the distance for each other no matter how scary it is.  The problem is, if you are listening to these books on disc/tape... Dean does way tooooooo much catching you up on the history from Fear Nothing.  More than once I fast forwarded and more than once I growled, "What about Orson!?".  No worries though, it all turns out as it should and is a great story...  I want more! As always the imagery and Dean's ability to pull you to the edge of your seat are extraordinary, and the reader (Keith Szarabajka), though at first may not "sound" right, is perfect.  
 I bought several books on how GarageBand works and while some had some helpful hints, the author of this book, Bob LeVitus, knows what he's talking about. Every sentence and page has valuable advice on how this thing, "GarageBand", really works. He also includes the limitations of GarageBand and alternative software suggestions for more elaborate recording needs. The author is very knowledgable about home-studio recording and he has excellent suggestions on microphones, speakers, and inexpensive technical gear incl. audio interfaces, etc. that will make your recording project a professional adventure. This book is so interesting and has so many useful tips, etc. that everyone playing around with GarageBand should read it in order to easily use this Apple application and to get the most out of it -- saving you a lot of frustration at the same time 
 I fully understand why there is a discomforture with the evolution of Jack from a force for mindless vengence, to a fully fleshed out character confronting choices and responsibilities, I am happy to see this character involved in a mature relationship and friendships that defy convention.More than just a vigalante! 
 A refreshing look at the ripper with a good insight into the secret societies. Depp as usual plays a very good part. A great movie 
      The 600+ pages of THE STRIPPING OF THE ALTARS lie beside me now, their once-smooth softbound spine wrinkled and creased, its bends evidencing my progress from cover to cover. Books of this scope (and length) really ought to be produced only in quality bindings.  I regret the obvious wear and tear that even a single reading leaves on such an otherwise fine object.  But then perhaps I'm reverencing the object rather than its contents. Of course, in so doing, I'm in the company of many 15th century Christians who, though incapable of understanding the Latin in their Primers (Books of Hours or Horae), nevertheless revered their treasured copies as being themselves sacred objects.       Beyond reverence for Primers, 15th and early 16th century Christianity is fascinating for its cults of the saints, its cult of the five wounds of Jesus, and especially its observances such as the annual Rogationtide processions, during which fields were blessed and demons were driven from the parish boundaries. The evolutionary links from Christianity back to Pagan religions are starkly evident in many of the practices and devotions of the period examined by Duffy.       The author's goal in the writing of this book was to demonstrate that, contrary to some historians' assertions, popular adherence to traditional religion, i.e., Roman Catholicism as then practiced, was alive and strong until its forced abandonment by successive monarchs during the Protestant Reformation.  Consequently, its title notwithstanding, THE STRIPPING OF THE ALTARS is primarily a study of English religious practices in late medieval times preceding and culminating with the Reformation, and these practices are most interesting indeed.  In fact, although Duffy does not speculate on this, I thought that I saw several such practices that have endured, more or less transformed, of course, into today's cultural norms.  As one example, I wonder if the modern practice of bringing food to the family of one newly deceased does not have ties to the soul-saving practice of giving food to the poor of the parish who came to help pray for the soul of the dying 15th century Englishman?       As I hope this single example illustrates, it would be an error to consider this book "ancient history," for the beliefs and practices that it studies underlie today's Christianity, whether it be practiced according to Catholic or to Protestant customs.  At the very least, Duffy's book should leave the reader with a heightened appreciation of the continuity that we share with our English ancestors of 450 years ago (assuming, obviously, that "we" equate to Caucasian European Christian immigrants to the New World, although converts to Christianity from other ethnic and religious ancestry should also find the history of their chosen religion to be of interest).         In speaking of Duffy's book, I have used the word "study" several times, and that is a most intentional word choice.  Duffy has not written a popular history but a scholarly examination of his topic.  In so doing, he assumes that his reader is knowledgeable of many items used in religious observances.  In this regard, let us say that I often had recourse to a dictionary.  He also includes frequent quotations that are written in English of the Late Middle and Early Modern periods.  If one reads Chaucer with ease, this will not be a challenge; otherwise, reading such passages aloud, usually more than once, may help the reader "translate" them into Modern English.  Still, this makes for occasional slow going.  Duffy's own use of (modern) English is precise and erudite, yet not what I would describe as scintillating and is the reason that I have given his book four stars rather than the five that its detail and excellent research would otherwise deserve.       For the reader interested in this period of history and in the evolution of modern Christianity, THE STRIPPING OF THE ALTARS is a valuable resource.  I also recommend WIDE AS THE WATERS by Benson Bobrick, IN THE BEGINNING, THE STORY OF THE KING JAMES BIBLE by McGrath and GOD'S SECRET AGENTS by Alice Hogge. May you enjoy your studies 
 After taking a long haitus from baking because of a busy work schedule, I suddenly found myself with a long-term houseguest who has a decided sweet-tooth, and this book has been a godsend! I have been baking cookies and brownies and cakes galore, to rave reviews: my husband and our guest have declared me a bloody genius! Everything I've tried has come out exactly as promised. Abigail Dodge's reassuring, conversational style is so refreshing, and she made me realize that I don't need huge blocks of time and a bunch of gadgets to get great results. I actually like to bake again. Thank you, Abigail 
 I looked at every book about Farming I could get my hands on and this one came out on top.  I grew up on a farm and am hoping 30 years later to buy the old homestead back. I loved the detailed diagrams and explainations. Maurice went into detail on important areas like soil types and care and feeding of soil, irrigation, even waste disposal systems. He refreshed my memory on a lot of important points and taught me some things I don't even think my father knew.  If I were to ask for any changes, I wish he would have included a lot more about livestock and perhaps less about orchards and growing fruit. But all in all, it deserves 5 stars. Buy this one first!! 
 The logics involved in his thinking is admirable, but what is even better is how he weaves his ideas into blocks of paragraphs which makes it easier to digest complex issues.   You can learn how it is possible to have order in randomness.   It is worth every penny. 
 The _Short Oxford History of Europe_, under the general editorship of T.C.W. Blanning, is an especially well-edited series of 11 brief but meaty topical surveys covering the region's entire recorded history, from Ancient Greece to the latter part of the 20th century. The reader is assumed already to know the broad outlines of European history and to want look below the surface of events to the underlying forces and trends. While each volume is composed of a series of articles by experts who bring unique understanding and insights the result is much more integrated and consistent than that of the usual collective work. The transitions between volumes are well managed so that the series can be read as a seamless history from start to finish if desired, but the reader who is looking only for insight into a particular period can read just one or two volumes without feeling that he is missing the secret key.  The overall impression, in fact, is a good deal like a far shorter (and much more affordable) version of the _Cambridge History_  series.   The chief lack is of good references to sources. At the end of each volume is a "further reading" section which is generally pretty thorough and helpful, but there is no way to tell where a particular fact or insight comes from except in those cases where the chapter author has mentioned the origin in his or her text.  It should be understood that these are not narrative histories of the events of their periods. A timeline of major events is provided at the back, as well as a series of clearly-presented maps, but the chapters cover topics rather than sub-periods, and generally are not themselves organized chronologically.   Covering a century that included much of the Renaissance, the Reformation, the age of European oceanic exploration, and the beginnings of the Counter-Reformation, this volume meets the challenge of integration admirably. In weaving them together it illuminates all these seemingly disparate strands. Amazon's helpful "Look Inside" feature gives a good idea of its contents and style 
 In "Pulp Fiction," Haut studied the early 20th century crime writers - Hammett, Chandler & Co. In this follow-up, he shifts his focus to writers in the field of crime starting around the 1960s and  continuing on up through the current crop of "Neon Noir" writers.  At times, Haut's attempts to filter modern crime fiction through the prism  of Vietnam, Watergate and Reganomics seem a bit forced, but overall, his  analysis finds foundation. Full of trenchant observations on the works of  James Ellroy, James Sallis and Daniel Woodrell, among others, this is  certainly a worthwhile read for serious readers of contemporary crime  fiction 
 As always, Langer comes through with well-tested recipes and useful techniques. The discussion on equipment is the best among all the smoke-cooking books we've seen, as are the tips on woods and charcoals and maintaining temperature, and there are some unique smoked main dishes --Smoked Gravlax, for instance, so useful for the fisherman who loves Gravlax but fears parasites in the traditional cold-cured salmon. Recipes for simple side dishes which go perfectly with smoked foods abound --the Langer Cole Slaw, for instance, uniquely flavored with wasabi and chives, is now a family standard (slightly altered by our substituting yoghurt for the sour cream). Clear instructions, amusing "continuity" detailing the author's experiences, and charming and useful drawings by Susan McNeill, who draws objects and events from life --her life as the author's wife 
 I have to tell you, I have been a fan of spicy food for the last 20 years. I have tried wicked salsas, and crazy-hot sauces. I thought I had seen it all until I received Dave's Total Insanity as a gift last Christmas.  I arrived home from work and decided to give this sauce a try. We were having rice for dinner, and I launched a generous topping of Dave's Total Insanity into the mix, and dug in.  Oh, my! This stuff was no hot I had to throw out the whole dinner. I put way too much in. I never expected "nuclear meltdown." Friends, this stuff isn't child's play. Heck, I wouldn't even secretly put it in my enemy's food. I might get arrested.  Dave's Total Insanity has a great taste, and is perfect for the spicy food lover in your life, but don't go slathering it on your pile of chicken wings until you have a small taste first. You will waste a meal unless you use it in moderation 
 This book is the best what has happened to me during this summer. This arrangements are fantastic. I love Barry's playing 
 Before it crashed, the Medusa satellite detected an immense cache of diamonds far beneath the desert of northern Eritrea in Africa. The Americans tried to keep it secret, but word got out, and groups of unscrupulous people vowed to find the diamonds. One group sought to insure success by kidnapping the best friend of famous geologist, Philip Mercer, and bargaining the friend's life for Mercer's discovery of the diamond lode. In his quest, Mercer faces threats that come ever-faster, until he finds that the diamond mine holds a great and deadly secret. This is an enjoyable adventure that should keep you turning the pages 
 This is my favorite book of all time.  By the time I had graduated high school, I had already read it twice.  I wrote a term paper on it in college.  When I deployed to Iraq, I made sure this book went with me.  I am planning on picking it up again in the near future.  A true classic that should be read by all.  I cannot recommend this book enough.  
 Jacob Riis' first and most influential book, How the Other Half Lives details the lives of the impoverished of New York City's slums at the end of the 19th century. His expose was highly influential and brought about a number of reforms within the City, yet the tome is filled with almost comical stereotypes and prejudices about the various races and cultures found within the domain of the tenements, sidestreets and alleyways that the poor called, for lack of a better word, home. Despite this massive shortcoming (a sign of the times Riis lived in), Other Half is an engaging read and showcases the severe plight too many endured during this period in history, moreso than the most depressingly dour of Dickensian prose 
 This is what best desrcibes this album. I wouldn't recommend you buy any of their others, but now that no one remembers they were on the TONY HAWK PRO SKATER game, it is safe to purchase and enjoy... Best song... "Between angels and insects 
 This movie is a true inspiration.  The man portrayed in this movie overcame oppression and a disability all in the service of the country he loved.  Cuba Gooding Jr does a great job playing Carl M. Brashear, the first African American Naval Diver.  If you ever have the feeling that you want to quit or give up on something you should watch this film for inspiration.  Unfortunately, today, we lost this great man.  I have attached the story from CNN below.  RICHMOND, Virginia (AP) -- Carl M. Brashear, the first black U.S. Navy diver who was portrayed by Cuba Gooding Jr. in the 2000 film "Men of Honor," died Tuesday. He was 75.  Brashear died at the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth of respiratory and heart failure, the medical center said.  Brashear retired from the Navy in 1979 after more than 30 years of service. He was the first Navy diver to be restored to full active duty as an amputee, the result of a leg injury he sustained during a salvage operation.  "The African-American community lost a great leader today in Carl Brashear," Gooding said of the man he played alongside Robert DeNiro, who was Brashear's roughneck training officer in "Men of Honor." "His impact to us as a people and all races will be felt for many decades to come."  In 1966 Brashear was assigned to recover a hydrogen bomb that dropped into waters off of Spain when two U.S. Air Force planes collided.  During the mission Brashear was struck below his left knee by a pipe that the crew was using to hoist the bomb out of the water. Brashear was airlifted to a naval hospital where the bottom of his left leg was amputated to avoid gangrene. It later was replaced with a prosthetic leg.  The Navy was ready to retire Brashear from active duty, but he soon began a grueling training program that included diving, running and calisthenics.  "Sometimes I would come back from a run, and my artificial leg would have a puddle of blood from my stump. I wouldn't go to sick bay because they would have taken me out of the program," Brashear said in 2002 when he was inducted into the Gallery of Great Black Kentuckians. "Instead, I'd go hide somewhere and soak my leg in a bucket of hot water with salt in it -- that's an old remedy I learned growing up."  Brashear faced an uphill battle when he joined the Navy in 1948 at the age of 17, not long after the U.S. military desegregated.  "I went to the Army office, and they weren't too friendly," Brashear said in 2002. "But the Navy recruiter was a lot nicer. Looking back, I was placed in my calling."  Brashear, the son of poor sharecroppers in Sonora, Kentucky, quickly decided after boot camp that he wanted to become a deep-sea diver.  "Growing up on a farm in Kentucky, I always dreamed of doing something challenging," he said. "When I saw the divers for the first time, I knew it was just what I wanted."  In 1954 he was accepted and graduated from the diving program, despite daily battles with discrimination, including having hate notes left on his bunk.  He went on to train for advanced diving programs before his 1966 incident.  "He kept to himself personally, but his military life was an open book," said Junetta Brashear, his first wife, who lives in Portsmouth, Virginia, near Brashear's home in Virginia Beach.  She said Brashear's health started to deteriorate about three years ago, but that he had experienced problems ever since the amputation.  Brashear married childhood friend Junetta Wilcox in 1952 and had four children -- Shazanta, DaWayne, Phillip and Patrick -- before their divorce in 1978. He later married Hattie R. Elam and Jeanette A. Brundage.  
 I bought this reciever for my hsband as a gift when his old radioshack reciever finally went. His reciever was 24 years old, after talking to several radio shack sales people they all basicaly agreed it was comprable to the sony system and his old system. the sound is great and the look is nice as well. great value 
 This book is for anyone to read, not just bible students and scholars. It breaks the bible down and teaches what is really inside of it. Pick this one up, you will not regret it. Excellent content and truth abounding 
 This book told me a lot about raising goats.  I learned more than I thought I would.  Now I can start a goat farm with confidence.  Thank you 
 This book is very good to my kid. It covers not only literature and math, but science, art, history, etc as well. Both my kid and I like it 
 This is must reading about one of the biggest threats to our country's security. Illegal, undocumented Mexicans are entering the USA at what should be considered an alarming rate. They are putting a strain on our social services, taking advantage of our country's benefits, and in many cases are involved in violent drug trafficing. Jim Gilchrist...a true Patriot...details this problem, and tells how the Minutemen are doing all they can to stem this tide. A GREAT book 
 Sigur Ros' debut is one of the weirdest CD's I've owned for a few years.  I just listened to it the other day and I am still blown away by its awesomeness.  It's sung in a made-up language by Icelandic space rockers.    The songs are beautiful, long and well-crafted.  There is generous use of the string sections.  The entire album is dreamy.  It sounds like it was made on an alien planet, or music made in the future.  This album is gorgeous music.  It always calms me down.  This is always a good album to put on if you want to fall asleep to - it works for me every time.  Tremendous debut - they'll never top this.  I can't recommend this one enough 
 For the professional therapist there's nothing like knowing good practice.   I cherish this little tome on Erickson for its ability to offer so much insight into the working practices of one of the great therapists. What makes it so important is the fact that nothing is as real as belief - that of the therapist practitioner and that of the client. Milton believed firmly in his ability, coupled with deep insight, compassion and understanding each situation.   In his own words we learn how important it is only to be a guide for the client who makes all the important decisions. We, the therapists are only there to guide and comfort. We do not heal - that is down to the individual client 
 The book doesn't go "in-depth" on any of the movements, just takes two pages to explain each exercise (step-by-step, trajectory, grips, range of motion, things like that) along with anatomical illustrations. Note that the book is kinda small when it comes to dimensions, so it doesn't really include THAT much information for a book that's almost 200 pages.  It really doesn't touch on anything outside this basic premise.  Still, I think this is an *essential* book for beginner and intermediate bodybuilders and health enthusiasts, the science is simple and easy to understand, the illustrations are PERFECT and very informative, the book is nicely organized.  My favorite thing about the book is how it explains different grips and position and how subtle differences in technique can target different areas and help you make the best out of your workouts, very handy reference.  To summarize, while book doesn't offer anything too complex or advanced; I still think it's essential for anyone who takes the sport seriously, and at $13.5 (at the time of this writing), you can't go wrong!  EDIT: I borrowed "Strength Training Anatomy" from a friend, and I must say, it contains much, MUCH more information than "Bodybuilding Anatomy". But that's not to say it's better or worse! Here are some key differences:  *As stated, STA has much more information than BBA, they're not even comparable in this department. *The drawings in STA are more complex but sometimes less informative. *STA has much more information on the given exercise, while BBA focuses more on different grips and trajectories. *STA also covers more ground when it comes to injuries and such (something BBA doesn't really touch on at all). *BBA is much easier to read through and understand, it's much more "user friendly". *BBA explains how the muscle group works and how it is composed before starting with the exercises. STA has none of that, goes straight forward to exercises.  Which one should you get? If you're a beginner/intermediate lifter, go with BBA, otherwise, go for STA 
 This book was my first read from the for dummies series.  I found it informative.  Although some of the content was a repeat of what I have already read as a chronic dieter, I still found the information helpful.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like to learn the ins and outs without the mumbo jumbo.  It also has helpful nutritional info at the back 
 Do you want to learn , understand, and remember Ajax, with a goal of developing more responsive web applications. If you do, then this book is for you. Author Brett McLaughlin, has done an outstanding job of writing a book that in no time will allow you to write JavaScript code that fires off asynchronous requests to web servers.  McLaughlin, begins with an overview of how to use Ajax. Then, the author shows you how to send requests on different browsers, master ready states and status codes, and even pick up a few extra dynamic HTML tricks along the way. Next, he shows you how to send your users' requests to a server, and let your users keep on working while they're waiting on a response. The author continues by taking you on a stroll through the Webville Tree Farm. He also shows you how to write a nifty DOM-based application. Then, he shows you how to post data. Next, the author delves into a discussion about XML. Finally, he provides an extensive overview of XML and JSON.  This most excellent book is designed to show you how to learn Ajax and asynchronous programming the right way. More importantly, this book provides a visually rich format that is designed for the way your brain works 
 I have no dancing experience, but have enjoyed the challenge of this workout DVD.  I find the dance number at the end of the stretches and exercises is a good cardio boost, though it won't compare to time on the treadmill.  This is a good workout for toning and stretching.  And fun 
 Billy Joel breezes through a variety of styles, ranging from doo wop to the Four Seasons. There's even a little Beethoven thrown in, just to show he's smarter than all of us. Joel's transitions through a variety of styles seem almost effortless, which is of course why he gets so much criticism. His talent cannot be questioned, but it almost seems like he can do this stuff in his sleep 
   The Lost World is probably, no the best sequal I have ever read.  It's not as good as the first dinosaur-eat-human adventure Jurassic Park, but nevertheless, this is a great book.  The movie as I said in my Jurassic Park reveiw is a cheap imatation.  I mean really cheap.  In the book there are different dinosaurs, Eddie Carr was young, Sarah Harding's no paleontologist, there's no big team that goes to Isla Sorna, there's no Nick Van Owen (Thank God!) in stead there is Doc Thorne(He's cool), there's no Peter Ludlow, instead there is Lewis Dodgeson, and the T-Rex never goes to the mainland.  Don't waist two hours of your life watching the movie.  Waist fifteen hours of your life reading the book 
 There are lots of novels in this genre, dozens and dozens.  Some are very good; some are poorly written and edited, poorly presented, barely readable.  Made for TV movies are sometimes good, sometimes sappy and romantic, sometimes very bad.  Yet every once in a while, there's just nothing else on the tube, and we find ourselves sitting through the type of movie we normally wouldn't select: it's just not our type of story, it's a weepy romance.  It's been done before.   Take sports movies for example.  If you've seen one, you've pretty much seen enough.  There's Hoosiers and Rudy and Field of Dreams.  Do you want to sit through another one, where it comes down to impossible odds, the last few seconds, and the most improbable comeback in the hands of the most unlikely player in history?  But we do.  Admit it.  I'll be channel surfing, and the last few minutes of Hoosiers is playing, and I'll stop to watch when Gene Hackman tells his guys to measure the court in the big arena.  I like that scene. Romancing the Zone is a basketball novel.  No, it's a lesbian romance.  You know, it's like those movies we'd never admit we watch.  This newest effort by Kenna White is in fact a little of both, and better than most in both genres. It has a little bit of everything. How about an over-the-hill college player who never got to finish her last year of eligibility, coming back to play on a team that won six games last season?  Throw in a daughter who's on the same team, out for the year with an injury, urging her mom on to rekindle that love of sport that never really goes away?  How about a coach who grudgingly falls in with the plan, and a small school is suddenly united behind this thirty-nine-year-old hero? Mix in a growing attraction between coach and point guard. It could work.  Come on, admit that you tear up when Rudy gets to play.  Confess.  We all love it when the improbable happens, when secret fantasies become real, when for once, the good guys actually win.  No matter how hardened your heart, it is touching when true love conquers old fears and prior committments. I'll make you a deal.  If you could put this plot in the hands of a good writer, one who doesn't over do it, who controls and defines her characters, who gently helps us suspend our disbelief and our cynicism, then I bet even the crustiest of us would smile and sniffle and even laugh. Kenna White has done just that, taken a time-worn story line and with great skill and deft handling refreshed and energized it.  Of course it's infused with a few twists and turns, but the heart-warming scenes are just that, touching, not overblown and sappy and ridiculous as those cliched movie moments can be.   With subtlety and skill, we are pulled into the story.  There's no last second buzzer-beater; this author's taken the kind of story that became cliched for a reason and revived it, reminding us all of why we once enjoyed them in the first place. Relax and read along.  You won't be bored or disappointed, you'll be smiling and occasionally, if figuratively, on the edge of your seat.  Just like in a stuffy, hot, high school gym, sometimes the drama comes alive again, and we are back there, collectively holding our breath until the ball swishes through, until the girl gets the girl.  It's nice when you can pull for something like that without feeling embarrassed or suckered into it.  Clear, crisp writing, well-shaped characters, and a gentle homage to those sappy love stories and sports movies we so often scoff at and denigrate. Well worth the price of popcorn and hankies.   Come on, people, it's World Series time, college football is in full swing, and it really mattered when we played Little League, remember?  All those Friday nights in the stands, didn't you get a lump in you throat at times? This book is like that.  
 Stacy Perman is one of a rare breed:  a great writer, but even better, a great storyteller.  She makes the world of Israeli espionage interesting, engaging and relevant, even to this would-be cynic.  The jacket says this is her first book, but I can't quite believe that.  She has the investigative instincts of a seasoned entrepreneurial journalist coupled with an easy-to-understand writing style that makes this somewhat esoteric subject matter understandable.  Can't wait for the second book 
 Jeff is going to produce some brilliant music over his journey and he's got a monster talent to take with him. Having heard Jeff play live on eight occasions in Australia I can testify that his star is in the ascendancy and his voice is growing in strength and character. You'll hear it on later releases. The common feature of Jeff's playing at the great East Coast Blues Festival in Byron Bay is that when he starts up the wings of the stage fill with musicians from all over the world who obviously hear something very special. As for the reviewer whose comment that this is what passes for blues in Australia, I did cringe and get angry. It's gotta be good ol' home-grown USA rehashes of Son House, does it? Heard of Dave Hole, Jeff Achison, Chris Finnen, Pete Cornelius, Phil Manning? Nup, didn't think so. Besides, am I losing the faculty of sight because I haven't seen a THIS IS A BLUES RECORD sign stamped on any of Jeff's records. What made you this it was going to be total blues rather than a fusion? Commentary based upon bigotry and profound ignorance is pitiable. As we say here, pull your head in. Jeff's going to shake your world up 
 Well researched and well written page turner.  Dr. John Money's theories run counter to his own research for his doctoral thesis.  But they brought him a lot of research money and acclaim.  They brought his victims a lot of heartaches.  What the arrogant pride of one research has done to so many children and their families ought to be criminal.  Not to mention the gratuitous sexual posturing to which he subjected his young patients.    This gripping tale reveals how magnificent the courage and determination of an unquenchable human spirit can be.  Young David  KNEW he was not a girl despite well-intentioned parents and a psycho-social system co-conspiratorial to his brainwashing.  It explodes the gender identity myths fashionable in the 50's and 60's, and examines the efforts of other researchers and victims of sexual "reassignment" to protect future children from this kind of experimentation.  While the factors are complicated, the sad post-script of the suicide of both twins is something in which the aptly named Dr. Money's authoritarian hypocrisy certainly played a part. 
 I find it hard to put the book down. Robin Cook again used his great skill of mixing humor with suspense 
 If you are a fan of Gregg Karukas you will simply love this album. It is arguably his best with not a song that isn't just fine. It is all smooth jazz at its best and in my opinion definitely woth owning 
 Buy this album - don't even think about it - just buy it.  The love songs on this album are superb.  The singing is almost perfect.  Thank goodness the old albums are being remastered and are once again available for all to enjoy 
 I endorse the comments of the previous reviewer and support his plea for a re-release of Big Black's Pig Pile. When Pig Pile (the CD) was released in Australia you could buy the video for an extra amount. Since my grandmother had died some years earlier, I had nothing to sell to raise the boodle, so  I had to make do with just the CD. Since I've never been able to find the  video again, I've regretted it ever since. If the company responsible won't  re-release the Pig Pile video, is there anyone out there who can find me a  copy? For the purposes of a review, the CD at least is frighteningly  awesome. I have no doubt the video was anything less 
 "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa" is among the most insightful analysis of the reasons behind the underdevelopment of the African continent. The book, published in 1972, was written in a Marxist context. The author demonstrates exceptional analytical depth and critical research into how European colonialism and capitalism were a double edged sword in creating deep rooted underdevelopment of the continent which has been very difficult to uproot.  Since the book was published, a lot has happened in the world which would appear to expose some flaws in the book, particularly his views that socialism or Marxism are the correct vehicle for the development of the African continent. However, the Marxist philosophy is now almost completely discredited. The few states worldwide that still practice unadulterated Marxism are impoverished pariah States tottering on the brink of collapse weighed down by the irrelevance of the Marxist dogma (they are indeed slaves of a dead philosopher). However, this hardly diminishes the legacy and impact of this great and famous writer in his exceptional exposure of how Europe underdeveloped Africa. His basic message of the need for the generality of the African peoples to enjoy the vast resources of the continent is still a cherished dream.  The profound underdevelopment of the continent highlighted by Rodney is still with us today, although the blame for this should now be shifted to African leaders. In fact, the legacy of colonialism has been the rise of some political leaders who mimic the colonial masters in their ruthless exploitation and subjugation of their people and their grotesque excesses. The various territorial conflicts on the continent are largely the result of the creation of the artificial borders during the partition of Africa, with no regard to the cultural affinities of the indigenous populations. The brain drain that started with slavery 400-500 years ago continues unabated to this day, with most of Africa's brains working outside the continent.  Because of his principled stand for the downtrodden Africans in Africa and the diaspora, Walter Rodney was assassinated in 1980 in his native country Guyana. However, his legacy and thinking will never die. The book is a must read for people who seek a just and equitable world order and those who wish to understand the history of Africa.  
 My grandson absolutely loves this book.  He sits quietly for this book and doesn't for others that are not interactive 
 "The Cathedral Within" is a very inspiring book, as uplifting to the spirit as "The Triumph and the Glory" and that is saying a whole lot, believe me.  What a great book this is, filled with such  inspirational examples of living life as it should be lived, looking after  others, and growing as a person because of such generosity of spirit 
 I'm Japanese high school student. Having been intrested in linguistics fora long time, I decided to try this book. It was pretty dificul for me in terms of words and vocablary but this book let ma have an intrest toward  sociolinguistics. This book contains a lot of examples. ( I couldn't fugure  out all of them, though. ) And made me realize we never can say  "correct English" or somewhat. If there is anyone who is  intrested in linguistics, please giveme a line. I hope to share our  knowledge anf the way of thought 
 I have only read about 25% of this book since it is a very large one (over 1000 pages), but I can say The Decline & Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon is one of the best history books I have ever read. Thought english is not my native language, the book is, with a few exceptions, very easy to read. It is loaded with a lot of history since it covers over 1000 years, but this fact does not give you a headache if your not into learning everything in it. The book covers the history of the Roman Empire from the 1st century A.D. to the final collaps of it in the 11th century. What I like about Gibbon's writing style is that he follows every emperor's reign and (not going into very much details) explains the ups and (mainly) downs of this great empire. That is why I wormly recommand this book to any history lover and specially to the ones interested in the reasons of the great fall of The Roman Empire.  Edit: I have read over 80% of time and I can say I am truly impressed. From all the theories of why the Roman Empire fell, Gibbon's ones are the most respected. Some argue he is a "paganist" writer since he thinks christianity is the main reason for the fall of the Roman Empire (maybe that's why I like the book so much... I totaly agree with his opinion).  If you are interested in the fall of the Roman Empire this book is a must and should come first before any other book on this subject. 
 The book provides well-informed background on the major players.  Primarily a text book, its print is small, with a left margin that takes 1/3 of the glossy page.  Get your glasses out 
 I personally found 'Far Way Trains Passing By' to be a very calming and soothing collection of tracks.  I felt a congruency of feelings with Urlich Schnauss as I did when I listened to the Icelandic band Mum.  I have been overall very pleased with the quality on this 2x disc set because almost all the songs have a calm and catchy rhythem along with the songs holding similarities to hold the CD together and play as one unit of music rather than a compilation of songs 
 I was looking for a silicon skin with a hard plastic screen cover. Most other skins use the thin film protector. This one has hard plastic over the silicon skin. The click-wheel is behind a layer of silicon and it is just as as responsive as if there were no skin. It *includes* a dock adapter so the docking is still snug and secure. This fit my needs perfectly and, several drops later, the nano is still undamaged 
 WORKS GREAT AND WITH ANY MATTRESS.  DUE TO SEVERE NECK INJURIES I CAN NOW SLEEP BETTER AT A SLIGHT INCLINE.  THANKS ... 
 the mouse has now gotten a bit too popular, but that's ok.  a great band like this deserves it.  if you are just getting in on the secret now, as many are, then you may not be ready for this album.  it's odder, darker and in some ways less accessable than good news.  such an amazing album though. without question, one of the best albums i own 
 This is a cute story. My boys mainly enjoyed how the main character's efforts to protect his veggies kept getting bigger and bigger. I enjoy this book too 
 Francis A. Schaeffer was one of the foremost philosophical thinkers of this century, a theologian that enfleshed the Christian life and taught many in the faith to use their brains, not to attack and 'debunk' truth,  but to use their grey matter to think logically and spiritually, honoring  Truth. The author has influenced countless millions, directly and  indirectly. His philosophy and thinking was based on the scripture and  maybe most of all on the Letter to the Romans from Paul the Apostle. The  letter is the main document that links the Old Testament Torah to the  revelation of Jesus 
 Hello, this little booklet is excellent. You get all information on lean concepts in your palm and right where you need it -not at your desk- but on the shop floor.  Even better would be customized country versions to spread the lean culture widely amongst companies;-))  Regards  Ralf Lippol 
 I never hoped to see another book by Richard Lamparski, whose series of "Whatever Happened to" books were huge hits in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s.  I don't know, I guess I thought he had left us.  But instead he has been writing and writing this "Hollywood Diary" in which he reveals some of the true gen he wound up finding out about the colorful Hollywood film stars (and demi-stars) he met while doing the radio show and the bestselling books.  Some of the portraits are caustic, some pretty luridm but most are quite touching.  He takes us backstage into the private life of scenarist Dwight Bodeen, the man behind CAT PEOPLE, as well as into the home of mysterious Hollywood legend Samson De Brier, only a name to most, but to Lamparski a living link to the old Hollywood of unabated money and sexual irreverence.  Among the young people Lamparski met were Darla Hood, the heroine of the oldtime "Our Gang" comedies, and Tommy Rettig, the charismatic and height challenged star of the TV series LASSIE (from the 1950s).  With both Hood and Rettig Lamparski developed a warm and intimate relationship, and two of the finest chapters of his HOLLYWOOD DIARY give us their lives in miniature.  I don't think that Lytton Strachey, the Edwardian stylist, could have improved Lamparski's portraits of these great, underrated artists.  We get to know them warts and all, and yet they are touched by the golden patina of love.  On the seamier side Lamparski spills the beans on the rivalry between Hollywood he-men John Payne, Dennis O'Keefe and Robert Taylor that make all of them seem like overgrown and unappealing children.  He goes to Mae West's funeral and speculates on her relationships with all the guys he sees there, quite comically.  He remembers early on in his career of tracking down and securing an interview with the elusive Zeppo Marx, by pretending to be a hotel worker bringing him flowers.  Marx, perhaps taken by surprise, allowed himself to be photographed in a bathrobe, and when the interview came out, people felt sorry for him, for he had also lost his wife, Barbara, to the more debonair and talented singing legend, Frank Sinatra.  Lamparski also takes into account the greater freedom of the present era by peeling back the sex lives of some closeted or semi-closeted Hollywood personalities.  His account of the making of THE LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER (1935) is hilarious in this regard; now that I know what I know, I can't wait to see that film again!  On the back of HOLLYWOOD DIARY, like a "sneak preview" the jacket copy says that Lamparski has also written a MANHATTAN DIARY.  If it's half as entertaining as HOLLYWOOD DIARY, it will be a classic for the ages.  Move over Ned Rorem, there's a new and even more revealing diarist on hand 
 "Bridge Over Troubled Water" is one of the few albums- The Who's "Live at Leeds", The Beastie Boys' "Check Your Head", The Velvet Underground's self-titled third album, Radiohead's "Kid A"- that are already viewed as a classic by some of the eminent critical voices of our time yet deserve still more acclaim. It transcends the minimal constraint that prevented the group's previous two albums from reaching such a phenomenal height- namely, that both stood in the shadows of the Beatles' at times only minimally superior work- to become a definitive "great album." Yes, the "Bye-Bye Love" cover is insignificant, but it is also more than competent. Yes, "Baby Driver" is a throwaway, but it's irrepressible, and quite superior to The Who's similar "Goin' Mobile." But neither of those songs undermines the record's overall tone and texture, nor do they dilute the strength of its unbelievably moving title track. "The Boxer" and "So Long Frank Lloyd Wright" are also quite beautiful, and the latter possesses an intoxicatingly rhythmic bridge that often gets overlooked by listeners in favor of the easier pleasures of the album's two more well-known ballads. "The Only Living Boy in New York" is breathtaking and grand, both a ballad and an anthem; of all the songs S&G recorded, it's the nearest in style and scope to "Bridge Over Troubled Water," though "America" might be said to hold this title as well. "Cecilia," on the other hand, is possibly the catchiest song of the entire 1970's. The instrumentation throughout "Bridge Over Troubled Water" is impeccable; the writing is understated and evocative- in its concision, it states as much as Dylan often could in twice its length; and both vocalists are represented at their peak here. Simon would never top his work here, though he came close on his underrated first solo record, and Garfunkel would record a few good albums and make a few half-hearted attempts to become a movie star before sliding into relative obscurity. "Bridge Over Troubled Water" is the greatest achievement of two of the sixties'-and all-times'- greatest pop artists, and deserves every plaudit it has been and will ever be served 
 Firstly, I haven't read this text-yet. However, when I do, it will be one of the earlier versions. This is because this text was recommended to me, by name, at a conference I attended, in Washington 
 I was not aware that Edmonton, Alberta features a vibrant black and immigrant community (my own poorly-traveled ignorance), and that's the setting for this riotous fantastical pop-cultural novel. Minster Faust gives us a fast-moving, brainmelting story populated by a wide variety of multicultural geeks and goons in E-Town. The events rotate around two excellent main characters, Hamza and Yehat, a moody writer and a brainy engineer respectively, who are down-and-out working dead-end jobs and reveling in a realm of comics, movies, sci-fi nerd TV, role-playing games, and all other forms of geekitude. The brokenhearted Hamza soon falls stoopid in love with the beautiful and mysterious Sherem, who claims to be an archeologist just returning from an expedition to Egypt where she learned about ancient languages and old African kingdoms, hence blowing poor Hamza's mind with exotic trivia.  It turns out that Sherem wishes to recruit Hamza and train him, a la Obi Wan and Luke, to fight a millennia-old archeo-narcotic cannibalistic conspiracy. Faust's construction of this eviltacular nogoodnikery gets a little bit out of hand, and some dark passages in the build-up to the story's climax don't mix too well with the lovable humor of the rest of the novel.  However, rest assured that Faust is a master of bodacious language, with a lot of heart and hipness and laughs, and his characters are uniformly fascinating. This especially applies to Sherem's true nature and the deep, complex friendship between Hamza and Yehat as the self-styled Coyote Kings. This has gotta be the most creative and offbeat debut novel to come along in a while. [~doomsdayer520~ 
 One of the most controversial aspects of "Wall Street Versus America" by Gary Weiss is the author's assessment that SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt was not the champion of the small investor as the press made him out to be; that, in fact, he aided and abetted the abuses against the small investor by refusing to curtail the corrupt practices on Wall Street.   Weiss' assessment of Levitt is tersely summed up in the opening pages: "Levitt presided over the worst abuses to descend upon Wall Street since the 1920s.  He failed miserably at dealing with the problems that he did not ignore entirely, but he did a couple of things better than just about any recent SEC chairman in history - give speeches, and court the press."  And this is the crux of what makes "Wall Street Versus America" a work of historical dimension.  Each of the Wall Street abuses detailed in the book, most of which continue to this day, were by themselves a fraud on the public investor.  But together, they rendered Wall Street not a fair and efficient capital allocation system but an institutionalized wealth transfer system.  No book has, heretofore, shown this so clearly. Wealth was sucked from the masses of little investors and transferred to the corporate and Wall Street insiders while the cop on the beat, the SEC, looked the other way.  I recently retired after 21 years on Wall Street,  during which time I made numerous written appeals to the SEC, the Fed, and in GAO testimony to halt the same areas of corruption covered in "Wall Street Versus America:"   the rigged arbitration system; the 1920s style creation of conflict-riddled mega banks/brokerages; the rampant kickback schemes with lofty sounding names.  One word aptly describes the outcome of each of my appeals: coverup.  Thus, I am not surprised that Weiss has borne the brunt of threats and backlash for this comprehensive and courageous work.  For those skeptics who can't believe that "Wall Street Versus America" is a keenly insightful and accurate portrayal of the corruption-riddled practices of the largest and most lauded financial system in the world, here's  background to digest before you move on to the main feature: "Wall Street Versus America."   In a 1994 article by Business Week (4/4/1994: Beware the IPO Market) regulators had the goods to clean up the systemic looting of American investors by bulge bracket Wall Street firms and their cronies.  The article quotes Lynn A. Stout, professor of securities regulation at Georgetown University Law Center: "The IPO [Initial Public Offering] market is rigged.  It's rigged against the average investor."   The article goes on to define exactly how a "penalty bid" works.  "This is a penalty imposed on brokers who flip or sell their customers IPO shares right after the offering.  The practice, devised by a group of top Wall Street firms during Securities Industry Association meetings in the 1980s, is used by underwriters to help prop up the stock price of an IPO in the sensitive weeks following its issue.  Brokers whose customers flip, risk having their commissions taken away, giving them an incentive to discourage customers from selling out."  The article points out, however, that the Wall Street firm's institutional clients were allowed to cash out while the individual investors are left "holding the bag" and serving as a prop under the price of the shares.    Two and a half years later, the Wall Street Journal took up the issue of the penalty bid.  (12/2/1996: Tough IPO Market Triggers Penalty Bids Against Brokers by Deborah Lohse)  "Even though penalty bids are taken out of brokers' commission, many investors gripe that they are the ones being penalized, since their brokers exert subtle, or not so subtle, pressure on them not to sell their IPO shares while the penalty bid is in place."    One and half years later comes Michael Siconolfi and Patrick McGeehan in the Wall Street Journal, who decide to take the gloves off on this penalty bid issue.  (6/26/1998:  Big Institutions Can Cash Out Quickly; the Little Guy Can't Without Penalties) "It's one of Wall Street's best kept secrets: While securities firms allow big institutional investors to dump hot new stocks at their whim, often within hours or minutes of the stock's first trade, they try to persuade investors to hold on to IPOs, for better or worse."  This article clearly points out that while the little investor continues to be fleeced, the SEC has its lens fogged.    It's now  March of 2001.  It's seven years since Business Week first tipped off the regulators and the Wall Street Journal reporters did everything short of filing the brief and buying the handcuffs.  And there are no more hot IPOs.  There are only drowning IPOs. Ron Chernow in the New York Times summed it up:  "Let us be clear about the magnitude of the Nasdaq collapse.  The tumble has been so steep and so bloody - close to $4 trillion in market value erased in one year - that it amounts to nearly four times the carnage recorded in the October 1987 crash."   Chernow likens the NASDAQ to a "lunatic control tower that directed most incoming planes to a bustling, congested airport known as the New Economy while another, depressed airport, the Old Economy, stagnated with empty runways.  The market functioned as a vast, erratic mechanism for misallocating capital across America."    This misallocation of capital, capital that should have been feeding American innovation to secure our economic future but went instead to build millions of miles of unneeded fibre optic cables or now bankrupt dot.coms while shifting wealth to such unprecedented levels of concentration in America as to threaten our democracy, can be placed squarely at the feet of Arthur Levitt's SEC.  That most of these practices continue unabated today means Gary Weiss needs to start work on a sequel immediately and that regardless of who is sitting in the oval office, there's likely to be a Wall Street crony at the helm of the SEC.

 After debating between this and the 70-200 L series I decided to purchase this lens.  I have been pleasantly surprised by the results.  I also own the 17-85 and the 50mm 1.8 lenses and I have found that I have gotten the "most pleasing" results from this lens.  The pictures have been very sharp from my 20D - even in the 200mm - 300mm range.  I've also been happy with the quality of the bokeh.    The primary drawback I see is that the AF tends to hunt a fair amount when confronted with low contrast images.  That being said, I used it for some flying bird shooting at the wildlife refuge and was surprised to see how many of the shots were in sharp focus.  However, it was a little bit of all or nothing.  Several shots were also wildly out of focus.  Since the lens is fairly slow to focus, you never know what you're gonna get with such a fast moving object against the distant sky.  I had much more consistent results when shooting soccer, softball and football in the park.  The AF speed did not present an issue for any of these activities and the results were excellent.  I wish the lens were a little less expensive but I the prints I have gotten from my 13 X 19 printer have been worth the extra money 
 My 2-year-old daughter loves this book because of the farm animals and likes pointing out the scarecrow when he appears.  It's a great book for bedtime because it's calming and toward the end it gets dark and the animals start turning in for the night.  The illustrations are beautiful and it is an enjoyable read for all.  If your child likes animals and the moon, this is a must-buy.  
 I used the valuable, step-by-step, practical information in this book to sell my first house by owner, a rental house at that. Book does a great job explaining the FSBO process from start to finish, with lots of good advice on all decisions involved and troubleshooting problems along the way. I found one of the FSBO companies with a local office to be of great help with the earnest money paperwork, and free advertising on CraigsList brought in both leads that signed to buy the house.  (ARG! My first buyer did not work out. 
 I found the definitions to be vague, and even the definitions of terms change as you go through the chapter, which is confusing, when you're trying to retain all this new information.  The author should provide a list of examples of terms, so that we understand and grasp what the meanings of terms are, and how they are linked to other definitions.    For example, a cash flow from investing actitivites are defined as "cash flows related to the acquisition or sale of the company's productive assests". As you do some homework prolems and online quizzes, you can gather that productive assests are more than manufacturing equipment, which was the one example given in the book.  If I don't know what productive assets are, then I'm not going to understand what cash flow from investing activities are.    Also, why not provide an answer key so that you can check to see if you're doing the work correctly and that you have the right understanding?  The answer key should not be just for teachers 
 The Woodlanders is said to be one of Hardy's more descriptive novels and Hardy is also said to have a love for this part of the country. I thought this was a beautiful passage:  "From the other window all she could see were more trees, jacketed with lichen and stockinged with moss. At their roots were stemless yellow fungi like lemons and apricots, and tall fungi with more stem than stool. Next were more trees close together, wrestling for existence, their branches disfigured with wounds resulting from their mutual rubbings and blows. It was the struggle between these neighbors that she had heard in the night. Beneath them were the rotting stumps of those of the group that had been vanquished long ago, rising from their mossy setting like decayed teeth from green gums. Farther on were other tufts of moss in islands divided by the shed leaves--variety upon variety, dark green and pale green; moss-like little fir-trees, like plush, like malachite stars, like nothing on earth except moss."  And this description of Winterborne as a wood-god really stood out for me:   "He rose upon her memory as the fruit-god and the wood-god in alternation; sometimes leafy, and smeared with green lichen, as she had seen him among the sappy boughs of the plantations; sometimes cider-stained, and with apple-pips in the hair of his arms, as she had met him on his return from cider-making in White Hart Vale, with his vats and presses beside him."  It is said that Winterborne was a creation derived from Hardy's own father.   The book also has the typical Hardy realism and tragedy based on innocence and wrong choices, the unfair position of women, mere chance, or should I say Chance, in keeping with the way Hardy uses it.  For me, somehow, the more descriptive nature of the book, while not that descriptive--Hardy is a realist not a romantic, gave the book a hazy, almost somnolent quality that almost distracted from the clarity and meaning of the book. Maybe it was Hardy's intention to have the woods form a kind of shadowy hold over the characters, the readers--there's the strange effect a single tree had on Winterborne's father, and another on Grace. But Hardy's description of the moors in Return of the Native had more power for me. Also, the characters seemed undeveloped to me, especially Grace, who was a main character. Marty seemed more real, though maybe that was intentional as the book ends with her, and poor Grace floated un-fixedly in the non-place between two classes.  I love Hardy's novels and poetry otherwise I may have given it 3 stars. I just read it--it may be I need to ruminate on it for awhile. 
 This intelligently-written book contains a nuanced discussion of immigrant incorporation in the United States. It updates and clarifies "assimilation" theory, and describes how it can be applied to understanding how immigrants become part of American society. I recommend it to anyone interested in a thoughtful discussion of these issues.

 April 13, 2003 Sunday City Edition  SECTION: COMMENTARY; Pg. E-5  LENGTH: 854 words  HEADLINE: BETWEEN THE BOOKENDS  BYLINE: Ann Lloyd Merriman, Editor, Commentary/Books  BODY: In the publishing cycle, spring usually brings a surge of books geared to the coming vacation season - lightweight, easy reading that can be used for escape or entertainment. Some call these books brain candy; most can be read without switching intellectual gears from neutral.  But a few titles rise above the flow to demand closer attention. One of them this spring comes from Virginia Holman, a native Virginian who has written a stark memoir about her childhood years with a schizophrenic mother in Rescuing Patty Hearst [Memoirs of a Decade Gone Mad] (Simon & Schuster, $23). Hers is a story familiar to many families with members suffering from intractable mental or physical ailments. In the case of Ms. Holman's mother Molly, the "compassionate" system set up in the 1960s to protect the rights of the mentally ill backfired. Although Molly made her family's life a living hell, caseworkers and other helpists insisted there was nothing they could do as long as she was not a danger to others or to herself. She succeeded in persuading them she was not - but, back with her family, she refused to take her prescribed medicines.   Ms. Holman was 8 when Molly first showed signs of the illness that eventually would institutionalize her. Convinced that she was a member of a secret army, Molly moved Virginia and her sister Emma from their Virginia Beach home to a Kechotan cottage. She turned the cottage into a small fortress. Her delusions and "voices" ruled her life and her family's lives; Virginia's father Nathan struggled to cope while working at a bank to provide for the family. Molly once thought the cottage was a field hospital and then planned to help the "war children." She led Virginia on a secret assignment far into the woods and left her. She took a butcher knife to Nathan and hit Virginia. Virginia picks at her memories to find a happy one, as if trying to coax a shred of meat from a crab claw, but mostly, she concludes, "Those years . . . were some of the blackest and most awful I can imagine a family enduring."  VIRGINIA'S MEMOIR, free of cloying self-pity, often is painful to read. Molly's family was caught in her web, unable to help her and unable to flee. Nathan tried; he always returned. Even after Virginia grew up and left home, her childhood experiences haunted her. She found some solace when she returned, with her husband and child, to the Kechotan cottage and then to Molly, by then permanently institutionalized, to seek understanding and perhaps the ability to forgive.  This is a powerful account of a family possessed, living in fear and dread - yet another testament to the failure of the mental-health system to rescue the afflicted. Molly had her rights, of course - so perhaps the system's defenders would consider her family's suffering merely "collateral damage." A better description comes from Virginia Holman, and it isn't pretty.  
 Finally a Christmas CD that every age group loves.  It was fun and played a lot at my house and in my car 
 In the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll a young girl with the name of Alice travels to a distant land that seems altogether and quite possibly unreal to her.  The book starts off with Alice in the park with her sister.  She has nothing to do as her sister is reading so when Alice sees a talking white rabbit scampering by, she doesn't hesitate to follow it.  Following the rabbit leads her to a world she could have never dreamed of.  This book can take you to magical places you would have never dreamed of.  Through the use of Carroll's thorough descriptions and dramatic elements this book is sure to take you on one wild ride.  I thought that the book was very well written and very interesting.  I could really imagine what the characters look like and feel how Alice would have felt.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a good adventure and lots of twists along the way.  This book is for children and adults alike.  As long as you have an imagination and a great sense of adventure you are sure to love this great tale of a girl and how she found herself in an imaginary world.     
 This book would be worth every penny if purchased solely for David Womersley's introduction.  The introduction is written so beautifully that it effortlessly carries the reader through every facet of the life of Edward Gibbon.  I intended but to scan only a few pages of the introduction.  Candidly, I expected it to be at best irrelevant and at worst tiresome. I was struck at once by how thoroughly Gibbon's life was recounted.  My imagination was launched into flights of fancy at the sharp contrasts between Gibbon's classic European education and my decidedly less useful American public indoctrination.  Gibbon spent time with major philosophers and these interactions helped to shape an intellect that was uniquely able to see 'truth', especially through religious dogma.  The introduction provides the reader with invaluable insight and, dare I say, a device that may grant the reader a greater understanding and likely a greater appreciation of this classic work.  Womersley has wisely chosen to abridge only the number of chapters while not `blending' chapters.  Womersley explains that the beauty of Gibbon's writing is best viewed in the arc of a complete chapter and therefore 'blending chapters' would be a horrible injustice.  I liken Gibbon's writing to that of a non-fictional Shakespeare.  Shakespeare helped us see truth in fictional stories as Gibbon does so in a non-fictional format.  This is THE book to buy about the Roman Empire.  Bravo - Sir Womersley 
 I was very pleased with this CD.  The songs are lovely that bring forth the season.  It reminds me of listening to my mother's old records at Christmas time long ago.  A retro feel with that soothing, relaxing vibe 
 This book was awsome.  I read the others in the series, so I devoured this one in just one day.  I love these books, and I think this was my favorite.  
 When I picked up this book years ago at a clearance center, I had no idea what a big deal it was. Now reading so many arguments about it, I have to lend my two cents. If I was a book critic or professional writer, I may offer similar words of contempt... but this book entered my life at the exactly right moment; I was young, self-absorbed, and still struggling to define the differences between passion and love and sex. This book doesn't lend any answers or insight- it just reflects those crazy feelings in a way that I found thoroughly, sensually entertaining. I did not care how well it represented asian culture, but having some asian heritage, I did find it refreshing to hear a strong young female asian voice. 
 This book is abound with breathtaking insights, i had a look at it and liked the title as i was beginning a study on prosperity, because in my life there was a lot of financial uncertainties and believed a lot of rubbish about succeding, from this book i learned to affirm myself and the world around me, as i realised that prosperity is not about who raised you, what your career and level is, but upon the level of faith and spiritual savvy which is easily obtainable if one only asked for it.  There are a lot of other sub-topics cavered in the book with a view for readers to gain transformation which is a requisite to achieving it, some of the exercises are kinder troublesome, like forgiveness, which is almost impossible for a majority of us people, but as we learn in the book, lack of forgivenss is one of the final blocks that can curb transformation.  I also gained a little bit of understanding of some of the concepts introduced in the Matrix movies in this book 
 This isn't your ordinary "wife-of-celebrity memoir." Deborah King Santana is the daughter of an Irish-English professional woman and an African-American jazz musician, brought up in a sheltered, secure life, with pride in herself and her heritage. Her adult life will be neither sheltered nor secure-and never ordinary.   Deborah meets Sly Stone as a teenager. She is totally unprepared for his world, but is so charmed and seduced by him, that she enters it, complete with music, drugs, abuse, and shame. When she finally finds the strength to leave him, she soon meets Carlos Santana, already a Grammy-winning rock superstar, and though she tells herself to wait, immediately begins a relationship with him.   Over three decades as Santana's wife, she'll experience the world of a touring musician, a meditative life with an oppressive guru, unfaithfulness by Santana, three children, near financial ruin, and the exhilaration of starting a successful business. Most important, she discovers the emergence of a sense of herself, and what it means to be true to that self.   Santana unfolds her story without judgment of the person who made the decisions she did. Santana the writer allows Deborah's understanding of each part of her life to emerge slowly and naturally. As much as is possible when looking back over time, we get a sense of what she felt and experienced as it happened, and then what she did with it.   Her writing is sensual - the feel of skin, the sense of light, music's blood-level rhythm describe her life intimately. It is also sensible - she looks back on her life not as isolated incidents adding up to something, but as stages of becoming. She describes herself with honesty, and fills the page with adjectives and adverbs, leaving nothing to chance in how we will understand her world. It's not a celebrity memoir at all, but a deep look at what this woman, who happens to be married to a famous man, is made of.   This is an excellent read if you want to learn what is like to be part of a famous musician's life-with all its perks and pitfalls.  
 The book is most interesting. Knipfel knows how to tell a story; he tells in a sarcastic way the story of his life. Very important book for rehabilitation teachers for the blind and social workers. 
 Firestarter will make you very angry. Firestarter will make you very sad. It's a clinic in shameful government abuses and a lesson in parental devotion. It's a glimpse at the hidden powers of the mind, and a treatise on the atrocities committed by men who hunger for power. Stephen King should not be able to jam so much inside a story and still make it keep a reader up until dawn. But Stephen King is Stephen King and that's what he does. In Firestarter, as with The Dead Zone, he empowers his characters with powerful abilities and then exploits those abilities from every angle. A little girl who can ignite infernos through simple thought should not be restrained in a fictional work. King does not restrain her. Young Charlie runs amok and as a reader, you'll be very glad she did. For every house that burns, every car that blows up and every evil G-man that runs shrieking in flames, our little protagonists has amble motivation. Her father can manipulate another person's thoughts just by thinking real hard. A man such as this should not be hidden in a back room to do mere parlor tricks. King does not whittle away Daddy's powers. Daddy uses them much as you would if someone locked you up and tried to steal your daughter. Firestarter is an outright grabber from start to finish. King has created some vividly evil entities through the years, but few so detestable as the men and women who make up The Shop. It is a sublevel government agency aimed at mowing down children and families in the ultimate race for world supremacy. Though he doesn't flout his research skills, King no doubt studied up on the CIA's experiments with mind control and chemical manipulations as he prepared to write this thriller. It's another fantastic tale that may be closer to fact than we want to believe 
      Another thriller from Vince Flynn. Like Mitch Rapp, this guy just doesn't miss!! He's that good--real, real good!!  No, he's great!!       Mitch Rapp specializes in counterterrorism--as he told his friend Congressman O'Rourke, he "hunts down terrorists and kills them..."       And nobody does it better than Mitch Rapp (unless it's John Corey, Nelson DeMille's sometimes protagonist)       One suggestion:  As enjoyable as Vince Flynn's reads are--and they are enjoyable, each in its own right and on its own merit--they are probabaly even more enjoyable when read in sequence: "Term Limits," "Transfer of Power," this book, "The Third Option," "Separataion of Power,' etc.       But if this book, "The Third Option," is your first Vince FLynn read, go to it and be prepared to be thrilled, enchanted and carried away by its action and characters...       Two notes to veteran Flynn readers: (1) Neat, wasn't it, the reference to Nelson DeMille, another great writer of this genere, and (2) Flynn got one fact wrong: Congressman Kaiser, the Speaker of the House, played football at Auburn, not Alabama!! 
 This game is far more complex than I could have ever expected and you can beat it and still leave half of it unplayed! I fell in love with kingdom hearts and decided I couldn't be happy until I'd seen all there was to see. With the guide, you'll have the advantage in tournaments, mini games, item hunts, and leveling up not to mention the random secret events and movies hidden in the game. A must-have for any kingdom hearts fan 
 At the urging of her husband Walter (Peter Masterson), aspiring photographer and obviously less-than-full-figured Joanna Eberhart (Katherine Ross) becomes an unwilling resident of Stepford -- a town of apparent marital bliss. Uxorial devotion strikes the former woman's libber with suspicion. Befriending a wild and unconventional new resident named Bobbie Markowe (Paula Printiss), they attempt to uncover what appears to be a misogynic plot to subjugate beautiful wives. After a weekend nuptial renewing retreat, Bobbie returns as another ultra-domesticated Stepford housewife. This sends Joanna on a high-adrenaline quest for immediate answers that ultimately brings her face to face with a revelation of epic proportions.   Scenes include brief violence, emphasis on female anatomy, and discussions of marital coitus.  Movie quote: "If I'm wrong I'm insane. And if I'm right, it's worse than if I'm wrong. 
 Finally, a book on the therapeutic uses of gemstones that even skeptics can take seriously!  I've been a fan of Michael Katz's books for years, and this is his very best.  In my long search for meaningful information on gemstones, I've read a fair number of books, most of which have been disappointing.  Katz's books never disappoint, and this one is no exception.   Katz provides the first coherent explanation of how and why gemstones can be used as serious tools of energy medicine.  He also gives a convincing argument for using gems shaped into spheres.  The detailed instructions on how to perform specific therapies go far beyond the usual "put a stone on your brow chakra" vagueness I've found elsewhere.  Very impressive.  I've read almost the entire book and found it well-written, user-friendly, and beautifully illustrated (the photographs alone are worth the price).  All in all, it's a fascinating, lively read for both the at-home user and the healthcare pro -- a true breakthrough book.  I recommend it to anyone who has any interest whatsoever in energy medicine and in gems in particular.  
 I really enjoyed this book, and despite it not being as descriptive as other Mountaineering books. If you take this as a story of two men who have little climbing experience achieve a goal of climbing the highest Mountains in each Continent, 7 summits in total. I found it an amazing book of self determination, motivation and true friendship. Yes it is true, they couldn't have otherwise succeeded at this unless they had the money to do so, but the book never denies the reader that insight. This booked had me routing for them from their first Everest adventure, I just wanted them to achieve their goals. For those who are wanting a descriptive mountain climbing book this isn't for you, but those who want to read about a great challenging adventure over coming multiple diffculties this is an excellant read. 
 I was very intruiged by Balkan Europe and wanted to learn more. This book, while a travelogue, was also a great historical primer. I've had several friends who've also been very impressed with it.  
 This book provides a nice discussion of the philosophical and historical underpinnings of economic anthropology.  It shows how three perspectives have predominated in economic anthropology: whether people are selfish, moral or self-interested.  The book traces the trajectories of each of these stances back in time, making interesting connections.  The result is a work that makes one think hard about assumptions and limitations.  Less attention is given to detailed discussion of formal economic models.  The writing style is accessible, the voice active and the touches of humor (e.g. the drawing that depicts "academic strife") refreshing.  This book might deserve a spot next to a favored ethnography or economics textbook on your shelf 
 I studied classical piano and composition myself for most of my life and have professional degrees in both. When I write my music, I need to look up stuff now and then, or brush up my knowledge. This book is perfect for this! I wish I had bought it years ago 
 Dr. Seuss has become such a fixture in our world that its hard to fully appreciate the impact he had on children's literature and our culture.  This book explores both the origins of his whimsical books and the impact he had on the publishing industry.  As portrayed here, Dr. Seuss is possessed of a slightly skewed view of life, but is devoted to promoting the causes he believed in, including children's literacy.  As a man who truly believed that reading should be fun, he wrote books that he felt were fun to read, and knew that others would enjoy them too.  Its a shame that his fear of public speaking kept the world from knowing him better during his lifetime, but he lives on in his impressive body of wacky and delightful books and art.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to get a glimpse of the man behind the cat 
 Although I can't comment on the return of several main characters, I did enjoy this book a lot.  I was not familiar with Maura and Jane, as I've only read a handful of Tess Gerristen's novels.  But, I thought both characters were rich and quite life-like.  Dr. Maura Isles did not have a huge part in the novel, but she was still a powerful character.  I thoroughly enjoyed Jane Rizzoli.  Her dedication as both mother and cop was great.  The plot of Vanish was also quite good.  A little bit of murder, kidnapping, deceit, government cover-up, and the terrible world of young women sold for sex all mixed into one very entertaining novel.  It was hard for me to put this book down every night or at the end of my lunch break.  I wanted to get to the end, but at the same time did not.  I highly recommend this book, as well as any work by the author.  Her writing is very readable, and her characters rich and believable 
 I just got my TFF CD today. So cool! These guys were one of the the coolest during the 80s decade. Their sound was sultry, hot and smooth like silk. Good thing cds are made to last for a long time, because if they weren't, I would definitely eventually wear this one out. This one is a treasure 
 This book (along with its tie-winner Declare by Tim Powers) actually beat out Perdido Street Station for World Fantasy Award of 2001.    In the year 2028, the citizens of Galveston are struggling to survive in the wake of a magical disaster that happened in the form of a flood in 2004 on Mardi Gras.  The Flood has destroyed the outside world (except for part of mainland Texas) and mostly obliterated technology (except for dwindling medical supplies and car engines that people keep nursing along as small generators for their homes).  The city is run by four Krewes, which used to be some sort of Mardi Gras parade-social clubs and which have evolved into quasi-priesthoods for magically awakened gods.    Even weirder, the Flood has opened up an "alternate" Galveston ruled over by an evil carnival god Momus where the Mardi Gras never stops.  Momus's motto, carved over the gates of his Galveston, is "It just doesn't get any better than this!"   Our hero Josh was a little kid when he witnessed his card-sharp father lose the family house in a high-stakes poker game.  He grows into a bitter fatherless young man who tries to practice medicine with nothing but herbs and some knowledge.  Then his childhood crush Sloane who doesn't remember him must face the impending death of her mother, the most powerful woman in Galveston.  Sloane must either save her mother or fill her mother's footsteps and become a leader.    She decides to seek out Momus in his Galveston and bargain for his help.  When she disappears into Mardi Gras, Josh and his only friend Ham are accused of her murder and sent into exile where they face horrific dangers on the Texas mainland.    Josh and Sloane have the viewpoints, and the plot takes some unexpected and complex turns.  Sloane is terrific, and Josh depicted in an even bolder way:  he's unlikable and petty while displaying only flashes of goodness.  They are very three-dimensional, complex characters 
 We read THE POWER AND THE GLORY by Graham Greene aloud, and it is the ninth book by Greene I have read.   It's not surprising that Greene (1904-1991) would have an existential slant to his work, not just as a 20th-century writer, but also as a man who suffered depression and who also attempted suicide as a young man. Throughout his life, he traveled and lived in regions of conflict related to government and military oppression. Greene's existentialism is specifically Catholic (he converted after becoming involved with the woman who would become his wife, who was herself a devout Catholic). Greene's Catholicism is an examined one, and his 1938 travels in Mexico and his horror at the persecution of the religious there informed two of his books, THE POWER AND THE GLORY and "The Lawless Roads."   In THE POWER AND THE GLORY, the reader follows a nameless priest who is trying to stay in a state of Mexico that has exiled and/or killed all the priests after a communist take-over of the local government. The government also forces one priest, Padre Jos, to marry. The remaining priest is always just ahead of the military officers who want to kill him, and his circumstances become more and more miserable. Though he tries to leave on occasion, he is pulled back by his sense of duty as a priest to those who maintain their religious lives after the political upheaval in their state.  In the narrative of journey, this is a quintessential existential novel. The priest is driven by circumstances beyond his control into instability, incredible misery, and doubt, and is never able to rest. Force, power and oppression are issues with Greene, and in this book Greene is focusing on the theme of how idealism and reality conflict. The priest we follow offers a meaningful vision of a religious vocation in a real person, flawed, broken, imperfect, yet endowed with -- or receiving of -- the gifts his vows bring him. Even though he has broken his vows, he has a belief that God has not broken his, that the priest still, through his faith, has blessings to offer the people. The reality of this love and belief vs. the idealized portraits of saints and martyrs that appear throughout the narrative is much more moving and compelling.   The power of resistance the book presents, the quiet, daily life of rebellion through religious or personal beliefs is compelling. And like other Greene novels, the later beneficial, and loving, effects of the efforts that the characters think are meaningless resonates deeply for the reader long after the book has been read.  THE POWER AND THE GLORY was a big success, both commercially and critically, but it was met with anger and disapproval by the Catholic Church, which is understandable given the portrayal of the priest that Greene provides. But it is a truly powerful view of the outcomes of love and faith, with a beautiful and moving "Greenian" ending. I recommend it 
 I have found this guide extremely helpful in identifying species found near our summer home in Michigan. It has excellent photographs, arranged by color, and a chart showing habitats, seasons, and growing conditions. There is a blank chart for entering your own finds. It is informative and user friendly. I would recommend it highly to both novice and experienced wildflower lovers 
 There is something about this book that I like. I finshed it in 3 days. This girl Delia is trying to get through school but she can't read and there are the Tolliver twins that everyone thinks are bullies. Delia is so good at Double Dutch and enters a competition with her friends and she's trying to keep her relationship going with Randy 
 You must know by now that I never write a bad review about this guy. In this book, we take a whirlwind tour of Europe. You can read the cover blurbs about how funny and perceptive he is, and how skillful he is with the language, and how eminently readable he is. I agree with every word. But I'd like to mention that this isn't some snooty tour guide or gushing forth bubblehead. He's an average guy who won't hesitate to tell you what sucks, or leave a place that he doesn't like, or bend over backwards to say nice things. He'll bash anybody, himself included. He's refreshingly honest.   Plus, if you had it in your head that Europe was just one homogenous place, or if perhaps you've heard a whole bunch of national or cities names and characteristics and can't keep them all straight, this book will fix that right up. In addition, if you're overseas but in a country nowhere near Europe, perhaps some place in Asia, you can still enjoy some very familiar situations. In case you haven't guessed, I highly recommend this book. 
 A better book could not have fallen into my hands!  An American professor in Venice recommended it, and after I read it I was only sorry I had not read it before going to Italy.  The mystery of its medieval, rather Renaissance cities (Florence, Venice, among others) would have been clearer; even today's Italians' ways and personality.  So much a product of Renaissance Italy...and its wonderful heritage from Ancient Rome.  I truly recommend this book for Italy lovers, anyone going there soon, or for the sheer joy of reading a good history book.  Jacob Burckkhardt is one of the most intelligent, enlightened historians I know 
 I've been reading every book I can find about donor insemination and this is the best I've found.  Whether using fresh, frozen, known, anonymous, at home or assisted by medical practitioners, medicated or not, this book has useful information for decision making, social/emtional issues and nitty gritty physical information.  It is an excellent resource for any woman considering alternative methods of conception, regardless of sexual orientation.  I highly recommend it 
 The earrings are gorgeous, kind of a hematite color--but they look darker, nearly black, against fair skin.  Beautiful!  And this COMPANY!  The earrings went on sale after I ordered (and paid for) them and they automatically credited my card/account for the difference.  Wow!  I am *very* happy with this purchase and will definitely buy from Securehoop again 
 Concise, correct, and terrific reading. I have not been able to find any  other books on clay for the past several years. The author explains all the  reasons for its use and its history.  I just started on my first bottle of  clay and I am looking forward to the results 
 In Vol. 2 we get more of the same from Yoko Kanno which is a good thing. 17 tracks from Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex, 2nd Gig.  Among those tracks are extended versions of Get 9 and Rise, which really gets the heart pumping and the spirit moving.  Any fan of Yoko Kanno or any fan of Ghost In The Shell or any fan of anime in general needs to grab this CD, new or used 
 I first read this book (not completely) just out of high school, for the purpose of a little education prior to declaration of a Political Science major. It was easy to read and concepts were easily understood. This book gives enough information to answer basic questions of Political Science as well as creating deeper more involved questions to be answered elsewhere. This is a great background book. Personally, I love the ancient philosphers and this book does a good job of using their best works 
 I will speak up for this.. I have a green color one of these and have used it for years.. convenient little opening gadget I keep handy! 
 Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is a comedian with an obsession with death who has a chance encounter with the adorably ditzy Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), an aspiring singer.  Through a series of flashbacks, non-verbal conversations between the two characters (including a great scene where Alvy and Annie are talking to each other, with subtitles under them, projecting the subtext in their exchange) and quirky scenes, we have an interesting view into the lives of these two very quirky characters.    This film has been deemed one of the best Woody Allen films, as well as one of the funnies comedies in film.   The dialogue is funny and engaging, the characters are delightfully neurotic and I guarantee you will enjoy it.  There was a reason it was the recipient of numerous Academy Awards in 1977..... 
 It was a fantastic movie when it was first released and it is still just as good. Great photography, good narrative. Makes me long for the summer days I used to spend on the beach at Santa Cruz 
 I could not put this book down!  I was so amazed with this shocking story that I bought several copies for gifts.  Reading this book was like watching a scary movie.  
 I am a faithful reader of Michael Crichton's work. Recently I have been catching up with his previous books. This book was written about 20 years ago and I am surprised to find out that the information presented by the book still sends me shocks.   One of the things that I enjoy Michael Crichton's book is the amoutn of research and interesting points of views that he brings forth. His ideas and information regarding to technologies are alwasy so fresh and new that it draws immediate attention.   I think this book was one of his best work. Not only the technological information was interesting, but also the ideas asscoiated with it are intriguing as well.   The first 1/3 of the book was quite slow, however things start to pick up after that and you just never want to put down the book. The story ended somewhat abruptly, makes you feel like lingering for more. But I have finally realized, after reading tons of Michael Crichton's books, that it is one of his styles to leave things sort of sudden and unfinished.   I strongly recommend this book. Don't brush it off just because it is old, trust me, it is still as good as his new books.    
 Good book. I borrowed it from the library then decided to buy it. Worthwhile tutorials to learn very cool stuff. I would recommend for beginner - intermediate 
 This book was pretext for Karl MARX idea of communism. Rousseau blamed inequality among people due to ownership of property 
 If.... (Lindsay Anderson 1969)  Even if If... were famous for no other reason than being the big-screen debut of some chap named Malcolm McDowell, that would be reason enough. McDowell, of course, rocketed to fame two years later in A Clockwork Orange, and has been a relatively constant screen presence since. Here, he plays Mick Travis, the ringleader (to use the term loosely) of a trio of sixth-form slackers at a British public school (for Americans who haven't been exposed to this sort of drama, public school over there = private school over here. Don't ask me why.) The other two are scarcely less recognizable-- David Wood, who plays Johnny, is a longtime TV character actor who was knighted in 2000 for his services to drama, whilst the late Richard Warwick (Wallace)  worked with some of the world's finest directors on some of their finest works (Zefferelli's Hamlet and Jane Eyre and Eastwood's White Hunter, Black Heart were among his final performances). The three are pitted against the school's prefects, headed up by the loathsome Rowntree (Shackleton's Robert Swann). Anderson contrasts the antics of Mick's batch, and their treatment by the prefects, with the treatment of the younger children (one gets the feeling a good deal of footage of the kiddies ended up on the cutting-room floor; Jute, especially, seems as if he's poised to become a major character more than once, but never does more than sit on the sidelines). The difference is that the sixth-formers have the knowledge and power to do something about the situation, and they do.  Much of the film's strength, as has been mentioned any number of times, lies in Anderson's documentary feel combined with the odd dadaesque images that crop up now and again and the film's seemingly arbitrary switching between color and black and white stock. (This, I have learned, was a budgetary, not an artistic, decision.) In hindsight, it's also gained a great deal of validity because Anderson's vision has, quite simply, come true many times in the time since the film's release (the DVD box still trumpets the conclusion as "shocking"; anyone over the age of ten living in America will probably call it inevitable, instead). But what really gives it the longevity it has, in my opinion, is the simple quotability of the script. Practically every word from Mick Travis' mouth is the kind of thing wannabe revolutionaries will go ape over. "One man can change the world with a bullet in the right place."? If that's not a call to arms, I don't know what is. If you want the original quotable high school misfit movie, forget Napoleon Dynamite and discover If.... **** 
 The coming together of Yosaif August and Bernie Siegel is truly a match made in heaven. If you or a loved one is ill, chances are you will be needing strong, wise and compassionate allies.  And you'll find them through the voices of these two wonderful, often hilariously funny, always compassionate and most importantly eminently practical men. If you want to learn how to be militantly on your own side -- when doing so could save your life - read this book 
 I have been looking for the "perfect" behavior book for horses and this is it! Thorough, easy to understand, and humane, this book discusses techniques, join-up, ground manners, loading, and a host of other behaviors. The descriptions are clear and the instructions are easily laid out. If you want only one reference book for behavior, make it this one 
 The Alberts text is the definitive resource for anyone interested in the subject.  It is also useful for people who's parents coerced them into majoring in biochemistry.  The details are plentiful and well-explained.  The diagrams are clear and generally easy to understand.  In the end, the mark of a truly exceptional textbook is how dumb you feel upon having read it.  Based on this, Bruce Alberts has co-authored arguably the finest molecular cell biology ever produced in that it made me realize exactly how dim I really am. [.... 
 As a worker in the field of 'mental health', I found this book to be invaluable in demystifying mental illness and assisting clients in learning about themselves using everyday language they can understand, not the psycho mobo jumbo utilized by psychiatry (to keep people oppressed and thinking they cannot cure themselves)This book, almost 30 years old, is probably more relevant today, particularly as the legions of 'rescuers' become more prevalent in society, i.e. therapists, counselors, probation officers, and all those in favor of the medicalization of behaviors. The books basic premise, that people can solve their own problems and get better on their own by redeciding, is both true and a threat to those who purport otherwise. For further in depth education in demystification, I recommend reading Thomas Szasz 
 I you are a Jimmy Buffet fan this is all wrapped up in one with fun extras 
 I'm not a Janis Joplin completist or specialist but this album is brilliant and highly enjoyable and I don't mind if 80s instruments are added to some tracks. My favourite tracks are the rousing Magic Of Love, the heart-rending One Night Stand (archetypical Janis at her best), the melancholy Farewell Song, the cheeky Amazing Grace/Hi Heel Sneakers and the riveting Catch Me Daddy. I have no hesitation in placing this album on a par with Pearl, Kozmic Blues or Cheap Thrills. Great songs performed with passion 
 Creative Visualization Packed with nuggets of wisdom and "aha's," this book will help anyone!  No one really changes from superficial change or through mere "positive thinking."  Change requires exploring, discovering, and changing our deepest, most basic attitudes toward life.  Creative Visualization is a tool to help in your pursuit of deep and meaningful growth.    If you feel that most people in our culture have become cut off from their awareness of who they really are. that they have temporarily lost their conscious connection with their higher selves. that they have lost their own sense of power and responsibility for their lives. that they have a sense of helplessness. that they feel basically powerless to make real change in their lives or in the world. Next to Srikumar Rao's Are You Ready to Succeed, this book has been perhaps the most powerful spiritual tool along my journey.  As a life coach, I've had clients tape quotes from this book to their office desk and read them throughout the day, every day for years!   
 Have had low back pain most of my 55 years and this DVD has helped to manage everyday pain more than any drug! 
 In my opinion, A.S Byatt is a master of language; as well as of the observations of both human nature and society. I was first introduced to her work with Possession, and have since then read everything I can.  Overall, Babel Tower is an amazing work of literature. As always, the prose flows together in perfect cadence; along with observations of a new revolution of traditional values versus new ideas of free thought, the change of language, and how one must suffer so greatly to be accepted by society and it's stiffling expectations. Frederica; I continued to adore and be plagued by at the same time. However, one of my small problems with this book is that the character development did not seem to be as strong as Virgin in the Garden or Still Life. I also really missed and wanted to see more of Marcus, Jacqueline, Ruth, Daniel, and the old crowd of the previous two novels--I wanted to know more about how Daniel's children coped with their mother's death and simply more about one of my favorite literary families instead of the whole novel being almost all Frederica. My only other small complaints are that sometimes the excerpts from Babbletower detracted from the book as well as some of Frederica's lamentations or reviews. My advice is to skim these parts--they don't really do much for the overall plot so you can get by with just a basic idea. Finally, there are parts in the novel that seem as if the prose and all the literary references are forced if not slightly pretentious, while the other two novels had a very natural flow while the intellectual ideas were not pretentious or showoffish. It seems as if Byatt was slightly stuck at these "humps", but she gets over it quickly enough.  But despite a few mild flaws, this is a very good novel. Perhaps not as polished as the others, but a gorgeously told story with brilliant social commentary and satire to top it off.  A great novel to read with any group of friends or a book club as there is so much to discuss with so many different takes. It does take awhile to get through, as is the case with all of Byatt's novels, but you will feel content with the overall book  in the end-- even with the pretentious bits and an often tearjerking storyline. 
 I will be writing a review on the legendary self-titled red album entitled "GRAND FUNK" by one of Rock's greatest band's and one of America's favorite sons. I give you one of Flint, Michigan's pride and joy's, GRAND FUNK RAILROAD. "GRAND FUNK" was originally released in 1970 on Vinyl/LP and 8-Track on the infamous Capitol Records label. As always, if I hear any new additional information concerning this legendary album or the artist, I will edit this review immediately so that you the consumer will get the best informative and most accurate review possible.  GRAND FUNK RAILROAD continues to amaze me as well as millions of others to this very day. As we are all aware, GRAND FUNK RAILROAD has had its shares of bad tribulations and hardships throughout their incredible career. Despite making changes in personnel through the years, it will always be the true original mega star line-up comprising of guitarist Mark Farner, drummer Don Brewer and bassist Mel Schacher that GRAND FUNK RAILROAD broke new grounds in Rock n' Roll and dared to pushed the limits of their musical creativity to another level, then more, then further and beyond. When GRAND FUNK RAILROAD evolved from the recording studio and handed in to Capitol Records this album, they felt confident that their self-titled red album was really going to blow people's minds as well as surprise the whole music industry. In my opinion, "GRAND FUNK," the red album is an action pacted non-stop hard Rock album that truly kicks a*s. "GRAND FUNK" is also a true testament of the three masterminds that created the ultimate sound and a fine tribute to one of the all-time greatest three-man bands in Rock n' Roll history that was truly ahead of its time.  Now its the music's turn to do all the talking. If you want to Rock, listen to the Rockers such as the fast paced a*s kicking "Got This Thing On The Move," the blistering Rocker "Please Don't Worry," the amazing breathtaking Rocker "High Falootin' Woman," the groundbreaking slow Rocker "Mr. Limousine Driver," the merciless fast paced Rocker "In Deed," the much slower but still Rockin' "Winter And My Soul," the scary and devastating a*s kickin' Rocker "Paranoid" and the mad wild energetic "Inside Looking Out." On this album, Farner pushes the limits of his guitar playing and just keeps getting better. Brewer keeps his  timing perfect while thrashing away on his drums with such skill and power that he gives the music a life of its own with a beat and energy that never lets up. Schacher is just the perfect icing on the cake to complete the ultimate sound that only these three can make together.   Overall, "GRAND FUNK" is definitely worth seeking and checking out especially for those who are curious what the fuss was all about with GRAND FUNK RAILROAD.  I would like to highly recommend purchasing this legendary groundbreaking album to own as a valuable and important part of his or her own personal music collection. This album has already proven to stand the test of time and will always be around to be enjoyed, appreciated and cherished for many years to come, NOW AND FOREVER.  In closing, GRAND FUNK RAILROAD will forever be remembered for contributing a new sound for Rock n' Roll and for daring to push the limits and boundaries further and beyond as far as setting new ground of how much a three-man band is really capable of recording and performing. But most importantly, GRAND FUNK RAILROAD played proudly together with a lot of heart and emotion which in turn gave the music a unique sound filled with raw energy and soul that never lets up. Then again, GRAND FUNK RAILROAD is the people's band that represented the hard times in America through their music at the right time when it was needed. With this in mind, GRAND FUNK RAILROAD left their mark in Rock n' Roll history on their terms and wouldn't have it any other way. So here's to you Mark, Don and Mel. Keep Persevering. Keep The Faith. And as the saying goes, "AND THE REST IS ROCK N' ROLL HISTORY," am I wrong? Thanks for reading my review and I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it for your reading pleasure. I also hope that you will read all of my other reviews in the near future when time permits. GRAND FUNK LIVES. Long Live Rock n' Roll. Rock out always and take it easy. Forever In Rock, John L.                    
 This book is long overdue.  Alan Tillotson has done an incredible job researching and compiling relevant information about the uses of herbals from many different cultures.  The book is direct and concise and gives a clear understanding of the appropriate applications of natural medicines in modern times.  This book is a must-have for anyone involved in healthcare, or anyone who seeks a deeper understanding of the "magic and medicine" of plants.  Definitely one of the most practical and valuable alternative healthcare texts to date 
 When this book was chosen by our book club for this month's theme of "tragedy," I approached reading it with some trepidation. There are a number of things that I don't care for in literature, and one of them is the family drama which centers on the drama as drama for its own sake, rather than to say something more about the world. Part of my bias against this kind of writing comes from having cut my eyeteeth on science fiction, the literature of ideas which, at its best, is about today as much as it is about a future. I also spent three years in a creative writing program where, god bless them, my fellow students seemed to spend a lot of time writing autobiographical stories that didn't have much to say beyond it sucks to grow up in fill-in-the-blank. The book had won a Pulitzer, and if there's anything I learned in my MFA classes on literature, an award was often a signal that a book was not for the reader but written for the critics. A Thousand Acres screamed to me from its cover that it was that kind of book, that focused on the dissolution of the family as seen through a retelling of the King Lear story. I shuddered.  But, really, I shouldn't have. Having previously read two books by Jane Smiley (the quite amusing MOO and the intelligent and thoughtful Thirteen Ways of Looking at the Novel), I should have given her the benefit of the doubt. Within the first fifty pages, I was surprised that Smiley had drawn me into her story, and while it was still fairly mundane (the family dog wasn't going to start talking on page 100, to my dismay), I found the voice of the narrator intriguing and wondered just how much of King Lear Smiley was going to be able to transpose to 1970s Iowa. Turns out, quite a bit, in a wondrously deft way that I would have termed a 'tour de force' if I used that phrase anymore.  The narrator is the eldest of the three daughters, and instead of a king dividing up his kingdom, the family farm is to be divided among the daughters somewhat early by forming a corporation in which he gives control of the farm to the children, in a sudden move that delights the older daughters and their husbands and alarms the youngest, who no longer lives on the farm nor has much to do with it. Her concern about the alacrity of his decision infuriates the father, so much that he cuts her out of the paperwork process and thus the land itself. Pretty much every plot point in the Shakespearean play is touched upon in some manner, but never so roughly that the connections feel strained. If anything, Smiley's version is much, much more subtle in its understanding of the character's motivations, giving both a sympathetic portrait of the older two sisters that is entirely missing in the play, as well as making the Lear figure less of a madman and more of a stubborn one, such that when his stubbornness leads him into the rain, his madness becomes if not sensible, at least reasonable. You don't necessarily take any one character's side in this fight, but none seems such a villain.  What Smiley does that, I think, one-ups Shakespeare even more than making the female characters sympathetic is that she truly makes the tragedy about the land as about the people. In the background, and infusing everything the character's do to a point, is the thousand acres of the title. Perhaps it is because it is hard for us to imagine a kingdom as something one can own and pass to your children, for it's very easy to grasp the concept of these thousand acres, how much they mean to the family, and how tragic it is that this family cannot hold on to that land. In the past, I've been less than sympathetic to the concept of the family farm, but even my cold heart can't read what Smiley has described here and see it as anything but a tragedy.  What this novel has over the modern literature that I feared it would be is not only a plot (people die here, not to mention being maimed and insulted and cruelly treated) but a larger meaning, and that big picture of this being more than just a personal tragedy, is what makes this worthwhile reading. Out of the group who read this for book club, I turned out to rate this book the highest, and that is to say, I recommend it strongly

 In clear and concise prose, David Schmidtz offers an insightful analysis of public goods.  Schmidtz rightly distinguishes public goods problems from prisoner's dilemmas, and explains both why and when people tend to contribute to the production of public goods.  Unlike other works on this subject, Schmidtz integrates philosophical analysis with carefully crafted empirical tests, thus providing evidence for his general thesis that while some public goods problems are best solved by private contracts, others may require coercive state intervention.  
 Jennifer Green English Student Wayne State University  A Review for Howells? A Hazard of New Fortunes  	William Dean Howells? novel, A Hazard of New Fortune, is an excellent example of realism in prose. Howells? text is so descriptive, that you can see the characters as though they were standing in front of you. He accurately describes nineteenth century New York, down to the exact streets that a middle class person should never cross. It is in part, his description, which makes the book such a quick read. Yet, to those readers who lose themselves within description, this novel may be hard to follow. Howells? spends more than ten pages describing a house hunt; he describes each house and the person who is attempting to sell it in great detail, which at times can cause the reader to wonder if they missed the point in the last few pages. Depending upon how the reader is able to deal with the descriptive prose, determines the readers response to this particular novel.  	His characters are very human, flawed and selfish like any person one may meet while walking on the street. It is this quality that makes their decisions easy to follow and their thoughts easy to understand. His characters are the most important part of the novel, as opposed to the plot, and the reader must watch what each does very closely. His categories and descriptions of characters are very in depth and must have close attention paid, or the reader will miss crucial points. His characters roles, and the impact each has on the other was what made the book so engaging. The Marches are the first characters the reader is introduced to, and they are the main focus of this book. They are a middle class family currently living in Boston, and are faced with the notion of starting a new business in New York. Howells? accurately describes their inner most thoughts, and has the reader very informed in what they are feeling.  	Howells? uses dialect so strongly within his novel that the reader is able to tell which character is speaking without their names. Each character is given a distinct personality, and in doing this readers easily identify with them. The Dryfoos family is a prominent example of his use with dialect and personality. They are from the south, and have just struck it rich by natural gas. They have come to live in New York and have sold their farm to live amongst the higher classes. Every one of them is homesick for their old way of life and is very uncomfortable in their new found glory. They are ignorant of proper behavior, and often make a fool of themselves with their speech and arrogance. When one of them is speaking within the text it is easy for a reader to pick up which one of the Dryfoos family it is. Each member have such a distinct personality, Mr. Dryfoos is a hard old man, Mrs. Dryfoos is a lonely sad old women, Conrad is a compassionate young man, Christine is a shrewd young woman, and Mela is a frivolous young lady. Howells? skill is so strong that the reader is not only able to picture them talking, but to almost hear them in their head. The only misuse of dialect is the in the Woodburn family. His idea of this accent is so atrocious it?s laughable. This is not an accurate account for they way people talk in the south, and his ridiculous adaptation of the language makes the Woodburn?s unrealistic as characters. They are held at arms length, and not a true credible source for southern habits. Colonel Woodburn is a southerner who strongly believed that the north interfered with the south and had they not; the slavery issue could have been perfected into a better system. He has an entire novel that he has written dedicated to showing the north the error of their ways. These characters are often shown talking to more significant characters, which in turn shoves their credibility and their ideas farther away from what the reader will utilize from the novel. 	Howells? book places women in the work place at a time where it was very uncommon to do so. Miss Alma Leighton is an artist and she and her mother moved to New York so she could advance her skill. Her art is the most used for the project the Marches have under taken, which was quite unusual at that time. Alma stands on her own, and is confident enough in herself to make all decisions affecting her life. She seems almost to be a type of heroine in the novel, as the only unmarried female character who doesn?t alter herself for society. 	Howells? novel is an excellent prose ad keeps the reader guessing as to its end all the way through. It has a voice through its characters and develops that voice as the characters evolve into society. The novel does not correctly reflect every type of person; the working class is hardly seen and never speaks, showing once again the realism of a human writer. He is just as flawed as any of his characters, he cannot please or include everyone and neither can any other human being. His novel is an excellent read, and will be a valuable use of any reader?s time.  
 you people who critzed this book are stupid and it was a great book , i have read severl books written by the auther and they are great get off his back like you could write any bette 
 This review refers to "Portnoy's Complaint" by Philip Roth...  The last time I read this book was in the early 70's. It's been sitting on my bookcase, pages yellowing, cover hanging on by a thread, for more then 35 years. It never saw a yard sale, or the donation bin. But for some reason I carried it with me, from home to home, and it has been around longer then either of my husbands. Yet,I hadn't pulled it out for another read until recently. I'd forgotten what a fun ride it was.  When this book came out, it was THE hot book to read. It pushed the envelope right over the edge, even considering the "free love" attitude of the era.Alex Portnoy, a Jewish man in his thirties, trying to come to grips with his life, gives a blow by blow account of his childhood, complete with his overbearing stereo-typical Jewish parents,the fabulous use of the Yiddish expressions he picked up, his very active(and quite descriptive) sexual activities from very early on in his pubescent years to his adulthood, and the relationships with the various women he used and abused over the years.   Alex is a character we love to hate. At times he is even infuriating(this might especially apply to female readers), but Roth's way of giving the very shallow Alex depth is wonderful. Alex's story unfolds, as he unleashes his escapades on a Dr's couch, with a rapier wit,and an amusingly self-deprecating style. At times he seems to ramble on and go off on tangents, only to have the these tangents artfully come back to complete the story.The writing style is an in your face, laugh out loud delight.  Had I written this review the first time I read this, no doubt I would have gone 5 stars plus. Here and now in the 21st century, when just about anything goes, this material may not have quite the effect it had in 1969. Other then that, I still laughed out loud, and couldn't put it down, as I followed Alex's escapades over the years.  A very funny book, a great read, I think especially for aspiring writers to check out. It may not be for everyone though, the language and events are explicit and very much "R" rated!  Enjoy the read....Laurie   
 Mike Lupica has written a page-turner of a sports book that any kid who ever picked up a Matt Christopher book or enjoyed watching any of the many kids' sports movies out there will read with rapt attention.  That's the great part of this book!  The not-so-great part is the way that some of the rules of grammar are ignored by Mr. Lupica, as some of the sentences don't flow naturally off the tongue as they're being read aloud due to missing words.  The story is written sometimes in what seems like an attempt at being cool instead of an attempt at being logical.  Overall, this is a story that will get kids to read.  And that's the bottom line 
 	Anyone familiar with the work of Gene Bertoncini knows that when they listen to one of his performances they are in presence of an artistic genius, just as they are when they gaze at Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" or Michelangelo Buonarroti's "David".  While the media in which these two masterpieces are created differ from each other, and differ from the medium in which Bertoncini works, the resulting communication of essential "truth" is the same. 	As these other great artists created work more beautiful when they continued to challenge themselves throughout their lives, so has Bertoncini continued to create recordings which have greater depth and more understanding of his chosen medium as he explores the possibilities of the unaccompanied acoustic guitar (with no electronic "help").  Whether he's working within the framework of a standard (Billy Strayhorn's Lush Life/Isfahan), a classical piece (Robert Schuman's Traumerei) or even an adaptation from the world of opera (Puccini's Nessu Dorma), Bertoncini's insightful melodic understanding, complimented by his creative harmonic knowledge, gives one the impression that whichever piece he plays was written specifically for him by that composer.  	None of this would be possible without his exquisite technical ability.  Truly gifted as an artist, he uses his talent on this CD to create music which is consummately beautiful.  To use analogy again, his arrangements have meaningful, cohesive lines similar to exquisite works of architecture.  So, even though we can't see what Gene Bertoncini creates with his guitar, it exists in aesthetic splendor as great as any masterpiece by any artist working in a visual medium.  "Quiet Now" is a CD by a remarkable artist, in full stride, doing what he loves best, to the utmost of his extraordinary ability!   
   I was surprised by some of the online reviews here that gave this book low marks.  Enough has been said about the theme of the story, so I'll just say it is simply terrific.  But it's not a story to take to the beach or to read on a plane.  This is one of those stories you read all alone, quietly at home, wrapped up in something warm and in a comfortable chair, where you can enter into the life of someone you have could never have imagined.  This story had my attention from beginning to end. You feel the gentle voice and a poetic soul throughout.   I recommend it very, very highly.      
 "An incoherent nightmare of sex . . . "  - The Westminster Gazette.  _The Great God Pan_ is the first book of the Welsh writer of weird tales and mystic Arthur Machen, published first in 1894.  This book was regarded as a form of decadent literature and was panned by critics of the Victorian era.  Arthur Machen was a fascinating character and antiquarian whose weird writings reveal his learning in the occult and his mystical inclinations.  Machen was an Anglo-Catholic opposed to modernism in all its forms who was to join the secret society of the Golden Dawn, though he would reject the nefarious doings of such individuals as Aleister Crowley.  Machen had an enormous influence on later writers of weird tales including especially H. P. Lovecraft who mentions him in his essay "Supernatural Horror in Literature" as an important influence.  This book, republished by Creation Classics, is complimented by automatic drawings of Austin Osman Spare, a friend of Machen and a fellow occultist and mystic.  In addition, this book contains Machen's introduction to the story proper.  _The Great God Pan_ begins with a scientist/doctor and his friend attempting to perform a surgical operation on the brain of a seventeen year old girl, Mary, so that she may "see the Great God Pan".  The doctor discusses his theories of "transcendental medicine", in which he believes he can control her through this operation.  The operation fails and Mary is rendered an "idiot".  The story then skips to the memoirs of Mr. Clarke, the friend of Dr. Raymond from the experiment on Mary.  Mr. Clarke recounts a tale involving a young girl named Helen Vaughan, who encounters a pagan idol from Roman times in a field.  The story involves murder and intrigue as well as a demonic sex change, which occur later in the tale.  Machen's mystical inclinations can be seen as he presents the reader with an alchemical transformation.  Though this book was initially criticized harshly by the establishment in Victorian times, it has endured and set the place of Arthur Machen as an important writer of weird tales.  Machen's stories are quite unique and his influence on subsequent writers of supernatural fiction continues to endure. 
 Lovely seems almost too precious a word to attach to something that has quite a bit of heft to it, however the word does seem apropos for the feeling I had upon finishing it. Tyler Caskey comes to the small town of West Arnett Maine in the 1950s to be the local parish minister. Yet soon a personal tragedy befalls his family and he finds himself struggling with his faith, and his place in the world as he copes with a terrible loss. What makes the book so winning, is that Strout avoids any maudlin or melodramatic pitfalls in her portrayal of Caskey, a man who must  provide spiritual guidance for a rich and colorful tapestry of small town characters in all their gossipy glory, while also struggling as a father and a widow 
 President Kennedy's White House taping system accomplished what one can assume was the goal in installing it . . . to accurately capture history as it happened.  There has possibly been too little attention paid to the  Cuban missile crisis, or perhaps the passage of 37 years has dimmed our  collective memory.  One has only to read these transcripts to learn how  close the world came to a nuclear holocaust, and how detailed and laborious  discussions and debates among Kennedy and his cabinet narrowly avoided it.   This is a superb and rare glimpse into the "inner sanctum" of our  government during one of the most tense moments in our history 
 This is a remarkable book by Nicholas Wade tying together a number of disciplines into a plausible explanation and sometimes exploration of unrecorded human past.  It is widely believed that evolution follows the path of least resistance towards survival and procreation and this almost blind intelligence is attributed for the progress of all species, particularly human.  This book traces major steps in evolution, explains the reason why evolution followed that path and also attaches tentative dates to these events. The narrative criss-crosses between evolutionary evidence, archaelogical findings, geological explanations, linguistics, anthropology and recorded history besides others.  It is a great read for anyone who is interested in learning what lies under the tip of the iceberg of recorded human history.  It is written for common audience with no special scientific or technical background.  Highly recommended. 
 This is a good introduction to dancing.  It won't teach you everything you need, but that's why you need to buy more DVDs from the same people.  I think it's excellent and easy to follow 
 Skates believes that invading Japan would have been preferable to dropping nuclear weapons.  He spends most of the book describing how the invasion would have happened.  He is honest enough to admit that there would have been problems with the invasion.  For instance, over half of the divisions would have come from Europe, however, most of the combat veterans in these units were being discharged and replaced with new draftees.  Retaining the veterans would have caused severe morale problems.  Skates' main argument is that an invasion would have caused fewer casualties than died in the nuclear bombing.  I believe he fails to sustain this argument.  The War Department staff in Washington estimated there would be 250,000 to 500,000 American casualties in an invasion of Japan. After the war, some politicians casually made this a "half-million dead" and then "a million dead." In any event, the estimate of casualties included killed, wounded and missing. The original estimates were a not-unreasonable figure based on recent American experience with fanatical Japanese defenders of the Philippines, Iwo Jima and Okinawa, and one which a postwar examination of Japanese plans for the defense of the Home Islands bore out. There was no indication the Japanese would fight any less strenuously if their Home Islands were invaded. Indeed, it was a safe bet that the fighting would have been even more costly.  And this doesn't even consider the Japanese casualties.  The Japanese consistently demonstrated a marked reluctance to surrender, either on the battlefield or at the negotiating table. The American people, in light of Germany's surrender in May 1945, were eager to get the war in the Pacific over with as soon as possible. The voters were making this wish quite clear to their elected officials and the chief among these, President Truman, was listening intently. He had been told that a blockade of Japan might have to go on for a year or more before Japan finally gave in. A successful invasion would not be noticeably shorter.  The American people would have none of this and wanted something done. Nuclear weapons were simply another incentive for the Japanese to surrender, and no one was sure they would be any more persuasive than the fire bomb raids (which killed more people than the atomic bombs) 
 Most people will read the title and think it's a 101 book on Wicca or Witchcraft or both. However it's NOT either. Taking the title literally it's a book on CRAFTS. Basically a how-to book on making robes, candles, brooms, wands, crosses, pendulums, smudges, books, athames!!!, holiday related, etc.  So if you really want to learn how to do it yourself for pretty much ANYthing that deals with working magic, ritual and what to do for the holidays this is it.  The only part I found...bad was the athame part. It's almost copy and paste from Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft. Not only that, the book makes it out that every craft is simple and easy to do and everybody can make these out of stuff lying around. I'm sorry I don't have a metal cutter and metal grinder just lying around my house. White glue and newspapers...maybe 
 "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" derives from one of the most celebrated shoot-outs in Western history in Tombstone, Arizona, on October 26, 1881... The semi-legendary confrontation had made of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, men of exceptional quality...   "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" has some of the Sturges virtues, but not all... It doesn't however disappoint when it comes to the crunch--the gunfight itself... This is magnificently staged... It probably equals anything that law and order movies have produced in set-piece battles...   The film also focuses on the friendship between Earp and Holliday and the good will of two different kinds of men... Earp, is an honest lawman with authority, and Holliday, a gambler with a 'real big hate for the law.'  The two characters are powerful, strong, and at the same time compassionate, with respect and dignity... Holliday's character as the black sheep, is much more interesting than the straight marshal who is at the same time the lawman, the judge and the jury.' The main assets of the motion picture are Lancaster and Douglas, two great stars conscious of their potentialities with excellent ability...  Douglas is impressing and brilliant as the troubled sick Doc Holliday and Lancaster is confident, solid and likable as Wyatt Earp... The mirror scene, in the beginning of the film, is great: Douglas, cool and steady, is ready for action observing carefully in the mirror the sharp feature and narrow steely eyes of Lee Van Cleef who is so anxious to kill him with a small gun hidden in his left boot...  Fine performances by a first-class cast heighten the interest: Rhonda Fleming is ravishing as the redhead lady gambler; Jo Van Fleet is very effective as the jealous lady, torn between Ringo and Holliday; Earl Holliman is good as the naive deputy who 'picks up the hardware as soon as the cowboys hit town;' John Ireland is unforgettable with his slight stoop and menacing walk; Lyle Bettger is strong as Ike Clanton, the organizer of the toughest bunch of gunslingers; Dennis Hopper is difficult and rebellious as the young Clanton who can't take the advice of the marshal; and Jack Elam is threatening as the tall and lean man with an evil leer...  Dimitri Tiomkin's great score back up the "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral," a pure Western, magnificently photographed by Charles Lang in VistaVision and Technicolor...   John Ireland has been twice on the losing side of the Corral incident... The first time as Billy Clanton in John Ford's "My Darling Clementine."   
 If you're exploring ska, Five Iron Frenzy, or Christian music in general, buy this album.  I garuntee you that you will enjoy this album immensely.  This is by far my favorite Five Iron Frenzy album.  Light-hearted, upbeat, and yet superbly well written and played.  They give off the vibe of a lets-just-scream-our-heads-off-and-have-fun punk band, but they are all extremely good musicians, and their talent shows in the quality of their music 
 Yojimbo (The Bodyguard) is a samurai movie based in the detective novels of Dashiell Hammett - particularly Red Harvest. Akira Kurosawa wanted to bring the best of literature and interpret it into Japanese cinema. Its interesting that the two main influences in this process were Hammett's hard-boiled detective fiction and William Shakespeare (Ran, Throne of Blood). The always-excellent Toshiro Mifune plays the nameless title character who schemes and plots of take down an entire town of gamblers and gansters. I won't recap the story, suffice to say that his plans lead into several battles and some beautifully choreographed sword fights. Yojimbo was later made (nearly scene-for-scene) into A Fistfull of Dollars by Sergio Leone with Clint Eastwood as "The Man with No Name." Bruce Willis brought the character back to it's ganster/detective roots with the not-so-good "Last Man Standing." Yojimbo is awash with cinematic violence, but the charm infused into the movie by the cynical, yet obstinately principled, hero surprised me when I first saw it. The performances of the supporting cast, as usual with Kurosawa's films, add depth and wit to each scene. For what its worth, Yojimbo has gradually become one of my favorite movies.   If you end up enjoying Yojimbo, check out The Seven Samurai, Sword of Doom, Miller's Crossing, The Maltese Falcon, and The Thin Man.    Criterion did an excellent job with their recent re-release of Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, and they gave the same treatment to both Yojimbo & Sanjuro. A new (and improved) translation, commentary from Steven Price, as well as documentary film focusing on Kurosawa during the time he was making these great movies.  This review is modified from my review of the Yojimbo/Sanjuro double DVD pack, each movie is great, but I'd recommend picking up both 
 I picked up Essential Ayurveda on a whim at a natural foods store when I was really looking for something else. What attracted me was the simple recipes and the pleasant, conversational voice of the author. When I began reading it at home, I was so glad I had trusted my instincts! I have been interested in Ayurvedic diet for many years but felt it was complicated and hard to prepare. But this author shows how simple it can be--and very clearly illustrates how the loving, respectful, harmonic way of living with and caring for yourself flows through all of life--not just diet. A wonderful book. I think it's the last book I'll ever need in order to understand Ayurveda better. I also already have "Heaven's Banquet," which the author recommends as a great source for balanced and healing recipes. Now I'll go back to that book with new eyes 
 Insects and Gardens is a double award winning book.  It received two of the "Top 10" 2002 Garden Globe Awards presented by the Garden Writers Association of America -- one for Best Book and one for Best Writer, and comes highly recommend by the people who write about gardening. Author Eric Grissell, who is a research entomologist with the USDA, received Best Writing for his clear and concise look at the life of insects and how they "work" to our benefit in our gardens.  Publisher Timber Press received the Best Book for an outstanding gardening book overall.  Only five individuals and five companies were selected out of a field of more than 300 entries to receive a 2002 Garden Globe Award. The book was selected by a panel of garden communication experts - some Pulitzer Prize winners themselves -- who look for the best books, magazines, writers and photographers in the country.  The book was evaluated on accuracy of information, ability to communicate, content, organization, style and originality.  If you are interested in  the relationships of insects to gardens, to each other and to humans, and how they benefit your garden, this is a must have in your library.. 
 Slug and Ant have outdone themselves in this amazing effort.  It seems the duo have taken a step away from the overall message of their previous albums.  The lyrics have started to evolve from the emo-like lyrics that their previous albums exlemplified.  This isn't a god thing or bad thing. I believe that it was an expirement to see how their fans would react.  They still had some of their old formula during this album which is actually a good thing because without it the duo probably would have lost some of loyal fan base that they had aquired during the 9 year run that Slug and Ant have taken.  As for the album itself, I found this to be one of my favorites because of the intresting step Atmosphere took.  There was the heavy beat of "The Arrival" and the anthem like "Watch Out".  But ths album also had some of the flair of their previous albums such as the sorrow in "Pour me Another" and the lyrical mastery in "Little man"  Because of these incredible tracks I give this record five stars.  The future of Atmosphere is still up in the air.  I'm not sure whether the duo will take another step forward and become more of a mainstream group or remain loyal to the fan base that have listened to their tracks since the late 90's. Listening to the last track, "Little Man",  really makes one think "You're raps are exhausted, stop it, everyone knows that you've lost it."   If this is indeed Slug telling himself that he's lost it the I don't think that we will see another Atmosphere record. Though this could just be a line that makes listeners think. But my theory is that Slug and Ant will revert back to the lyrics and beats that have taken them this far 
 The fact that this collection of essays has been in print for almost four decades is consistent with its enduring significance.  Although Goffman draws on his research in mental institutions, his writings in this book  have much broader relevance.  In particular, they have to do with the  nature of identity, the processes whereby organizations and groupings seek  to change the identities and selves of their members, and the strategies  used by group members to resist those changes.  At a broader level, this  book is about the relationship between person and the groups of which s/he  is a part.  Extremely well written, and very readable with excellent use of  illustrative examples, this set of essays provides unparalleled insights  into and understandings of the relation between person and society 
 I'm a 56 year old 200# 6'1 pronator with flat feet and left leg 1/2" shorter than right leg.  The 991 was my first running show and I wore it out in a little over 6 months at about 500 miles or so or walking/running.The 992 has more cushioning and is holding up better.  The Plastic stuff on the back of the 991 just fell apart.  I still have the 991's for alternate days and wear them on short runs or walks.  The 992's do 4-6 mi comfortabley for me.  They are wider than the 991.  Both are 11 1/2D.  I beef them up with a left heel 1/4" cork, 1/8" foam in each shoe, and arch molds with strategically placed felts and a ball pad.  I think the 992 is a better shoe and it is wearing well with a couple hundred miles on it.  I don't have experience with other brands so any suggestions for a pronator with bad knees would be welcome.  I need another pair so I can retire the 991's 
 This hitting instruction book, written by the premier hitter of our lifetime, will be of benefit to players of every age and ability. Imagine Leonardo Da Vinci writing a book on painting. There was only one Ted Williams, but this book will help all players who strive to become better hitters 
 I hadn't read a book on business in a few years, and typically find business books a snooze - not the case here.  Upon starting my copy of Berman's book, I found it a great read.  I read it on the plane then finished it that same night.  I'm glad someone took the time to put together a package of their years of business experience into a simple book and program. With the enourmous amount of useful information in the software program I will surely keep coming back for more info and use if for years to come 
 We had this game for years, it was lost in a fire and we just found it again. It is a lot of fun playing and we are now teaching relatives who we have game night with to play. It is a lot of fun...for 2 or more people to play too 
 my only comment is as follows: This book completely relates to how a government can defraud another country to the way loan brokers inflict predatory lending to the poor in our own backyard 
 As always the Aunt Dimity series is fun, light reading. Always entertainin 
 This book differs from most other Six Sigma guides in that it identifies, by name, companies that failed at Six Sigma. So many authors have presented Six Sigma as something magical that it is refreshing to see its warts. Make no mistake - the authors are not out to debunk or dethrone Six Sigma, a management philosophy and method that has been their professional life for many years. They clearly believe that Six Sigma is worth the investment of time, brain power, leadership and political capital that it requires. But they aren't afraid to point out the fact that it does require serious investment, and that management must sustain its commitment for years to unlock the full benefit of the Six Sigma approach. The book is a tolerably good read, albeit dry. It mercifully spares the reader any puffery or promotion, and it lays out the axioms of Six Sigma life in a very lucid format. Occasionally, it stoops to cliché, but not terribly often. We  recommend it to those who need to know what it really takes to achieve Six Sigma performance, and how to begin 
 The authors show how important it is to gather ideas and encourage people to think creatively. I wish they would have described more how they could gather these ideas more effectively. 
 This was a good, somewhat disjointed look at lesbian and gay families in the United States today. This is perhaps the only book dealing with the history of the movement, but much of it seemed impersonal. I am not sure if Benkov's target audience is lesbian and gay parents and their supporters, or if the book is supposed to be a way to convince those opposed to the movement. All in all though, it was an enjoyable and informative book, and it is a must read for anyone interested in this subjec 
 Chavarria is no Dashiel Hammett.  Nor is he a Reinaldo Arenas . . .and 'tho he shares Pedro Juan Gutierrez's (Dirty Havana Trilogy) appreciation of the consolations of tropical sexuality, he's not nearly as monomaniacal as Gutierrez, preferring instead to chain his erotics to a fast-paced and intriguing mystery plot.  Set in contemporary Cuba, a nation desperate to modernize by delicately balancing the fruits of European and Latin American capital against the achievements of the Cuban Revolution, Adios Muchachos exploits that most typical setting where foreigner and native meet in Cuba - - the sexualized body of the Cuban woman.  Chavarria's heroine possesses the most perfect "culo" in Havan, and like the enterprising jineteros or hustlers who sustain a dynamic entrepeneurial culture under the noses of the Revolution's guards, she deploys that asset to pull herself into the tourist economy and its prized dollars.  When Cuban sexuality and ingenuity meet European libidos on a long leash from home - - the result is a whirlwind of disguise, counterplotting, and subterfuge.  Buried within Adios Muchacho is a kind of charming allegory about the everyday power of the Cuban people to foil the return of postmodern, neo-liberal imperialists.  A fun read

   Great versatile sandals for the price. Will never go out of style, and you can wear them almost anywhere, with almost anything 
 In her customary clear-headed fashion Jane Jacobs has written a brief but brilliant summary of the reasons why Western culture is facing a Dark Age.  In short chapters (supplemented by copious notes and further details at the end) she examines the decline of the family structure, the breakdown of community, the discarding of education in favor of "credentialing", and other warning signs of decline.    Jacobs is always clear minded and often witty.  She makes the same point again and again: decline is not so much a failure of society or of structure as it is of imagination, our inability or unwillingness to look beyond the immediate problem or to consider unusual but promising alternatives. Sometimes the solution is so obvious as to be overlooked, such as that the reason for a high death toll among the elderly in one Chicago neighborhood during a heat wave was not neglect or failure to provide information, but rather that there was no viable community to give the support and help that was needed.  Jacobs will not please those who have permanently bound themselves to either the Left or Right, but those of us able to look beyond ideology in search of real solutions will find much to ponder here. 
 I bought this for my 2 year old grandson, and he loves it.  His mommy plays the guitar and he always wanted hers.  She wanted a real-looking and sounding guitar for him, and she says this one is great.  It's good quality (for a 2 year old).  Let's see if it can hold up to a toddler 
 One thing that Hemingway clears up is that bullfighting is not a contest between man and beast. It is a tragedy; no matter if the bull succeeds in killing the matador, and all the picadors and bandierros for that matter, he will still be executed after the fight. This is pure art, and nothing more. I can't explain why to you, but Hemingway says that it is very Spanish, and to understand it you must understand the Spaniards.   This is just a general overview of bullfighting. The book is very descriptive and very much more worth your time. You will find that there is something of the bullfight and the muleta in all of us.   The three steps of the bullfight are clear and showcase the bull. (It is worth mentioning that these are not just any bulls: they are finely bred fighting bulls that are too agressive to be good for anything else.)   One: the bull shows his strength and bravery in the killing of the horses in the first stage with the picador. The picador pierced the muscle on his shoulder, therefore showing the bravery of the bull if he continues through the pain to gore the horse. After this stage, the dead horses are covered and the bandierros enter the ring.   Two: The bandierros use small spears with hooks on them so they stay in the bull's hide. They are 'set' in pairs in the large hump of agrivated muscle over the withers. These are used to raise the neck of the bull and therefore weakening it so the matador can do his work. In this stage the bull is confused: he cannot (if the man knows his work and is not unlucky) catch the man as he did in the last stage. His courage is useless.   Three: The matador enters the arena (or barrera, I believe...it's been a while) to finish the bull. At this stage, the bull is tired and his head is beginning to droop. His shoulders are covered in blood but he stands there arrogant. The matador cannot rise over the horns of the bull to kill in his origional condition; therefore, he must tire him over the course of the three stages. The matador does his part with the muleta (cape) and then kills the bull by stabbing him with a sword to his heart. It is here, Hemingway will tell you, that the bull is either said to be killed or assasinated. If the matador is competent, his body will come over the top of the horn. If the bull lifts his head, the matador is gored. Thus, in a proper kill, the bull in the end had a chance to kill again. If the matador pulls back at the last second and just stabs the animal without the threat, he is said to "assasinate."  This is excellent. Your friends might look at you a little funny for reading about "killing bulls" and not understand that it is...well, an ART. This is just plain wonderful. Hemingway again does a terriffic job, showing more of his journalistic side than in For Whom the Bell Tolls.   Excellent read, but not for everyone. Get it from the library and read the first few chapters. If you still feel sorry for the bulls after that, you're on your own 
 Veteran smooth jazz saxophone master Gerald Albright is no one-dimensional purveyor of musical wallpaper. He has recorded seven successful solo albums for Atlantic when he wasn't busy, assisting an impressive, and mammoth, roster of popular R&B artists.Some of the more well-known artists Albright assisted during his career include Anita Baker, Quincy Jones, the Temptations, Phil Collins, Whitney Houston, and many, many more.   His excellent "NEW BEGINNINGS" collection is wide-ranging enough to cover a sultry version of "Georgia on My Mind" and a swaying, uptempo cover of the Whispers' disco-era hit "And the Beat Goes On",  a compelling 80's style groove which features the Scott brothers (Whispers) on backing vocals. The pianist Patrice Rushen makes a guest appearance on the album's title track, and Albright's colleague Jeff Lorber performs on cuts including the velvety "We Got the Groove" and the sinuous "Take Your Time". Other guest artists are Chris Botti on trumpet,Paul Jaxkson jr. on guitar,Rex Rideout and Chuckii Booker as arrangers. The uptempo cut "Big Shoes" is a  flowing number. Listen also to the slower "Last But Not Least". Albright is quite capable of providing a five-star masterpiece, which "New Beginnings" is not. Nonetheless, this 2006 release with Peak Records has more pluses than minuses -- and it is certainly superior to "Dream Come True", "Bermuda Nights", and some of the other duds he recorded for Atlantic in the '80s and '90s. This is a very strong selection of Smooth Jazz grooves that mixes in Funk and Fusion. As usual, Gerald's playing is soulful, smooth and fluid.And very  enjoyable. You will love this feel-good album. Enjoy !  
 This is a well paced, well writen book that brings out the thrill of the Iditarod.  I did figure it out about half way through without really trying, though, but it didn't take anything away from the excitement!  The only other negative to the story is that I live in Alaska and I don't think the author really got the point across of just HOW cold it can get here in the winter.  Negative temperatures for a month or more!  Good book and the best fictional account of the Last Great Race I have read 
 Strange Fruit is an amazing, eye-opening, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, and often -- indeed, at nearly every page -- startlingly shocking book.  It's a wonder that this book (and author) is not more well known.  Strange Fruit is a Southern Peyton Place; it has that authenticity that makes us remember what many of us have would prefer to forget.  It is a novel not to be missed. 
 Lots of Good Information for potential recruits or DEPers. There was alot of off-topic stuff on society, and the history of the Marine Corps post Vietnam. Certainly a good read for all forture Marines 
 having read this book thoroughly i appreciate the effort done by the auther.i also translated the same book in technical english,the book is very informative,it simplified many equipments and systems to prevent the viman from natural hezards,to supply enery from natural sources.i whole heartedly appriciate him.since last 32 years ,i was working in an industry  manufacturing supersonic fighter aircrafts,having adventage of technical knowledge and command on sanskrit,i can suggest a few addendums if the auther can enter them in his next revised addition, i wish every technical men should read this book 
 There isn't really much to say about this record mostly because it will render you speechless. There is really no point in giving a breakdown of each song as they are all attached to eachother. The songs flow together.... you will look at your player and wont believe that you are at the end of the album, mostly because it's almost as if the album is one song.   Never have I heard an album who's lyrics are just as powerful as the music. Have you ever had a song speak to you? This whole album speaks to you in a way that leaves people breathless. Not only that but women have had orgasms listening to this album. How many bands can do that with every song on an album? Ok, maybe that was a little overboard but seriously, a must have for any music lover. 
 The first jurassic park was the best, but I still like some things about jurassic park iii better. The effects in 3 were improved, and being the public is used to seeing computer generated graphics in many movies since the first jurassic park 1993, many cg movies have followed. Titanic to come to mind, gladiator 2000,godzilla 1998, and many other computer graphic movies after 1993. Jurassic park iii had to convince the public even more that the dinosaurs in pt.3 were real. Special effects expert stan winston and crew do an excellent job in doing that in pt.3. the raptors look more authentic than in any of the first two jurassic movies. Keep in mind that the dinosaurs in pt.3 and just like in the first two movies they were created with the aid of paleontologists,jurassic park dinosaurs with the help and knowledge of these paleontologists advised stan winston on the dinosaurs anatomic motions and even their growls and grunts, through their research and studies on dinosaur behavior. The special features on this dvd explain some of what I am discussing in this review. The thing I like about pt.3 is that it is a shorter movie than the first two. 30 to 40 min. Shorter. The action is faster you get right into the movie. When you see sam niel blow into that replica raptor throat passage, what your really seeing is what paleontologists have done with molds taken from dinosaur skeletons mainly the head and throat. Paleontologists have blown air into the molded cast and have produced what could have been dinosaur sounds produced many millions of years before the time of humans, incredible! I am sure I am boring you with all this but I am trying to make you see the research that went into the special eefects of not only jurassic park iii, but in the first two. I enjoyed pt.3 immensly, shorter cut right to the action of the movie. This movie may have not been the best out of the three but it is better than pt ii. Sam niel really played a believable paleontologists. Amazing, this movie a third installment of the jurassic park franchise still made over $300.000.000. I know the title jurassic park pt iii. And the special effects drew the people to this movie to make the over $300,000,000 it made at the box office,or maybe most people have a hidden fasination with seeing these dinosaurs come to life on the screen, because there really is nothing like these creatures alive today. Jurassic park or not, dinosaurs are one of the most amazing success stories in the history of the earth they existed for about 160,000,000 to 180,000,000 years, modern humans only about 2,000,000 years so far. Enjoy jurrasic park pt.3 for its researched special effects and fast paced action, no it will never be citizen kane but it will certainly entertain the whole family from the realists to the simple minded. Remember alot of research went into jurassic park pt.iii, dont grade it for an oscar, grade it for the scientific research that went into it and the action and the fun. Enough already enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I received this book as a gift during my pregnancy and I LOVED IT!!!!!  Now, it's the first thing I buy for my pregnant friends 
 I have been reading and researching the United States homeless issues for a few months and found this book to be fairly insightful. Liebow writes from a very intimate point of view and backs up his observations with sources and facts. This is a very palatable introductory book to the general issues of homelessness in America today 
 If you possess writing talent and want to break into TV and Motion Picture Industry, "Writing Treatments that Sell" is the only book you will ever need. No, the book won't help you actually sell your story, but it will help you understand the industry, its needs and prepare you to submit a project that will garner serious consideration. "Writing Treatments that Sell" helps you to see your own project from the perspective of the Development Director and guides you through the steps necessary to shape your product from that point of view.  As a writer, I became so intimately involved with my project that I forget the point of the story and was unable to communicate what the story was about because I no longer knew myself. Often times, while writing, it's so easy to get bogged down in the muck and mire and lose the point of the story. "Writing Treatments That Sell" helped me focus on the "meat" of the story. The ideas put forth in the book allowed me to lose sight of myself and become an objective reader of my own story. "Writing Treatments That Sell" helped me set up a road-map in an effort to take my story from point A to Point B without losing the flavor.  If anyone has ever asked you what your story, novel or script is about and you can't tell them in one or two lines, then "Writing Treatments that Sell" is the book for you. Not only will you be able to convince the buyer your story is worthy of production, you will also convince yourself that the story is a cut above the rest 
 Classic Du Maurier!  "A Borderline Case" was my favorite, with the title story ("Don't Look Now") a close second.  The very best mystery/suspense/romance author 
 but I have hopes for this series. I just didn't connect at all with the character in this book. Maybe it is just the 1st book syndrome thing. I will however read the next in the series, I think there are quite a few secondary characters that can really help carry this series along and I hope to get to like the main character more 
 wait a minute - did I just write 'old school'?  This is still soooo hot 
 With solid research and absolute clarity,  John Meacham tells a story that every political and religious leader should be required to read. Without becoming a partisan, Meacham debukes a lot of myths regarding the religious beginnings of the U.S.      When the religious right speaks of the "values the nation was founded upon", which values are they speaking of: the values of Jamestown and Mass. Bay colony or the values of Jefferson, Franklin and Washington?  Meacham makes clear that there is a difference.        The author is encouraging in that he makes a case that the "center" position re: religion has always held forth in American.  I "pray" that, through his book and others, it shall always be so 
 I adored this series, I am thrilled to have the tapes of some of the episodes, but yes, they wear out.  Please, please, oh ye powers that be, get this whole series on DVD!  There are an awful lot of us out here who would appreciate it.  And please also remember, SOME of us live overseas and need Region 2 format!  But the prospect of being in that world, just once more, just for a moment - well, that's the magic of the thing, isn't it 
 At my camp, we recently performed a play in two acts using "Mute" from this collection, and "Nick of Time" from the other. These are easy to follow scripts, and are great bed reading 
 I think that sometimes people overlook how hard it is to become well respected in the field of science research. For Richard Feynman, thinking scientifically came easily since he was a child. Throughout this book he shares his early scientific experiences up until he helps in discovering the reason why the Challenger space shuttle failed. With a detailed explanation of every step of his journey as part of the commission, which investigated causes of failure, Feynman expresses his frustrations, triumphs and discoveries along the way. He does not sugarcoat any of his experiences. In fact, it seems as if he wants to show people how difficult it can be to work with so many people all striving for the same thing. From reading this book, one can see that respect does not come without hardships and failure. It is important to see the process of how someone comes to think of things and how even acclaimed and accomplished scientists run into obstacles when trying to figure new things out. Feynman's depiction of his investigation of the failure of the Challenger gives the reader a realistic view of how frustrating things must have been for Feynman. Even though it would have been nice to read about the country's views on the matters, it was also nice to get an "insider's" story and opinion 
 I wish I had this book when I took my discrete systems class in college.  Maybe then I would have understood what the professor was trying, but failed, to teach us.  Thanks to Lyon's book, I now am beginning to understand how to use the FFT to actually analyze a real signal.  I understood FIR filters pretty well but the book's helping me a lot to understand how to use the Z transform to analyze IIR filters.  The book doesn't just give you the equations, he explains what they mean and that's what I like about the book.  I am even beginning to grasp some of the DSP Tricks in Chapter 13.  I highly recommend this book to anyone trying to learn digital signal processing 
 This treatise constitutes a touchstone document in the theory of European art music, especially, that from ca. 1600-1850.  It is a great tool, not only for historians of the music and music theory of the 17th- and 18th- centuries, but also, for  historians of science interested in acoustics.  Definite recommendation 
 The thing about Linda Ronstadt's three albums in which she collaborated with Nelson Riddle is, you either love them or you hate them. Count me as one of the people who enjoys it. I wouldn't say it's essential Linda Ronstadt by any means, if you are a big fan I think it suits you better, but it's a nice listen. I think she handles the songs with grace and her voice is just fine for what it calls for. So you have all three albums on this two disc set. Personally, I think the first album (tracks 1-9, WHATS NEW) is the best of the three, but there's good moments throughout all 32 tracks 
 I bought this as an extra battery for my new Kodak EasyShare One.  It lasts a long time and recharges quickly.  If you are in the market for a quality camera battery, this is it 
 Tom's takes on "Sea of Love" and "Young at Heart" are worth the price of admission alone.  When you add all the other great songs, such as "Bottom of the World," "Rains on Me," "Lucinda," et all, you get the portrait of a human soul chained in purgatory but still hoping for love, calling up from the bottom of a deep, deep well.  I've always felt that Tom's voice has been underrated, and that his are usually the best versions of his songs.  Case in point: "Downtown Train," (not from these CDs, but from RAIN DOGS). Tom's version is so much better than Rod Stewart's big hit cover version.  Anyway, amidst the clanking of wooden spoons on rusted pans and steel guitars fretted with rubber bands, you get on this 3 CD set the howl of someone with a great deal of soul in a great deal of pain who is singing his way out of or about it.  Listening to Tom, I always get the feeling that, for those of you who have read Dickens' "A Christmas Carol," what a set of songs sung by Jacob Marley would have sounded like 
 Director-screenwriter Jane Campion started at the movies in the early 1980s at the Australian School of Film and Television... She clearly emerged from her cultural heritage to become one of the world's premiere female directors...  Campion's films typically have a treacherous terrain of searing emotional intensity... We recognize ourselves in the ways her characters think and behave... Her work signifies a break with the tragic, the Gothic and the sentimental...   Her exquisite film which won three Academy Awards including one for Campion's screenplay, is not about sex, but about passion...  Jane challenges the viewer on many levels... Her film (literary inspired from 'Wuthering Heights') explores new territory in the delicious handling of female sexuality and pleasure with the ecstasy of a loving relationship...   In one scene Ada, with tears of anger, hits Baines hard across the face, as if she has spoken words of love... With each new breath, with every moment that their eyes remain locked together, the promise of intimacy is confirmed and reconfirmed and detailed... Only their feelings and emotions guide their instincts...   No woman artist had approached sex in such a direct and liberating manner... Campion's scenes shows Baines' face crumpling with the exquisite pain of his pleasure... Ada moving his head to her chest, and Baines struggling through her dress anxious to touch her skin...   Nominated for eight Academy Awards, the film tells the story of Ada, a strong willful 19th-century Scotswoman who hasn't spoken, since she was six years old... Ada has been set up in an arranged marriage to a British emigrant in New Zealand...  The film opens with Ada who is carried to shore on the shoulders of five seamen to meet her husband Stewart, a landowner who is without much emotion or real love... Her large Victorian skirt spreads across the men's arms and backs... On her head a black bonnet... Around her neck her pad and pen...   Campion manages to chose a cast to suit her purpose and style... Ada is not any easy role and Holly Hunter plays her without vanity... Her face is alight with facial expression, sometimes tender, sometimes sad, sometimes humorous, sometimes soft, while her hands and fingers are quick and neat...  Ada speaks through sign-language translated by her young daughter Flora, and through her beloved piano which happens to be the prime source of her expression... She takes great delight in feeling her fingers on her piano's keys... But in the way she eyes the illiterate, uncultured Baines, there is an insolence and lack of respect... We watch her stopping abruptly, indignantly, as he touches her neck...   Harvey Kietel plays the lonely neighbor George Baines, a depressive man who is everything Stewart is not... He has never seen a graceful woman behave with so much abandon... Ada moves to the piano... She wants to touch it, but she is torn by her feelings, wanting it, but not owning it... Baines views Ada totally absorbed in her piano music... He seems satisfied to watch... He finds himself edging irresistibly closer, magnetically drawn to the spectacle...  Baines enjoys her fingers moving on the keys and the small details of motion on her face... Twice he closes his eyes and breathes deeply... He is experiencing a strange sense of appreciation and lust... He feels powerless... He is desperate and romantic... He no longer admires her absorption with the piano... He is jealous of it... His attention finally focuses on her neck as it bends further or closer to the piano... Ada's long white neck proves irresistible... Baines comes across the room, kisses her, and asks: 'Do you know how to bargain, nod if you do. There's a way you can have your piano back.'   Anna Paquin has been proclaimed one of the best child acting roles ever... She gives a subtle and complex performance as the very cute little girl torn between her mother and stepfather... She looks over at the house suddenly aware that the piano playing has stopped suddenly... She investigates the mystery peeping through the various cracks and holes in the loosely built hut... Her venture is one of challenge and curiosity... Her complex portrayal of Flora won her the Best Supporting Actress...  Sam Neill plays the intense, moralistic and very-Victorian husband Alistair Stewart, who never understands his woman's nature... He surveys Baines' hut suspiciously... There are sounds inside which are worrying him... By wondering around the hut, he finds a hole where he can see the two lovers kissing, and undressing... He reels back angry, but just as we might expect him to burst through, he steps up to look again...  Jane Campion creates an unusual film, poetic and lyrical, complimented by a beautiful cinematography of the haunting woods, which by many critics has been named as a masterpiece... She is the first female director to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes...   
 As the review below states this book isn't a behind-the-scenes book or a chronicle of the development of the game nor is it a book discussing the technological merits of Half Life 2 or the Source Engine. Although, it does contain elements of all of the afformentioned parts, it is in the end an art book, but a great one at that with great color, a sturdy build, and a clean uncluttered design.    As a fan of the game myself, I enjoyed seeing all the places and ideas that never made it into the game and the evolution and design of those that did. One area, I feel the book ought to and should have delved into more, was the development and evolution of the plot itself which except in reference to other points was never brought up significantly.  Fans of the Half Life franchise and people interested in the creative development of games will find this book of interest. Others may want to pass on it 
 I have to say I'm very surprised by this book.  I bought it after seeing him interviewed about it on TV.  I have never watched his show, and I don't think I've seen any of his movies, except maybe Red Heat.  But this book is really hysterical.  I laughed outloud several times.  It's not highbrow humor or anything...far from it.  It just has lots of humorous ways of looking at life, from a "guy's guy" point of view.  Don't expect it to be more than that...but if you like a good belly laugh, this book has it.  Look for the "Glurk! 
 We do seem to love the story of a child whose life is so miserable that it begs for a magical rescue and an exciting, dangerous and hair raising adventure.  In James and the Giant Peach we meet one James Henry Trotter, one of these very same children who like his predecessors and successors   (Harry Potter, Cinderella, Those Lemony Snickett Children, Hansel & Gretel, ect...) is leading a desperate and miserable life with is two wicked aunts...his parents were eaten by a wild, rampaging rhinoceros (naturally).  On one particularly bad day, Henry hides behind some bushes and meets a strange old man who gives him some magic crystals (green glowing pellet things), which he is supposed to drink (mixed with water and ten of his own hairs), but of course he promptly trips and spills them on the ground under an ancient and withered peach tree.    James is crushed when the crystals wiggle into the ground and are lost forever (or so he thinks)...but as with all magic, that's not the end of the story....it is merely the beginning.  Shortly thereafter, the tree grows the most enormous peach ever and the aunts are in the green, selling admission to the general public...but that money and fame doesn't make them any nicer and James winds up locked outside, where he discovers a hidden tunnel to the center of the peach!  Luckily for him the crystals have made quite the team for him to embark on an adventure with...the cantankerous Worm, the pest of a centipede, the wonderful Ms. Spider, the loveable lady bug, a glow worm, a silk worm, and an old grasshopper!  In short order, the free the giant peach from its branch, roll over the aunts and are on the way to a whole big adventure!    Dahl is always a treat, and his books stand up to the test of time...kids always seem to love a good evil guardian gets what they deserve while the miserable child gets to shine for the good hearted, hero he is and have a grand adventure too!  You'll have to read the book if you want to find out what happens to James and his gang once the peach gets rolling...you know you want to!  James and the Giant Peach is still a strange and twisted tale that is fun for children of all ages!  We highly recommend it! 
 I have taken this book out time and time again since buying it a few years ago.  I have underlined, highlighted and written notes in the margins according to what peaks my interest at a particular time.  These books never fail to give me a boost of refreshing energy that is well-needed and, according to the author, well-deserved in a time where women find themselves constantly on the go.  I can't say enough how much I enjoy this book 
 This is a great product, easy to program and use.. easy to read digital display and very accurate 
 This is a  slogan they use in N.A. (Narcotics Annonymous) and it holds true in this movie, too.- "One is too many, and a thousand is never enough"  -Drug addiction IS a HUGE social problem, whose ends are ALWAYS the same: Jails, Institutions, and death. This is also a slogan they use.(I am not talking about occasional use here, but full blown addiction)...  I think the message this film is trying to convey, is that drug addiction is a social problem/disease that attacks people from ALL walks of life,and that addiction is progressive, and that is why we see this film in seasonal chapters, because addiction progresses and moves FORWARD.  The characters are Ellen Burnstein (who plays the mom) Her son, her son's best friend, and her son's girlfriend. The son and friend start out selling drugs, and become thier own best customers, and so does the girlfriend, and we see them slowly become addicted through 4 seasons.  It starts out in the summer, and things are going great, and even profitable for the 3 younger ones. The Mother starts taking diet pills, to fit in a red dress she wants to wear to a television show,, but mainly for the goal of something to do with her time. She is old and lives alone.  So we watch them become empty shells of who they used to be throughout a one year time period. By the time Winter hits, they are all living in thier personal hells as full blown addicts.Mom on her "legal" prescription speed, and the other 3 on Herion.  I think it is right on the money the depths to which these four sink. Addiction is not a pretty thing, and you will remember this movie long after you see it 
 After every book ive read by Feist this book was even better.  New charcters, new plots against the kingdom, new creature that walk like men but have the stength of 10.  A new continent.  And the fear of a demon lord arising throught the demon worlds ranks.  Will the prisoner comdemd to death than turn to solider be enough to stop the Sauur before the attck is made on the kingdom.  Will Pug and Thomas have to fight again.  Who mirnda.  This book has adventure that so real and action on every page almost.  A unstopable ride till the end of the book.  
 This is a great video, and has excellent performances all around except for Noel.  Time and time again, Noel just doesn't work.  He isn't involved in the song the same way Jimi or Mitch are.  I mean, that is one ...bass solo during the seemingly 40 minute version of "Sunshine Of Your Love."  While doing his "solo," Noel pauses and SCRATCHES HIS NOSE.  COME ON, WHAT THE HELL?!?!?!  Jimi should have thrown him off the stage, or gotten a bass player that puts his playing before a scratch he had on his nose.  Noel's backing vocals are also whinny and raspy.  Let Mitch take some of the vocals (if he's not scratching his nose).  So in short, Jimi and Mitch are spectacular, but Noel is enough to give this excellent collection four stars 
 Two thumbs way up for Michael Savage's writing, insights, and politics! He tells the facts with a no-nonsense style that I love. I enjoy all his books and his show. He is pure and simply great 
 These CDs are most faithfully reproduced from the original mastertracks. Dr. Rosza's Oscar-winning score fully merited such fidelity in it's digital preservation. Every nuanced note beautifully projects each mood desired by the composer,from the overture's famed tension, the love theme, Bethlehem's Star, the signature 'Parade of the Charioteers',to the final redemption theme. Probably among the five best in Cinema scores.   
 B.B. King is an outstanding performer.  The CD selections are first-rate 
 I bought this book after seeing the newly remade movie.  The characters are essentially the same, with one important difference, but the story and tone are quite different, and the relationships among the characters are different.  Most notably, Raymond's mother's second husband, Senator John Iselin, is a key character in the book but does not exist in the movie; Raymond and Ben are close friends; Eugenie is not an undercover fed.  The differences go on, but this is not a review comparing the movie to the book.  It's interesting that this book is usually characterized as being a thriller.  It is a fascinating story but the first three-quarters of the book strike me more as a wry black comedy rather than a thriller.  It paints some absurdly twisted scenes that are so over the top that it can only be considered comedic.  For example, Iselin in serving in the military in 1944 near an Eskimo village solicited sex from the indigenous tribe and was set up with a woman for sex in an igloo in view of the group.  Suddenly one Eskimo shed his outer clothes, turned out to be a German officer who apparently objected, perhaps this was his woman.  Iselin decided it was a good time to leave but the woman, who by now had taken a liking to him, grabbed him firmly by the privates to retard his retreat.  He finally shook her off by shoving her in the face with his foot but not before she bit him fiercely; he ended up with a purple heart.    Another scene sends the brainwashed Raymond through a series of odd coincidences so that he falls into a state where he becomes receptive to hypnotic suggestion.  He hears someone say to "go jump in the lake," upon which Raymond takes it literally, gets a boat, rows to the middle of a lake, and jumps in.  When Marco first meets Eugenie, she fires off clever repartee right out of a 1940's detective story, to such an extent that it seems intended to be satire.  This reminds me of some of the dark absurdities in Catch-22, or Infinite Jest (wherein a character commits suicide by putting his head in the oven--a microwave oven).  The book is very elegantly written, and sent me to the dictionary a couple of times to look up definitions of words that were perfect fits for their use but that one does not see every day.  The references to Communism are probably best appreciated with a foundation of knowledge about the political issues of the day.    The story is engaging though not utterly unpredictable.  You'll love to hate Raymond's mother and Iselin, develop sympathy for poor Raymond, and admire Ben Marco 
 I LOVED THIS AS A CHILD. IT USED TO BE ON TV A LOT AND I REMEMBER BEGGING MY MOTHER TO TAPE IT ON VHS. WE RECORDED IT ONE DAY AND I WATCHED IT SO MUCH THE VHS BROKE. I AM NOW 20 AND MY BOYFRIEND RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS DVD PLUS THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS FROM SOME IDIOT ON HERE AND HIS COPIES WERE WORSE THAN MINE. HE CLAIMED THEY WERE NEW BUT WE GOT THEM AND THEY WERE OPENED MASS PRODUCED COPIES. WE COULD TELL BECAUSE THE VHS'S WERE BLANK AND THE COVERS WERE NOT ORIGINAL. PLEASE RELEASE THESE MOVIES ON DVD! 
 I didn't create my Fortune 500 company from scratch by mollycoddling my managers, and I sure as rain didn't oversee double-digit revenue growth five years running by catering to weakness. HR always gets complaints that I drive the employees too hard, but I never paid much attention to the whiners and complainers until that horrible day one of my most loyal workers snapped and very nearly blew my head off with a shotgun. That's when I knew I had to make some changes.  I first saw Dr. Hallowell's article when it came out in the Jan. 2005 HBR. That was before the attempt on my life, so I didn't take the article too seriously. Later, after narrowly dodging 000 shot from a twelve gauge, I saw the same article available for download, with "enhanced features" including a key ideas summary and company examples. Well, I remembered the article talking about something called "attention deficit trait" (ADT) as a symptom of and response to the overload of a hectic work environment. Dr. Hallowell, psychiatrist, founder of The Hallowell Center for Cognitive and Emotional Health, and author of several, best-selling books on mental health and ADD, has the credentials to write with authority, or else he's simply trying to expand his ideas to a greater customer base. The latter doesn't discount the former, of course, and it's good business strategy to boot, so I applaud his efforts to get into the workplace psychology game.  We've mandated several of the ideas suggested in the article for combating ADT. We've set up a work-buddy system, removed all the junk food vending machines, given everyone free membership to the company gym, kept the cafeteria open twenty-four hours with healthful foods, mandated short breaks every two hours, and given seminars and training on time and stress management, giving every one of our employees access to whatever time management tool best suits him. Has it helped? No one's tried to kill me yet, and everyone seems less stressed. But just to make sure people don't think I'm getting soft, I fired a long-time employee the other day just to show them who's the boss 
 Describing this book will only make it look less perfect. This is for all you med. students out there:  Excellent Review.   
 I found this book to be highly informative and extreemly helpful in planning my trip. I am so glad that I got it 
 Like many American Christians, I was brought to church most Sundays and endured countless sermons and lessons. Despite this seemingly rich education on Christian principles, I never was exposed to a lesson or class on the existence of God; God's existence was assumed as fact. As I matured into my twenties and went to college, the existance of God was no longer taken for granted. I encountered many agnostics and atheists among my many college professors. The net result of their influence was to question my faith. I never lost my faith, but I found it was a faith that could not withstand scrutiny.   Reading Lee Stobel's "The Case For Faith" continued in me my search for the certainty of my faith. Strobel's book is an excellent place to start investigating the issues that question one's faith. Like in his previous book, "The Case for Christ", Strobel presents interviews with several Christian apologetics that involve issues related to the veracity of the Christian faith.   The issues are as follows:   Can a real living caring God exist in a world filled with evil?  Are the Biblical miracles really true?  Is evolutionary theory enough to explain life on earth?  Is there only one way to GOd - through Jesus?  How can a loving God throw his created people in hell?  Is the church's history, with it's abuses, crusades, and inquistions, a reason not to believe in Christianity?  If I am filled with doubts, can I still be a believer?   Mr. Strobel investigates each issue thoroughly. He approaches the issues as a skeptic who wants to be convinced of the truth. Strobel was once a skeptic himself and his investigative journalism convinced him of the truth of his Christian faith.   If you have questions about your faith, then this is a good starting point for your investigation. There are other books that go into more detail on all the issues raised here, and you may want to purchase these as well for further study. But this is a very good starting point for answering those nagging doubts about your faith in Christianity and one's faith in the person of Jesus.   Most highly recommended.   Jim "Konedog" Koeni 
 I just recieved this blowdryer today. I immediately tried it out and so far so good I am very pleased with this item. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 it's because it's lacking a swirvel cord and I do like to spin around alot just to make sure my hair comes out straight but other then that this product is a keeper 
 Felicity Pride is annoying, smug, and invulnerable, a difficult heroine to empathize with. But this book is so funny, and so on target with its characterization of the cozy mystery genre. She reminded me a little bit of Jo Dereske's librarian heroine, and nothing at all of Holly Winter. I think it will get even better in subsequent entries in the series, when she can develop the characters more 
 I think this book is good for people that want to learn what a Perigrine Falcon can do over an amount of time. I have read all three of the series. It is a great series  and the other books, they are great also 
 Dean is on the right track when he looks for psychological explanations behind the slide to the right, but he stops at the authoritarian personality literature, which is notorious for going half way. Most of these researchers see the tendency as an unchangable and inborn personality trait, chiefly because their chosen method of surveys has no way to quantify childhood treatment in any reliable way. But child development research has offered plenty of evidence that mistreated kids are the ones who exhibit this antisocial behavior into adulthood. Yes, there is a genetic component, but we can do nothing about that. Childhood treatement we CAN do something about.  Dean is at least starting down the road in a high-profile way. We need to go further. 
 A thought provoking book for any woman searching for her own spirituality. The author shares her own doubts and fustrations that are so much like my own that sometimes the book made me a little uneasy. The women described in  this book are wonderful! The author does a great job clarifying her goals  along the way 
 Any student preparing to take the SAT should not go with out this book. The Book provides accurate practice test created by the Test makers (ETS). But don't count on this book to give you excellent review. Review for the SAT is very brief. also this book is no good without the solutions manual which you could buy on amazon. so without the soulutions manual you won't be doing anything but just taking the practice test and not knowing where you went wrong. anyways good luck 
 This product has specific fields for the entry of all essential data about a book but is still flexible enough to allow for the entry of information specific to a personal library. I found  the ability to  put the entire data base in alphabetical order with one click of the mouse a great feature. The instruction manual is also excellent with lots of useful information and helpful hints. If you are looking to organize a personal library its hard to imagine a better system exists anywhere 
 I just don't get tired of any of Cyndi's songs.  I can't believe she won't be coming out with another one, because she is such an honest, truly memorable country singer.  So I'll have to just continue listening to this CD and enjoying the pure, touching lyrics.  Buy this CD and listen to the whole thing twice.  I guarantee you will love it!! 
 Gary Giddins is probably the most articulate and learned jazz critic in the USA. This is an outstanding contribution to jazz scholarship. Its format is deceptively conventional in its linearity: it runs through the century through portraits of the musicians themselves, in chronological/thematic groupings. But it urges the reader forward with an exciting, fully engaged narrative that expertly interweaves the complementary and conflicting elements of the jazz tradition like counterpoint in a fugue. Giddins' infectious enthusiasm and enchanting storytelling skill make this an irresistible read. Unfortunately it falls slightly short of a comprehensive reference work; the index of recordings serves only as a vague guide to the aspiring collector, and the index of names is helpful, but not as powerful as a full index. A full index and coherent discography would have enhanced an already highly recommendable work 
 READ THESE BOOKS!!!!!! I offer you no other option, these are all three simply amazing books, and this one is especially good, mainly because I'm absolutely crazy about Mickle and here she finally comes into herself completely, it's just amazing. I personally find it a travesty that The Kestrel is out of print,it's really the pivotal novel to the series, it's so important. I will never undrstnad how it is that these books never became as popular as Lloyd Alexander's Prydain books which I was never overly fond of. How it is that they are still all in print and the middle of this amazing series, truly Lloyd Alexander's best work (I should know, I've read them all), is absent is just astonishing beyond words. READ THESE BOOKS!!!! Lend them to all your friends,spread the joy!!! 
 Douglas Coupland made his biggest mark on literature with "Generation X," a witty satire on the jaded "Gen-Xers." This time, we have one instead of several, but Coupland's writing might be even tighter because of that. Witty, unpredictable and full of Coupland's little flickers of bitterness and sweetness.  Things start to go awry when ex-hippie Jasmice wakes up with "divorce" written on her forehead. Ambitious twenty-year-old Tyler is a living anti-hippie, devoted to hair-care, sleek technology and big corporations. He considers Jasmine the living figure of sixties idiocy, but he consoles his mother about her rotten husband's departure.   As he comforts Jasmine, he contemplates his own life, his sweet girlfriend Anna Louise, and his oddball family, which was based in a weird hippie commune when he was little. Things in Tyler's life are disrupted when the haughty Stephanie, a summer fling, comes to visit -- and stay. Tyler travels with his fling-turned-new-girlfriend to California, but finds himself more alone than he has ever been before.  In this book, Coupland takes a look at a small group of people -- young, intelligent college graduates who aren't sure whether to follow their dreams, or chain themselves to a big corporation. Don't worry -- it's not half as boring as it sounds. Coupland keeps the book vibrant with snotty Europeans, scraggly ex-hippies and the offspring they drive crazy.  Theme aside, Coupland has a way of tugging at the heartstrings, without becoming really sentimental, and reminds us that "the time you feel lonely is the time you most need to be by yourself." His writing is sharp, solid and strangely evocative of a split world: half sand candles and flowers, half leather furniture and big-screen TVs. And he has a unique sense of humor -- he doesn't make readers really laugh, but just exposes the absurd side of things.  Tyler starts off superficial and rather snotty, and he spends much of the book doing the wrong thing. But Coupland makes him grow up slowly, making him see the worth of people he thought were freakish before. Not to mention his long-suffering girlfriend Anna Louise, who is obviously The Girl for Tyler. Jasmine is a very real portrait of an aging hippie -- full of life and sweetness, yet incredibly naive.   Douglas Coupland's "Shampoo Planet" tackles some of the same turf as "Generation X," yet it gets more intimate and sweet than his first novel did. Remember -- what's on top of your head does not say what's inside your head 
 OK, we've all read at least one of Dick Francis' early novels.  The usual components are there: HORSES, racing, mystery, and often a physical or psychological character defect.  (I write this, having a hearing loss, so I can appreciate the effort!)  The main character, Gene Hawkins, is an intelligence agent who once had his heart ripped out. (I always wanted to write that last phrase) In his agony, he has to escort his boss's nubile 17-year-old daughter to California, to solve a horse kidnapping.  Living in the 21st century, trust me, you will not guess the ending of this novel.  We need a few more authors with this sense of decency 
 I purchased this book, along with "RENT" for my daughter's 8th grade graduation, as we are RENT addicts.  We love it all.  She has now read this book as her requirement for her Summer Reading list for High School - one of which needed to be a biography/autobiography.  We were very taken by the story of Anthony Rapp, about his "coming out" to his beloved Mom, whom he later lost - and all that surrounds this compelling story about Love and Loss.  There are important lessons here for everyone, and I felt my adolescent age daughter could appreciate these lessons and issues we all face at different times in our lives.  I look forward to other works by Anthony Rapp and wish him, as well as other RENT cast members, who have contributed to our love and understanding of an important segment of our current society.  
 One of the best and entertainment history books that I have ever read.  You cannot stop when you start reading this book.  It also have a lot of pictures, so you can visualize what the author is talking about.  We learn how it was difficult for women to travel West, so they can have a better future.  Author did a lot of research to write this book.  Author did a great job.  I recommend you to read it 
 Wendy Froud makes the most beautiful puppets.  Not only are the pictures in this book amazing, but the story is also really great.  Terri Windling is a really good writer, and along with Wendy's images she makes the faery world come to life in this book.  If you love fairies, fairy art, or the Frouds, I definately recommend this book 
 Surprisingly, a book about science that is unbiased, very informative and an easy and enjoyable read!  I would most definitely recommend this book to anybody with an interest in not just science and chemistry but also to those who wonder how modern society got to where it is.  You'll find information about everyday items found around the house and in the workplace that is insightful, interesting and applicable to everybody.  Not to mention the added bonus of being able to surprise your acquaintances with fascinating small talk!  A surefire pleasing read for anyone 
 This CD is classic Lupone and any broadway-lover should know it.  Patti didn't get fired from every job she ever had honey...she's done tons of productions and if you knew how badly Andrew Lloyd Webber screwed her over, you might understand why she made a big deal out of her.  Check your facts.  Anyway, her voice is still strong and pure today, I also recommend her "The Lady with the Torch" album 
 I couldn't agree more with the other reviews.  I wore the grooves out on this album in college.  How nice to see Verve re-release one of the classic live dates from this fabulous trio.  Gomez and Jones have chops running out their ears.  Evans would not recapture this level of integration again until the Marc Johnson/ Joe Labarbera trio of the early '80's.  Start with the seldom heard title track and let it rip 
 The Charlie Bone series is an entertaining one, and all the kids I know who read it want to keep reading more.  That's my goal as a teacher, so I try not to quibble with the gigantic plot holes that exist in the world Nimmo has created.  Nor do I care that the main character seems to have no personality.  He merely serves as a plot anchor.  I confess that I enjoyed this book, and am happy that so many of the 3-5th grade kids I teach and know enjoy it too 
 Just bought this for my Sony HDR-HC1, The battery is big, but it balances the camera better than the standard battery. I think that sony designed the camera a little heavy in the front to make this battery balance the camera so well. The price seems steep but it is less than buying three standard batteries, that it replaces. A great buy in my book! Buy two so you can always have one charged and ready to go. You will run out of tape before ypu run out of battery 
 Although not strictly an existentialist novel, "The Stranger" delves into the philosophies of life and meaning, concluding that there is no rhyme or reason or higher plan for human life.  Indeed, the chilling realization that life serves no higher purpose directly contradicts the most precious of human ideals - that one's life serves a higher purpose.  Camus tells the story of Meursault , a French colonial living in Algeria.  An otherwise unremarkable individual, Meursault  lives life for the moment, and does not dwell on the past for future.  His mother's death is a non-event, as he views it as an irksome distraction.  However, he is not cold-hearted or immoral, but he is merely an indifferent, apathetic man who sees no purpose to life.  Thus, if there is no purpose to life, then his mother's passing has no greater meaning than the daily routine of one's job.  It is just an event to partake of.  Throughout the novel, Meursault  espouses Camus's "absurdist" philosophy.  That is, that human existence is absurd in that there is no higher meaning or moral value to it.  It is this lack of morality and meaning that makes Meursault  alienated from the society he lives in.  Without any moral compass, Meursault  is gloriously indifferent to his fellow beings.  Friendship, marriage, and even murder have no higher meaning for Meursault .    Although his murder of an Arab has no meaning for himself, his adversaries and friends attempt to assign meaning to his actions at his trial.  Meursault  loses when the Prosecutor attempts to assign a rational meaning to his actions, subject to the accepted rules of society.  Indeed, it would appear that Meursault  is a cold-blooded criminal, one who didn't even shed a tear for his departed mother.  Yet, if one were to understand Meursault , he is no cold-blooded killer, although that certainly doesn't justify his actions.  His final self-realization is that society loathes him and his actions.  Although he cannot change society's views, he becomes comfortable in his own views and looks forward to the day that onlookers will applaud his execution 
 Augusten Burroughs is hilarious. He says the things I am thinking and have thought about in the past. His pop culture references are dead-on. I would recommend this book to most 30-somethings and up who will really relate to his comments about Donny and Marie, Tony Olando, and Flair pens. His writing is not for the faint of heart, however, and I wouldn't suggest this book to my parents, or any of their friends for that matter. But for open-minded, not easily offended adults there is no one today who can beat Burroughs at his genre. Check this book out, you'll be hooked! 
 The R818 camera will not fit the port on the R-series dock.  Just call HP and request the adapter, they will send it to you for free. Part # C8887-40003  Nice camera, and HP service was excellent 
 Speaking not as a math specialist but one disposed to read a number of the popular explications of Godel's famous proof I can say that it was Godel's original text that did it for me. The reason is that it is the proof and not a lot of verbiage about the proof. And it is short and sweet. One problem is that the more common Turing Machine approach is actually 'easier', where Godel's approach is that of recursive functions which are more obscure, or at least less often discussed. If you can sort of glare at the recursive function issue and proceed with the basics of the proof it will stand out suddenly better than many of the popularizations. At least give it a try 
 This book has all the basic information one requires to understand the role of proper dieting and exercise for healthy living, and how our lifestyle impacts various health risks.  It is superbly written, easy to understand and follow.  It lacks glamour and fanciness, does not promise miracles, and maybe it is for that reason the book is not well known to the masses.  It only speaks the scientific reality, which is the only one.   For two years, I applied Dr.Elliott's simple scientific formula, which accounts for one's built, calories consumed, and impact of  exercise on metabolism, and monitored my weight and shape.  Theory matches with the outcome with reasonable accuracy, both in periods of dieting/exercise and sedentary lifestyle.  I wish Dr.Elliott publishes new edition.  One problem with this book is that it is pretty old.  People like me would like to hear from him,on what had changed in the past 15 years.  Nonetheless, great work, great book, buy it.. 
 If you care at all about the future of the United States, and if you're intelligent enough to ask "WHY?" (why do people turn to terrorism to get their point across?!), read this book.  Ms. Stern doesn't just cover Al Queda -- she covers terrorist groups all over the planet, including some in the United States that you might not have previously thought of as being "terrorists" .... although they clearly are just that.  This book is fascinating and an easy read, and I absolutely recommend it.  I also applaud Ms. Stern's willingness to take on this dangerous mission and compile this information for the rest of us -- she's done an awesome job 
 In a movie jam-packed full of actors who have gone on to acclaim, director Ang Lee presents a dark winter in the suburbs during an ice storm.  The movie perfectly captures the look and feel of the 1970s-even the pacing seems completely appropriate.  The characters are in the middle of a sexual revolution-married men and women are having clandestine and unfulfilling liaisons, teenagers are experimenting, and the hipsters in the neighborhood are holding a wife-swapping "key party."  All the action comes to a head during a tragic and dangerous ice storm.  This is a dark drama and a brilliant commentary on the human condition 
 The Master Puppeteer is a mysterious thrilling book about a bandit named Saburo who robs the rich and helps the poor! There also is a boy in the story named Jiro who devotes his life to learning puppetry.Meanwhile the puppet theater crashes by a mob of rioting peasents.Jiro becomes aware of his responsibilities greater than his craft.He schemes to safe his friend Kinishi and his parents.While he does this he stumbles upon a great and powerful secret 
      While living in the Haifa University dorms I developed the habit of checking a dozen books out of the library at a time and one of them was "Slaughterhouse five."  Before reading "slaughterhouse five" I'd have laughed myself stupid if someone suggested I read ANY book cover to cover in one day but, yes...Vonnegut is that good.        I always read the blurbs before reading the introduction.  The blurbs for "Slughterhouse five" were so well executed that I figured the book must be "that good."        Vonnegut starts with an introduction that reads like a post card to a friend and before you know it, the narrative kicks in and Vonnegut introduces timeless and structureless events that make sense in their timeless and structureless state but, when juxtaposed, give the story its substance, its kick, its juice.  There are no loose ends and no soggy and simple-minded moral to the story other than the one you manage to extrapolate. no unnecessary passages, characters, dialogue or even unnecesary words.  An airtight novel if there ever was one.               A treat for anyone with a penchant for the more twisted traits exclusive to the human species. The images of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that most people are familiar with can't even compare to the images of the fire bombed Dresden Vonnegut conjures up in my mind.  Raw and dead serious matter treated with a levity that draws chuckles in situations that would otherwise draw tears of blood.  For all who had their praise for Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. immortalized in blurb form we salute you.          
 Longtime fans of Harvey Pekar (I was turned on to the American Splendor books as a college student in 1987) will absolutely love this! Very faithful to the original and to Harvey Pekar and what he stands for.  The switching back and forth between the real Harvey and the actor who portrays him gets a bit confusing and jarring at times, and it will require multiple viewings for those not familiar with the adventures of our man Mr. Pekar and Joyce, Mr. Boats, Toby, etc. (Freddie the Moocher or Emil the hermit aren't in the film, but that's a minor complaint). The actor playing Mr. Boats, the elderly black crumudgeon, is a tad stiff. I've always visualized James Earl Jones or Louis Gossett Jr. in that role.  But the film as a whole works as the story of the triumph of the common everyday working man in spite of himself. You'll recoil at the exploitation of Toby the nerd (his identifying with the comedy "Revenge of the Nerds", a scene straight from the AS books, is funny, sad, and touching at the same time), and you'll cheer as Harvey "socks it" to David Letterman and his audience.  Read the American Splendor Anthology, see the movie (more than once), laugh, think, and enjoy 
 If you are making your first purchase of a Lester Young CD you really can't go past this one, especially if you want an overview of his playing in his prime years. This probably has his best recordings from the beginning in '36 to '49 with maybe a few ommissions here and there, but I'd be surprised if there is a better 'Prez' compilation out there for the first time listener. Good value for money too with 4 CD's 
 The thing I like about this book is the condensation of a lot of wisdom into a small space. Stressed out at the office  or school or just plain stressed out. This book is small enough to keep with you at all times. What a lifesaver 
 I have read this at least a dozen times. I still don't claim to understand it all, but I firmly believe something very deep and meaningful is being discussed. I will continue to read it until I think I truly understand it. It is quite a mental exercise. I find myself thinking so intently that I often can not finish a chapter without falling asleep. It is not boring, just deep 
 The absolute fore runner to the musical/movie Chicago!  If you love music, dancing and a poinant story with great acting...this is it 
 Larry Elder's book, Showdown, is an excellent look at the shortcomings of many policymakers, educators and journalists in America.  One particular chapter of Showdown that I enjoyed discusses the importance of having a father present in a son's life.  He provides some great statistical data to back up his claims, but also points out that it's common sense: A boy's chances of succeeding in life are much higher when they have a father present in their life.  So often, we hear about how racism or poverty cause young, inner-city black men to commit crimes.  However, Larry Elder points out the obvious and tells the truth 
 This is a very good introduction to Combinatorics.  It is filled with many examples and has problems that really reinforce the examples.  Because it is well organized, it is very easy to use as a reference.  I highly recommed it for anyone who is serious about studying Combinatorics 
     Call it a statement. An analysis. Fine Art. A masterful fusion of visual and auditory art, i.e. Philip Glass at his best.  Koyaanisqatsi shows us the ills of our modern world in a new light. It contrasts the beauty and grandeur of our natural world with its destruction.  Despite the date of production, the film is applicable to the state of humanity today.     It is an artist's, a monk's view of our hustling-bustling lives. A fresh world view is presented as if seen through the eyes of first century monk transported in time to the current era. It speaks to you at a deep subconscious level. This film leaves you with new desires, a reason to help make changes, and an urge for a more peaceful life. Koyaanisqatsi is unforgettable. 
 I have all 9 books of the series and they are thought provoking and very well but easy readin 
 Great book!  I found a lot of interesting concepts in here including the concept of homeostasis (forgot about that one from Biology!), how the body eventually will automatically always return to its original state as a way of protecting itself and how that also applies to the mind.  The topic of practice and muscle memory and why you need to practice over and over before your muscle memory kicks in to do a particular task before it becomes second nature.  And the discussion on how America has become a society of immediate gratification, without the benefit of practice, commitment and mastery, the values that are lost in this lifestyle.  The author discusses learning to love the practice and finding peace and satisfaction in your daily life.    
 This was an excellent novel! Very unique writing style and point of view 
 This documentary was very good. It was also very informative. It shows you the "real" side of basketball stars. I felt that this film should open some eyes to the situations that our young black athletes face on a  daily basis.  In a nutshell, this film is very good. Thats it 
 e-Learning and the Science of Instruction is a must have for anybody that is already a pro, or just starting out at designing web-based instruction.  The authors give outstanding guidance for every step of the way, from explaining theories to the best way to set up your web site.  It shows excellent illustrations of what to do, as well as what NOT to do.  This book is a tool that every one in the business shouldn't be without.  
 This is a classic!  It should be in every children's library.  Children will laugh at the monkeys and wonder about the peddler.  If parents act out this story your children will always remember this one.  It is an excellent story 
 I don't know why, but this book was released in the UK back in September so I read it over a month ago.  This is the Alex Cross book to end all Cross books. Don't want to ruin the surprises but this time he is after the killer of his wife Maria. Patterson pulls out all the stops! It was great to have questions answered about my favorite Yank detective that have been lingering since the early novels. best thriller I have read since "Tourist in the Yucatan! 
 I enjoyed it for the most part.  I think the romance was a little rushed.  I look forward to Ethan Brooker's story!!!!  I hope it's next!!! 
 This is one of the single best books I've seen for mind, body and spirit.  Clear and concise, it exudes kindness, gentleness, and love. And it has  greatly helped me and many people I know in dealing with every aspect of  life 
 In a dying world, there are some that know of a place to escape to known as "Paradise" where life can be restarted. But it's not the humans that know of this place. The wolves, once thought to have been extinct for 200 years, are the only ones that know how to get to it. But they need a guide. The "Flower Maiden", Cheza, whose is said to have been born of a Lunar Flower, is that guide. But she is being held by human scientists in a lab in a coma-like state. Meanwhile, wolves, attracted by her scent have begun to gather in the city. They can move among the population because they have an unexplained ability to appear as humans. Kiba has come looking for Paradise. Tsume roams with human gangs, robbing the Nobles. Toboe is wandering aimlessly, looking for companionship after being raised as a dog and having his owner die. Hige too has been drawn by the Lunar Flower scent. But the wolves have been followed as well by a ruthless hunter known as Quent who has vowed to kill every wolf he finds. When Cheza awakens, the long and tragic quest for Paradise begins.   This manga is based on the 30 episode anime of the same name and being a 2 volume manga, you know that most of the story is going to be left out of the book. I didn't really find any complaints about the manga though I would suggest watching the anime before reading this so you won't be left with any holes in the plot. The art was great, maybe a little TOO well done, so that there isn't a lot of pacing in the rigid drawings, but the layout makes up for this some. It's been so long since I watched the series that I found this volume a welcome reminescence of a show that was ultimately kept from greatness by its flawed ending. 
 This is almost the best book that I ever read!! If you have a lot of brothers or sister or you like kids,than this book is for you! This book is about the Rosso's moving from a New York apartment to a country farm house! They keep you up to date on whats happening on their house! At the end Mrs.Rosso annouces at a picnic, that they will have another baby! To find out what happens, read you will have to read the book 
 Pretty tight collection from the Cash Money fellas.  has many of Cm's best cuts to date....if you're a fan, pick this sh** up!!!  you won't be dissapointed.  Peac 
 I ORDERED THIS FIGURE THINKING HE WOULD BE ABOUT AS TALL AS A BARBIE DOLL. WRONG!!!! HE IS MUCH LARGER!!!!! HE IS ALMOST HUGE! MUCH BIGGER THAN I WOULD EXPECT FOR A TEN DOLLAR TOY! THIS PRICE RIGHT HERE (OF ONLY TEN DOLLARS) REALLY IS A BARGAIN! WHAT'S MORE THIS DOLL LOOKS VERY NICELY MADE. HE LOOKS BOTH DURABLE AND ATTRACTIVE. I BOUGHT THIS FIRST ONE FOR SOMEONE ELSE SO I HAVEN'T OPENED THE PACKAGE. BUT I AM SO IMPRESSED WITH THE TOY'S APPEARANCE THAT I AM ORDERING ANOTHER ONE FOR MYSELF! IF HE PERFORMS HALF AS WELL AS HE LOOKS HE WILL HE WILL BE WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY. AND I USUALLY DON'T BUY "BOY" TOYS. BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS BATMAN ROCKS! 5 VERY, VERY BIG STARS! AND A NEW BATMAN FAN HERE 
 Genet's "the Thief's Journal" is to me his greatest novel-if that's whatyou want to categorize it as. The only reason I don't say its his greatest book is because of a  wonderful book called "Prisoner of Love", and who knows what may turn up altho I doubt much of anything as he was so private and transient.  Anyway, it clearly maps out the genesis of his artistic, sexual, and criminal life.  For any gay male reader, it is essential, higher in priority than almost any other gay fiction. Of course, it is essential not just to gays but any serious reader.  On a final note it is also quite accessible. so if you tried reading "Our Lady..." or others I think you will be pleasantly surprised and absorbed. If you like French novels of the forties you might also check out the writer Celine. He is quite caustic and brilliant and many of his novels are in English. For cultural referents, Todd Haynes film "Poison" wa in part inspired by Genet and   John Waters named Glenn Milstead "DIVINE" from one of Genet's novels. So there you ar 
 I read this book in 1995 and I have never found a better one in analyzing democratization since then. His idea on democracy as a result of "spontaneous compliance" is so powerful that nothing else can actually stimulate more on a research direction for the preconditions of democratization process in countries like China.  It can be read together with his "Democracy and the Rule of Law", which addresses the question of why governments act or do not act according to laws, and interprets the rule of law as a strategic choice of actors with powerful interests (rather than as an exogenous constraint on politicians), and concludes that the rule of law emerges when no group is strong enough to dominate the others and political actors seek to resolve their conflicts by recourse to law.   Unfortunately, Adam Przeworski is later on obsessed with math, statistics, graphs, and aggregate analysis instead going deeper into specific political culture, which is yet another sad example of how mathematical academics continues to ruin more economists and political scientists (States and Markets: A Primer in Political Economy, 2003). The point is, applied mathematics and statistics concern with correlation, social scientists concern with causation. Mathematics and statistics are good tools, but social scientists are not technicians. If all they can do is applying mathematics and statistics without institutional analysis or policy analysis, they are in a wrong career 
 I'm an old fuddy-duddy!  I don't want my kids (ages 8 and almost 6) watching 99% of the garbage that is on TV outside of PBS.  But they are getting too old for Sesame Street.  So where to turn?  I've found help in my old friend Lucy.  We have bought Season One of I Love Lucy on DVD, and the kids think it is the funniest thing ever.  I enjoy watching it with them, and I laugh all over again.  Season one has Vitmeatavegemin, and the kids laugh hysterically on the ground everytime they watch it.  I can't wait to show them the Chocolate factory.  The only caveat we need to do is explain about the cigarette smoking that goes on on the show.  We just explain that "back then" no one knew how bad smoking was for your health, and they are fine with that.  It's a great alternative to SpongeBob, I can tell you that 
 i disagree with all the negagtive comments twords the lexar's line of lightning flash drives.  i keep mine attached to a messanger bag at all times, i toss it around all the time and never have i had mine get distroyed. if you treat your electronics with alittle bit of care (when pluging into the computer and taking out), keeping this flash drive in one piece should be fine.   its extremely fast to put  music on, almost as soon as you drag a single file will it be on the flash drive. Its also alot nicer looking than most flash drives that are out right now for the price. and all the applications they make for usb drives work amazing on it.  
 My husband bought this book for me and I have to say it is not a book I would normally pick up. I also have to say...I loved it! It was a very entertaining story with several plot twists along the way. I enjoyed the writing style and would highly recommend this book for taking on a relaxing trip this summer 
 Really this book was a fun read. I laughed out loud a couple of times and that is a good sign, in any book. In her first book Helen Fielding left me with this conviction that, "Oh My God! I'm Bridget Jones". She was righting about me, and I am a single woman, living a world away from London.Really it was(is) a phenomena that had instant success, even before the release of the movies. The Edge of Reason does not dissapoint, its the very same Bridget. And as a self professed Austen fan I enjoyed the tongue -in- cheek allussions to Persuasion. So Miss Fielding, could we persuade you to right another sequal, with wedding bells perhaps 
 I picked up this book as I was beginning my study of Catholicism.  Coming from an anti-Catholic background, I appreciated reading the response to most of the things I had been taught.  This led me to further study, in which I later found most of the concepts I had been taught regarding Catholicism, were wrong.  It is a quick read and a basic overview of the beliefs.  I recommend it as a starting place to begin your study between the two doctrines. 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book and believe it provides a rare and intimate look into the heart of a male adoptee. Not much is written for male adoptees, or those who love them. Therefore, I applaud Tim's courage and admire his journey. It would be a great resource for an all-adoptee male support group 
 I learned fluid mechanics from this book in college, tutored undergraduates with the help of this book in grad school, and used it as a reference for my advanced fluids class. In all cases, it was clearer and more understandable than other references I was recommended. I'm not saying this book is perfect - the description of the Navier Stokes equations, a fundamental concept in fluid mechanics, skips too many mathematical steps, as White is prone to do - but overall, if you are strong enough in math, this is a very good reference/first time book for fluid mehanics. White also has a good more advanced text on viscous fluid flow. If you are learning fluid mechanics for the first time, I would also recommend a Schaum's outline to supplement your textbook 
 Ordering this book to use as a resource for an in-depth Bible Study for adults, I was pleased to find some great applications.  However, the strength of this book really lies more in the realm of beginning Bible students.  I think it is a great way to introduce the wisdom of the OT while still maintaining the vital truths of the NT.  I've since used the book as a resource to teach Teens from church as we looked at topics in Proverbs, and it was perfect for them.  It is best adapted for small group use, and its topical nature lends itself to some great dynamics in discussion.  Dee Brestin is always a safe bet 
 Nicole Kidman has had a handful of great films, MY LIFE being one of them.  Nicole plays the wife of Michael Keaton, a busy executive who learns that he has cancer.  He is given only months to live and decides to video tape "advice" to his yet unborn child. Both Keaton and Kidman convincingly portray a couple dealing with the situation, and it is one of those films that will bring tears to your eye.  I first saw it in 1993 and didn't think that much of it then (I can't remember why).  Watching it 10 years later made me appreciate it more and notice the fine performances.  This is a movie worth buying.  However, the DVD is disappointingly presented in pan/scan.  Why the distributor did not take advantage of the original widescreen aspect ratio that the film is available in, is beyond me.  I dislike pan/scan because much image is lost 
 If you like fact reading, you'll like this.  I thought he was to discriptive and went on and on and on about nonsense. Some of the info was really good, but it was hard to stay focused and really take it all in.  I found my mind wondering and thinking about other things. 
 to be truthful Dylan hadn't released anythingh amazing since "Blonde on Blonde", ans that was almost a decade ago when he released "Blood On The Tracks". This is a seminal work of subtle beauty and brillient story telling. Each track tells a tale of deep characters being created from the conscience of a depressed and destrought man (Dylan's marriage had collapsed) and this leads to a wondeful album, both depressing and uplifting in equal measure. This is a must buy.   
 I received this magnificent disc today and gave it a listen. Having previously read the novel and comic of the same name, not to mention played the video game, I found this soundtrack to be an excellent companion the Shadows of the Empire storyline. Not only does it stand on its own as an inspiring piece, but it adds greater depth to the story by tugging at the emotions as all great Star Wars music does. This soundtrack helps the reader imagine all of the story's scenes in their mind, almost allowing the reader to create their own movie in their head.  The concept of this soundtrack, which is to be the film score to a film that only exists in the form of a book, was a risky undertaking on the part of the composer, Joel McNeeley, yet he accomplished this task very well. I highly recommend adding this disc to your music library. 
 Time-Life managed to pull off a great feat by putting together a set that will not only be pleasing to the casual fan, but will also appeal to the die-hard JLL collectors.  It consists of three disks, each focusing on a particular phase in his career.   The first disk consists of recordings from his 1956-1963 stint at Sun studios, where he became the biggest rock star this side of Elvis.  The inclusion of the religious discussion is a nice touch. But the ommission of his first single, "Crazy Arms" and the instumental of "in The Mood" in favor of the so-so cuts  "Night Train to memphis" and "I'm Feeling Sorry" is a bit puzzling. The last three, more country-oriented singles at the end of this disk make for a nice lead in to the second disk and phase of his career, the Smash/Mercury years. Disk two contains what is probably the best single-disk collection of his smash/mercury era recordings I've ever heard.  Its a great mix of his rockers and hard-lived country recordings, and doesn't skip over any of the hits.  Its clear why the original vocals he recorded for "A Damn Good country Song" weren't used; his voice was in horrible shape.  But in some strange way, they fit the song very well and it was a treat for time-life to include this version in the set.      The third disk is the true jem of this set- The Electra recordings!  Just about every cut on this disk has been out of print for a while.  It covers his stint at Electra and Sire records (and gracefully skips over the mediocre MCA sessions).  I believe some of the Killers best work was from the three electra albums, and this disk has all the best cuts from them.  While the killer had more or less passed his prime by the time he made the sire records, they prove he still has a ton of talent to share with the world.  The final two tracks are the much-hyped New Orleans acetate sides he made for himself as a teenager.  "Don't Stay Away" shows that Jerry was ready to shake up the world long before he made the trip to Memphis.  What I found most interesting was the flip side- his "New Orleans Boogie".  He became completely engrossed in the energy generated by the music and let the beat slip away from him several times.  It painted a vivid picture of a young rebel who refused to be tamed by society's rules- the world's original punk rocker!  
 David Roberts, in the re-released Great Exploration Hoaxes by Modern Library Exploration, looks at nine exploration hoaxes and one poor fellow (Abyssinian James Bruce) whose adventures turned out to be true while being believed as a hoax in his own lifetime.  The short chapters detailing each hoax are fascinating and the book is a wonderfully entertaining little read.  Once one reads the first hoax one will be hooked and the rest of the book will quickly cascade from one folly to another.  The author presents each case quite clearly and, though, supporters of various of these explorers, such as Peary and the North Pole, will balk, the average reader will come away with a little wisdom and a touch of cynicism about the great adventure yarns we all grew up learning.  And that can be a good thing.  A delighful little collection of adventures that should lead the reader to other true adventure stories with a greater understanding and appreciation 
 How to decribe this gem of a CD. There is such a gentle warm feeling to the songs. It appears that Steve Kilbey's voice is aging like a fine wine.  Great selection of songs with a sprinkling of five new ones.  I have always tried to get friends and coworkers to like the Church and this one is getting the warmest response. Any fan of the Church will enjoy and it is a great place to start for the curious 
 The Wizard of Oz--Still a classic, though some of us may have escaped our youth without actually reading the book. The play "Wicked" whets one's appetite for the original story, and this little classic is well done...Quick and easy to read, good type face and good leading between the lines (something we didn't worry about in our youth).  There may be other, better illustrated editions, but this one gets the job done and gets it done very nicely if you want to re-read or remember something we should remember from our youth--the book, not the movie!!  Suggest reading it after seeing "Wicked"...That allows more creative license in the play, thus more enjoyment and capitivation with that story rather than continually comparing it to the original Oz.  "I'm a good man, just a bad wizard..."  What a line!!! Even now, after all these years. (And don't you wish there really were Yellow Brick Roads!!  Life would be as easy now as we perceive it was then... 
    Let me start by saying this is my first Greg Iles book and I'll be back for more!     Joe Hickey has pulled off five kidnappings for ransom, each a year apart.  Not only has he not been caught, but none of the parents of the victims ever reported the crime.  Now it's kidnapping time again and Joe sets his sights on Abby Jennings, the five year old daughter of an anesthesiologist and his Junior League wife, who resents her husband's success and social status.     Joe's retarded but lovable cousin, Huey, will take charge of Abby.  Joe's wife Cheryl (a former prostitute) will monitor Abby's dad Will and Hickey himself takes charge of mother Karen who turns out to be a lot tougher than he anticipated. The fact that Abby has juvenile diabetes increases the chance that Will and Karen will never get their daughter back alive.    The action shifts between the Jennings' Mississippi estate where Hickey holds Karen prisoner, to a cabin in the woods where Huey hides Abby to a medical doctor's convention on the Gulf Shore, where Cheryl keeps Will from calling the FBI or police.     As the Jennings parents engage in a battle of wits with Joe and Cheryl Hickey, Abby and the childlike Huey entertain themselves in their secret location.     24 Hours has one of the cleverest criminals and best thought- out plots I've encountered and you really come to care about the Jennings family and their individual fates.  Strongly recommended for page turning reading! 
 Love it, love it, love it!!!  Takes me back to the time I was stationed in Germany when I was in the Army.  All his greatest songs are on the CD.  I was hoping they would have pics of KC and his band back in the 70s.  Sure enough, they do.  It's a lot of fun listening to this CD.  I am so happy I bought it from Amazon and so thrilled to own it so I can listen to it over and over again!!!  Thanks, Amazon, for carrying such wonderful music that I can purchase.  Trust me, this won't be the last!!!  Jocelyn Har 
 The Nag Hammadi Library is a collection of some of the books not included in the bible.   Most of these books were omitted due to the heritics of the day beleiving that Jesus was not a man but a God.     Since this was never my beleif, in spite of most churches considering me to be a heritic, I'm delighted that the true is finally coming forth.     It is my personal belief that the collection of greatest heritic's of our age is the Catholic Church
